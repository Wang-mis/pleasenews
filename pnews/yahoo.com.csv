82LU7B0N5A-0,US Overtakes China as South Korea’s Top Export Market,Sam Kim and Hooyeon Kim,"January 1, 2024 at 10:19 AM·2 min read",20231202,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-overtakes-china-south-korea-021922764.html,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korean exports to the US exceeded shipments to China for the first time in two decades last month, in a sign of shifting ties amid global tensions over economic security and tech supply chains.

South Korea sold $11.3 billion in goods to the US in December compared with $10.9 billion to China, the trade ministry said Monday. The switch in positions came as South Korea’s overall exports rose 5.1% from a year earlier — a third monthly increase after a yearlong slump.
The change in positions partly reflects China’s economic challenges, which led policymakers to come up with a series of stimulus measures last year. Still, one month’s data doesn’t offer conclusive proof of a conscious or enduring shift in trading patterns.
China remains South Korea’s biggest trading partner by a large margin given the scale of Seoul’s imports from the world’s second-largest economy.
While exports to the US have increased from a year earlier for a fifth month, South Korea said shipments to China also continued to improve. Meanwhile, South Korea’s overall imports declined 10.8% from a year earlier, with a trade surplus widening to $4.5 billion.
The data come as the US looks to generate support for its agenda to reduce dependence on China in global supply chains and limit the country’s access to advanced semiconductor technology.
That has placed countries like South Korea and Japan in an awkward spot between their two biggest trading partners. Both Seoul and Tokyo are key military allies of Washington, another important dimension given Beijing’s increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific and rising tensions in the region.
Under President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has been forging stronger ties to the US. Yoon traveled to Washington last year with a plethora of Korean executives, where he pitched deeper ties with America in meetings with President Joe Biden and Congress.
South Korea and the US have a free-trade agreement which began in 2012, so Seoul benefits from US laws that increasingly restrict the use of batteries and other products made in countries including China.
China is also ramping up domestic production of goods as it moves up the value chain. One key area that China is focusing on is semiconductor and smartphone manufacturing, a development that has contributed to a slump in sales of goods made by Samsung Electronics Co. and other businesses.

3518ZZYWDF-1,Alex Batty ‘unlikely to see mother or grandfather again’,Henry Bodkin,"January 3, 2024 at 9:53 PM·3 min read",20231204,https://news.yahoo.com/alex-batty-unlikely-see-mother-135323776.html,"Alex Batty said he is unlikely ever to see his mother or grandfather again as he revealed the final moments before he fled the Pyrenees in search of a “normal life”.
The 17-year-old said he had prepared a final meal for his mother Melanie Batty and grandfather David, before striking out on foot to return to the UK
They had spent six years living in communes across Morocco, Spain and France. Greater Manchester Police has launched a criminal investigation into the alleged abduction of the teenager.
Alex’s mother and grandfather have not been since his escape and are believed still to be in France or to have crossed the border. Last week, it was reported that Ms Batty had sent an email to her former landlord in Villefort, a hamlet in the French Pyrenees, saying: “I’ve got to keep running.”
Asked in an interview with Good Morning Britain on Wednesday whether he would ever see his mother, 43, or grandfather, 64 again, Alex replied: “Probably not. I don’t mind.”
Describing the day he decided to leave, Alex said: “It was a normal day. It was a very, very quick decision for it to be that day. I realised it was time, just like that. So I made food for everyone, played it chilled of course, and around half 10 I wrote the note, and by 12 o’clock I was gone.”
Last week, The Telegraph revealed that Alex and his grandfather had been living apart from Ms Batty and her new boyfriend for at least several weeks before he decided to leave.
She had apparently adopted a more comfortable life with an Italian man called Fabrizio, moving into a newly converted stone cowshed,and spending much of her time socialising in cafes and bars in nearby Chalabre.
Local acquaintances of the couple have said she could be being sheltered nearby by one of many “cults” or have fled ao Spain or Andorra.
Last month, Alex told The Sun that a final row with his mother, who he described as very “spiritual” and stridently anti-government, had prompted him to escape.
For years, he had worked on construction projects and on the land, receiving no education and only making “one” friend his own age in six years.
He told Good Morning Britain: “Everyone else I’ve known has been a lot older than me. So I’m very comfortable talking to adults, but with children my age I’m completely different.”
Alex, who wants to study computer engineering, said he had previously asked his mother whether he could go home but she had ruled it out. His grandfather, however, had been more sympathetic.
“We stayed in a lot of caravans and we stayed in a lot of houses, always up mountains hours away from any kind of village or anything,” he told GMB. “One day I thought: ‘OK, I can’t take this any more’.”
Alex is now back in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with Susan Cuarana, his grandmother and legal guardian. He told GMB his birthday is coming up on Feb 13, and asked about his plans, he said: “[Getting] absolutely hammered with my friends.”

M3T263SNWK-2,"JetBlue's CEO is stepping down, and he'll be replaced by the first woman to lead a big US airline",Associated Press Finance,"January 8, 2024 at 5:27 PM·2 min read",20231210,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblues-ceo-stepping-down-hell-232715076.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — JetBlue said Monday that CEO Robin Hayes will step down next month and be replaced by the airline’s president, Joanna Geraghty, who will be the first woman to lead a major U.S. carrier.
Geraghty, 51, joined JetBlue in 2005 and has taken on an increasingly prominent role at the New York-based airline in recent years, including becoming president and chief operating officer in 2018.
Geraghty said she was honored to get the new job, and said she was looking forward “as we execute on our strategic initiatives, return to profitable growth, and generate sustainable value” for shareholders.
Hayes, 57, said he will retire for health reasons.
“The extraordinary challenges and pressure of this job have taken their toll, and on the advice of my doctor and after talking to my wife, it’s time I put more focus on my health and well-being,” Hayes said in a statement.
The change at the top will occur on Feb. 12. It comes as JetBlue waits for a federal judge in Boston to decide whether it can purchase Spirit Airlines for $3.8 billion in a bid to grow quickly into a challenger to the biggest U.S. airlines. The Justice Department sued to block the deal, and a trial was held last fall.
Hayes, 57, is a former British Airways executive who joined JetBlue in 2008 and became CEO in 2015. He pushed the airline to start transatlantic flights and create a partnership in the Northeast with American Airlines. The deal with American was disbanded, however, after the Justice Department successfully sued to kill it.
JetBlue is the nation’s sixth-biggest airline by revenue, slightly behind No. 5 Alaska Airlines. Hayes has pursued mergers for several years to draw closer in size to American, Delta, United and Southwest.
JetBlue tried to buy Virgin America in 2016, but it was outbid by Alaska Airlines. In 2022, Hayes prevailed as JetBlue beat out Frontier to strike a deal with Spirit, the nation's biggest low-fare airline.

JWP3QFXXN5-3,A war travelogue: Two Florida photographers recount harrowing trip to document the Ukraine war,"Earle Kimel, USA TODAY NETWORK","January 1, 2024 at 7:02 PM·9 min read",20240101,https://news.yahoo.com/war-travelogue-two-florida-photographers-110204783.html,"David Graham and Allan Mestel stopped for a break on the side of the road near Donetsk, Ukraine, last summer when Graham pointed out a faded green piece of plastic – remnants of an exploded land mine.
“It looks like a toy,” Graham told Mestel, his colleague in the journalistic endeavor Portrait Ukraine 2023, which can be seen on the Spotlight Ukraine website.
“It looks like a toy; I was like 'Allan that’s one, right here,’” Graham recalled. “It was safe, it had already exploded but just this little piece of green plastic would take your foot off.”
Mestel added, “I think that was one of the most dangerous aspects of what we were doing the whole time we were in Donetsk: there were signs up, ‘Watch out for mines.’”
Graham, 56, and Mestel, 61, both photographers from Sarasota, Florida, were in the midst of a three-week journey through Ukraine, as freelance journalists and documenting the war's impact.
They also sent regular dispatches to Spotlight Ukraine, a passion project website operated by Christine Mariconda, a marketing professional now based in Sarasota.
At least 17 journalists have been killed in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Mestel and Graham have taken on the risk more than once. Their trip in late August and early September was Mestel’s third and Graham’s second.
Along the way, soldiers they traveled with were constantly urging the two men to stay on the paved areas.
“There were unexploded mines all over the place,” Graham told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network, adding, “Somebody lobs a shell and all of a sudden, there's 200 more unexploded mines around.”
One of the more sobering instructions the two men received from their military escort was on the importance of having a tourniquet kit attached to their clothing. “'Make sure they’re somewhere you can reach them one-handed, with either hand,'” they were told.
Mestel and Graham met through the Sarasota photographic community.
Originally from Canada, Mestel started in advertising as a director and editor of TV commercials in Toronto. He frequently pursues documentary projects about the plight of refugees and immigration and co-founded the Sarasota-based nonprofit Streets of Paradise in 2018 along with his wife Robyn Richardson and community activist Greg Cruz.
Graham, a computer specialist with the Sarasota County School District, is a popular wedding photographer and photography instructor
Prior to their late summer trip, the two were talking and Mestel expressed an interest in getting closer to the conflict.
“He had this passion to go back, I was looking for a contract or something to go back or an excuse to go back,” Graham said.
In turn, Mestel said Graham’s experience gave his wife Robyn a little more comfort that they would return home unharmed. While the trip was Mestel’s third to Ukraine after Russian troops invaded the country in February 2022, it was Mestel’s first time venturing close to the front lines of a conflict.
Graham, who worked as a contractor for a number of federal agencies and commercial businesses, had previous exposure to a wartime environment in the Middle East. He also went to Ukraine in March 2023 to help the Ukrainian military with training.
“The concept was to go there and capture portrait-style images of people that were representative of the war in multiple situations – civilians, military,  first-responders,” Mestel said. “Anyone we ran into who was impacted significantly by the war I wanted to shoot portraits.”
Graham recorded the trip through roughly 100 hours of video and interviews that he plans to turn into a 60-minute documentary.
Between Aug. 28 and Sept. 9, 2023, the two traveled  2,287 miles – from Warsaw Poland, as far east as Kramatorsk, near the combat zone, and back to Warsaw.
Mestel’s first trip to Ukraine in March 2022 and second trip that summer were both spent documenting the humanitarian efforts, mostly in western Ukraine.
Mariconda saw photos from Mestel’s July 2022 trip in a local magazine and reached out to him about working together. Mariconda wanted to do something for Ukraine, to keep the story in the public eye as the conflict receded from breaking news.
“That was the seed for Spotlight Ukraine, to share personal stories that would connect with people,” Mariconda said.
From Mariconda’s perspective, the stories Graham and Mestel can share help keep the victims in the public's consciousness.
“We would continue to share personal stories that would connect with people that – as time goes on and the main news outlets lose focus and interest – we would continue to share stories that would keep people engaged,” she added. The website serves as a link to nonprofits funding the relief efforts in Ukraine.
Mariconda saw a synergy between her goal and the work Mestel produced last year – now known as Portrait Ukraine 2022.
“When I’m shooting photo journalistically,“ Mestel said, “I like to capture images that allow people to have an emotional connection with individuals.”
On Mestel’s first two trips, in March and July 2022, he was documenting the living conditions of refugees from fighting in the eastern portion of Ukraine, though the whole country was on a war footing.
It takes about two days to get from Sarasota to Ukraine, including a drive to Miami, flight to Warsaw and then an 18-hour train ride from Warsaw to Kyiv that includes a six-hour stop at a facility near the border, where the undercarriage of the train cars could be swapped out to travel on tracks in Ukraine that still match the gauge of the Soviet rail system.
For this trip, they rented a white Renault SUV that bore signs with both the Canadian and U.S flags and the word press spelled out in English and Ukrainian, and hired fixer/guide Denis Rumiancev to help them.
Neither Graham nor Mestel speak Ukrainian.
In Kyiv, people they encountered could speak English and Polish but the farther east they traveled, they relied more on Google Translate to communicate with they encountered.
“It works,” Graham said. “Not only do you get your point across but they get the gist of what you’re trying to do.”
Both men had applied to the Ukrainian army to receive press credentials and checked in with local press offices at every major city where they stopped.
Rumiancev – who can communicate in four different languages – worked his connections to find different aspects of daily life that they could document.
“It was absolutely incredible the amount of contacts he had,” Graham said. “We were doing about three things a day.
“One morning we had a school opening and then we had the gay pride parade and then we went to a place that rescued 15,000 animals – and we got it all done in one day.”
Mestel added that they had little down time during the three-week trip.
“I think we did actually go from rescuing puppies right to the front line,” he added.
Graham recalled that on their first night, at 5 a.m. in Kyiv, they experienced a barrage of rockets – one of which blew up a big building.
“We got rocketed in every city,” Mestel added “Every city, every night there were rockets impacting.”
While Mestel had been in some potentially dangerous situations documenting the plight of refugees in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the trip to Ukraine marked the first time he worked close to active gunfire.
“The entire time we were there, we never stopped hearing Russian shellfire – some of it distant, some of it much closer,” Mestel said.
Every night, Mestel said, they heard “big booms.”
“There was one time when it sounded like they were walking the shells towards us – that got my attention – when you heard ‘Boom,’ ‘Boom,’ ‘BOOM!'”
Chasiv Yar, one village over from Bakhmut – was one of several places where Mestel and Graham shadowed the nonprofit Ukrainian Patriot – a last-mile organization founded by dancer Lana Nicole Niland that delivers both military and humanitarian aid.
Ukrainian Patriot volunteers dug a new well, so residents could have access to running water for the first time in a year-and-a-half.
Mestel drove their white Renault SUV between destinations, with members of their military escort urging them to keep up at an 80- to 100-mph pace.
“We were literally doing rally-style combat driving from one place to another,” Graham said.
Mestel’s fast-paced driving continued even when they weren’t with military escorts. One time Graham noted, he beat the GPS-suggested travel time by 45 minutes. In one small town, they were pulled over for speeding by local police.
Mestel gave the officer all of his papers, including his driver's license, Canadian passport and Ukrainian driving permit.
The officer looked at his paperwork and then consulted his supervisor.
“I think they didn’t know what to do with me so he came back and said, ‘Have a nice day.’”
In Kharkiv, Mestel said, only one elderly woman still occupied her apartment in an otherwise empty block of apartment buildings.
“There’s a hardcore group of people – mostly elderly – who won’t leave,” Mestel said.
In contrast, Mestel added, “The west is operating basically as normal – except for the rocket fire every night – it's literally a lottery as to whether your building is going to be hit.”
Graham noted that a large rocket may damage one structure but not the next, creating a situation where “there’s a bombed-out school and right next door, a store was open.”
There are other contrasts that still haunt both men.
Near Izyum, they saw the bodies exhumed from a mass grave site of roughly 455 people that Ukrainian officials are trying to identify, “People who were executed and buried by the Russians in unmarked graves inside the forest,” Mestel said.
Meanwhile in Lviv, roughly 44 miles from the border with Poland, they visited a military cemetery, “and they can’t build graves fast enough,” Graham added.
While their press credentials helped, Graham said it did take some time to build up a level of trust with the people they talked with.
Graham noted that everyone was kind and expressed a fear that the Russians wanted nothing less than to exterminate them.
“The main thing we heard when we were there,” he said, “was they were so happy that we were there to tell their story, because they were afraid people were going to forget them.”

Sydney man Kevin Malligan was travelling as a passenger last Friday when he fell off the moving vehicle and hit his head, reportedly suffering a brain bleed and fractured neck.
The family believe he had not been doing anything ""silly"" and was not intoxicated while on the scooter, simply hitting a bump in the road which caused him to topple off.
Kevin, 24, was rushed to hospital for immediate medical assistance and has remained there in an induced coma since, with loved ones in Australia rushing to be by his side as his future remains uncertain.
Kevin's wife Leah is currently pregnant with their second child, who is due early next month. She left her two-year-old daughter in the care of loved ones to rush over to Indonesia with Kevin's father and brother.

""We got the all clear from his CT scan to say his brain is fit enough to book the medical flight home. It’s just a matter of time of getting the money to make that flight happen,"" Leah told Yahoo News Australia.
The family have created a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds to get Kevin home and said they ""aren't losing hope"".
""We have made the decision to keep him in a coma and on life support until we can get him that fly back home to Australia,"" she said.
According to the family, insurance will not cover the expensive medical bills, meaning they face an uncertain future.
The fundraising page has raised more than $77,000 in two days at the time of writing. For now, the family remain concerned with how exactly they will be able to get Kevin safely home to Australia as they hold out hope he will be able to begin his road to recovery.

Kimberlee Singler's 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son were found dead on Dec. 19 when police responded to a report of a burglary at their home. Police later said the report turned out to be unfounded.
Singler, 35, initially cooperated with police but disappeared during the investigation, said Ira Cronin, spokesperson for the Colorado Springs Police Department. Authorities were unable to apprehend her after obtaining an arrest warrant Tuesday on charges of murder and attempted murder, among other allegations.
Singler was not under surveillance and was last seen in Colorado Springs on Dec. 23, said Cronin.
Authorities did not provide further details on the overseas arrest, but said they are working with multiple law enforcement agencies.
Attempts to reach Singler for comment through phone numbers listed for her were unsuccessful. Cronin said he didn't know if she has an attorney.
When police first responded to Singler’s home, they found her with minor injuries, the two children’s bodies and Singler’s 11-year-old daughter hurt. At first, Singler was treated as a burglary victim, said Cronin.
The injured girl was hospitalized for a few days before being released and is recovering in Colorado Springs, said Cronin.
The children’s deaths came amid an ongoing legal battle between Singler and her ex-husband over parenting time and other issues, according to court filings.

Police had been seeking Kimberlee Singler, whose 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son were found dead on Dec. 19 after responding to what turned out to be a false report of a burglary at their home.
The 35-year-old Singler initially cooperated but then went missing as the unfounded report came to light. By the time police got an arrest warrant last Tuesday, she was gone, Colorado Springs Police Department spokesperson Ira Cronin said. She was last seen on Saturday in Colorado Springs.
“In the initial stages of the investigation, we were treating her as a victim of a burglary,” Cronin said.
Responding to the call at an apartment complex at about 12:30 a.m. Dec. 19, cops found the children’s bodies, along with Singler and her 11-year-old daughter, who were both injured. Singler’s injuries were minor, while the daughter was hospitalized for a few days. Police did not release details on the injuries or the children’s manner of death.
The FBI was brought in to assist once Singler disappeared. No details were released on how her arrest overseas unfolded.
Singler was embroiled in a legal battle with her ex-husband related to parenting time and other issues, concerns that were scheduled to be heard in court next month.
The mom now stands charged with multiple counts of first-degree felony murder, attempted first-degree murder, three counts of felony child abuse and one count of first-degree assault, with bond set at $10 million.

2DXBX4ISDS-9,Crown Prince Frederik: What do we know about the next king of Denmark?,George Wright - BBC News,"December 31, 2023 at 3:04 PM·3 min read",20240101,https://news.yahoo.com/crown-prince-frederik-know-next-230453131.html,"Danes were given a surprise on New Year's Eve as Queen Margrethe II announced her abdication.
The world's only reigning queen and the longest-serving living monarch in Europe will step down on 14 January, which will be 52 years to the day since she became queen.
""I will leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik,"" she announced live on TV.
But what do we know about Denmark's soon-to-be king?
Crown Prince Frederik was known in Denmark as somewhat of a party prince in the early 1990s, but perceptions started to change after he graduated from Aarhus University in 1995 with a masters in political science. He was the first Danish royal to complete a university education.
During his studies he spent time at Harvard in the United States, where he enrolled under the pseudonym Frederik Henriksen.
He later served in the Danish navy, where he was nicknamed ""Pingo"" - which according to the Mail was earned after his wetsuit filled up with water during a scuba diving course and he had to waddle like a penguin.
The 55-year-old has earned his name as a daredevil, taking part in a four-month ski expedition across Greenland in 2000. He has been hospitalised in sledging and scooter accidents.
""I don't want to lock myself in a fortress. I want to be myself, a human being,"" he once said, insisting he would stick to that even after taking the throne.
Crown Prince Frederik, like Britain's King Charles III, is known for his passion for the environment. He has vowed to ""guide the ship"" of Denmark into the future.
His wife, Princess Mary, grew up on the Australian island of Tasmania and was working as a lawyer when the pair met in 2000, at a bar in Sydney during the Olympic Games.
She once said in an interview that she did not know he was the prince of Denmark when they met, saying: ""Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?'""
They are considered by some to represent modern values and have tried to give their four children - a daughter, son and twins - as normal an upbringing as possible, sending them mainly to state schools.
Unlike British royal tradition, there will be no formal crowning ceremony for Crown Prince Frederik. Instead, his accession will be announced from Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen on the day.
He will become King of Denmark and head of state in the country - which is a constitutional monarchy - as well as in Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
Queen Margrethe II is the world's only reigning queen and the longest serving current monarch in Europe, taking the throne after the death of her father King Frederik IX in 1972.
The 83-year-old revealed the decision was made after a period of reflection following surgery on her back in early 2023.
""The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,"" she said.
""I have decided that now is the right time,"" she added, and offered her thanks to the Danish public for their support over the years."

Details: ""The Finnish nation and state stand firmly behind Ukraine. Our decisions at the national level, such as increasing production capacity for heavy ammunition, allow us to support Ukraine in the long run. We are also strengthening our own defence capabilities,"" Orpo said.
The prime minister stressed that Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has been going on for almost two years, noting that it has changed the security situation in Europe, while ""Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country, for Europe as a whole and for Western values"".
""We are actively working within the European Union to ensure that Europe is united with Ukraine. The start of accession negotiations with Ukraine is a message of hope for the Ukrainian people: Ukraine is invited to join the European family, and it belongs in the EU,"" said Orpo.

VHZWWW7VG0-13,Israel's Supreme Court overturns a key component of Netanyahu's polarizing judicial overhaul,JOSEF FEDERMAN and MELANIE LIDMAN,"Updated January 2, 2024 at 3:54 AM·4 min read",20240101,https://news.yahoo.com/israels-supreme-court-overturns-key-170309230.html,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s Supreme Court struck down a key component of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s contentious judicial overhaul Monday, delivering a landmark decision that could reopen the fissures in Israeli society that preceded the country’s ongoing war against Hamas.
The planned overhaul sparked months of mass protests, threatened to trigger a constitutional crisis between the judicial and legislative branches of government, and rattled the cohesion of Israel's powerful military.
Those divisions were largely put aside after Hamas militants carried out a bloody cross-border attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, triggering a war that has raged in Gaza for nearly three months. But Monday's court decision could reignite those tensions even while the country remains at war.
Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally and the architect of the overhaul, lambasted the court's decision, saying it demonstrated “the opposite of the spirit of unity required these days for the success of our soldiers on the front.""
The ruling “will not discourage us,” Levin said without indicating whether the government would try to revive his plan in the short term. ""As the campaigns are continuing on different fronts, we will continue to act with restraint and responsibility,” he said.
In Monday’s decision, the court narrowly voted to overturn a law passed in July that prevents judges from striking down government decisions they deem “unreasonable.” Opponents had argued that Netanyahu’s efforts to remove the standard of reasonability opens the door to corruption and improper appointments of unqualified cronies to important positions.
The law was the first in a planned overhaul of the Israeli justice system. The overhaul was put on hold after Hamas militants carried out their Oct. 7 attack, killing some 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. Israel immediately declared war, and is pressing forward with an offensive that Palestinian health officials say has killed nearly 22,000 people in Gaza.
In an 8-7 decision, the Supreme Court justices struck down the law because of the “severe and unprecedented harm to the core character of the State of Israel as a democratic country.”
The justices also ruled 12-3 that they had the authority to overturn so-called “Basic Laws,” major pieces of legislation that serve as a sort of constitution for Israel.
It was a significant blow to Netanyahu and his hard-line allies, who claimed the national legislature, not the high court, should have the final word over the legality of legislation and other key decisions. The justices said the Knesset, or parliament, does not have “omnipotent” power.
Netanyahu's government could decide to ignore Monday's ruling, setting the stage for a constitutional showdown over which branch of government has ultimate authority.
The court issued its decision because its outgoing president, Esther Hayut, is retiring, and Monday was her last day on the job.
Netanyahu and his allies announced their sweeping plan to reshape the judiciary shortly after taking office a year ago. It calls for curbing the power of the judges, including by limiting the Supreme Court’s ability to review parliamentary decisions and changing the way judges are appointed.
Supporters said the changes aim to strengthen democracy by circumscribing the authority of unelected judges and turning over more powers to elected officials. But opponents see the overhaul as a power grab by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, and an assault on a key watchdog.
The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good-government group that opposed the legislation, called the Supreme Court's ruling “a tremendous public victory for those who seek democracy.”
“Only an unreasonable government, one that acts unreasonably, that makes unreasonable moves, abolishes the reasonablility standard,” the group’s chairman, Eliad Shraga, said.
Before the Israel-Hamas war, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in weekly protests against the government. Among the demonstrators were military reservists, including fighter pilots and members of other elite units, who said they would stop reporting for duty if the overhaul was passed. Reservists make up the backbone of the Israeli military.
While the reservists quickly returned to duty after the Oct. 7 attacks in a show of unity, it remains unclear what would happen if the overhaul efforts were revived. A resumption of the protests could undermine national unity and affect the military’s readiness if soldiers refused to report for duty.
Under the Israeli system, the prime minister governs through a majority coalition in parliament — in effect, giving him control over the executive and legislative branches of government.
As a result, the Supreme Court plays a critical oversight role. Critics say that by seeking to weaken the judiciary, Netanyahu and his allies are trying to erode the country’s checks and balances and consolidate power over the third, independent branch of government.
Netanyahu’s allies include an array of ultranationalist and religious parties with a list of grievances against the court.
His allies have called for increased West Bank settlement construction, annexation of the occupied territory, perpetuating military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men, and limiting the rights of LGBTQ+ people and Palestinians.
The U.S. had previously urged Netanyahu to put the plans on hold and seek a broad consensus across the political spectrum."

""In the extraordinary security situation resulting from Russia's war of aggression, it is crucial that we continue to support Ukraine. Support for Ukraine is important for Norwegian and European security. We must plan for the possibility that the illegal war of aggression may be prolonged. The Government has therefore decided to permit direct sales of weapons and defence-related products from the Norwegian defence industry to Ukraine,"" he said.
The statement adds that provided that the exports meet the requirements for verified needs and end-user control, the government has decided to allow direct sales of Norway's arms and defence products to Ukraine.
""This change means that we are safeguarding fundamental defence and security policy interests for Norway together with our allies. The Government employs a number of instruments to facilitate the important role of the defence industry in the current security policy situation,"" said Norwegian Defence Minister Bjørn Arild Gram.
The Norwegian Foreign Ministry stressed that export licences for direct sales will be granted only on a case-by-case basis and will be thoroughly assessed. Monitoring will continue to take place within a strict and responsible framework in accordance with Norwegian export control regulations.

Details: She added that the aftermath of the attack is still being summed up and the final data will be available later.
Humeniuk said the attack began at 23:30. One of the port infrastructure facilities in Odesa Oblast was hit. A fire broke out, but it was quickly extinguished. No people were injured.
She said that the air defence systems operated in the south for almost 11 hours during the night. The drones were shot down in Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad and Vinnytsia oblasts. Most of the drones were shot down in Odesa Oblast – about 30 of them.
Humeniuk explained that even a downed Shahed drone remains very dangerous. When it falls, it creates a powerful blast wave that destroys facilities around it.
Background:
On the evening of 31 December, several dozen Russian attack drones were spotted in Ukrainian airspace. During the night, several of them flew to the west of the country to Lviv.
Explosions were heard overnight in Odesa and Dnipro. In Odesa, a high-rise building caught fire, killing one person. There were also strikes in Mykolaiv Oblast.

The Ukrainian attack on Saturday, which killed 25 people including five children, came after Moscow launched a large-scale attack on Ukrainian cities.
""We're going to intensify the strikes. No crime against civilians will rest unpunished, that's for certain,"" Putin said during a visit to a military hospital.
He said Russia would continue to hit what he called ""military installations"".
""We are doing that today and tomorrow we will continue doing it,"" Putin announced, speaking almost two years into Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Kyiv said Russia had targeted the country with a ""record"" number of drones on New Year's Day.
""What happened in Belgorod is a terrorist act,"" Putin told wounded Russian soldiers sitting near him in hospital pyjamas and sanitary masks.
""There is no other way to call it.""
He accused Ukrainian forces of targeting ""right in the city centre, where people were walking around, before New Year's Eve"" and alleged they had ""purposefully hit the civilian population"".
Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Monday that the death toll had risen to 25, saying medics were unable to save a toddler who was seriously injured in the attack.
""Today in the local children's hospital a four-year-old girl, who was in a serious condition with severe injuries to the chest and internal organs, died,"" Gladkov said.
Her death brought the number of child victims of the attack to five.
""This is an irreparable loss for all of us,"" Gladkov said.
He said a total of 109 people were wounded, 45 of which are still in medical facilities.
Speaking about the situation on the battlefield, Putin said he believed the ""strategic initiative"" in the drawn-out conflict in Ukraine was on the Russian side.
""In any case, that is how I am being briefed,"" he said.
He also claimed Moscow wanted to end the conflict -- which has dragged on for almost two years -- ""as quickly as possible"" but ""only on our terms"", according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.

""We hope that the two sides will resume healthy and orderly exchanges as soon as possible,"" Tsai said during her New Year's address.
Tsai said Taiwan also wants to jointly find a way for the two sides to coexist over the long term through the principles of ""peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue.""
Facing the renewed conflict between the democracy and authoritarianism around the world, Tsai said that ""Taiwan's only choice in the future is still to continue to uphold democracy and safeguard peace.""
In 2024, Taiwan's total defence budget will reach a record high of 600.7 billion Taiwanese dollars ($19.58 billion), she said.
""We must show our determination and protect the democratic and free way of life, so that the world can further confirm that Taiwan is an indispensable and key player in global democratic peace, not a dispensable part,"" Tsai said.
During a news conference, Tsai told reporters that Taiwan's future relationship with China will be jointly decided by all Taiwanese people through a democratic procedure because ""Taiwan is a democratic country.""
China cut off all communication with Taiwan's leadership in June 2016, one month after Tsai of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took office.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held on January 13. Tsai, re-elected in 2020, is ineligible to seek a third term.

Taiwan is less than two weeks from an election, closely watched from Beijing to Washington as it determines the future of the self-ruled island's relations with an increasingly bellicose China.
Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory to be seized one day.
It has halted high-level communications with Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government since her 2016 election, and ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on the island.
In her last New Year speech before leaving office in May, Tsai expressed hopes to restart communications with Beijing.
""We hope that the two sides (of the Taiwan Strait) will resume healthy and sustainable exchanges as soon as possible,"" she said.
""We also hope that the two sides will jointly seek a long-term and stable way of peaceful coexistence under peace, parity, democracy and dialogue.""
But Tsai -- whom Beijing hates as she has refused to acknowledge China's territorial claims -- also stood firm on Taiwan's need to defend its democracy.
""Facing the renewed conflict between democracy, freedom and authoritarianism around the world, Taiwan's only choice in the future is still to continue to uphold democracy and protect peace.""
Tsai was also asked to comment on Chinese President Xi Jinping's New Year's Eve speech, in which he said Taiwan ""will surely be reunified"" with China.
""Decisions must be made with the common will of the Taiwanese people. We are a democratic country after all,"" she told reporters after her speech.
""What kind of relationship we will form with China in the future must be determined by our democratic procedures to make the final decision.""
Xi has previously said China would never rule out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
Tsai's ruling DPP has largely campaigned on a platform of sovereignty separate from China, and their candidate, Vice President Lai Ching-te, has in past described himself as a ""pragmatic worker of Taiwan independence"".
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party's candidate Hou Yu-ih and Taiwan People's Party Ko Wen-je have pledged friendlier ties with China, saying Lai's pro-independence remarks could undermine Taiwan's security.

The Russians also fired missiles, shells and unguided rockets at multiple cities and villages, including in Kherson and Kharkiv Oblasts in the past 24 hours.On Dec. 29, Russia conducted the largest single massive attack since the start of the full-scale invasion, killing at least 39 people.

O3Z4SHWIS3-24,"White House says it is not seeking wider conflict after US helicopters sink Houthi boats in Red Sea, killing crews","Kevin Liptak and Nikki  Carvajal, CNN","January 1, 2024 at 6:50 AM·3 min read",20240101,https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-says-not-seeking-225006449.html,"The White House said Sunday it is not seeking a wider conflict in the Middle East after US helicopters sank three Houthi boats in the Red Sea after coming under fire.
The helicopters sank the boats and killed those aboard, marking the first time since tensions broke out earlier this year that the US has killed members of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group, which has been targeting commercial and merchant vessels in the Red Sea.
The US has avoided directly striking the group inside Yemen as it seeks to avoid escalating the crisis further. But a National Security Council spokesman said Sunday that the US would continue acting in self-defense.
“We don’t seek a conflict wider in the region and we’re not looking for a conflict with the Houthis. The best outcome here would be for the Houthis to stop these attacks, as we have made clear over and over again,” John Kirby said on ABC News.
Four small boats originating from “Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen” attacked the Maersk Hangzhou on Saturday with small arms and attempted to board the merchant vessel, according to a statement from US Central Command, which added that a security team on board had returned fire.
CENTCOM said helicopters from the USS Eisenhower and Gravely responded to the Maersk Hangzhou’s distress call, the second in less than 24 hours, and were fired on by the Houthi boats.
“The U.S. Navy helicopters returned fire in self-defense, sinking three of the four small boats, and killing the crews. The fourth boat fled the area,” the statement said, adding that there was “no damage to U.S. personnel or equipment.”
CNN has reached out to Maersk for comment on the incident.
The Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels since October 7, saying they are acting in solidarity with Hamas amid the group’s war with Israel.
The US has deployed warships to the Red Sea and last month launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational maritime coalition, to beef up security in the critical global shipping lane.
While President Joe Biden has authorized strikes on other Iranian proxy groups that have attacked American troops in Iraq and Syria, he has stopped short of striking the Houthis in Yemen.
“We’ve got significant national security interests in the region just on our own … and we’re going to put the kind of forces we need in the region to protect those interests and we’re going to act in self-defense going forward,” Kirby said.
Asked about the prospect of a preemptive strike in the region, Kirby reiterated the White House stance.
“We’re not ruling anything in or out, but we have made it clear publicly to the Houthis and privately to our allies and partners in the region we take these threats seriously, and we’re going to make the right decisions going forward,” he said.

C4CGPP9D8E-25,Arizona man shot in Mexico while trying to cross into US. What to know,"José Ignacio Castañeda Perez, Arizona Republic","January 2, 2024 at 12:58 PM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-man-shot-mexico-while-185817352.html,"An Arizona man was shot Christmas Eve when he was caught in the crossfire of rival smuggling gangs in northwestern Sonora as he drove north to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.
Craig Ricketts was shot twice, once in his arm and once in his left leg, near Oquitoa, Sonora, a town just outside of Altar, Sonora, according to reporting from Arizona’s Family, the outlet that first reported the shooting in the Phoenix market.
Ricketts’ car was shot at least 16 times as he attempted to bypass the Lukeville-Sonoyta Port of Entry closure and cross the border through Nogales. Instead of crossing through Nogales, Ricketts’ GPS led him on a route through Altar to cross through the Sasabe Port of Entry, an area that has been the epicenter of an ongoing turf war between rival cartel gangs.
Sasabe, Sonora, is only about 66 miles north of Oquitoa, resulting in an hour-and-a-half drive.
Northern portions of Sonora have become entrenched in intense violence stemming from rival gangs battling for prized migrant smuggling routes near the southern border. Sasabe, Sonora, has been largely abandoned by residents as cartel fighting has spilled into the streets.
Travel advisory: US citizens urged not to travel to Rocky Point until Lukeville border crossing reopens
The entire state of Sonora is classified under a level 3 travel advisory, which means citizens should reconsider travel because of crime and kidnapping.
Ricketts has been working in Puerto Libertad, Sonora, to build a real estate development for the past seven years and has worked in Mexico for over 20 years, he told Arizona’s Family. Ricketts was traveling to Tempe to visit his son for the holidays.
At the time of publication, Google Maps still guides travelers from Puerto Libertad to drive through Sasabe on their way to Tempe.
Ricketts’ was shot just over a week after one U.S. resident was killed and two others were injured in a shooting on Federal Highway 2 in Sonora. The shooting happened on Dec. 16 at about 2 a.m. as the group drove in a truck with Oregon plates between Altar and Santa Ana.
The group, which came from Utah, was heading to Michoacán, Mexico, on the highway that also serves as an alternate route to reach Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, known as Rocky Point, from Nogales.
The U.S. Consulate General strongly advised U.S. citizens against traveling to Rocky Point and warned about using alternate routes to reach the tourist destination as the Lukeville Port of Entry remains closed. The guidance was issued on Dec. 20, advising people not to travel to Rocky Point until the Lukeville port reopens.
The Lukeville port has been shuttered for nearly a month after U.S. Customs and Border Protection resigned officers to help Border Patrol with asylum seeker processing on Dec. 4.

Rinkevics also wrote that ""Ukrainian air defense works well, but Ukraine must get more help.""
""New Year’s celebrations are over and the West must get serious and act now,"" Rinkevics posted on X.

58T1LUXNZM-27,Beijing criticises Netherlands' move to block ASML exports to China,Reuters,"January 2, 2024 at 7:32 AM·2 min read",20240102,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-says-dutch-government-revoked-233253756.html,"(Reuters) -China on Tuesday urged the Netherlands to ""respect market principles"" a day after chip machine maker ASML said the Dutch government had revoked an export licence covering the shipment of some of its equipment to China.
The Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company said on Monday that the shipments affected included certain lithography systems.
""A licence for the shipment of NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i lithography systems in 2023 has recently been partially revoked by the Dutch government, impacting a small number of customers in China,"" the company said.
ASML dominates the global market for lithography systems, which use lasers to help create chip circuitry.
Its shares dipped in early trade on Tuesday.
Asked about the Dutch government's move, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Tuesday urged the Netherlands ""to be impartial, respect market principles and the law, take practical actions to protect the common interests of both countries and their companies and maintain the stability of international supply chains"".
ASML did not specify which customers were due to receive the machines, but its customers in China include Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and others, according to company disclosures.
SMIC and foundry peers Hua Hong, Nexchip Semiconductor, Wuhan Xinxin Integration Dianlu Manufacture and United Nova Technology did not respond to requests for comment.
In recent years, China has been ASML's third-largest market after Taiwan and South Korea, but it was the biggest in the third quarter of 2023, with 46% of the company's sales.
In 2023, the United States announced rules giving Washington the right to restrict the export of ASML's ""Twinscan NXT1930Di"" machine if it contains any U.S. parts.
Soon after, several Dutch lawmakers challenged the Netherlands' Trade Minister over whether the United States had acted correctly in unilaterally imposing rules regulating the export to China of another ASML chipmaking machine.
""In recent discussions with the US government, ASML has obtained further clarification of the scope and impact of the US export control regulations,"" the semiconductor equipment maker said in a statement.
""ASML is fully committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including export control legislation in the countries in which we operate.""
China has been striving to catch up in lithography as part of a massive government-directed effort to create a self-reliant semiconductor supply chain. Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is the country's only known maker of lithography machines, though it is seen as well behind ASML and Japanese peers.
Last month, one of SMEE's shareholders, Zhangjiang Group, announced that the company had successfully developed a 28nm lithography machine on its WeChat account in what would mark a breakthrough for the company and China. However it later retracted the post without specifying why.

Source: Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann gave her comment to the portal t-online; European Pravda
According to Strack-Zimmermann, the talk about supporting Ukraine ""as long as it takes"" will be just words ""if we do not continue to support Ukraine together with our European partners to a much greater extent"".
""Ukraine needs more ammunition, more replacement parts, and we need to immediately mobilise Taurus [missiles – ed.] to finally complicate the possibility of resupply for Russia,"" Strack-Zimmermann stressed.
""And the much-publicised European F-16 coalition needs to be operational much sooner if we are to counter Russian air superiority. Putin is counting on us to be afraid of our own courage. And he's right. This hesitation is very bitter,"" Strack-Zimmermann added.
Sara Nanni, the press secretary for the security of the German The Greens party, in a comment to t-online, also called for reliable German assistance to Ukraine. According to Nanni, ""we need certainty in planning when it comes to German support"" for Ukraine, adding that ""at the moment, it is not enough due to intense discussions on the budget"".
Nanni pointed out that Ukraine desperately needs ""ammunition for artillery, Taurus [missiles] and spare parts for large equipment that we supply.""
Background:
On the morning of 2 January, Russia launched a large-scale missile attack on Ukraine. In Kyiv the fall of missile wreckage was recorded in Pecherskyi, Obolonskyi, Holosiivskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts. There are also hits in Kharkiv.
Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said that the Russians launched 99 missiles of various types at Ukraine, 72 of which were destroyed.

ZIKNCV9OSV-30,Children of German steakhouse heiress kidnapped,Jorg Luyken,"January 2, 2024 at 5:52 AM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/children-german-steakhouse-heiress-kidnapped-121024034.html,"The children of a German millionaire restaurant heiress have been abducted, with police investigating whether it is linked to a custody battle.
The abduction of the children, aged 10 and 13, took place shortly after midnight on Monday while they were watching a firework display with their father in the Danish town of Gråsten.
Several men knocked the father to the floor before beating him, then bundled the children into two cars, Danish police have confirmed.
The vehicles, a Mercedes and a Citroen, had German licence plates, leading local police to immediately contact their German colleagues across the border 10 miles to the south.
On Tuesday, police still had no clues as to the whereabouts of the children.
German police are also investigating. It is unclear whether the kidnappers crossed the border.
While Danish police are refusing to confirm the identities of the father of the children they have said that the victims are involved in a custody dispute which has been reported on by the media in both countries.
They are now investigating “whether there is a connection between the night’s events and the question of parental authority,” a police official said.
Germany’s Bild newspaper has reported that the victims are the two youngest children of German steakhouse heiress Christina Block and her former husband Stephan Hensel.
The couple, from the northern port town of Hamburg, have been involved in an ugly custody battle since their divorce in 2018.
Mr Hensel moved across the Danish border after the break-up.
Ms Block, who is the daughter of the steakhouse tycoon Eugen Block, has previously told the German media that her former spouse “kidnapped” their two youngest children in 2021 after they never came back to their Hamburg home after a weekend visit.
He responded that the children refused to go back to Germany and accused his former wife of subjecting them to physical and emotional violence.
A legal battle ensued in both countries, with the German court system ruling that Mr Hensel should return the children to their mother.
However, Denmark’s courts ruled that they should stay with their father and granted the mother visitation rights.
Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward. The abduction took place at the Caféodora restaurant in Gråsten shortly after midnight on Monday.
The 10-year-old boy was wearing light blue jeans, a blue-and-white striped shirt and a dark pullover.
His 13-year-old sister was wearing light cargo trousers and a green sweater with a teddy bear motif on the front.
Ms Block is set to inherit a £350 million fortune, the jewel of which is the Block House restaurant chain, founded by her father in the 1960s.

Song Tao's message, which comes less than two week's before Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 13, follows President Xi Jinping's remarks in his New Year Eve's address that China's ""reunification"" with Taiwan was inevitable.
""The motherland will eventually be reunified, and it will inevitably be reunified,"" Song said in his New Year's message on his office's website.
This is the common desire and common mission of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Song added.
Taiwan's people should ""promote cross-strait relations to return to the right track of peaceful development, and promote the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland"", he said.
Taiwan's government rejects China's sovereignty claims. Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and largest opposition party, the Kuomintang, say only Taiwan's people can decide their future.
China has offered Taiwan a ""one country, two systems"" model of autonomy, but no mainstream Taiwanese party supports that idea.
Song reiterated China's support for ""one country, two systems"" and opposition to Taiwan's formal independence or ""interference by external forces"".
His message made no mention of the election, which the Taiwan Affairs Office has cast as a choice between war and peace.
China has continued military pressure around the island, ended some tariff cuts for Taiwan and threatened further economic measures as the vote has neared.

The tariffs were removed in May 2022 to guard against supply risks after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global energy markets. That helped pave the way for record imports last year, which included an increased portion of Russian coal shunned by other buyers. Now, policy has shifted to protecting China’s mining companies from the consequences of a glut after domestic output also rose to an all-time high.
Russia has become the no. 2 shipper of coal to China and the long-term aim of the two countries is for annual supply to reach 100 million tons, a figure that’s likely to be hit in 2023 once December’s imports are tallied. To maintain those volumes, Russian prices will have to fall.
“No other countries can take in such large supplies,” Su Huipeng, an analyst with the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association, told a briefing last week. “It has to be exporters cutting prices and absorbing the additional tax cost.”
Russia’s monthly coal sales to China have declined since peaking at more than 10 million tons in June as its shipments have become less competitive against other origins, a dynamic that’ll only worsen as taxes are reimposed.
Meanwhile, rivals such as Australia and top supplier Indonesia are shielded from the duties because of free trade pacts struck with Beijing. Moscow has also imposed a tax on its own overseas sales to help pay for its war.
China’s duties for most-favored nations, including Russia, Mongolia, South Africa and the US, have returned to a rate of 6% on coal for power and heating and 3% on coking coal used by steel mills. China has an abundance of thermal coal but is generally short of the steelmaking variety, which should help limit the impact of the levies on those imports.
Coal from other countries that don’t enjoy preferential status will be taxed at 20%.

K2FMRN37Q7-33,Colorado mother accused of murdering two of her kids appears in London court,"Theresa Braine, New York Daily News","January 1, 2024 at 8:46 PM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-mother-accused-murdering-two-044600751.html,"A Colorado Springs, Colo., mother arrested in the UK for murdering two of her children appeared in court on New Year’s Day, with an extradition hearing pending.
Kimberlee Singler, 35, appeared in Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London after being nabbed on Sunday in London’s Kensington section by officers of the National Crime Agency’s national extradition unit. Her bail was set at $10 million.
An extradition hearing was scheduled for Jan. 29 as Singler faces two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.
Singler seemingly disappeared last week as police in Colorado were getting set to arrest her in the deaths of her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. The children were found slain on Dec. 19 when police came to investigate a report of a burglary, which turned out to be false. Singler and her 11-year-old daughter were wounded nearby.
The daughter spent several days in the hospital and has since been released. Police did not share who is taking care of her now or where she went other than to say the girl “is safe and accounted for in the Colorado Springs area and is being cared for,” a spokesperson told KUSA-TV.
While Singler was being treated as a crime victim, she cooperated with police. But as they closed in, she disappeared. Other than saying she was arrested without incident, police gave no details of the bust.
Singler had been in an extended legal battle over custody of the three children she shared with her ex-husband, Kevin Wenz.
Wenz’s family issued a statement through an attorney while the search for his ex-wife was still underway.
“Mr. Wentz and his family are currently in a tremendous amount of grief and shock,” lawyer Rex Harris said in the statement obtained by KKTV-TV.
Colorado Springs police said the investigation is ongoing. Authorities on both sides of the Pond said a press conference would be held with more information at some point in the future.

BEXKO5KCMW-34,Facial recognition at UK airports: When is it coming in and how does it work?,Lola Christina Alao,"January 3, 2024 at 5:06 AM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/facial-recognition-coming-uk-airports-171105209.html,"Facial recognition technology could soon replace passports at UK airport e-gates. It means that passengers will be admitted to the UK simply by looking into a camera. Border Force director Phil Douglas said he was “really impressed” by e-gate schemes in Australia and Dubai.
“I had to apply for an electronic travel authorisation in advance and used my smartphone to read the chip in my passport. That sent the image of me in the chip to the Australian authorities. When I arrived in Australia, I didn’t even have to get my passport out of my bag. It is a really interesting concept,” he told the Times.
In February 2023, Douglas suggested the paper passport was becoming redundant. He told an audience at the Airport Operators Association conference in London at the time: “I’d like to see a world of completely frictionless borders where you don’t really need a passport. The technology already exists to support that.”
He added: “In the future, you won’t need a passport – you’ll just need biometrics.”
There are currently over 270 e-gates in place across 15 railway stations and airports in the UK, which will require upgrading to the new technology. These can be used by passengers over the age of 10 who are British citizens or nationals of an EU country, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and the US.
These new rules are set to launch on October 6, 2024, having been postponed from the initial date of May 2023.
The current e-gates require a passport, whereas the new plan should offer ""frictionless"" travel.
You can normally use e-gates if you:
have a biometric symbol on the cover of your passport;
are aged 10+ (10 to 17 year olds must be accompanied by an adult);
are either:
a British citizen;
a national of an EU country, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland or the USA; or
a member of the Registered Traveller Service.
You currently need a valid passport if you are travelling abroad and for many domestic flights within the UK."
9HNCCL5LO2-35,Five dead in Japan plane collision at Tokyo airport,AFP,"January 2, 2024 at 8:53 PM·3 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-airlines-plane-fire-runway-104016184.html,"Five people aboard a Japan coast guard aircraft died Tuesday when it hit a Japan Airlines passenger plane on the ground in a fiery collision at Tokyo's Haneda airport.
All 379 passengers and crew on board the passenger plane which burst into flames were safely evacuated, Japanese transport minister Tetsuo Saito told reporters.
But five of the six crew members from the smaller plane -- bound for central Japan after Monday's huge earthquake -- died, Saito said.
The captain escaped and survived but was injured, he said, cautioning that ""we're not at the stage to explain the cause"" of the accident.
Television and unverified footage shared on social media showed the Japan Airlines (JAL) airliner moving along the runway before a large eruption of orange flames and black smoke burst from beneath and behind it.
Video posted to social media platform X showed people sliding down an inflatable emergency slide from the side of the passenger plane while flames shot out from the rear of the aircraft.
All 367 passengers plus 12 crew onboard were swiftly taken off the plane before dozens of fire engines with flashing blue lights sprayed the fuselage.
They however failed to put out the flames coming out of windows near the wings and the blaze soon engulfed the entire aircraft.
The plane, reportedly an Airbus 350, had arrived from New Chitose Airport serving Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido. Those on board included eight children.
""Smoke began to fill the plane, and I thought, 'this could be really bad'"", an adult male passenger told reporters at the airport.
""An announcement said doors in the back and middle could not be opened. So everyone disembarked from the front,"" he said.
A female passenger said it had been dark on board as the fire intensified after landing.
""It was getting hot inside the plane, and I thought, to be honest, I would not survive,"" she said in comments shown on broadcaster NHK.
- 'Sense of mission' -
The coast guard plane had been preparing to fly to Ishikawa prefecture to deliver supplies after the devastating New Year's Day earthquake which killed at least 48 people.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida praised the deceased crew members on their way to help the victims of the quake.
""These were employees who had a high sense of mission and responsibility for the affected areas. It's very regrettable,"" he told reporters.
""I express my respect and gratitude to their sense of mission,"" Kishida said.
JAL said the passenger plane either collided with the other aircraft on a runway or a taxiway after it touched down, Kyodo reported.
There was also burning debris on the runway at Haneda, one of the world's busiest airports.
Haneda suspended domestic flights, according to its website, but most international takeoffs and landings were still operating.
A transport ministry official said investigations into the incident were ongoing, including exchanges between the flights and air traffic control.
Japan has not suffered a serious commercial aviation accident in decades.
Its worst ever was in 1985, when a JAL jumbo jet flying from Tokyo to Osaka crashed in central Gunma region, killing 520 passengers and crew.
That disaster was one of the world's deadliest plane crashes involving a single flight.

Further rainfall is expected, meaning water levels could rise and the situation could worsen in some places, the spokesman said.
In some municipalities, a so-called ""exceptional event"" has been declared, which means that districts or cities can access emergency services more easily. This level of preparedness continues to apply in six districts in Lower Saxony.
Further south the water level on the river Werra in the state of Thuringia has been rising again following heavy rainfall. The German Weather Service (DWD) has warned of heavy continuous rain in parts of Thuringia until Friday, particularly in the south-western Thuringian Forest and the southern Harz Mountains.
In northern Thuringia water levels are expected to rise significantly on the Zorge, Bere and Unstrut rivers. On Tuesday morning water levels at four measuring points in Thuringia were already causing concern."

Yan told Ukrainska Pravda. Zhyttia that after the 2 January Russian attack, he had rushed to the site of the missile strike to record Russia's crimes on video.
Yan left his car in Kyiv's Obolonskyi district and walked to the scene. At that moment, air defences fired twice.
""A minute later, I saw the missile fall on the territory of a plant where smoke was already rising from a previous hit. It was literally 50 metres away from me. I was lucky in that there must have been a foundation dug behind the fence, because the missile fell down there and exploded. I couldn't move for five minutes as stones, debris and shards of window glass were flying around me,"" said Yan.
Initially, Yan thought the debris had injured his body, but he felt no pain because of the adrenaline rush in his blood. He walked away unharmed.
The photographer waited for firefighters to arrive at the scene, finished his work, and headed to another spot that the Russians had hit.
""I'm exhausted, but in one piece,"" he said.
Yan added that this was the first time during the full-scale war that he had been so close to the epicentre of an explosion, and he considers it an absolute miracle that he remained unharmed.
""God loves me, but I mustn’t take advantage of that,"" Yan noted on social media.

""Yesterday, I was crying on and off all morning — thinking about them,"" family friend Matthew Rooney, 40, told the Free Press. ""I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep imagining their last moments.""
Hope and Don Bragg, in their 50s, along with their three children — Kenny, a Michigan Tech student; Beth, a college freshman in Arkansas, and Stephen, a schoolboy — were in the house with Hope’s father, Rich Pruden.
Rooney — who said he was a family friend and colleague and has a son in the same school as Stephen, who along with Pruden, survived and is hospitalized — called the unexplained Saturday afternoon explosion ""horrifying.""
By early Tuesday, national news outlets were reporting more details, and the Democrat-Gazette, which is sold throughout Arkansas, said mourners were holding candlelight memorials at St. Mark Catholic Church, where the family worshiped.
A police photo shows the blast leveled the house in the 8200 block of Winters Lane. Rooney said Hope and Don Bragg frequently visited it and planned to retire there. Debris, the police report said, scattered debris over two acres.

The Free Press left a message Tuesday morning with Northfield Township police, who had not yet released the names of the victims, seeking more information about what caused the explosion.
Saturday, township police said that three were killed. By Sunday, however, they confirmed to the Free Press the death toll had climbed to four, with two more in the hospital.
Don and Hope Bragg, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported, were a Forest Service scientist and a University of Arkansas Extension Service 4-H instructor, respectively, adding that they were originally from the Midwest.
But the Democrat-Gazette added that the couple moved to Arkansas decades ago, and had become a vital part of the small community with a population of a little more than 8,000. The Braggs were involved, the newspaper said, in state and local archaeological activities.
Don Gragg, Rooney said, had a doctorate and taught at the University of Arkansas, Monticello; while Hope, was still earning her doctorate, and seemed to know someone everywhere she went in the city.
On Facebook, the College of Forestry, Agriculture, and Natural Resources posted that it mourned ""the tragic loss of two of our colleagues and friends,"" and confirmed, ""Don and Hope Bragg were lost along with their daughter and one of their sons in a house explosion.""
Kenny, the oldest of Hope and Don’s children in the home, was preparing to graduate from Michigan Tech, Rooney said.
While Beth — who Rooney recalled ""made the best desserts,"" particularly her cheesecakes — had just left home in the fall to start college at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.
Stephen, a student in the Monticello School District, survived the blast.
But, Superintendent Sandra Lanehart said in a social media post, said Stephen has a ""broken pelvis and lacerated liver."" And Pruden, she added, is ""in a coma,"" with burns to 20% of his body.
She asked for prayers for Stephen, his family, their friends, colleagues, and classmates, and ended with a touching verse from Psalms about healing broken hearts.
""They were some of the most generous and kind people I’ve ever known and had the pleasure to be around,"" Rooney said on his Facebook page. ""I wish it had been far longer. We’ve really lost out big time.""

7A0APP8OU3-39,How Are California’s Students Doing? New School Dashboard Is Out,Carolyn Jones,"January 3, 2024 at 3:32 AM·6 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/california-students-doing-school-dashboard-193200025.html,"This article was originally published in CalMattters.
In the first glimpse of California’s K-12 schools’ year-over-year progress since the pandemic,  graduation rates hit some of their highest levels ever, absenteeism dropped significantly, and hundreds of districts showed academic improvements.
But despite a few bright spots, most of the 13 measurements that California uses to gauge student achievement remained flat in the 2023 School Dashboard, which the California Department of Education released on Dec. 15.
Returning to the color-coded system the state used prior to the pandemic, the new dashboard graded many categories as “yellow,” or mid-way between high and low. In assigning one of five colors, the state combines data about schools’ current performance and progress from previous years, which it says creates a more nuanced picture of achievement. Districts that score red — the lowest grade — for more than one category qualify for extra assistance to make improvements.

Support The 74's year-end campaign. Make a tax-exempt donation now.
During the pandemic, the state didn’t update the dashboard for two years, and then last year didn’t use the color-coding system because there was no previous data to compare it to. This is the first year since 2019 that the dashboard contains full information about test scores and other metrics.
First released in 2018, the dashboard is meant to give the public a fuller view of school performance, beyond just test scores. The dashboard looks at detailed data such as suspension rates, progress of English learners and career readiness, broken down by race and ethnicity and whether students are low-income, in foster care, are homeless or have disabilities.
“In no way, shape or form is yellow a good thing,” said Kimberly Mundhenk, education research and evaluation administrator for the Department of Education. “But it could mean that there’s improvements. … Not all yellows are created equal.”
The number of students who graduated within five years climbed to 88.7%, the highest rate since the state started tracking that data in 2018. More than half of those students qualified for California’s public universities, also the highest rate in years.
Chronic absenteeism, which hit record levels during the pandemic, dropped to 24.3%, down more than 5 percentage points from last year but still more than double the pre-pandemic level.
“I’m glad to see that we’re starting to turn things around, and that districts that had intentional strategies saw big improvements,” said Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, which researches the topic. “But we still have a significant challenge before us.”
Los Angeles Unified and Monterey County both doubled down on attendance efforts last year, she said, by examining data, working directly with families to address the barriers to attendance, investing in after-school and summer programs and taking other steps to get students back in the classroom after the height of the pandemic. A comprehensive, data-focused strategy clearly works, Chang said, and the state should encourage all districts to adopt such an approach.
Heather Hough, executive director of Policy Analysis for California Education, said that the state needs to take dramatic steps to jolt schools toward better results. She and her PACE colleagues recently released a study showing that collaboration among teachers, data analysis and extra help for struggling students can have “measurable impacts on student achievement.”
“There isn’t a simple solution, because the problem is that our schools (currently) aren’t organized in a way that supports and empowers educators to make sure every student learns,” she said. “The dashboard release will bring new attention to the issue, and will raise again questions about what, exactly, we need to do.”
The number of school districts that qualified for what the state calls “differentiated assistance” — extra help based on poor achievement in at least two categories — fell dramatically, from 617 last year to 466 in 2023, primarily because of improvements in attendance, according to the state.
Smarter Balanced test scores were released in October and incorporated into the new dashboard. Mostly unchanged from last year, the dashboard shows English language arts and math both in “orange,” or below average. In English language arts, students scored an average of 13.6 points below the state benchmark on a 200-point scale, and 49.1 points below the standard in math.
Education officials said they were gratified about the dashboard data. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said the improvements show that California’s recent investments in K-12 education are beginning to pay off. Since the onset of the pandemic, the state and federal governments have spent billions on tutoring, after-school programs and mental health programs to help students recover from school closures.
“This is encouraging news — and our work is not complete,” Thurmond said. “We need to continue providing students with the tools they need to excel, especially now that we are successfully reengaging our students and families, so we can close gaps in achievement in the same way that we have begun to close the equity gaps in attendance and absenteeism.”
Los Angeles Unified was especially proud of its adjusted 4-year graduation rate, which jumped almost five percentage points to 84%. In addition, a record number of graduates — 53% — met the admission requirements for University of California and California State University.
“The work we are doing to transform Los Angeles Unified into the premier urban district in the nation is being demonstrated in the remarkable stories of our students overcoming adversity, dedicating themselves to their school work and graduating ready to change the world,” Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said. “Our students and families have confronted remarkable challenges since the pandemic, but this is the latest signpost validating the progress we are making as a district.”
San Francisco Unified touted the drop in its chronic absenteeism rate, from 29% to 26%, among almost all student groups. The district had been prioritizing attendance with incentives like schoolwide dance breaks, parent notifications and services to help families get their children to school regularly.
“Attendance is directly tied to student outcomes. If a child doesn’t come to school, they’re not learning,” Superintendent Matt Wayne said. “We are pleased to have made progress last year in reducing chronic absenteeism, and we know that more work is needed to continue supporting students in coming to school every day.”
Among English learners, the dashboard assigned “yellow” statewide, based on 48.7% of students advancing in their language skills. But Martha Hernandez, executive director of Californians Together, an English learner advocacy group, said the state should have higher standards for its students.
“We’re happy the state has returned to the color-coded indicators, but we’re very concerned that 48.7% is considered yellow,” Hernandez said. “We’d like to see more aspirational goals, like 80%. … We know that there’s a persistent achievement gap for English learners, but California is giving itself a yellow as if there’s no sense of urgency.”
Students who don’t become proficient in English are more likely to struggle academically and miss out on opportunities to succeed in college and career, she said.
“This is important,” she said. “I think we need to have higher expectations.”"
UBU7YP6EEC-40,Israel assassinates senior Hamas leader in Beirut,Lizzie Porter,"January 3, 2024 at 5:29 AM·7 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-assassinates-senior-hamas-leader-202000571.html,"Israel has assassinated a senior Hamas leader in a Beirut drone strike that threatens a major escalation in the war.
Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas’s political wing and the founder of its militant operations in the occupied West Bank, was among seven killed in the blast in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh.
The 57-year-old is the most senior member of the terror group to have been eliminated since the Oct 7 attack on southern Israel.
Hamas killed around 1,140 people in the attack and captured an estimated 240 hostages, with 120 remaining in captivity. Members of the terrorist group raped, carried out sexual violence and mutilated women during the onslaught, according to a BBC report.
A US defence official said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was behind the strike on a Hamas office, in which two other senior members of its militant wing were killed.
The early-evening drone strike caused extensive damage to a building in the residential suburb of Beirut, with the front of the multi-storey block blown out. Limbs and other pieces of flesh could be seen on the roadside.
Najib Al-Mikati, Lebanon’s prime minister, said the strike was a “new Israeli crime that definitely aims to bring Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations”.
The country plans to submit a complaint to the UN Security Council that the “blatant” strike is a violation of its sovereignty.
Arouri’s death is a “big loss” for Hamas, Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator, told the Telegraph, adding: “This is especially because he was directly in charge of terrorist actions from the West Bank.”
Israel did not officially confirm that it was behind the attack, which struck an area of the Lebanese capital dominated by the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah, a key ally of Hamas.
Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesman, said Israel’s military was at a “very high level of readiness” for any retaliation.
Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, said the assassination was a “terrorist act”, a violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and an expansion of Israel’s hostility against Palestinians.
“All these assassinations and attacks will make us stronger and more determined than ever. This is the history of the resistance and our movement. We always become stronger and more determined,” he said in a televised speech.
Samir Fendi and Azzam al-Aqra were the two senior commanders also killed in the strike, he said.
In a statement by its foreign ministry, Iran, which funds both Hezbollah and Hamas, said Arourii’s death would “further ignite resistance against Israel”.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have caused massive disruption to global shipping via the Red Sea, expressed condolences over the killing.
In Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, hundreds took to the streets to urge retaliation, shouting: “Revenge, revenge, Qassam”.
Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, declined an invitation for Israel to deny responsibility for the drone strike, but did not condemn it either.
He told the broadcaster MSNBC: “Whoever did it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state. Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership.”
The US was not informed of the IDF operation ahead of time, the news website Axios reported.
A failure to do so will further fray relations between Jerusalem and Washington, with the Biden administration increasingly perturbed by Israel’s response to Oct 7 and a fear of escalation across the region.
Thousands of Israeli troops have recently been withdrawn from Gaza, with officials briefing that some will be redeployed to the northern front on Lebanon’s border. Israeli leaders have been drawing up plans for a war with Hezbollah across that border, amid daily exchanges of artillery fire.
Large swathes of northern Israel have been evacuated to protect citizens from Hezbollah rocket attacks, while last month Benny Gantz, a former prime minister who joined Israeli’s war cabinet in the aftermath of Oct 7, warned that the IDF would be forced to act to remove Hezbollah from the border region if the artillery fire continued.
Hezbollah, one of the most heavily armed non-state militias in the world, poses a potentially greater threat to Israel than Hamas. It has an arsenal of roughly 30,000 advanced missiles.
Last month, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, warned: “If Hezbollah wants to take this up a level, we will take it up five levels.”
Arouri was closely linked to Iran and his death is a “huge loss to the Iran-Hamas relationship”, said David Makovsky, the director of Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute of Near-East Policy.
Though less influential than Hamas’s leaders in Gaza, Arouri was seen as a key player in the movement, masterminding its operations in the West Bank from exile in Syria, Turkey, Qatar and finally Lebanon after long stints in Israeli prisons.
As Hamas’s senior official in Lebanon, he played a major role in cementing its relations with Hezbollah and healing ties to Iran.
Arouri visited Tehran in 2017 immediately following his election to Hamas’s political bureau. He was also regarded as being close to Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza.
The US State Department had offered a reward of $5 million (£3.9 million) for information on Arouri’s whereabouts.
In the wake of the Oct 7 massacre, Arouri met Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, and Ziad Nakhale, the secretary general of Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Western intelligence has briefed that Hezbollah and its Iranian backers do not want to provoke a wider regional war that would be difficult for them to sustain.
Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis in history, and Hezbollah knows there is little support in the country for a war that would further devastate the already struggling nation.
Nasrallah has previously warned that any Israeli strike on Beirut would be met with fierce retaliation. On Tuesday night, a Hezbollah MP in Lebanon’s parliament vowed revenge as Hamas called for a general strike in the West Bank.
“Since Oct 7, Hezbollah has been trying hard to avoid an all-out conflict with Israel, which would be catastrophic for Lebanon and for them,” Maha Yahya, a Beirut-based political analyst, told The Telegraph.
“They have tried to contain the conflict along the border areas – but they also need to demonstrate that their deterrence [you bomb Beirut, we bomb Tel Aviv equation] remains meaningful.”
Arab sources told Haaretz that the assassination had brought to a halt negotiations over a hostage deal. Talks in Cairo were now focused on how to prevent an escalation, the newspaper reported.
The Israeli military rarely confirms military operations it conducts abroad but is widely believed to have played a part in the killing of senior officials from terror groups abroad in the past.
Danny Danon, a Knesset member from the Likud party, praised Israeli security forces for Tuesday’s strike, writing on X, formerly Twitter: “I congratulate the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad and the security forces for killing senior Hamas official Salah al-Aaruri in Beirut.”
Quoting the Book of Judges, Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister said: “So, let all thine enemies perish.”
The Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 reported that officials had been ordered not to speak publicly about the attack.
Some 75 per cent of Israeli Jews oppose US demands to limit the scale of the war in Gaza, a poll found on Tuesday.
Just 15 per cent of those polled by the Israel Democracy Institute, meanwhile, want Mr Netanyahu to continue in office after the war is over.

3BKJDIFMRL-41,Israel to appear before ICJ to counter South Africa's Gaza case,Reuters,"Updated January 2, 2024 at 11:41 PM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-says-appear-icj-counter-133212444.html,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague to contest South Africa's genocide accusations over the war with Hamas in Gaza, an Israeli government spokesman said on Tuesday.
South Africa asked the ICJ on Friday for an urgent order declaring that Israel was in breach of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention in its crackdown against Hamas.
""The State of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at The Hague to dispel South Africa's absurd blood libel,"" spokesman Eylon Levy told an online briefing.
""We assure South Africa's leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy,"" Levy said.
South Africa has for decades backed the Palestinian cause for statehood in Israeli-occupied territories. It has likened the plight of Palestinians to those of the Black majority in South Africa during the apartheid era, a comparison Israel strongly denies.
The ICJ, sometimes known as the World Court, is the United Nations venue for resolving disputes between states. Israel's foreign ministry has said the suit was ""baseless.""
Lawyers representing South Africa are preparing for the hearing scheduled on Jan. 11 and 12, Clayson Monyela, a spokesperson for South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation, said in a post on the platform X.
The war was triggered by a cross-border attack by Hamas Islamist militants on Oct. 7, which Israel says killed 1,200 people.
Israel responded with an air and land assault that has killed more than 22,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. While its casualty figures do not differentiate between fighters and civilians, the ministry has said that 70% of Gaza's dead are women and those under 18. Israel disputes Palestinian casualty figures and says it has killed 8,000 fighters.
Levy listed a series of measures Israel's military has taken to minimize harm to non-combatants.
He said Hamas bore full moral responsibility for the war it started and was ""waging from inside and underneath hospitals, schools, mosques, homes and UN facilities"", Levy said.
He added, without elaborating, that South Africa was complicit in Hamas' crimes against Israelis.
Hamas denies using Gaza's population as human shields.

OXUVNF3FV4-42,Israel to withdraw thousands of troops from Gaza Strip,Namita Singh,"January 2, 2024 at 10:49 AM·3 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-withdraws-thousands-troops-gaza-091007308.html,"Israel says it will begin pulling thousands of troops out of Gaza this week, indicating a shift to more targeted operations against Hamas.
An Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) official said toppling the Islamist faction remained an objective of the offensive in the Palestinian enclave, and that some of the five brigades withdrawn will prepare for a possible flare-up of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The US welcomed the troop pullback, calling it the start of a shift to lower-intensity operations in the north of the Palestinian enclave.
“This appears to be the start of the gradual shift to lower-intensity operations in the north that we have been encouraging,” a White House official said, noting that the change reflected the success of the Israeli military in dismantling Hamas’ military capabilities there.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who has repeatedly urged Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians, is expected in the region next week.
It came as foreign secretary Lord Cameron spoke to Blinken on Tuesday about attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
“The foreign secretary and secretary of state discussed the international communit’s shared condemnation of the illegal and unjustified attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi militants. They made clear that the UK and US will work with our partners to hold the Houthis accountable for these unlawful seizures and attacks,” a statement said.
Meanwhile, 87 tonnes of aid sent by Britain and Cyprus has arrived in Egypt and is ready for transfer into Gaza. The delivery to Port Said comes as both nations try to establish a regular corridor for humanitarian deliveries.
The Israeli army’s chief spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, did not say whether the withdrawal of some troops reflected a new phase of the war.
“The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,” he told reporters late on Sunday. But the move is in line with the plans that Israeli leaders have outlined for a low-intensity campaign, expected to last for much of the year, that focuses on remaining Hamas strongholds and “pockets of resistance”.
Even as Israel pulled tanks out of some cities in Gaza, fighting still raged elsewhere in the Palestinian enclave amid intense bombardment, said residents, with IDF aircraft and tanks stepping up strikes in southern Gaza overnight, including eastern and northern areas of Khan Younis.
The US has kept up its support for Israel while expressing concern over the growing casualty toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Mr Biden earlier spoke with Mr Netanyahu about Israel’s objectives and the phasing of its military operations in Gaza on 23 December, while underscoring the need to protect civilians and secure the release of hostages being held by the Hamas Islamist militant group, the White House said.
Israel says the war in Gaza, which has reduced much of the territory to rubble, killing thousands and plunging its 2.3 million people into a humanitarian disaster, has many months to go.
The Gaza war was triggered by a surprise Hamas attack on Israeli towns on 7 October that Israel says killed 1,200 people. Palestinian health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say Israel’s offensive there has killed more than 21,978 people and wounded many thousands more.

Roi Yifrach, a 35-year-old from Tel Aviv, took advantage of the chaotic situation in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack to join combat operations and steal large amounts of military gear, including weapons, munitions and sensitive communications equipment, The Associated Press reported, citing an indictment filed on Sunday.
Yifrach went to southern Israel and presented himself alternately as a combat soldier from elite anti-terrorism units, a bomb dispersal expert and a member of the Shin Bet internal security service, the indictment said.
He even appeared in an image alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during one of the Israeli leader’s visits to troops in the field, the AP added, citing Israeli media.

However, Eitan Sabag, Yifrach’s lawyer, told Israel’s Channel 12 TV that Yifrach went down to the south to help as a paramedic with a first responder organization and fought bravely to defend Israel for more than two months.

""Absurdly, the State of Israel, which failed to protect its citizens, is now going after a citizen, my client, who volunteered for Israel.""
The indictment said Yifrach was in Gaza for several weeks and stole equipment including an assault rifle, 14 stun grenades, a drone, three detonators and other items, The Times of Israel also reported.
Authorities were tipped off and found the equipment in Yifrach’s house, his mother’s house and in his car, according to The Times of Israel.

But the response to that backlash was telling: It was the overhaul that led to disunity and the war, a growing number of critics are saying. As chief military spokesman Daniel Hagari put it, the sense that Israel was divided and weakened over the court plan may have played a role in Hamas’ decision to attack in October.
The chorus of voices that’s seizing on the link between the war and the populist attempt to weaken the judiciary reflects a growing and intense set of constraints on Netanyahu — military, diplomatic, budgetary and judicial — as he begins his second year presiding over the most right-wing and religious coalition in Israel’s history.
Whether his government will survive 2024 is a renewed topic of debate that will now play out against the backdrop of Israel’s worst armed conflict in half a century.
“There is a real dissonance between his control of parliament and the strong mistrust by the public — and it’s a dissonance I don’t think can last,” said Amichai Cohen, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a liberal think tank.
Others argue that as long as he keeps his coalition partners happy with budgetary largesse, Netanyahu will remain in office. At the same time, critics that include the central bank are calling for fiscal adjustments such as spending cutbacks to get a grip on Israel’s growing debt burden.
Gaza, Economy
There are many factors at work as Netanyahu plots his way through the upheaval.
Hours before the high court’s ruling, the military said it was pulling thousands of troops from Gaza as it starts moving toward a more targeted phase of combat. It’s doing so, by all accounts, due to US pressure to reduce casualties and start planning for the day after in Gaza.
It also needs to return reservists to their day jobs, filling a void that’s paralyzed swathes of what had been one of the most dynamic high-tech economies in the world. Apart from its sheer human toll, the war will come at a price to the budget that the central bank estimates at around 210 billion shekels ($58 billion).
In addition, next week South Africa is taking Israel to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel rejects this as a blood libel, a centuries-old antisemitic slur, and plans a vigorous defense, according to the prime minister’s office.
But officials say that’s another reason to downgrade the war just now — pictures of 2,000-pound bombs exploding over civilian areas won’t help Israel’s case.
Attack and Aftermath
The war began on Oct. 7 when several thousand Hamas operatives infiltrated Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 and kidnapping another 240. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza and freeing them is one of the war’s aims.
Israel’s counter-attack has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. Much of the enclave’s north has been reduced to rubble and the United Nations says disease and hunger are spreading.
Israel says it’s destroyed a great deal of Hamas military infrastructure and killed 8,000 militants. Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the US and the European Union.
For many in Netanyahu’s coalition, this is no time to yield to international demands and reduce the war’s pace.
Danny Danon, a senior Likud lawmaker, spoke for others on Monday when he accused the prime minister of “bowing down in the face of American pressure.” The far-right coalition members are even more adamant and speak publicly about moving nearly all of Gaza’s 2.2 million inhabitants to other countries.
That isn’t the government’s policy — although what it plans to do with the hundreds of thousands of homeless remains unclear.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due in Israel on Friday with the goal of helping the government move fully to its next and more targeted phase of the war. He will also listen to Israel’s emerging plan to use local Gazan leaders as temporary administrators for aid and rebuilding purposes.
Israel is intent on uprooting Hamas and not handing over the keys to the Palestinian Authority, which remains the US’s preferred route.
Government Reboot
As the war shifts in coming weeks, it’s widely expected that Benny Gantz, an opposition leader who joined the emergency war cabinet, will leave the government along with his close colleagues.
Since Netanyahu is widely held responsible for the security breach that led to the Oct. 7 attack, some argue that the clock will begin ticking for new elections. Gantz is leading all polls for prime minister.
“Within weeks of Gantz leaving, the public will start to protest and call for the government to go,” Cohen, the Israel Democracy Institute fellow, said.
The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth points out that in none of the nearly 100 recent polls from March 16 has the governing coalition been projected to win a majority.
But Yoel Esteron, founder and publisher of the business daily Calcalist, says this lack of popularity only makes Netanyahu “more desperate and more dangerous.”
Grip on Power
“He’ll cling to his seat of power and do everything he can to avoid going to elections,” Esteron said.
Once Gantz leaves, the old coalition will move back in, with its 64-member majority of the 120-seat Knesset and three years still to go. Five of its members would have to bolt for the government to fall.
No one is counting on Netanyahu to leave voluntarily, as then Prime Minister Golda Meir did in 1974 after the intelligence failure that led to the 1973 Middle East war.
Netanyahu doesn’t blame himself for Oct. 7, saying the entire security establishment believed Hamas had been deterred and wouldn’t dare try to strike in the way it did.
Other factors could also interfere, notably tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Low-level fighting continues there, and one reason some brigades are leaving Gaza is to ready them to be moved north later this year if the Lebanon front explodes. US special envoy Amos Hochstein is due in Israel on Thursday to seek a diplomatic solution.
On Tuesday, a top Hamas official, Saleh Al-Arouri, was killed in an explosion in Beirut widely assumed to be an Israeli attack. This seems likely to complicate Hochstein’s mission.
Merav Michaeli, who leads the opposition Labor Party, told reporters on Tuesday that Netanyahu’s difficulties are “huge and dire.” She added, “That said, it doesn’t mean that his political abilities and his determination to stay in power can’t keep him prime minister.”

The impact of the missile fragments resulted in a concussion for Yuna, leading to a loss of coordination. Video footage shows the lioness struggling to get up, prompting vets to swiftly prescribe treatment.
Natalya Popova, head of HAU, revealed to NV's sister publication Ukrainska Pravda.Zhyttia (Life) that the two-year-old African lioness was the only animal outdoors during the attack. The bright flash, fire, and smoke from the missile could have caused Yuna's concussion, as surveillance camera records indicate she wasn't directly hit. No trees separated the field where the fragments fell from Yuna's enclosure.
Yuna was rescued from Kyiv Oblast, where she lived in a small enclosure with a male lion that bullied her, Popova said. The living conditions were stressful, and the animals suffered frostbite from living on concrete during Ukrainian winters, conditions not suitable for African lions.

TUZLP1JNNT-51,Russian oil tankers bound for India are turning around amid scuffle over payments to Moscow,Jennifer Sor,"January 3, 2024 at 6:40 AM·2 min read",20240102,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-oil-tankers-bound-india-224018330.html,"Russian oil tankers are turning away from India amid disagreements over payment.
The tankers had been hovering near the shores of India and Sri Lanka for about a month.
India is paying for Russian oil in UAE currency, but one major supplier has been unable to accept payment.
Russian oil ships drifting near India's shores have begun to turn away amid unresolved payment disputes between the two countries.
According to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg, five oil tankers carrying Sokol oil, which have been idling close to India and Sri Lanka for about a month, are now headed eastward toward the Malacca Straight.
Another Russian ship — the NS Century — is still drifting near the shores of Sri Lanka. The tanker has been idling for over a month as Indian officials mull over whether to let the ship unload its cargo, Bloomberg previously reported.
The turnaround comes as Indian refiners are paying for oil with Russia in dirhams, the currency of the United Arab Emirates, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. But a unit of Rosneft, one of Russia's state-run oil giants, hasn't been able to open a bank account in the UAE, meaning it's unable to accept payment, sources added.
As of October, India had at least seven oil shipments from Russia that hadn't been paid, Reuters originally reported.
India is also under pressure to remain on good terms with the US, which sanctioned the NS Century late in 2023 for trading oil with Russia above the $60 per barrel price cap. Those restrictions are part of the West's attempt to ramp up pressure on Russia's energy revenue that it is using to fund its war against Ukraine.
India has become one of Russia's largest oil customers since the invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Russia now exports nearly all of its oil to China and India, Russia's deputy prime minister said last week – though shipments to India have recently stalled on payment issues. Russian oil exports in India cratered in December, with Indian refiners receiving no Sokol crude that month at all, according to Kpler data cited by Bloomberg.

Details: ""We have promptly fixed the operation of the necessary equipment, within just a few hours, and most consumers in Kyiv and the surrounding areas have uninterrupted power supply. The city's water supply systems have also been resumed,"" said Kudrytskyi.
The official noted that a range of Ukrenergo and regional power distribution companies' facilities in Kyiv Oblast had been hit, resulting in some interruptions in power supply.
However, the Ukrenergo CEO stressed that this attack had failed to pose a critical threat to the operation of the power system regardless of the damage and challenges.
""I have recently visited one of the affected power facilities myself. The equipment is already in operation, and I think that if any of the consumers in Kyiv Oblast and the city of Kyiv still do not have the power supply, it will be a matter of just a few hours before it is resumed,"" Kudrytskyi explained.

P387V4B2QG-53,Senior Hamas leader killed in reported Israeli attack in Beirut,Brad Dress,"January 3, 2024 at 1:11 AM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/senior-hamas-leader-killed-reported-171152493.html,"Israel on Tuesday bombed a building in Beirut and killed a top Hamas official, according to Lebanese news channels.
The alleged assassination killed Saleh al-Arouri, who was the deputy chief of the political bureau for Hamas in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.
Lebanese state media reported four people were killed in a drone strike in southern Beirut.
The reported bombing would mark the boldest attack in Lebanon yet from Israel, which has traded fire with Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah since war broke out with Hamas in early October.
The tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Hezbollah have been deadly, but have largely taken place over the border in skirmishes and artillery fire.
But Israel says it is fighting a multi-arena war against Iranian-backed enemies. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are supported by Iran.
Israeli soldiers also carried out a strike in Syria in late December that killed a top Iranian general.
Palestinian militants have vowed to avenge al-Arouri’s death. Hamas official Izzat Al-Rishq called the alleged bombing a “cowardly assassination” that “will not succeed in breaking the will and resilience of our people, or in undermining the continuity of its valiant resistance.”
“They prove once again the utter failure of this enemy in achieving any of its aggressive objectives in the Gaza Strip,” he said in a statement shared on an Iranian-backed Telegram channel.
Israel has not publicly commented on the alleged strike, which killed the highest-ranking Hamas official since the war began nearly three months ago.
al-Arouri joined the politburo, or main decision-making body of Hamas, in 2010. He was appointed to be deputy chairman of the body in October 2017 and was the leader of the Hamas movement in the West Bank, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations. He was also a founder of Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.
He was involved in several high-level discussions in recent years, including the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011 in return for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners.
Israel has vowed to completely destroy Hamas in retaliation for a deadly Oct. 7 attack that killed more than 1,200 people. Some 240 hostages were also taken by Hamas fighters, with 129 still left in the Gaza strip.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the mission includes not just dismantling the military infrastructure of Hamas, but also taking out is top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, and Mohammed Deif, the head of the group’s military wing.

XJURNOL04A-54,"Shipping giant Maersk pauses Red Sea transit after attack, raising inflation fears: Updates","John Bacon, Jorge L. Ortiz and Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY","Updated January 3, 2024 at 10:49 PM·8 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-world-war-iii-hamas-142140720.html,"Editor's Note: For the latest on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.
Shipping giant Maersk said its vessels will stop sailing on the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden “until further notice” after one of its cargo ships was attacked by Houthi militants from Yemen over the weekend.
An extended pause in the Danish company’s operations in the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean Sea by the Suez Canal in the shortest maritime route between Europe and Asia, could increase the cost of delivering goods and possibly drive up inflation.
“An investigation into the incident is ongoing and we will continue to pause all cargo movement through the area while we further assess the constantly evolving situation,” Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, said in a statement Tuesday.
Germany's Hapag-Lloyd, a Maersk competitor, said it would also avoid the key shipping lane at least until Jan. 9 for security reasons, Reuters reported.
Houthi rebels have launched tens of drone and missile assaults on ships in the area since November, purportedly because they have links to Israel. The container ship Maersk Hangzhou was initially hit by a missile Saturday, then fired upon hours later by four boats in an attempted boarding.
Helicopters from two U.S. ships responded to a distress call, sinking three of the boats and driving away the fourth, the U.S. Central Command said.
Israel plan scuttled:  Court nixes key part of Netanyahu judicial reform amid troop pullout
Developments:
∎ The U.S. State Department issued a statement Tuesday condemning the ""inflammatory and irresponsible'' comments by two far-right Israeli officials − Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir − who recently advocated for Palestinians to leave Gaza.
∎ Secretary of State Antony Blinken has delayed his latest trip to Israel by a few days to early next week, the Times of Israel reported.
∎ The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford will leave the Middle East and return to its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, in the ""coming days,"" the Navy says. President Joe Biden ordered the ship to the Mediterranean Sea the day after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel. The amphibious assault vessel USS Bataan and accompanying warships will take the place of the carrier.
∎ Palestinian health workers were vaccinating children in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah after UNICEF said it delivered at least 600,000 doses of vaccines. UNICEF estimated that over 16,600 infants have missed one or more routine vaccinations because of fighting and evacuations.
∎ Heavy fighting was reported Tuesday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was withdrawing thousands of troops but would continue fighting until Hamas was eliminated.
∎ A majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have fled to the southern part of the region since the start of the war. More than 21,900 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead. In Israel, about 1,200 people have been killed, with around 240 people taken hostage.
∎ Following an Israeli drone strike in Lebanon that killed a senior Hamas leader, protests broke out Tuesday in Ramallah in the West Bank. Palestinians marched through streets after numerous factions called for protests in response to the strike, NBC News reported.
Saleh al-Arouri, top Hamas leader,  reportedly killed in Israel strike
Saleh al-Arouri, deputy leader of the Hamas military wing, was among six people killed in an Israeli drone strike in Lebanon, according to multiple reports from the region. The attack in the suburbs of Beirut would mark a major escalation in the Israeli-Hamas war. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly vowed to retaliate against any Israeli effort to target Palestinian leaders in Lebanon. The Biden administration has been laboring to keep the war in Gaza from spreading into Lebanon and across the Middle East.
The strike targeted an office belonging to Hamas in Mushrifiyah in the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital, the Jerusalem Post reported. Arouri, the highest-ranking Hamas figure killed in the war so far, reportedly was a prime target for Israel because of his alleged role in organizing terror attacks in the West Bank.
Speaking to reporters, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not directly mention Arouri’s death but said, “We are focused and remain focused on fighting against Hamas.” And Israeli lawmaker Danny Danon congratulated Israeli security forces in a social media post for killing Arouri, adding, ""Anyone who was involved in the (Oct. 7) massacre should know that we will reach out to them and close an account with them.""
Arouri spent many years in Israeli prisons before being released in a 2010 swap. In October, Israeli forces demolished his home near Ramallah. The U.S. government has designated him as a “global terrorist.""
Survivors of the massacre by Hamas-led militants at a rave concert Oct. 7 have filed a $56 million lawsuit against Israel’s security forces, accusing them of negligence and claiming the deadly rampage could have been averted.
The 42 plaintiffs allege the Shin Bet security service, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Israel Police and the Defense Ministry failed in their duties. Haaretz has reported that top defense officials held urgent meetings Oct. 6 to discuss a possible Hamas attack. The next day militants crashed across the border from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages.
“A single phone call by IDF officials to the commander responsible for the party to disperse it immediately in view of the expected danger would have saved lives and prevented the physical and mental injuries of hundreds of partygoers, including the plaintiffs,” the lawsuit claims. “The negligence and the gross oversight is beyond belief.”
Israel is “at the height of World War III against Iran and radical Islam,” Israel's new foreign minister said Tuesday at a Jerusalem ceremony marking his ascension to the post. Israel Katz said his top priority is bringing home the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Katz wrote on social media that ""my message to the (foreign ministry) employees was succinct. ... Order of priority: hostages, hostages, hostages. This is our commitment to the people and families.""
Katz also emphasized the importance of gaining global support for the war with Hamas that started after the militants' brutal border attacks on Oct. 7, pledging that “we will achieve our goal of toppling Hamas.”
On Tuesday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made it clear the war will continue for a long time, even if the Israeli military plans to reduce the number of its troops in Gaza by several thousand as it enters a lower-intensity phase in the conflict.
“The feeling that we will stop soon is incorrect,” Gallant said. “Without a clear victory, we will not be able to live in the Middle East.”
Israeli spokesman Eylon Levy said Israel will go before the U.N.'s International Court of Justice to challenge South Africa's ""absurd"" claim accusing Israel of genocide. Levy chastised South Africa for providing ""political and legal cover"" to Hamas for the attack on Israel Oct. 7.
In a televised address, Hamas supreme leader Ismail Haniyeh thanked South Africa for bringing forth the case and rejected the Israeli and U.S. demands that Hamas not be part of Gaza's future as ""mere illusions.''
“We are the ones who decide our present and future,” Haniyeh said.
A high-ranking Hamas political leader dismissed a New York Times report accusing militants of sexual assaults against Israeli women during the Oct. 7 attacks. Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, accused the Times and other Western media of being biased to ""what the Israeli propaganda says"" and against the Palestinians and their resistance to Israeli occupation.
USA TODAY has also published a report chronicling similar claims against the militants. The Times report was based on a two-month investigation it said showed ""the attacks against women were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern"" of violence targeting women on Oct. 7.
""We ask the New York Times to revise such misleading report, and to distance itself from the Israeli propaganda and to preserve its professionalism and reputation,"" Naim said.
The Israeli military has seized the primary Hamas intelligence and control stronghold in Gaza City, military officials said Tuesday. The ""Mizrachi Outpost,"" which included operations rooms to manage the fighting in the entire Gaza Strip, was spread over 37 buildings near residential structures, schools and hospitals, the Israeli military said in a statement. A network of tunnels and an underground control bunker on the site held long-term living spaces used by Hamas military commanders and an armory of weapons, the statement said.
""All the terrorists were eliminated,"" the statement said. ""The 601st Engineering Battalion and the Yalam unit destroyed the entire route of the tunnels.""
The Israeli military said it seized long-range rockets inside a family home in central Gaza and that dozens of rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons were found in civilian buildings nearby. The rockets were destroyed and the weapons were confiscated, the Israeli military said in a statement that included photos and videos of the weaponry. Israeli officials have defended their assault on Gaza − which has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians − by saying Hamas militants use civilians as human shields.
""We are here in a house of a family that lives up here with a living room, a kitchen and a children's room and a first floor − a military warehouse,"" the statement said. ""You can see here this beehive of more long-range rockets, mortars and other equipment that was used against our forces.""

PSVR724S4V-55,Somalia rejects port deal between Ethiopia and Somaliland,Abdi Sheikh and Abdiqani Hassan,"Updated January 2, 2024 at 5:30 AM·2 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/somalias-cabinet-calls-emergency-meet-062845562.html,"By Abdi Sheikh and Abdiqani Hassan
MOGADISHU (Reuters) -Somalia on Tuesday rejected a pact its breakaway region of Somaliland signed with Ethiopia allowing it to use a major port with access to the Red Sea in return for recognition as an independent state, saying the agreement had no legal force.
Somalia, which views Somaliland as part of its territory, also summoned its ambassador to Ethiopia for deliberations over the agreement signed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Somaliland leader Muse Bihi Abdi on Monday.
The agreement would allow landlocked Ethiopia, which relies on neighbouring Djibouti for most of its maritime trade, to lease 20 km around the port of Berbera, which lies on the Gulf of Aden with access to the Red Sea, for 50 years for its navy and commercial purposes.
In exchange Somaliland's leader said Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland as an independent nation, becoming the first country to do so.
Abiy's stated ambition to secure access to the Red Sea is a source of tension between Ethiopia and its neighbours and has raised concerns of a fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa.
In October, Abiy said Ethiopia's existence was ""tied to the Red Sea,"" adding that ""if we (countries in the Horn of Africa) plan to live together in peace, we have to find a way to mutually share with each other in a balanced manner"".
Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said in parliament that ""no one has the power give away a piece of Somalia"" after an emergency cabinet meeting that said the deal between Ethiopia and Somaliland was ""an open interference with Somalia's sovereignty, freedom and unity"" and ""null and void"".
Mohamud also said: ""Somaliland, you are the northern regions of Somalia and Ethiopia has no recognition for you. If Ethiopia claimed it gave you recognition, then it is not a recognition that exists.""
Abiy's national security adviser has said Ethiopia will offer Somaliland a stake in state-owned Ethiopian Airlines in return for giving it access to the Red Sea. It is not clear how large a stake.
Billene Seyoum, spokesperson at Abiy's office, Meles Alem, spokesperson at Ethiopia's foreign affairs ministry, and Legesse Tulu, the Ethiopian government spokesperson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Somaliland has not gained widespread international recognition, despite declaring autonomy from Somalia in 1991.
Last week the Somali National News Agency said Somalia and Somaliland had agreed to restart talks to resolve their disputes, following mediation efforts led by Djibouti.
Somaliland's interior minister Mohamed Kahin told reporters on Tuesday that Somaliland could never accept the position taken by Somalia on the deal with Ethiopia. ""We ask Somalia to apologise for its claim that Somaliland is part of Somalia,"" Kahin told a news conference.

Lee, the chief of the main opposition Democratic Party, is conscious and was airlifted to the Pusan National University Hospital, a party official and a fire department official told Reuters. He was attacked by an unidentified man during a tour of the site of a proposed airport, Yonhap reported.
The attack left a gash in Lee's neck that is about 1 cm long, according to YTN television.
The suspected attacker appeared to be a man in his 50s or 60s who wore a paper crown with Lee's name printed on it, news photographs showed. He approached Lee asking for an autograph among a crowd of supporters before he lunged forward and attacked, video footage showed. The assailant was quickly subdued and arrested at the scene.

The assailant was refusing to answer police questions about his motives, the daily Busan Ilbo reported.

Video clips aired on YTN television and social media showed the attack in which a man was seen lunging at Lee with his arm stretched out, followed by Lee grimacing and collapsing to the ground.
News photographs showed Lee lying on the ground with his eyes closed and other people pressing a handkerchief against the side of his neck.
About two dozen police officers were responding at the scene.
President Yoon Suk Yeol condemned the attack, calling it unacceptable, according to his office. The president expressed deep concern for Lee and asked for him to receive the best care, so he could make a speedy recovery.
Lee, a former governor of Gyeonggi province, narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to the conservative Yoon, a former chief prosecutor. Lee has led the main opposition party since August 2022.

South Korea's next parliamentary elections are scheduled for April.
Despite strict restrictions on gun possession, South Korea has a history of political violence involving other weapons.
Lee's predecessor, Song Young-gil, was attacked in 2022 at a public event by an attacker who swung a blunt object against his head and caused a laceration.
Then-conservative opposition party leader Park Geun-hye, who later served as president, was attacked with a knife at an event in 2006 and suffered a gash on her face that required surgery.
In 2015, then-U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was attacked by an assailant and suffered a large gash on his face while attending a public event.

QZC14B55G7-57,South Korea’s opposition leader stabbed in neck by man posing as autograph-hunter,Our Foreign Staff,"January 1, 2024 at 10:36 PM·5 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-opposition-leader-stabbed-020057153.html,"The South Korean opposition leader is recovering in intensive care after being stabbed in the neck by a man who approached for his autograph.
Lee Jae-myung, of the Democratic Party, was attacked on Tuesday by an assailant who wore a paper hat with the politician’s surname and lurched at him with an 18cm-knife.
Mr Lee, 59, was talking to reporters at the construction site of a new airport in Busan city’s Gadeok island.
Disturbing footage of the attack showed Mr Lee in the centre of a jostling crowd of reporters holding digital recorders and television cameras.
A man wearing a bright blue paper crown asked him for an autograph before lunging forward and stabbing an object into his neck.
Mr Lee stumbled backwards as bystanders screamed.
Footage shows Mr Lee with his eyes closed and bleeding heavily with aides pressing a handkerchief to his neck.
He was  airlifted to the capital, Seoul, where he underwent two-hour surgery to repair a major blood vessel.
“It is fortunate that the damaged area is the jugular vein,” a hospital official told Yonhap, a Seoul news agency, adding that he could have immediately died at the scene if the wound had occurred on the carotid artery.
Busan police said the assailant was born in 1957 and used a knife that had been bought online. No further details about the attacker have been released and police have launched an investigation.
Yoon Suk Yeol, the president, said: “This type of violence must never be tolerated under any circumstances.”
With South Korea’s election scheduled for April, Kwon Chil-seung, the Democratic Party spokesman, condemned the attack as “political terror”.
Mr Lee narrowly lost the presidential election in 2022 and has widely criticised the political atmosphere in the country, last year undertaking a hunger strike against what he described as the Yoon government’s “incompetent and violent” policies.
Mr Lee is on trial for bribery charges, which he denies, in connection to a firm that is suspected of illicitly transferring $8 million (£6m) to North Korea.
He is also accused of breaching his duties, allegedly resulting in the loss of $20 billion won for a company owned by Seongnam city during his term as its mayor.
Mr Lee has denied all allegations against him.
Political violence in the country is not uncommon, particularly as leaders are not heavily guarded. Lee’s predecessor, Song Young-gil, was hurt in 2022 by an assailant who swung a blunt object against his head.
Political analysts say that tensions could rise owing to uncertainties about the future of the region with a “ripple effect” across the Korean Peninsula as elections get under way in Taiwan, Japan and the US.
Kim Heung-kyu, a director of the US-China Policy Institute at Ajou University, said: “There is a growing presence of
uncertainties in both diplomatic and security aspects.
“This heightened uncertainty raises concerns about potential ripple effects on the Korean Peninsula, particularly if the Taiwan issue is mishandled amid the two ongoing wars.”
Police identified the suspect as a man in his 60s and surnamed Kim. He used an 18cm-long knife purchased online for the attack.
The Busan Metropolitan Police Agency said it plans to charge the perpetrator with attempted murder, as he has confessed to intending to kill Mr Lee.
“An investigation is under way for matters such as the exact motive,” Soh Je-han, an officer at the agency, told a press briefing.
President Yoon Suk Yeol expressed deep concern over Mr Lee’s safety, and ordered the police and authorities to swiftly determine the facts, according to his spokesperson Kim Soo-kyung.
President Yoon also stressed that such violence should never be tolerated under any circumstances, Ms Kim said.
The assault comes just four months before April general elections, which will be bitterly contested between Mr Lee’s opposition Democratic Party and the People Power Party of President Yoon.
The election will be crucial in determining whether President Yoon can put through his policy goals as he enters the third year of a five-year presidency, and will be set amid the often febrile atmosphere of South Korean politics.
The Democratic Party condemned the attack on Mr Lee as an act of terror and a threat to democracy.
Mr Lee, who hails from a farming family, worked in a factory while pursuing a career as a human rights lawyer and was Mr Yoon’s main rival in the presidential election in 2022.
The former governor of Gyeonggi province is expected to run for president again in 2027, and recent polls suggest he remains popular. However, his political record has been overshadowed by a string of scandals and accusations of corruption and he is facing trial for alleged bribery in connection with a development project when he was mayor of Seongnam, near Seoul. Mr Lee denies any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “fiction” and a “political conspiracy”.
News of the attack has shocked South Korea. Although the East Asian nation has low crime rates, South Koreans were alarmed by a surge of random mass knife attacks last summer.
Assaults on high-profile figures are not unprecedented. In 2015 Mark Lippert, the former US ambassador, was stabbed during a breakfast function in a Seoul hotel, leaving him with injuries requiring 80 stitches in his face.
South Korea has tight gun restrictions but has a history of political violence using other weapons. Song Young-gil, Mr Lee’s predecessor, was attacked in 2022 by an assailant who inflicted a laceration on his head with a blunt object.
In 2006, then conservative opposition party leader Park Geun-hye, who later became president, suffered a knife attack that required surgery on her face.

NTZI665VQW-58,Top Hamas official killed in Beirut blast,The Associated Press,"January 3, 2024 at 2:20 AM·1 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/top-hamas-official-killed-beirut-182007989.html,"BEIRUT (AP) — An explosion in Beirut on Tuesday killed Saleh Arouri, a top official with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and three others, officials with Hamas and the Lebanese group Hezbollah said.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast killed four people and was carried out by an Israeli drone. Israeli officials declined to comment.
If Israel is behind the attack it could mark a major escalation in the Middle East conflict. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to retaliate against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon.
Hamas official Bassem Naim confirmed to The Associated Press that Arouri was killed in the blast. A Hezbollah official speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations also said Arouri was killed.
Trailblazing Texan Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson dies at 88
Arouri, one of the founders of Hamas’ military wing, had headed the group’s presence in the West Bank. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him even before the Hamas-Israel war began on Oct. 7.
The explosion shook Musharafieh, one of the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, which are a stronghold of the militant Hezbollah group, which is an ally of Hamas. The explosion caused fire in Hadi Nasrallah street south of Beirut.
The explosion came during more than two months of heavy exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and members of Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border.
Since the fighting began on Oct. 8, the fighting has been concentrated a few miles (kilometers) from the border but on several occasions Israel’s air force hit Hezbollah targets deeper in Lebanon.
Earlier in the day, Hezbollah said its fighters carried out several attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border targeting Israeli military posts.

The development is the latest escalation in tensions between the two countries during the Israel-Hamas war and comes about a week after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.
""We will never allow espionage activities carried out against the national unity and solidarity of our country,"" Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya wrote on X, adding that officials in Turkey ""determined that the Israeli Intelligence Service aimed to carry out tactical tasks such as reconnaissance, pursuit, assault, and kidnapping against foreign nationals residing in our country.""
""During the searches carried out during the operation; 143,830 euros, 23,680 dollars, various amounts of cash from different countries, 1 unlicensed gun, a large number of cartridges and digital materials were seized,"" Yerlikaya also said.

Ronen Bar, who leads Israel’s Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, reportedly said in a recording aired by Israel’s public broadcaster Kan in early December that Israel would hunt down Hamas terrorists in countries such as Turkey.
""We will do this everywhere, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar. It will take a few years, but we will be there to do it,"" Reuters quoted him as saying.
However, the next day, the Jerusalem Post quoted a Turkish intelligence official saying that following the airing of Bar’s remarks, ""Necessary warnings were made to the interlocutors based on the news of Israeli officials' statements, and it was expressed to Israel that [such an act] would have serious consequences.""

The raids came just weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of ""serious consequences"" should Israel try to target figures from Palestinian militant group Hamas living or working in Turkey.
Turkey does not view Hamas as a terrorist organisation and has hosted the Islamic group's political leaders for much of the past decade.
A Turkish security source told AFP that most of the 34 people detained were foreign nationals whom Mossad recruited for ""operations targeting Palestinians and their family members"".
""We are determined to ensure that absolutely no foreign intelligence agency can operate on Turkish soil without proper authorisation,"" the security source said.
Turkish government released video footage showing armed security service agents breaking down doors and handcuffing suspects in their homes.
The Istanbul public prosecutor's office said 12 additional suspects remained at large.
""There is an insidious operation and sabotage attempts being made against Turkey and its interests,"" Erdogan said after the raids were announced.
- Breakdown in ties -
Relations between Turkey and Israel imploded following the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly three months ago.
Erdogan has turned into one of the world's harshest critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Turkish leader last week compared Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and demanded that Israel's Western allies drop their support for the ""terrorism"" being conducted by Israeli troops in Gaza.
Erdogan has also recalled Ankara's envoy to Tel Aviv, and pushed for the trial of Israeli commanders and political leaders at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
The president's ruling Islamic, conservative AKP party also led tens of thousands of protesters out on the streets of Istanbul on Monday for one of Turkey's biggest rallies against the Israeli government of the entire war.
The war in Gaza has put an end to a gradual thawing in Turkish-Israeli relations that culminated with the reappointment of ambassadors in 2022.
Israel and Turkey resumed long-stalled talks about a major Mediterranean Sea natural gas pipeline project that could have reshaped geopolitical alliances across parts of the Middle East.
Turkey won words of gratitude from Israel in 2022 for detaining a group of Turkish and Iranian nationals were allegedly planning to murder and kidnap Israeli tourists in Istanbul.
Erdogan and Netanyahu met briefly on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York in September and were discussing holding a formal summit this year.
- Periodic raids -
The Turkish MIT intelligence service conducts periodic raids against suspected Israel operatives working in major cities such as Ankara and Istanbul.
Most are accused of conducting surveillance work on Palestinians living in Turkey.
Istanbul served as one of Hamas's foreign political offices until the outbreak of the Gaza war.
Turkey informally asked Hamas leaders to leave, days after militants conducted raids into southern Israel on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people -- most of them civilians -- according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The Islamists also took around 250 people hostage. Israeli officials believe more than half of them remain in Gaza.
The Gaza health ministry says Israel's relentless military campaign targeting Hamas has killed around 22,000 people in Gaza since October 7 -- mostly women and children.
UN agencies have voiced alarm over a spiralling humanitarian crisis facing Gaza's 2.4 million people.
Most have seen their homes destroyed and now face dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine, and are surviving in tents and shelters amid the rubble.

While some celebrated with their friends and family far from the front line, Ukrainian soldiers sought a few moments of quiet celebration in the country's east and south.
President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation in the minutes leading up to midnight, expressing gratitude to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and civil society for their exceptional sacrifices in the ongoing struggle against Russian aggression.
New Year's Eve and the early hours of New Year's Day unleashed another wave of Russian aggression against Ukrainian cities. Russia launched 90 Shahed drones against Ukraine overnight, 87 of which Ukrainian air defense successfully intercepted, according to the Air Force.
The determination of Ukraine's Armed Forces to safeguard the nation's people, sovereignty, and commitment to freedom was emphasized once again as Ukraine entered into yet another year of war in 2024.

Naumkin, a resident of Mariupol, was among the 31 children deported to Russia in May 2022 under the disguise of sending them for rehabilitation to the Polyany boarding house in Moscow Oblast. They are known as “Group 31.”
The Kyiv Independent has learned about the teenager’s rescue from Daria Kasianova, the head of the board at the Ukrainian Child Rights Network. The organization worked on bringing back Naumkin along with Ukraine’s Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories and the teenager’s lawyer, Kateryna Bobrovska.
The Ukrainian authorities have identified over 19,000 Ukrainian children who have been illegally deported to Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Only 387 children have been brought back so far, according to the national database Children of War.
After the so-called “rehabilitation” in Russia, part of the children from ""Group 31"" were put into the custody of Russian families in Moscow Oblast. The rest, including Naumkin, were placed into Russian state care institutions. Naumkin also studied in a Russian vocational school.
The Kyiv Independent reconstructed the deportation of the “Group 31” in an investigative documentary, “Uprooted.” The film revealed that Russia’s collaborators organized the Ukrainian children’s displacement from occupied Donetsk to Russia in May 2022.
Some of the group’s children were from the now-occupied Mariupol and its suburbs. During the Russian offensive operations aimed at capturing the city, the Russian military forcibly moved the children to Donetsk, placing them in local hospitals. They were later brought together with other Ukrainian children in the part of Donetsk Oblast occupied by Russia since 2014. Together, they were illegally deported to Russia.
Svitlana Maiboroda, a local resident who collaborated with Russia, was in charge of the children’s displacement, the Kyiv Independent’s investigation discovered. Maiboroda was the head of the local proxy agency in charge of children and family affairs installed by the Russian occupiers in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine put Maiboroda on the sanctions list on Nov. 18, 2023.
Naumkin is the sixth child of the “Group 31” who was brought back to Ukraine.
Earlier on Nov. 19, Naumkin’s friend Bohdan Yermokhin, another member of the group, returned to Ukraine.

Russia carried out another massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight on Jan. 1-2. All 35 drones were shot down in the first wave of the attack. Russia then launched several missiles, including aeroballistic Kinzhals missiles from MiG-31K warplanes, and cruise missiles from 16 Tu-95MS bombers during the second wave.
Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi disclosed that the air defense forces successfully destroyed 72 missiles, including ten Kinzhal aeroballistic missiles using the Patriot air defense system — marking a record achievement.

NB3TXLVGW3-66,What is behind Turkey's staunch support for Hamas in Gaza?,Ece Goksedef - BBC News,"January 2, 2024 at 11:50 PM·5 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/behind-turkeys-staunch-support-hamas-155059939.html,"On the first day of the year, tens of thousands of Turks poured on to the streets of Istanbul, chanting ""Murderer Israel, get out of Palestine"".
It was not the first massive pro-Palestinian rally in Turkey since the start of Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.
But Monday's mass protest followed incendiary remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Since he first came to power more than 20 years ago, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas.
But even by Mr Erdogan's standards, the rhetoric was extreme. What Israel's prime minister was doing in Gaza, he said, ""is not any less than what Hitler did"".
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying ""Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us"".
Mr Erdogan has made comparisons with Nazi Germany in the past, but the current war of words has put into sharp focus just how bitter Turkish-Israeli relations have become, just months after a significant upturn.
Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?
In the latest broadside against Israel, Turkey announced on Tuesday that it had detained 33 people suspected of working for Israeli intelligence service Mossad in raids across eight provinces.
The operation, carried out with Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, followed reports that Israel intended to hunt down members of Hamas abroad, including in Turkey.
Turkey has stepped up support for Gaza since 7 October, for example bringing dozens of patients from Gaza to Turkey for treatment. Turkey's health minister himself accompanied the casualties en route from Egypt.
When Hamas attacked Israel, Mr Erdogan used relatively measured language, urging both sides to remain calm. But as Israel's military response intensified, his rhetoric became increasingly fierce, calling Hamas ""freedom fighters"" and Israel's actions ""genocide"".
This hostility to Israel plays to President Erdogan's support base in Turkey, says Helin Sari Ertem, Associate Professor of International Relations at Istanbul Medeniyet University.
""Palestine has long been a cause for Turkey and the Turkish people, covering almost all political tendencies,"" she says. ""Consequently, it is not possible for Turkish governments to consider the Palestine-Israeli conflict only as a foreign policy issue; as it definitely is a game-changer in domestic politics.""
In the second half of the 20th Century, Israel and Turkey enjoyed close economic and strategic relationships. Turkey was also the first country in the region to formally recognise Israel after it was founded.
But it was not long after Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to office in 2002 that relations with Israel deteriorated while those with Hamas improved. In 2006, then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal visited Turkey following an invitation from Mr Erdogan. Hamas had by then been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US and the EU, amongst others.
The first diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey played out before a world audience when in 2009, Mr Erdogan stormed out of a meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos after a clash with Israel's then-President Shimon Peres over Israeli air strikes in Gaza.
The Turkish leader vowed to never go back to Davos - and he has not returned since.
But just a year later tensions reached breaking point when a ship, the Mavi Marmara, sailed from Istanbul to Gaza with volunteers and humanitarian aid to challenge Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.
When the Mavi Marmara refused to halt, Israeli commandos raided it in international waters and 10 Turkish citizens on board were killed in ensuing clashes. The incident led Turkey to suspend diplomatic relations with Israel for several years.
According to Ms Sari Ertem, Turkey's pivot away from Israel and towards the Palestinians is due to the conservative and pro-Islamic grassroots of Mr Erdogan's AKP party.
While Mr Erdogan's support for the Palestinians is sincere, she says it also aimed at calming down the conservative-nationalist political groups, which did not see sufficient reaction from the AKP in the first days of the war.
The head of the main opposition Republican People's Party in Turkey, Ozgur Ozel, called on the international community to act for Gaza, and the leader of the second biggest opposition party, Meral Aksener, has branded the Israeli prime minister a ""terrorist"".
However, this support for Hamas has come at a cost for Turkey.
Turkey's frayed relationship with Israel was restored only last year and then, within months of both countries reappointing their ambassadors, the war erupted. Turkey recalled its ambassador, and Israel's envoy returned out of security concerns.
Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based geopolitical risk consultancy, says President Erdogan is unlikely to change path.
""He has his domestic supporters and constituents, and he can't ignore such pressure coming from within Turkey and his base,"" Mr Cafiero argues.
He also says the president cannot ignore his desire to be considered as a strong Muslim leader.
""Erdogan is a respected head of state throughout the wider Islamic world, and he has regional and international supporters, too.""
Despite the rupture between the two countries, Ms Sarı Ertem believes it will not be too damaging.
""The anti-Israeli discourse, which becomes very much visible especially at times of serious civilian casualties caused by Israel on the Palestinian side, rarely disrupts the traditional Turkish foreign policy approach, which favours a balancing act,"" she says.
""It has always continued its relations with Israel at least economically, if not politically. Turkish-Israeli relations have proved to be quite resilient despite all the ups and downs during history.""

N914LMBPDP-67,What to make of Xi’s New Year threat to reunify Taiwan with China,Diego Mendoza,"January 2, 2024 at 9:03 AM·3 min read",20240102,https://news.yahoo.com/xi-threat-reunify-taiwan-china-150319411.html,"Insights from the Taiwan Research Hub, Tamkang University, and Tsinghua University
In his New Year address, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said that reunification with Taiwan is a “historical inevitability.”
“All Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” he said.
His comments on Taiwan — echoing similar remarks last year — raised alarms about the future of the self-governing island, particularly as voters head to the polls later this month.
But China watchers suggest that Xi has bigger problems ahead of him in 2024.
Beijing wants the China-friendly Kuomintang Party to regain control of Taiwan’s presidency, but Xi’s comments could backfire on those ambitions. “Xi may not have learned his lesson” after the 2020 re-election of President Tsai Ing-wen, which was largely considered a rebuke of the Chinese leader’s increasing aggression against Taiwan, wrote New Bloom Magazine editor Brian Hioe. Polls have shown that Taiwanese voters are willing to view China more favorably if Beijing ceased military aggression against Taipei, according to the University of Nottingham’s Taiwan Research Hub. But until then, many voters appear to favor candidates who will stand up to Xi’s rhetoric. Not many voters “ will choose to compromise or kneel down and surrender like the Kuomintang,” one commentator wrote for The News Lens in 2020.
Despite Xi’s warning, China watchers have suggested that he is too preoccupied with China’s economic viability to risk war. While Taiwan’s unification is an integral part of Xi’s broader mandate and there are some who want it done before 2027, it “is still a non-mainstream view” among Xi and his inner circle, argued Tamkang University’s Wang Bao last year. Rather, experts said that Beijing is expected to spend more time and effort on maintaining domestic stability, especially since the country’s worsening property crisis triggered a wave of protests in 2023. Beijing does not currently have the money to fund an invasion of Taiwan, and even an assertive leader like Xi “has to worry about where his money is going to come from,” said Wang Fei-ling of the Georgia Institute of Technology.
The bipolar world order between the United States and China is now an “objective reality,” and smaller countries and international organizations have little say over how to mitigate crises, argued Tsinghua University’s Yan Xuetong. This conflict between Beijing and Washington “puts pressure on small and medium-sized countries to pick a side,” and regional actors like Japan, North and South Korea, and the Philippines will be obliged to acquiesce to their demands if a crisis is to escalate. At most, the role of a country like Japan in the conflict would be similar to Poland’s in the Ukraine war, a retired Japanese military general told Nikkei Asia: serving as a gateway to supply Taiwan with weapons and hosting Taiwanese refugees."

The Air Force intercepted all 10 Kinzhals Russia launched on Jan. 2, using the U.S.-designed Patriot air defense systems.
If the missiles hit their targets, the consequences would have been catastrophic, Zaluzhnyi wrote on X.
Russia launched at least 99 missiles on the morning of Jan. 2, targeting Kyiv, the surrounding region, and Kharkiv. The attack killed 5 people and injured 127, including children, as of 5 p.m.
The Air Force reported earlier that 72 Russian missiles were shot down, along with all of the 35 Shahed ""kamikaze"" drones that Russia used to attack the country earlier in the night.
On X, Zaluzhnyi thanked Ukraine’s allies for providing the air defense systems but said that the country needs more systems.
""There is no reason to believe that the enemy will stop here. Therefore, we need more systems and munition for them,"" he wrote.
Earlier in the day, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics called for more air defense systems for Ukraine.
Nauseda wrote on X that ""Ukrainians do wonders with the air defense the West has provided, but they need more."" ""Air defense systems to Ukraine now!""
Rinkevics also wrote that ""Ukrainian air defense works well, but Ukraine must get more help.""
""New Year’s celebrations are over and the West must get serious and act now,"" Rinkevics posted on X.

MWVWB0JEQI-70,ABJ: Tesla expands to suburb northeast of Austin as footprint grows,Justin Sayers,"January 4, 2024 at 12:03 AM·1 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/abj-tesla-expands-suburb-northeast-160314267.html,"AUSTIN (Austin Business Journal) — Tesla Inc.’s growing footprint in the Austin area now includes a sizable facility in Hutto. But what it’s for remains unclear.
The Austin Business Journal visited the 36,000-square-foot site at 200 County Road 199 in the fast-growing industrial hub northeast of Austin in late December. The parking lot was full and a nondescript warehouse-style building was bustling with employees in construction vests and helmets, but there were no signs listing any companies and no clear indications of who was occupying it. The only traces it could be Tesla were a handful of the company’s electric vehicle charging stations out front.
But Elon Musk’s EV manufacturing and clean energy company is linked to the site in state filings, and it has been confirmed by Hutto officials. Tesla’s expansion to Hutto underscores the company’s wide-reaching plans for the region — as far south as San Antonio and, now, as far north as Hutto — as it continues buildout of its multibillion-dollar operation in eastern Travis County. The Hutto site is about 30 miles directly north of its gigafactory, which serves as the company’s headquarters, along State Highway 130.

E2FTN6BGPU-71,Britain calls for ‘immediate end’ to attacks on Red Sea container ships by Houthi rebels,David Lynch,"January 4, 2024 at 3:46 AM·3 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/britain-calls-immediate-end-attacks-194650867.html,"The UK has called for an “immediate end” to attacks on container ships by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.
The British Government and 11 other countries have issued a final warning to the militants to cease hostilities in the important maritime trade route.
The allied nations said the Houthis would “bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways”.
The Yemeni rebels, backed by Iran, say they are targeting Israel-linked or Israel-destined ships, and aim to end Israel’s air and ground offensive targeting the Gaza Strip following the attack by Hamas on October 7.
On Wednesday, leaders from the UK, the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands and New Zealand, signed a joint statement describing the attacks as “illegal, unacceptable, and profoundly destabilising”, and warned the Houthis against further assaults.
Action in the Red Sea has heated up in the last week, with seven Houthis killed in a clash with US military helicopters on Saturday, after rebel boats fired on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou container vessel.
It follows weeks of strife, which have led shipping companies to redirect vessels around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope to reach the Mediterranean and Europe, rather than travelling through the Suez Canal.
The joint statement said: “Let our message now be clear: we call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews.
“The Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.
“We remain committed to the international rules-based order and are determined to hold malign actors accountable for unlawful seizures and attacks.”
The statement also claimed the Houthis had made a “historic first use of anti-ship ballistic missiles” against container vessels, describing this as a “direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world’s most critical waterways”.
A Royal Navy destroyer last month joined international efforts to deter attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea.
HMS Diamond joined American and French warships in a US-led international task force dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian.
Asked on Tuesday whether Britain was considering more armed support to protect the vital global shipping route, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Planning is under way for a range of scenarios.
“No decisions have been made.
“We will continue to pursue all potential routes, including diplomatic routes.”
But the UK did not plan to send more warships or other military assets to the Red Sea, No 10 said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, on Wednesday, and urged him to ensure more aid got into Gaza.
Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Lord Cameron said: “More must be done to get humanitarian aid into Gaza – Israel must allow significantly more supplies in to reduce the risk of hunger and disease.
“The UK also wants to see the immediate release of hostages and progress towards a sustainable ceasefire.”"
IH2NCU67O8-72,"Bullet-riddled cars, stray dogs at Israel's Gaza crossing",Jack GUEZ,"January 3, 2024 at 8:20 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/bullet-riddled-cars-stray-dogs-162008503.html,"Nearly three months after Hamas's bloody attack on Israel, stray dogs roam amid bullet-riddled cars at the country's shuttered Erez crossing with the Gaza Strip.
Surrounded by high fences and with security cameras at every turn, the Erez crossing was once under constant guard by heavily-armed Israeli security forces.
But on October 7, the only crossing which enabled people to travel between Israel and Gaza was one of dozens of sites to come under attack by Hamas militants.
In rare images taken by AFP journalists on Wednesday, the fallout of that battle remains.
Cars are pockmarked with bullet holes in the abandoned parking area, while much of the tarmac has been ripped up.
""Welcome to Erez crossing point"" reads a sign in Hebrew, Arabic and English, a pile of debris below.
Stray dogs and birds picked at the muddy ground outside the terminal, which once bustled with thousands of Gazans crossing into Israel after obtaining work permits following stringent Israeli background checks.
Palestinians with permits for medical treatment, diplomats and humanitarian workers were also among those able to pass through Erez before it was shut down with the outbreak of war.
In the past, those crossing from Gaza would go through a body scanner, while their belongings were searched behind the scenes, and lastly their documents were checked.
Erez crossing stands adjacent to a military base, where armoured vehicles were seen approaching on Wednesday.
On October 7, the Israeli military launched air strikes in the area and said ""terrorists were thwarted at the Erez crossing"".
The army last month showed journalists a huge tunnel which came within 400 metres (1,300 feet) of the crossing.
A Hamas official, without elaborating said the tunnel, which could fit small vehicles, had ""successfully"" accomplished its mission.
The militant group's shock October attack claimed the lives of around 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
More than 22,300 people have since been killed in Israeli assault in Gaza, according to the latest data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

RZ5HCZATD2-73,California Assembly disrupted by Capitol protesters calling for Israel-Hamas war cease-fire,"Lindsey Holden, Jenavieve Hatch","January 4, 2024 at 5:49 AM·6 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/california-assembly-disrupted-capitol-protesters-214944853.html,"Protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war on Wednesday shut down the California Assembly on the Legislature’s first Capitol floor session of the new year.
Hundreds of demonstrators from Jewish anti-war organizations packed the Rotunda and the Assembly gallery and began chanting, singing and unveiling banners around 1:30 p.m., just as lawmakers reconvened in Sacramento after a months-long recess.
The Assembly was conducting routine business, the usual fare of opening day, and recessed during the protests before adjourning for the day. The Senate, which convened at 2 p.m., met without disruption.
The protesters were from groups that included Jewish Voices for Peace, IfNotNow and the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network.
Demonstrators’ banners read, “Jews say not in our name,” “Jews say no U.S. funding for Israel’s genocide in Palestine” and “Jews say California tax $$$ for healthcare, housing, schools, climate.”
Lawmakers had differing reactions to the protest, which Legislative Jewish Caucus leaders said “shut down the democratic process.”
Some Assembly members on the floor when the demonstration began immediately left the room and looked visibly upset.
The war in Gaza has divided Democrats, with moderates generally supporting Israel and progressives calling for a cease-fire.
Assemblyman Alex Lee, D-San Jose, has been in favor of a cease-fire for months, saying “more diplomatic solutions than wartime aggression has proven to be more productive. Like hostages are being freed, prisoners are being swapped.”
When asked about the protesters, Lee said they had “lovely voices.”
“I think it’s a great, effective way to convey that message in a very peaceful manner,” he said. “No one got hurt, obviously. Nothing was really disrupted. So I’m glad they got their point across.”
The Capitol demonstration occurred as Assembly Republicans were preparing to introduce a resolution condemning Hamas as one of their first acts of the new legislative year.
Protesters sang “cease-fire now” as lawmakers began leaving the chamber, although a few lingered on the floor and in the back of the room. None of the California Highway Patrol sergeants who provide security at the Capitol removed or arrested any of the demonstrators, who continued singing and chanting to a largely empty room.
They remained even after the lights in the Assembly chamber were shut off after the adjournment, continuing to sing while turning on their cell phone flashlights.
The protesters said, “Jewish values bring us here to say no to California money for genocide.”
“Assembly members, we call on you to join us in calling for cease-fire now,” they said in unison.
More than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war that followed the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.
“I know that the world abandoned Jewish people during the Holocaust, but our safety is not dependent on oppressing others,” said Margot Goldstein, a San Francisco-based teacher taking part in the demonstration.
“The fascism that we faced in Nazi Germany and around the world is what leads me to understand that what is happening now is a genocide, and that my history should not be used to excuse that or defend that.”
Goldstein said she wants California lawmakers — and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has supported Israel — to “listen to progressive Jews.”
Protesters sat in the Capitol Rotunda after they disrupted the Assembly. Most formed a large circle on the Rotunda floor, tossing handcrafted red poppies into the center to represent the thousands of Palestinians who have died so far in the conflict. Protesters chanted and sang, and some leaders gave speeches.
The demonstration lasted about three hours, and protesters left the Capitol just before 4 p.m.
Sacramento City Councilwoman Katie Valenzuela spoke in support of a cease-fire. Her presence in the room drew enormous support in the form of loud cheers and applause.
Valenzuela said she loves her Jewish neighbors and Sacramento’s Jewish community.
“It’s out of love for that community that I’m here today,” she said. “I don’t think this (war) is making anybody safe ... I believe the only path forward that includes safety for the Jewish community is one that is peaceful, and that doesn’t rely on the suppression of Palestinian neighbors.”
She said her support of a cease-fire is not support for Hamas’ actions on Oct. 7.
“I think the actions taken in October in Israel are horrific, and I think the actions taken in Gaza since then are also horrific.”
One former Israeli Defense Force soldier Meital Yaniv, who lives in Southern California, said their experience in the IDF brought them to the protest.
“I joined the IDF when I was 18, and after six months, I disgracefully left,” Yaniv told The Bee. Yaniv suffered from panic attacks and suicidal thoughts after sending planes into Gaza.
“That started a process of understanding the brainwashing and indoctrination of the way that I was raised,” they said. “The first thing that we need to do is an immediate cease-fire now, which is what we’re asking lawmakers (for).
Proponents of a cease-fire are often accused of not acknowledging the victims of Oct. 7, or the hostages Hamas took. Assemblyman Joe Patterson, R-Republican, posted such sentiments to X, formerly known as Twitter, after the Assembly session was cut short.
200++ people in Assembly Chambers many refusing to stand for pledge and prayer, all wearing masks, now shouting for a ceasefire. Of course, no talk of return of hostages. #caleg pic.twitter.com/Uuh9zgrF2i

Mica Amichai, who lives in Oakland and grew up going to Jewish day school, supports a cease-fire and freedom for Palestinians, despite, Amichai said, the toll it has taken on family relationships.
But Amichai continues to support the cause, and went to the Capitol Wednesday with one message: “Stop.”
Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Yuba City called the protests “totally unacceptable.”
“People have the right to free speech, but impeding important government functions like us coming back into session — we have big important issues to face,” Gallagher said. “The $68 billion deficit, cost of living is out of control in this state, an insurance crisis, a public safety crisis. We have work to do.”
Jewish Caucus co-chairs Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, and Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, D-Woodland Hills, emphasized the threats Jewish Californians are experiencing in the wake of the the Oct. 7 attacks and the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The protest happened minutes after Wiener released a letter from the Jewish Caucus announcing a legislative package aimed at preventing antisemitic hate. The letter calls for people to “join our efforts to confront hate and bigotry and support the Jewish community at this difficult moment in time.”
“We’ve made very clear what our perspective is in the caucus,” Wiener said. “We have our own criticisms of Israel. We want the war to end. The death that happened in Israel and the death that’s happening in Gaza is just horrific.”
“We also know that the cease-fire resolutions we’ve seen at the local level have, at times, gone off the rails in terms of dredging up a lot of anti-Jewish hate,” he added. “And that causes a lot of fear in our community for a non-binding resolution.”"

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly cast the Jan. 13 presidential and parliamentary elections as a choice between war and peace.
Top Chinese leaders have generally avoided public comments on the vote. President Xi Jinping said in his New Year's address on Sunday that China's ""reunification"" with Taiwan is inevitable, but did not mention the election.
In his own New Year's message, Zhang Zhijun, head of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, a quasi-official body that handles ties with Taiwan, said Taiwanese faced an important choice in the election.
""The two elections coming up in the Taiwan region are important choices between the prospects for peace and war, prosperity and decline,"" said Zhang, who headed the central government's Taiwan Affairs Office from 2013 to 2018.
""Taiwan compatriots must stand on the right side of history, and make a correct choice to promote cross-strait relations back to the right track of peaceful development,"" he said.
Taiwan's government rejects China's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their future.

G06CDB7QBA-77,European Council sanctions Russian diamond miner PJSC Alrosa,Patrick Hilsman,"January 3, 2024 at 12:42 PM·1 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/european-council-sanctions-russian-diamond-184225549.html,"Jan. 3 (UPI) -- The European Union Wednesday expanded sanctions on Russian diamonds to include a state-run mining company.
The European Council announced sanctions against PJSC Alrosa, which it said accounts for 90% of all Russian diamond production and its CEO Pavel Alekseevich Marinychev.
""The company constitutes an important part of an economic sector that is providing substantial revenue to the government of the Russian Federation,"" the council said.
The new proposed measure comes shortly after the European Union adopted its 12th sanctions package against Russia in December.
""These designations complement the import ban of Russian diamonds included as part of the 12th package of economic and individual sanctions,"" the European Council added
The 12th sanctions package focused heavily on the Russian defense industry and banned the import of Russian diamonds.
The European Commission says, ""almost 1,950 individuals and entities,"" have been sanctioned in response to Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The sanctioned individuals can have their assets frozen and are barred from travelling to or via EU nations and are not allowed to access money via European financial institutions."

Russian forces launched multiple large-scale missile strikes against Kyiv and Kharkiv on Jan. 2. President Volodomyr Zelensky told U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that Russia has attacked Ukraine with at least 500 missiles and drones over the past five days.
Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, condemned the attacks in a post on the social media platform X.
""Russia started the new year by shooting over a hundred missiles and drones at Kyiv, Kharkiv, and other cities, targeting civilians, destroying residential neighbourhoods and life-supporting infrastructure,"" Borrell said.
""Russia will be held to account for its war crimes.""
OSCE officials Malta Ian Borg and Helga Maria Schmid also denounced the attacks in a Jan. 2 statement.
""Together, we deplore in the strongest possible terms these ongoing attacks and urgently call for an immediate end to the unrelenting violence that does nothing but propagate a vicious cycle of misery and suffering. We call for this war to end now,"" the statement read.
The attacks Russia launched over the New Year holiday are the largest aerial attacks against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion.
U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attacks in a Dec. 29 statement and urged Congress to unblock military aid to Ukraine.

Trifonov, who served as the head of the Yekaterinburg branch of Russia's Interior Ministry from 2011-2017, was convicted on bribery and weapons charges in 2022. He was then sentenced to nine years and four months in prison.
Local media reported that Trifonov wanted to prove his innocence and fight for Russia, and eventually was able to secure a contract with the Russian military at the end of 2023.
Trifonov was killed shortly after arriving at the front, the report said, without providing further details on how he was killed.
In 2022, Russian authorities allowed the Wagner mercenary group to recruit prisoners in Russian jails, a practice which has since been taken up by Russia's Defense Ministry. As per the contracts signed to enlist, convicts are usually offered an official pardon in exchange for the completion of military service.
The U.K. Defense Ministry wrote in October 2023 that Russia mostly continues to rely heavily on so-called ""Storm-Z"" units, staffed by both convicts and regular troops on disciplinary charges, for local offensive operations in Ukraine.
Such units are often used as cannon fodder and suffer high casualties.

9VK12OL7GF-80,Former NATO chief pushes Biden for ‘more aggressive’ response to Houthi attacks,Lauren Irwin,"January 4, 2024 at 4:24 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/former-nato-chief-pushes-biden-202457187.html,"Former NATO chief James Stavridis urged the Biden administration to move toward a “more aggressive” response to the attacks from the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on shipping vessels in the Red Sea.
“What I think the White House is going to be grappling with today, in addition to what you and I have just discussed, is how to respond to these pirate attacks at sea, these Houthi rebels — you can call them Iranian pirates if you want,” Stavridis told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday.
The Houthi rebels have launched several attacks on merchant ships and vessels since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. Stavridis said the rebels are effectively shutting down the Red Sea, where 15 percent of the world’s supply chain travels.
The United States, along with several allies, warned Houthi rebels against further attacks on ships in the Red Sea, labeling the recent attacks as “illegal, unacceptable, and profoundly destabilizing.”
“The White House, I think, is going to have to move toward a response that’s more aggressive against the Houthis ashore. That means going after an Iranian proxy that is going to inflate tension,” he said.
Stavridis’s warning came after the U.S. sank three small Houthi boats early Sunday following another attack. He said the sinking was an “entirely appropriate” response, but to really get the attention of Tehran, “it’s going to require strikes ashore against Houthi land infrastructure, fuel depots, docks.”
The former NATO chief, who has warned of escalation between the U.S. and Iran since October, said he thinks that chances of a regional war are increasing.
At least 73 people were killed and another 170 were injured Wednesday in Iran during a ceremony marking the death of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by the U.S. in 2020. Stavridis said it “does not feel like an Israeli operation” and would guess “it could be the work of the Islamic State” or even “internal resistance” but at this time “there are number of explanations.”
“It just doesn’t feel like the Israelis to me, but it’s all part of this larger fabric of violence that’s spreading across the region, and simply the fact that that explosion occurred, when you add to it what’s happening in the Red Sea with the … Iranian-backed piracy, add that to what’s happening ashore in Gaza, of course, the attacks on U.S. forces,” Stavridis said.
“I have to say that the chances of a wider regional war feel to me like they’re ticking up from maybe 10 to 15 percent two months ago to something like 25 to 30 percent now. That’s very uncomfortable,” he added.

He visited Russia in September last year, where he had a personal meeting with one of the heads of the 5th Service of the FSB, who oversaw his disruptive activities against Ukraine.
On the instructions of his handler, the suspect used social media and propaganda media to disseminate specially selected, inaccurate and biassed information about the situation in Ukraine, incite national hatred, and justify Russia's blatant armed aggression against Ukraine.
Moreover, the offender made posts on social media calling for Ukraine's eastern regions to be annexed to Rostov Oblast of the Russian Federation.

TR7KXRPY7J-82,"Going against FDA, Florida Surgeon General discourages use of mRNA COVID vaccines",Melissa Marino,"January 4, 2024 at 4:50 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/going-against-fda-florida-surgeon-205037668.html,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Florida’s Surgeon General is calling for a halt in the use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, going against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recommendations.
“We continue to live in a world, where the CDC and the FDA, when it comes to Covid at least, are just beating their own path and direction that is inexplicable in terms of thinking about data and thinking about common sense,” Dr. Joseph Ladapo said at a recent meeting regarding the mRNA Covid vaccine.
On Dec. 6, Ladapo sent a letter to the FDA that called into question the safety of the mRNA vaccine, citing a case study that claims the mRNA could cause cancer if a sequence of events happens. He also said there haven’t been enough clinical trials.
DeSantis, Ladapo warn against newly approved COVID booster
“DNA integration poses a unique and elevated risk to human health and to the integrity of the human genome, including the risk that DNA integrated into sperm or egg gametes could be passed onto offspring of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine recipients. If the risks of DNA integration have not been assessed for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, these vaccines are not appropriate for use in human beings,” Ladapo wrote in the letter. “The FDA’s response does not provide data or evidence that the DNA integration assessments they recommended themselves have been performed.”
“We would like to make clear that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process, FDA is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines,” the FDA said in response to the letter. “The agency’s benefitrisk assessment and ongoing safety surveillance demonstrate that the benefits of their use outweigh their risks.”
“With over a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines administered, no safety concerns related to residual DNA have been identified,” the FDA added.
DeSantis: Ladapo ‘blackballed’ over COVID vaccines ‘just the reality’
“Worldwide, several billion people have gotten mRNA vaccines. To say that we don’t have the data, in fact, we do have the data,” said Dr. Thomas Unnasch with the USF Center for Global Health Research.
Unnasch worries Ladapo’s stance could be dangerous.
“There are going to be more people who aren’t going to get vaccinated and as a result, particularly among the at-risk groups, people who don’t get vaccinated, and then there are going to be people who are going to end up hospitalized and die from the infection,” Unnasch said.
Ladapo would need federal approval to prevent the vaccine from being distributed in Florida, which Dr. Unnasch said is unlikely to happen at this time.
An FDA representative released the following statement to WFLA on Wednesday:
The FDA stands firmly behind the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality of the approved and authorized COVID-19 vaccines, and respectfully disagrees with the Florida Surgeon General’s opinion. With over a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines administered and following very careful review of all the available scientific evidence, the FDA has not identified safety concerns related to the sequence of, or amount of, residual DNA. In general, while concerns have been raised previously as theoretical issues, the available scientific evidence regarding the mRNA vaccines strongly supports the conclusion that the vaccines are safe and effective and have a highly favorable profile of benefit to risk. Additionally, it is simply a fact that millions of lives have been saved because of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which most Americans undergoing vaccination have received (Two Years COVID Vaccines Prevented Millions Hospitalizations Deaths | Commonwealth Fund).
Perpetuating references to information about residual DNA in COVID-19 vaccines without placing it within the context of the manufacturing process and the known benefits of the vaccine is misleading. Please refer to FDA’s letter to Dr. Ladapo for an explanation along with references. As stated in the letter, the challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake. Given the dramatic reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization and serious illness afforded by the vaccines, lower vaccine uptake is contributing to the continued death and serious illness toll of COVID-19.

FR8K2MQ508-83,Hezbollah chief Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah warns Israel against full-scale war on Lebanon,Dalal Saoud,"January 4, 2024 at 4:02 AM·3 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/hezbollah-chief-seyyed-hassan-nasrallah-200242970.html,"BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Hezbollah leader Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel on Wednesday that launching a full-scale war on Lebanon would be ""very costly,"" and that the assassination of a senior Hamas leader in Beirut would not go unpunished.
""If the enemy thinks of launching a war on Lebanon, then our fighting will be without limits, ceiling, rules or restraints and he knows what I mean,"" Nasrallah said of Israel during a speech broadcast live via video at a rally to commemorate Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on the fourth anniversary of his assassination in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq.
Referring to Hezbollah's ""missiles, capabilities and men,"" Nasrallah emphasized: ""This is all to say that we are not afraid of war and not hesitant...Who thinks of [engaging] in a war with us, he will regret it if God wills.""
Nasrallah, whose fighters have been battling Israeli troops along the Lebanese border since the Gaza war broke out in October, warned that such a wider war will be ""very, very, very costly.""
He explained that his fighters have been battling since Oct. 8 along the border with Israel in a ""controlled"" way, taking into consideration Lebanon's precarious conditions. However, he said that resulted in ""paying a high price"" -- a great number of Hezbollah men killed, about 120.
The Hezbollah chief said his group joined the battle a day after Hamas' attack on Israel sparked the war to support the Palestinian people and resistance in Gaza.
By opening the Lebanese front, Hezbollah prevented Israel from waging a surprise war on Lebanon, he said. Otherwise, the Lebanese ""could have woken up during the night and Israel destroyed everything in this country because the international community is supporting it.""
Nasrallah described the Tuesday assassination of a senior Hamas leader and his companions in an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs, Hezbollah's stronghold, as ""a big and dangerous crime.""
He said it was the first time his stronghold has been ""targeted in that way since 2006,"" when Israel destroyed large parts of the southern suburbs during a 33 day-war with Hezbollah.
Saleh al-Arouri, 58, who served as Hamas' deputy politburo leader and its military commander of the West Bank, was killed in the drone attack, along with two commanders of Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing, and four other members of the Palestinian group.
Al-Arouri was a founding commander of the brigades and has been living in Lebanon since 2018. He was imprisoned twice in Israeli jails for a total of 18 years before being released in 2010. He was known to be the coordinator between Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran.
""This dangerous crime will not stay without response and punishment,"" Nasrallah said.
His retaliation threats would either deter Israel or increase fears of a full-scale war between the two battling forces, which have been engaged in daily fighting mostly restricted to parts of southern Lebanon and northern Israel, resulting in numerous deaths, destruction and displacement on both sides."
VY2UKAV536-84,Hezbollah leader promises response to Hamas official’s killing,Laura Kelly,"January 4, 2024 at 4:11 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/hezbollah-leader-promises-response-hamas-201140033.html,"Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah said the alleged Israeli assassination of a top Hamas official in a Beirut suburb Tuesday would not go unanswered.
On Wednesday, Nasrallah addressed the killing of Saleh al-Arouri, the No. 3 member of Hamas’s political and military leadership, during a major speech marking the four-year anniversary of the death of Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian commander who was killed in a U.S. strike in Baghdad in 2020.
Nasrallah said Hezbollah “will not be quiet about [it] … without any response or paucity of action on the battlefield,” in remarks translated from Arabic by Sky News.
Israel has not taken responsibility for al-Arouri’s killing, but Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told NBC News the death of a top Hamas official in Beirut did not implicate Lebanon or Hezbollah in Israel’s larger war against Hamas.
“Israel has not taken responsibility for this attack. But whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state. It was not an attack even on Hezbollah, the terrorist organization,” Regev said. “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership.”
Israel and Hezbollah have traded strikes and counterstrikes nearly every day across the border between Israel and Lebanon since Oct. 7, following Hamas’s shocking terrorist attack on Israel that triggered a wider war by Israel against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Still, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah is considered restrained in comparison with a larger war that could take place, between Israel’s large military and Hezbollah’s deep reserve of fighters and weaponry.
The U.S. has sought to keep a lid on fighting in the Middle East as Israel prosecutes its war against Hamas, even as tensions and attacks occur in multiple theaters throughout the region.

40AYQT2V9U-85,Hezbollah leader warns Israel against waging war on Lebanon,AFP,"January 4, 2024 at 4:13 AM·3 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/hezbollah-leader-warns-israel-against-201345139.html,"The chief of Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, warned Israel on Wednesday against waging war on Lebanon, a day after a strike killed Hamas's deputy leader in the southern Beirut stronghold of Hezbollah.
""If the enemy thinks of waging a war on Lebanon, we will fight without restraint, without rules, without limits and without restrictions,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech.
""We are not afraid of war,"" he said, adding that ""for now, we are fighting on the frontline following meticulous calculations"".
Hamas, and security officials in Lebanon, accused Israel of killing Saleh al-Aruri and six others on Tuesday.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari did not directly comment on Aruri's killing but said the military was ""highly prepared for any scenario"" in its aftermath.
Hezbollah and its arch-foe Israeli have exchanged near-daily fire over their border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, but the Aruri killing led to fears of wider conflict.
He is the most high-profile Hamas figure to be killed during the war, and his death came in the first strike on the Lebanese capital since hostilities began.
The strike that killed Aruri marked ""the first time they target the southern suburbs in this way since 2006,"" Nasrallah said, in reference to that year's Israel-Hezbollah war which saw Beirut's southern suburbs bombed.
Israel had sent ""messages"" to indicate it ""did not intend to target Lebanon or Hezbollah,"" but was rather ""settling scores"" with Hamas leaders, the Hezbollah leader added.
Nasrallah described the attack as a ""major and dangerous crime"" which ""will not go unanswered and unpunished"" -- repeating a threat made by Hezbollah on Tuesday.
The group announced several strikes on Israeli troops and positions Wednesday, within the usual scope of the border area.
Israel's military said it responded with artillery after munitions were fired from Lebanon. Warplanes also hit Hezbollah targets and a tank struck a ""terrorist squad"" in Lebanon, the military said.
""Israel has been weakened"" by Hamas's October 7 onslaught, Nasrallah said.
He spoke in a pre-planned speech commemorating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qasem Soleimani four years after his death in a US strike in Iraq.
Nasrallah is set to deliver another televised speech on Friday.
Earlier Wednesday, a high-level Lebanese security official told AFP that Israel fired guided missiles from a warplane to kill Aruri. Lebanese state media had on Tuesday reported he died in a drone strike.
Hamas said Aruri would be buried on Thursday in Beirut's Shatila Palestinian refugee camp.
Since hostilities began, 171 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, most of them Hezbollah members but also more than 20 civilians including three journalists, according to an AFP tally.
On the Israeli side, at least four civilians and nine soldiers have been killed, according to figures from the military.

According to local news channels, Israel carried out a bombing that killed Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy chief of the political bureau for the Palestinian militant group in Beirut. The Hamas official is the highest-ranked member killed in the ongoing war between Israel and the group in Gaza.
The State Department listed al-Arouri as a terrorist and offered a $5 million reward for information about him, according to The Associated Press.
Despite the win for Israel in taking out the official, Hamas leaders have been quickly supplanted in the past. There’s also the question of how the Israeli bombing in an area where Iran-backed Hezbollah is strong could affect current fighting along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had promised retaliation in the past for all forms of Israeli targeting of allied militant leaders in his country, the AP reported. However, Nasrallah has seemed reluctant thus far to escalate the fighting.
Israeli officials have not provided comment on the bombing that killed al-Arouri. However, military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said “we are on high readiness for any scenario.”
Hezbollah said the strike was “a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance,” per the AP.
“We affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment,” the group said.

In response, Hamas has said it would release the remaining 129 hostages once the war has ended. The two sides previously agreed to a temporary cease-fire, when they exchanged Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and allowed humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.

XNGV3C3JHK-88,"ISW analyses Putin's statements that West is ""Russia's enemy""",Ukrainska Pravda,"January 3, 2024 at 11:52 AM·6 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/isw-analyses-putins-statements-west-035219997.html,"Experts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have analysed Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements that the West is Russia's enemy and that Russia is waging an existential war against the West in Ukraine.
Source: ISW
Details: Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the West a Russian enemy, and suggested that Russia is fighting in Ukraine to defeat the West.
Putin was responding to a question from a Russian soldier about Western assistance to Ukraine during a meeting at a military hospital in Moscow Oblast on 1 January, saying that Russia's problem is not that the West is helping Ukraine, but that the West is ""Russia's enemy"".
He additionally claimed that Ukraine on its own is not an enemy to Russia, but that Western ""actors"" ""who want to destroy Russian statehood"" and bring about the ""strategic defeat of Russia on the battlefield"" are Russia's enemies.
Putin said that Western elites are trying to split Russia into five parts and are trying to do so by using Ukraine, but the situation on the fronts is changing, and Russia will ""deal with [the West] faster"" than the West can deal with Russia on the battlefields in Ukraine.
Putin added that the problem is not the supply of Western aid to Ukraine, and noted that Ukraine is already completely destroyed, that there is ""nothing left"", and that it ""exists only on handouts"".
Putin hinted that Russia is waging an existential war in Ukraine against the West, and noted that Western rhetoric has recently shifted to how to ""quickly end the conflict.""
ISW noted that this wording means that Putin sees a conflict and potential negotiations between Russia and the West, rather than a conflict and potential negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.
Putin added that Russia also wants to end the conflict between Russia and the West, but only on the Kremlin's terms, and stressed that Russia will not give up its positions.
The Russian president does not view Ukraine as an independent actor and thus portrays his full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a confrontation between Russia and the West. In this way, Putin is deliberately distorting the reality that Russia invaded Ukraine with the aim of destroying Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Putin's emphasis on changing the narrative in the West may indicate that he will perceive and/or present any weakening of Western support for Ukraine and any defeats of Ukraine on the battlefield as a Russian victory in this supposed Russian-Western confrontation.
The fact that Putin is presenting his war in Ukraine as Russia's struggle against the West, not Ukraine, demonstrates that he has no intention of negotiating with Ukraine in good faith and is setting up information conditions aimed at persuading the West to betray Ukraine through negotiations.
Putin is likely deliberately and falsely portraying Ukraine as a powerless pawn in the Russia-West conflict to mask his expansionist and maximalist goals of establishing full effective Russian control over Ukraine.
Quote: ""Putin’s 1 January discussion of negotiations refers to his intent to negotiate solely with the West about Ukraine’s future within the Russian sphere of influence and only about Western abandonment of Ukraine.""
More details: Putin previously followed a similar line when he issued two ultimatums to the United States and NATO in December 2021, which were aimed at forcing the West to recognise Russia's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe by ceding significant elements of Ukraine's sovereignty in the name of de-escalating the conflict between the West and Russia that Putin had fuelled.
Any Western commitment to negotiating Ukraine's future bypassing Ukraine would signal to Russia that it can impose its will on countries it perceives to be in its sphere of influence, potentially including Finland and Moldova, for which Russian actors have begun to set the stage for future campaigns.
Putin may expand his military objectives in Ukraine to include a confrontation with the West to create the conditions for a continued build-up of the Russian military and justify high casualties on the battlefield.
In addition, his statements likely indicate that he is preparing a long-term justification for keeping troops mobilised and engaged in combat to ostensibly defend Russia's sovereignty against the West.
To quote the ISW’s Key Takeaways on 2 January:
Russian President Vladimir Putin identified the West as Russia’s ""enemy"" and implied that Russia is fighting in Ukraine in order to defeat the West.
Putin’s framing of his war in Ukraine as a Russian struggle against the West – and not Ukraine – indicates that he does not intend to negotiate in good faith with Ukraine and is setting information conditions aimed at convincing the West to betray Ukraine through negotiations.
Putin may be expanding his war aims in Ukraine to include confrontation with the West in an effort to set conditions for permanent Russian military buildup and to justify high battlefield sacrifices.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed Ukraine’s need for urgent Western support to protect both Ukraine and the rest of Europe in an interview with The Economist published on 1 January.
Russian forces conducted another massive series of drone and missile strikes against deep rear areas in Ukraine between 31 December and 2 January, one of which used a strike package similar to that used on 29 December, and to which Ukrainian forces appear to be adapting.
Western provision of air defence systems and missiles to Ukraine remains crucial for Ukraine as Russian forces will likely attempt to adapt to Ukrainian air defence capabilities.
Russian officials publicly defined the goals for Russia’s 2024 chairmanship of both BRICS and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), articulating how the Kremlin may intend to use these organisations to fulfil its foreign policy objectives this year.
The Norwegian government announced on 1 January that it is permitting Norwegian defence companies to sell weapons and defence-related products directly to the Ukrainian government.
The Turkish government announced on 2 January that it will not allow the United Kingdom (UK) to transport two mine hunting ships to Ukraine via the Turkish Straits ""as long as the war continues.""
Russian society continues to reckon with the impacts of increasing anti-migrant sentiment amid Russian authorities’ ongoing efforts to systematically disenfranchise migrant communities within Russia.
Russian forces made marginal confirmed advances along the Svatove-Kreminna line, northwest and southwest of Bakhmut, northwest of Avdiivka, and southwest of Donetsk City.
The Russian military command may be seeking avenues to re-pardon recidivists who previously fought in the war in Ukraine in an apparent effort to maintain Russia's ability to leverage convict recruits as a manpower resource.
Russian occupation authorities are restricting and likely monitoring internet communications ahead of the March 2024 presidential elections.

2HINW11752-89,Majority of California residents become homeowners by this age: study,Amber Coakley,"January 4, 2024 at 5:23 AM·3 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/majority-california-residents-become-homeowners-212342708.html,"SAN DIEGO — Homebuying — it’s a pillar of the American dream. But is the vision out of reach?
For many young adults in California, it’s become a forbidden holy grail.
In fact, the age of most first-time homebuyers in the Golden State is now almost a decade older compared to the 1980s. That’s according to a recent University of California, Berkeley study which examines California’s “sliding homeownership ladder.”
The simple truth is: homebuying has become a later life experience for California residents. As of 2021, the majority of people in the Golden State don’t own a home until the age of 49. Researchers say it is the biggest delay represented in the age of buyers across America.
These California cities are among richest in US: report
Why is that?
Researchers explained that the ability to afford a home, as opposed to the desire to own one, accounts for most of California’s homeownership gap when compared to the rest of the country.
“While the typical timing of life cycle milestones such as marriage and childbearing can also influence rates of homeownership, most of the gap follows from residents’ financial ability to afford a home in the state,” the research paper noted while explaining why homeownership seems to be out of reach in the Golden State.
Researchers estimated the difference in financial ability to afford a home accounts for 55.6% of the observed difference in homeownership rates between residents of California and the rest of the U.S. (ages 25–75).
This comes as median U.S. home values have almost doubled in the past 10 years, with median household incomes only increasing by about 13.5%.
Places with the lowest cost of living in California: study
A look at the decline
Based on this study, 43.5% of people aged 25–75 were homeowners in 2021. This was down from 49.8% in 2000.
“The decline was even more pronounced for younger Californians aged 35–45, an age range when many people in other states become homeowners,” the research paper noted.
For that group, the study shows the share that owned a home declined from 49.5 % to 39.7%, which is almost 10 percentage points in just 20 years.
This study also indicates an especially noticeable decline in homeownership rates for Black and Hispanic residents over the past 40 years.
“For some groups, such as Black and Hispanic/Latine people, the drop in homeownership since 1980 is particularly pronounced, compounding the challenges historically facing these groups from a legacy of systemically discriminatory policies, such as redlining, exclusionary zoning, and a lack of access to financing,” the research paper noted.
California retailers are now required to have gender-neutral toy aisles
The researchers suggested that a slower housing price growth in the state would have helped homebuyers.
“Had housing prices in California risen from 2000 to 2021 in line with those in the rest of the country, about half (48%) of California’s decline in homeownership rate over the period could have been averted,” the research paper noted.
The following major data sources were used to conduct this study: the Decennial Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Each had its own strengths and weaknesses for understanding trends in homeownership, according to the Terner Center for Housing Innovation, UC Berkeley.

FFOHTQOQPU-90,Mega cruise ships trend as world's largest one launches inaugural voyage,Dana Forsythe,"January 4, 2024 at 4:53 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/mega-cruise-ships-trend-worlds-205305384.html,"Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Royal Caribbean's Icon of the Seas, the largest cruise ship in the world, was spotted passing through Ponce, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday, as it heads toward Miami for its inaugural voyage Jan. 27.
Overtaking the title of world's largest ship from Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, the Icon is five times larger than the Titanic with a volume of 250,800 gigatons compared to the ill-fated ship's 46,328 GT.
According to Cruise Industry News, the Icon docked in Cádiz, Spain, in December, where it received more than 10,000 plants and trees.
The Icon of the Seas is the first of four new Royal Caribbean cruise liners, including Star of the Seas, Odyssey of the Seas and Wonder of the Seas.
The new ship features 18 passenger decks and accommodates 5,610 guests and an international crew of 2,350. The massive ship is also home to six waterslides, seven pools and nine whirlpools, including the largest pool at sea.
The Icon is the first of three Royal Caribbean ships to use liquefied natural gas for a power source. The ship also uses environmentally friendly designs for energy efficiency and reduced emissions and providing up to 90% of the required freshwater produced onboard via a reverse osmosis/desalination plant.
Aaron Saunders, a senior editor at Cruise Critic, told UPI that while there's certainly an audience for smaller, more intimate vessels, it's far more expensive to build a small ship on a per-berth basis than it is to build a big one.
Saunders said big ships are in demand and companies continue to roll out ships that continue to out-do one another.
""If you're worried about being at loss for choice at sea, that concern is squashed on a mega-ship -- from roller coasters and bumper cars, to Broadway-caliber shows and a wide array of dining options -- sailing on a mega ship provides travelers the opportunity to not only visit the destinations on a ship's itinerary, but also enjoy the ship as a destination in its own right,"" he said.
Ben Armstrong, CEO of travel company Famvia, said the larger cruise lines are trying to lean into more experiential offerings for families with older children.
""Bigger ships equal more options for families to enjoy together,"" he said.

NATO’s Support and Procurement Agency said it will support a group of nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain, in buying the Patriots, which are used to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles as well as enemy aircraft.
According to industry sources, the contract could be worth around $5.5 billion.
The purchase could help allies free up more of their own defense systems for Ukraine. The agency said that “other user nations are expected to benefit from the conditions of the contract,” without elaborating.
“Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, cities and towns show how important modern air defenses are,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. “Scaling up ammunition production is key for Ukraine’s security and for ours.”
As an organization, NATO provides only non-lethal support to Ukraine, but its members send weapons and ammunition individually or in groups.
Russia's latest round of attacks began Friday with its largest single assault on Ukraine of the conflict, which has bogged down into a grinding winter war of attrition along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. More than 40 civilians have been killed since the weekend.
Ukraine’s two largest cities came under attack early Tuesday from Russian missiles that killed five people and injured as many as 130, officials said, as the war approaches its two-year mark.

P25HKXW5VL-93,"Netanyahu Boxed In by Pressure Over War, Politics, Budget",Ethan Bronner,"January 3, 2024 at 2:15 AM·6 min read",20240103,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netanyahu-boxed-fierce-pressure-over-154034582.html,"(Bloomberg) -- When Israel’s Supreme Court late Monday struck down a judicial overhaul law of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his Likud party assailed the justices for ruling during the war on Hamas, when national unity is paramount.

But the response to that backlash was telling: It was the overhaul that led to disunity and the war, a growing number of critics are saying. As chief military spokesman Daniel Hagari put it, the sense that Israel was divided and weakened over the court plan may have played a role in Hamas’ decision to attack in October.
The chorus of voices that’s seizing on the link between the war and the populist attempt to weaken the judiciary reflects a growing and intense set of constraints on Netanyahu — military, diplomatic, budgetary and judicial — as he begins his second year presiding over the most right-wing and religious coalition in Israel’s history.
Whether his government will survive 2024 is a renewed topic of debate that will now play out against the backdrop of Israel’s worst armed conflict in half a century.
“There is a real dissonance between his control of parliament and the strong mistrust by the public — and it’s a dissonance I don’t think can last,” said Amichai Cohen, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a liberal think tank.
Others argue that as long as he keeps his coalition partners happy with budgetary largesse, Netanyahu will remain in office. At the same time, critics that include the central bank are calling for fiscal adjustments such as spending cutbacks to get a grip on Israel’s growing debt burden.
Gaza, Economy
There are many factors at work as Netanyahu plots his way through the upheaval.
Hours before the high court’s ruling, the military said it was pulling thousands of troops from Gaza as it starts moving toward a more targeted phase of combat. It’s doing so, by all accounts, due to US pressure to reduce casualties and start planning for the day after in Gaza.
It also needs to return reservists to their day jobs, filling a void that’s paralyzed swathes of what had been one of the most dynamic high-tech economies in the world. Apart from its sheer human toll, the war will come at a price to the budget that the central bank estimates at around 210 billion shekels ($58 billion).
In addition, next week South Africa is taking Israel to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel rejects this as a blood libel, a centuries-old antisemitic slur, and plans a vigorous defense, according to the prime minister’s office.
But officials say that’s another reason to downgrade the war just now — pictures of 2,000-pound bombs exploding over civilian areas won’t help Israel’s case.
Attack and Aftermath
The war began on Oct. 7 when several thousand Hamas operatives infiltrated Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 and kidnapping another 240. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza and freeing them is one of the war’s aims.
Israel’s counter-attack has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. Much of the enclave’s north has been reduced to rubble and the United Nations says disease and hunger are spreading.
Israel says it’s destroyed a great deal of Hamas military infrastructure and killed 8,000 militants. Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the US and the European Union.
For many in Netanyahu’s coalition, this is no time to yield to international demands and reduce the war’s pace.
Danny Danon, a senior Likud lawmaker, spoke for others on Monday when he accused the prime minister of “bowing down in the face of American pressure.” The far-right coalition members are even more adamant and speak publicly about moving nearly all of Gaza’s 2.2 million inhabitants to other countries.
That isn’t the government’s policy — although what it plans to do with the hundreds of thousands of homeless remains unclear.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due in Israel on Friday with the goal of helping the government move fully to its next and more targeted phase of the war. He will also listen to Israel’s emerging plan to use local Gazan leaders as temporary administrators for aid and rebuilding purposes.
Israel is intent on uprooting Hamas and not handing over the keys to the Palestinian Authority, which remains the US’s preferred route.
Government Reboot
As the war shifts in coming weeks, it’s widely expected that Benny Gantz, an opposition leader who joined the emergency war cabinet, will leave the government along with his close colleagues.
Since Netanyahu is widely held responsible for the security breach that led to the Oct. 7 attack, some argue that the clock will begin ticking for new elections. Gantz is leading all polls for prime minister.
“Within weeks of Gantz leaving, the public will start to protest and call for the government to go,” Cohen, the Israel Democracy Institute fellow, said.
The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth points out that in none of the nearly 100 recent polls from March 16 has the governing coalition been projected to win a majority.
But Yoel Esteron, founder and publisher of the business daily Calcalist, says this lack of popularity only makes Netanyahu “more desperate and more dangerous.”
Grip on Power
“He’ll cling to his seat of power and do everything he can to avoid going to elections,” Esteron said.
Once Gantz leaves, the old coalition will move back in, with its 64-member majority of the 120-seat Knesset and three years still to go. Five of its members would have to bolt for the government to fall.
No one is counting on Netanyahu to leave voluntarily, as then Prime Minister Golda Meir did in 1974 after the intelligence failure that led to the 1973 Middle East war.
Netanyahu doesn’t blame himself for Oct. 7, saying the entire security establishment believed Hamas had been deterred and wouldn’t dare try to strike in the way it did.
Other factors could also interfere, notably tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Low-level fighting continues there, and one reason some brigades are leaving Gaza is to ready them to be moved north later this year if the Lebanon front explodes. US special envoy Amos Hochstein is due in Israel on Thursday to seek a diplomatic solution.
On Tuesday, a top Hamas official, Saleh Al-Arouri, was killed in an explosion in Beirut widely assumed to be an Israeli attack. This seems likely to complicate Hochstein’s mission.
Merav Michaeli, who leads the opposition Labor Party, told reporters on Tuesday that Netanyahu’s difficulties are “huge and dire.” She added, “That said, it doesn’t mean that his political abilities and his determination to stay in power can’t keep him prime minister.”

VS2AYZ8RDB-96,Report: Israel in Talks With Third Country to Expel Palestinians Entirely,Tori Otten,"January 3, 2024 at 11:51 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/report-israel-two-state-solution-175120398.html,"It seems that Israel is finally opening up to the idea of a two-state solution to its conflict with Palestine—so long as the second state is on a completely different continent.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition has been secretly speaking with the Democratic Republic of Congo about resettling thousands of Palestinians in the African nation, the Israeli outlet Zman Israel reported Wednesday.
“Congo will be willing to take in migrants, and we’re in talks with others,” a senior source in the security Cabinet, speaking anonymously, said.
Netanyahu and his allies floated the idea of sending Palestinians elsewhere last week, but the idea has been vehemently rejected by the international community. Moreover, Congo is unlikely to have the resources necessary to take care of such a massive influx of displaced people. More than half of the country’s population lives below the poverty line, according to the World Food Programme.
Israeli officials have made it increasingly clear in recent days that their plan is to completely eliminate Palestine. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that a way to solve the war was to “encourage the voluntary migration of Gaza’s residents to countries that will agree to take in the refugees.”
Separately, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir told reporters Monday that the war was an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza.”
The U.S. State Department slammed the officials’ comments as “inflammatory” and “irresponsible.”
“We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the Government of Israel, including by the Prime Minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government. They should stop immediately,” department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.
But it seems that Smotrich and Ben Gvir’s statements do reflect the policy of the Israeli government. Nearly all of the 2.3 million people living in the Gaza Strip have been displaced due to Israel’s unrelenting bombardment of the region. Palestinians were forced to flee to designated “safe zones,” only for Israel to bomb those areas, as well.
South Africa asked the International Court of Justice on December 29 for an urgent order declaring that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in its nearly three-month assault on the Gaza Strip. More than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed, the majority women and children. Some organizations, such as the nonprofit Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, put the death toll at nearly 30,000."

7GANT30NTZ-98,Russia and Ukraine exchange hundreds of prisoners of war in biggest release so far,The Associated Press,"January 3, 2024 at 11:14 AM·4 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-exchange-hundreds-prisoners-171413697.html,"Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war in the biggest single release of captives since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Ukrainian authorities said that 230 Ukrainian prisoners of war returned home in the first exchange in almost five months. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 248 Russian servicemen have been freed under the deal sponsored by the United Arab Emirates.
There was no immediate acknowledgment from the UAE, which has maintained close business ties to Moscow throughout Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Ukraine’s Human Rights Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said it was the 49th prisoner exchange during the war.
Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some of those who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine’s Snake Island and the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange.
Also Wednesday, Russia said it shot down 12 missiles fired at one of its southern regions bordering Ukraine, as Kyiv’s forces seek to embarrass the Kremlin and puncture President Vladimir Putin’s argument that life is going on as normal despite the fighting.
The situation in the border city of Belgorod, which came under two rounds of shelling on Wednesday morning, “remains tense,” said regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov, writing on Telegram.
“Air defense systems worked,” he said, promising more details about possible damage after inspecting the area later in the day, part of a New Year’s holiday week in Russia.
Ukraine fired two Tochka-U missiles and seven rockets at the region late Tuesday, followed by six Tochka-U missiles and six Vilkha rockets on Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
The Soviet-built Tochka-U missile system has a range of up to 120 kilometers (75 miles) and a warhead that can carry cluster munitions. Ukraine has received some cluster munitions from the United States but the Tochka-U and Vilkha can use their own cluster munitions.
The Russian side of the frontier has come under increasingly frequent attack in recent days. Throughout the war, border villages have sporadically been targeted by Ukrainian artillery fire, rockets, mortar shells and drones launched from thick forests where they are hard to detect.
Lately, as Russia fired missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, Kyiv’s troops have aimed at Belgorod’s regional capital, which is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.
Belgorod, with a population of about 340,000, is the biggest Russian city near the border. It can be reached by relatively simple and movable weapons such as multiple rocket launchers.
On Saturday, shelling of Belgorod killed 25 people, including five children, in one of the deadliest strikes on Russian soil since Moscow’s full-scale invasion. Another civilian was killed Tuesday in a new salvo.
Hitting Belgorod and disrupting city life is a dramatic way for Ukraine to show it can strike back against Russia, whose military outnumbers and outguns Kyiv’s forces.
The tactic appeared to be having some success, with signs the attacks are unsettling the public, political leaders and military observers.
On Monday, Putin lashed out against the Belgorod attacks by Ukraine. “They want to intimidate us and create uncertainty within our country,” he said, promising to step up retaliation.
Answering a question from a soldier who asked him about civilian casualties in Belgorod, Putin said: “I also feel a simmering anger.”
Many Russian military bloggers have expressed regret about Moscow’s withdrawal from the border area in September 2022 amid a swift counteroffensive by Kyiv, and they have argued that more territory must be seized to secure Belgorod and other border areas.
Russia describes Ukrainians as “terrorists” who indiscriminately target residential areas while insisting Moscow only aims at depots, arms factories and other military facilities — even though there is ample evidence that Russia is hitting Ukrainian civilian targets.
Ukrainian officials rarely acknowledge responsibility for strikes on Russian territory.
In another Russian border region on Wednesday, the city of Zeleznogorsk was briefly cut off from the power grid after Ukrainian shelling, local officials said.
Authorities were forced to temporarily shut down an electricity substation in the city of 100,000 people in the Kursk region to repair the damage from an aerial attack, Kursk Gov. Roman Starovoit said on Telegram.
Residents were without power or heat, he said, although electricity was restored in most of the city about two hours later, he said.
Russia has recently intensified its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, including using Kinzhal missiles which can fly at 10 times the speed of sound. The Kremlin’s forces appear to be targeting Ukraine’s defense industry, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
The onslaught has prompted Kyiv officials to ask its Western allies to provide further air defense support.
NATO announced Wednesday that it would help member nations buy up to 1,000 surface-to-air Patriot guided missiles in a deal possibly costing about $5.5 billion. That could allow alliance members to send more of their own defense systems to Ukraine.

Ukraine got back 230 soldiers and civilians, while Moscow received 248 troops in return.
Some of the captured Ukrainians had fought in battles during the early weeks of the war.
Kyiv announced Wednesday the largest prisoner exchange since the full-scale war began nearly two years ago. In the swap, Russia released 230 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and Moscow said it received 248 troops in return.
The surprise deal, which was brokered by the United Arab Emirates, is the first exchange in months and followed a series of recent Russian barrages against Ukraine that left dozens dead and hundreds injured. The missile and drone attacks have led officials in Kyiv to slam Moscow as a ""terrorist regime.""
Ukraine's military intelligence agency said on Wednesday that the exchange marked ""the largest in terms of the number of returned defenders.""
The 230 men and women who were released from Russian captivity include 130 soldiers in the regular military, 55 national guard troops, 38 members of the country's State Border Guard Service, one national police officer, and six civilians who were ""illegally deprived of their liberty,"" the agency said.
A majority of these individuals maintained the official status of a prisoner of war, while some were not thought to be in captivity and were considered missing, the Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence, an arm of the country's defense ministry that is also known as the HUR, said in a Telegram statement.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the exchange as ""long-awaited good news.""
""We remember all Ukrainians held in Russian captivity,"" he said in a statement addressing the nation.
""There was a long pause in the exchanges, but there was no pause in the negotiations regarding the exchanges. We seize every opportunity, try all mediation options. At every international meeting that can help the cause, we raise the issue of returning our captives. And we will continue this work to return our people… All our people,"" he said.
Zelenskyy noted that some of the Ukrainians who were released had defended Mariupol and the Azovstal steel plant, which is where Kyiv's forces made their last stand in May 2022 after Moscow laid a devastating siege to the southern port city. This means those soldiers spent at least 20 months in Russian captivity before they were exchanged this week.
The HUR also said Russia released national guardsmen who were captured while defending Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which fell into Moscow's hands in the early weeks of the war, indicating that these individuals may have been in captivity for nearly two years.
Russia's defense ministry, meanwhile, said it received 248 soldiers from Ukraine as ""a result of difficult negotiations,"" although it thanked the UAE for its mediation. The freed Russians are being given medical and psychological assistance and will undergo treatment and rehabilitation, Moscow said in a Telegram statement.
""I thank each of our warriors on the front line who take the occupiers prisoner and replenish our exchange fund,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The more Russians we take prisoner, the more effective the negotiations on exchanges will be.""
While it's unclear what sort of conditions the newly released Ukrainians faced in Russian prisons, one soldier who spent more than a year in captivity until he was released last summer told Business Insider that he witnessed brutal emotional and physical abuse and endured horrific treatment.

7OIBVR711F-100,Russia says Ukraine mounts new missile and drone attacks on southern region,Reuters,"Updated January 3, 2024 at 10:28 AM·2 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-says-ukraine-attacks-belgorod-074857361.html,"(Reuters) -Ukraine launched repeated missile and drone attacks on Wednesday on Russia's southern region of Belgorod, Russia's defence ministry and local authorities said.
Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the situation ""continues to remain tense"" in Belgorod, where Russia says 25 civilians including five children were killed in Ukrainian attacks on Saturday.
There was no word of any casualties from the latest attacks.
Later, Gladkov said authorities were evacuating residents near potentially unexploded munitions, with sappers called in to evaluate the danger.
Defence ministry explosive technicians were working on disposing of an unexploded projectile and around 600 residents from 323 houses within a 500-metre radius had been evacuated, Gladkov said.
Several other villages came under fire on Wednesday and a power line was knocked out, he said.
Ukraine's escalation of attacks on Belgorod over the New Year period has come as Russia launched some of its most intense strikes on Ukraine since the war began almost two years ago. Kyiv said on Tuesday that Russia had launched well over 300 attack drones and missiles of various kinds at cities across Ukraine since Friday.
Belgorod, like other Russian regions on the border with Ukraine, has seen frequent low-level attacks since the start of the war, but Saturday's was by far the deadliest. President Vladimir Putin said it would ""not go unpunished"".
One person was killed and seven more wounded in the region on Tuesday, Russian authorities said.
In Wednesday's attacks, Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine fired six Tochka-U ballistic missiles and six guided missiles launched from a Vilkha heavy multiple rocket launcher.
Gladkov said Ukraine also launched several drones on the region and the city of Belgorod, which is the administrative centre of the region.
Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.

CGH3MVD6MV-101,Russia targets Ukraine’s defence industry as it prepares for a long war,Joe Barnes,"January 3, 2024 at 11:29 PM·4 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-attacks-crimea-russia-aerial-135540288.html,"Russian forces are targeting Ukraine’s defence industry with long-range strikes in a tactical switch as Moscow prepares for a long war, British intelligence officials have said.
The attacks are part of an escalating missile and drone duel between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides bidding to degrade one another’s military and industrial capacities while the front lines remain largely static.
The Ministry of Defence assessment came as Kyiv launched a wave of strikes on occupied Crimea and a Russian border region on Wednesday in what appeared to be a retaliatory assault for a barrage on Ukrainian cities the previous day.
Britain’s MoD said Moscow’s volley of around 100 high-velocity projectiles aimed at the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv on Tuesday had likely targeted Ukrainian drone and missile producers.
“This contrasts with its major attacks last winter, which prioritised striking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,” the department said.
“Russia appeared set to restart this campaign by hitting energy sites in early December 2023,” it added.
“These new operations suggest at least a temporary change of approach in Russia’s long-range strikes. Russian planners almost certainly recognise the growing importance of relative defence industrial capacity as they prepare for a long war.”
A defence industry source in Ukraine told the Economist that recent strikes had been targeted at sites connected to domestic missile and drone production.
“The attacks had strategic meaning for the enemy, with the aim of reducing our capacity to strike,” the source said. “It’s a battle to see who can destroy more of the enemy’s long-range weapons.”
Ukrainian strikes deep behind enemy lines have followed a similar pattern, as Kyiv seeks to disrupt Russia’s ability to launch missiles and drones.
It is likely to become a battle of endurance as both sides move to improve their air-defence systems to protect valuable targets on the ground.
Russian forces have taken to using vast barrages combining Iranian-made kamikaze drones and dozens of types of missiles to evade surface-to-air interceptors.
“Its forces have committed a significant portion of the stock of air-launched cruise missiles and ballistic missiles they had built up over recent months,” the MoD’s intelligence update said.
But Ukrainian officials dispute that Russia had shifted away from civilian targets, such as heating and power stations, in the hope of freezing the war-torn country into submission during the cold winter months.
Yuriy Sak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s strategic industries minister, said: “I saw the destroyed residential homes, shopping malls, maternity wards, railway stations, and the high numbers of civilian casualties.
“These are facts. Everything else is speculation.”
The strikes on Belgorod Wednesday were said to have been aimed at an ammunition bunker just south of the city, some 20 miles from Ukraine’s northeastern border with Russia.
Russian air defences destroyed 12 Ukrainian missiles fired at Belgorod, local officials said.
Vyacheslav Gladkov, the region’s governor, said: “The situation in Belgorod continues to be tense. There were two attacks in the morning.”
He added Ukraine had also launched several drones targeting the city. Russia has said 25 civilians including five children were killed in Ukrainian attacks on Saturday, and the wider region.
Footage shared on social media purportedly showed a plume of smoke rising into the sky on the outskirts of the city. Explosions, which are characteristic of burning munitions, could be heard in one clip.
Another aerial attack damaged infrastructure and caused power cuts in the Kursk region, to the north of Belgorod, its governor Roman Starovoyt said on Telegram.
Meanwhile, in occupied Crimea, local authorities said a Ukrainian missile was downed over the port city of Sevastopol.
The missile was reportedly aimed at Belbek air base, from which Russia has frequently launched jets used to conduct bombing sorties in Ukraine.
Residents of the nearby villages of Fructovoye and Verkhnesadovoye reported hearing loud explosions before witnessing a bright flash of light in the area near the base.
A plume of smoke was also spotted following the explosion.
The Telegraph could not independently verify the reports.
Kyiv has yet to comment on Wedneday’s attacks.
Russia has launched a series of major drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent days, marking some of the most intense strikes since the war began in February 2022.
The strikes killed more than 50 people, with some 330 others wounded, and prompted Kyiv to intensify its calls for more weapons and ammunition from the West.
Kyiv said on Tuesday that Russia had launched more than 300 attack drones and missiles of various kinds at cities across Ukraine since Friday.

7OYMFXPIFN-104,RyanAir reports record travel despite feud with online travel agencies,Dana Forsythe,"January 4, 2024 at 12:56 AM·1 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/ryanair-reports-record-travel-despite-165632244.html,"Jan. 3 (UPI) -- A little over a month after some online booking sites removed RyanAir flights from their listings, the European airline recorded a jump in traffic.
RyanAir, a discount carrier based in Dublin, said 12.54 million passengers booked flights December 2023, a jump of 9% from December 2022, in which 11.52 travelers booked with the airline.
In total, RyanAir carried over 181 million passengers in 2023, compared to 160 million in 2022.
The airline operated 72,500 flights in December, with 900 canceled because of the the ongoing war in between Israel and Hamas.
According to a RyanAir new release, online travel agencies like Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak removed Ryanair's flights from sale on their websites in early December.
RyanAir called the move ""welcome"" and alleged the actions could be the result of pressure from consumer protection agencies or a response to the recent Irish High Court ruling about screenscraper Flightbox that halted unauthorized scraping of the airline's data.
The company said the sudden removal of RyanAir flights from these online travel websites could reduce short term load factors by 1% or 2% over the next two months.
It noted the move could ""soften short-term yields"" as the airline begins to lower fares where necessary to encourage all passengers to book directly on Ryanair.com.
Starting in summer 2023, RyanAir started warning customers of ""pirate scams and overcharges, saying that online travel agents like Kiwi.com, Lastminute.com, Opodo.com and eDreams.com were hitting customers with unjustified fees and charges."
VINU93QUDL-105,Senior Hamas leader killed in Beirut was a key figure who patched up ties with Iran,Dan De Luce and Doha Madani,"Updated January 3, 2024 at 10:36 PM·4 min read",20240103,https://news.yahoo.com/senior-hamas-leader-killed-beirut-050327280.html,"The killing of Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in a reported drone strike in Beirut will be perceived as a warning to Iran, which has armed and financed Hamas, and other Hamas leaders, experts said.
Al-Arouri, the commander of Hamas’ military wing in the West Bank and deputy chairman of the group’s political bureau, was a key figure who had helped repair Hamas’ relations with Iran and had been in Israel’s crosshairs even before the current conflict began. He was killed Tuesday with six other members of the organization after his home in a suburb in southern Beirut was targeted by a drone strike.
“There’s no single cog in this group without whom the whole thing falls apart, but Arouri was a particularly important person, both in terms of overall leadership and his support for violence,” said Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank.
Levitt was the deputy assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis at the Treasury Department from 2005 to 2007 and a counterterrorism adviser at the State Department.
Lebanese officials, Hamas and the Lebanese-based militant group Hezbollah all laid blame for the strike on Israel. Israeli officials declined to comment.
Israel will be braced for retaliation from Hezbollah, which is backed by the Iranian regime, but it most likely concluded removing al-Arouri was worth the risk, Levitt said.
“They didn’t just kill some random Hamas leader, someone who just speaks in front of a camera. They actually took out someone who was operationally important,” he said.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to retaliate against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon.
Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told NBC News that Israel has not taken responsibility for the strike.
Regev did not deny nor confirm whether Israel authorized the strike but said it was a “surgical” hit on Hamas, rather than an attack on Lebanon.
The CIA declined to comment.
“The killing of Al-Arouri is a shot across the bow not just to Hamas, but to Iran. Al-Arouri was known to be close with the leadership in Tehran,” said Colin Clarke, the director of research at the Soufan Center, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization focusing on global security issues.
“It’s also a signal that Israel will seek to hunt down and eliminate Hamas leadership anywhere they are, not just in Gaza, but in the region and further afield, as well. This is putting other senior Hamas officials on notice,” he said.
Al-Arouri, who grew up in the occupied West Bank and had been involved in Hamas for decades, had operated a joint war room with Iran since the war began in October and was seen as a rival to the commander of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, according to Levitt.
The civil war in Syria caused a rift between Hamas, which favored Sunni rebels fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and Iran, which came to the aid of the regime. But al-Arouri sought to patch over differences with Tehran, experts say.
Israel has a history of hunting down its enemies, including Hamas leaders. In August, Netanyahu had suggested al-Arouri was a potential target along with other Hamas leaders, saying al-Arouri “knows very well why he and his friends are in hiding.”
The day before, al-Arouri had warned in an interview with a Lebanese media outlet that the Israeli government’s decisions would lead to a “multifront” conflict.
""Those who seek targeted assassinations understand that a multifront war is coming. When we reach it, Israel will suffer a huge loss,” al-Arouri told the Lebanese Al Mayadeen news channel.
In a 2003 U.S. federal racketeering case, the Justice Department named al-Arouri as an unindicted co-conspirator and described him as a senior Hamas figure who had access to tens of thousands of dollars for terrorist operations.
He was detained several times by Israeli authorities, including in 2007. But he was freed in 2011 with more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006.
In 2018, the State Department offered a $5 million bounty for information about al-Arouri through its Rewards for Justice program. At the time, the State Department said he had reportedly worked with Qassem Soleimani, who was then the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020.
Al-Arouri also announced in 2014 that Hamas claimed responsibility for an attack involving the kidnappings and killings of three Israeli teenagers, including a dual U.S.-Israel citizen, Naftali Fraenkel, according to the State Department.

South Korean goods sent to the US totaled $11.3 billion in December, versus $10.9 billion to China.
South Korea's exports climbed 5.1% year-over-year on the month.
South Korea exported more goods to the US than China in December for the first time since 2003.
Bloomberg data shows that last month, the US imported $11.3 billion worth of goods from South Korea. Meanwhile, China imported $10.9 billion, according to the country's trade ministry.
While the numbers reflect a change of just one month, and may not indicate lasting trends, they point to shifting trade flows amid changes in the geopolitical landscape and China's ongoing economic hurdles since reopening its economy after the pandemic.
China remains South Korea's largest overall trading partner.
Policymakers in Beijing have been weighing various stimulus measures to prop up the country's economy, and the Conference Board anticipates more economic headwinds to come in 2024.
""So far, the government has refrained from implementing a broad-based stimulus package,"" the Conference Board's China Center said in its 2024 outlook. ""Still, over the past months, the government has been stepping up monetary and fiscal measures to stimulate 'targeted' investment, especially in infrastructure for flood recovery and disaster prevention. As a result, while the strong recovery blip seen in 2023 Q3 will dissipate, growth in 2024 is likely to remain stable.""
The US, for its part, saw shipments from South Korea increase for a fifth consecutive month year-over-year, per Bloomberg data.
President Yoon Suk Yeol has been deepening ties with the US amid trips to Washington and meetings with American lawmakers. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration has pushed to reduce dependency on China in business and technology, with an emphasis on semiconductors in particular.
China, in turn, is reportedly ramping up spending on chip production for AI and smartphones.

Ukrainian authorities said that 230 Ukrainian prisoners of war returned home on Wednesday in the first exchange in almost five months.
Russia’s defense ministry said that 248 Russian servicemen had been freed under the deal sponsored by the United Arab Emirates.
The UAE’s foreign ministry attributed the successful swap to the “strong friendly relations between the UAE and both the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine, which were supported by sustained calls at the highest levels”.
The UAE has maintained close economic ties with Moscow despite Western sanctions.
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, said that it was the 49th prisoner exchange during the war.
Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some of those who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine’s Snake Island and the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange.
Also on Wednesday, Russia said it shot down 12 missiles fired at one of its southern regions bordering Ukraine, as Kyiv’s forces seek to embarrass the Kremlin and puncture the argument made by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, that life is going on as normal despite the fighting.
The situation in the border city of Belgorod, which came under two rounds of shelling on Wednesday morning, “remains tense”, said Vyacheslav Gladkov, the regional governor, writing on Telegram.
“Air-defence systems worked,” he said, promising more details about possible damage after inspecting the area later in the day, part of a new year holiday week in Russia.
Ukraine fired two Tochka-U missiles and seven rockets at the region late Tuesday, followed by six Tochka-U missiles and six Vilkha rockets on Wednesday, Russia’s defence ministry said.

XZHAYN5ZXM-109,US manufacturing sector eyes recovery in December - ISM,Reuters,"January 3, 2024 at 11:02 PM·3 min read",20240103,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-manufacturing-sector-eyes-recovery-150254988.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted further in December, though the pace of decline slowed amid a modest rebound in production and improvement in factory employment.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday that its manufacturing PMI increased to 47.4 last month after being unchanged at 46.7 for two straight months. It was the 14th consecutive month that the PMI stayed below 50, which indicates contraction in manufacturing. That is the longest such stretch since the period from August 2000 to January 2002.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 47.1. According to the ISM, a PMI reading below 48.7 over a period of time generally indicates a contraction of the overall economy. The ISM and other factory surveys, however, likely overstate the weakness in manufacturing.
The so-called hard data suggest that manufacturing, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy, is plodding along. Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods were up strongly on a year-on-year basis in November. Though factory production has been weak, the magnitude of the drop has gotten smaller in recent months.
The economy continues to expand, growing at a 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. Growth estimates for the October-December quarter are currently as high as a 2.0% pace.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to 47.1 last month from 48.3 in November.
Production at factories rebounded, with the sub-index coming in at 50.3 from 48.5 in November. Production could improve further as a measure of customers' inventories fell back below the 50 level after rising in November to what the ISM said was the upper end of ""just right.""
Several manufacturers in November cited the need to reduce inventory levels.
Subdued demand helped to further depress prices at the factory gate, a sign that goods deflation could prevail for sometime. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers dropped to 45.2 from a seven-month high of 49.9 in November.
The survey's measure of supplier deliveries edged up to 47.0 from 46.2 in the prior month. A reading below 50 indicates faster deliveries.
Factory employment picked up, though it remained weak amid attrition, hiring freezes and layoffs. The survey's gauge of factory employment rose to 48.1 from 45.8 in November. This measure has not been a reliable predictor of manufacturing payrolls in the government's closely watched employment report.
According to a preliminary Reuters survey of economists, manufacturing payrolls likely increased by 5,000 jobs in December as the boost from the return of striking United Auto Workers union members faded. Factory employment rose 28,000 in November.
Overall nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 168,000 jobs last month after surging 199,000 in November, according to the Reuters survey. The unemployment rate is forecast rising to 3.8% from 3.7% in the prior month.
The government is scheduled to publish its closely watched employment report for December on Friday.

Details: A journalist asked Miller to comment on statements in the media according to which ""the US wants Ukraine to ship its strategy from total victory to being in the strongest negotiation position"".
""No, no, that is not true,"" Miller replied briefly.
Background: In December, at least two media outlets, The New York Times and Politico, published detailed materials about a subtle shift in American strategy concerning Ukraine.
Both outlets claimed that the US imposes a more defensive strategy on Ukraine in order to keep its territories and accumulate forces for deterring the Russian offensive. Among the reasons for this shift was the uncertainty about further support due to debates in the Congress.
The NYT also wrote about the alleged readiness of Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign a ""truce"" if Kyiv and the West recognise some illegally occupied Ukrainian territories as Russian.

A spokeswoman for Habeck told dpa that he had been happy to talk to the farmers.
""Unfortunately, the security situation did not allow for a dialogue with all farmers, and the offer made by Minister Habeck to talk to individual farmers was unfortunately not accepted,"" she said.
The row came after Germany's coalition government decided to gradually decrease fuel subsidies for farmers over the next couple of years, rather than cut them all at once as had been planned, a government spokesman said.
Chancellor Scholz, Habeck and Finance Minister Christian Lindner had also agreed to abandon a planned cancellation of the motor vehicle tax exemption for agriculture, the spokesman added.
The cuts were part of a package of measures intended to plug a multi-billion euro gap in the government budget following a landmark top court ruling at the end of last year that sent the coalition's financial plans into disarray.
But the original plans had triggered massive protests from farmers and were also controversial within the coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).
The German Farmers' Association had called for a week of action against the planned cuts starting on Monday and stuck to the call despite the government changes.
A major demonstration is planned in Berlin on January 15. Farmers' president Joachim Rukwied said the coalition should withdraw the proposals completely.
According to the government, the rate of fuel relief for farmers will now be reduced by 40% in 2024. In 2025 and 2026, there will be a further annual reduction of 30%, meaning that there will no longer be a subsidy in 2026.
Scholz, Habeck and Lindner agreed on savings in the 2024 budget in mid-December after lengthy negotiations. Following the court's verdict, they had to plug a financial gap of around €30 billion ($32.3 billion) in the core budget."
XS23895VDT-113,Arkansas lawmakers introduce legislation to increase outdoor recreation funding,Alex Kienlen,"January 5, 2024 at 2:47 AM·2 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/arkansas-lawmakers-introduce-legislation-increase-184701287.html,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Arkansas lawmakers have introduced a bipartisan bill that would increase funding for federal recreation areas.
The Lake Access Keeping Economies Strong Act, or LAKES Act, would allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers facilities to keep 80% of recreation fees collected. Currently, Corp of Engineers facilities can not retain fees, unlike U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service sites.
The act was introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (AR-04) on Dec. 22, 2023. Westerman was joined by fellow Arkansas Republican Rep. Steve Womack (AR-03) and Democrat Jared Huffman (CA-02) in introducing the bill.
Arkansas tourism on post-pandemic $9.2 billion upswing, new state director named
The LAKES Act would also allow the Corps to enter into agreements with nonprofits to operate and maintain Corp facilities. It would also allow local managers to make operation and maintenance decisions about facilities under their control.
Companion legislation in the Senate is co-sponsored by Senators John Boozman (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jon Tester (D-MT) and Steve Daines (R-MT).
According to figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce, outdoor recreation is 2.5% of the Natural State’s GDP.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has pointed to outdoor recreation as a driver for the Natural State’s tourism revenue.
Arkansas tourism booming, boosting state economy
Westerman and Womack acknowledged the economic role of recreation in introducing the LAKES Act.
“Outdoor recreation is among one of the top economic drivers in the U.S., especially in states like Arkansas,” Westerman said. “Because of discrepancies in current federal law, managers of some of our favorite outdoor recreation sites have to jump through bureaucratic hoops to maintain and manage the sites.”
The Corps is one of the largest outdoor recreation providers, with nearly 257,000 facilities across 43 states, according to Westerman’s office.
Womack spoke to the efficiencies provided in the act.
“Under current federal law, local managers of recreation sites we all know and love, such as Beaver Lake and Table Rock Lake, must cut through endless bureaucratic red tape to maintain and operate these sites effectively,” Womack said. “The LAKES Act would rectify this by allowing the Army Corps to retain recreation fees collected onsite, keeping maintenance and operations decisions out of the hands of federal bureaucrats and into the hands of the local managers who know these sites best.”
A letter supporting the legislation undersigned by 26 outdoor recreation equipment manufacturers has been received by Westerman and Huffman. It cites the historic underfunding of Corp programs.
Arkansas general revenue $200 million plus above projections at fiscal year halfway point
The act has been Referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.

Multiple home care patients in Maury County noticed there was money missing from their bank accounts, which led to an investigation in June, according to a Jan. 4 news release from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The agency received complaints that the patients’ caregiver may have been behind the spending, according to TBI.
The 38-year-old woman was using some of her patients’ debit cards to make “fraudulent, personal charges” for online gambling, investigators said.
The Maury County grand jury then indicted the caregiver Dec. 14 on four counts of financial exploitation of an elderly or vulnerable person and four counts of theft of $1,000 or less.

WI6XLTNC3C-116,China protests to Myanmar after stray artillery shells hurt five,Reuters,"Updated January 4, 2024 at 4:33 PM·2 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/artillery-shells-restive-myanmar-region-071633763.html,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China has protested to Myanmar over five people injured after artillery shells lobbed during battles between its ruling junta and rebel groups strayed into a small town near their border, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday.
Armed conflict has surged in Myanmar's north between the military and rebel groups since late October, spurring calls for ceasefire from neighbouring China, which has even facilitated dialogue between the two sides.
""China ... strongly deplores the Chinese casualties caused by the conflict and has already lodged serious representations with the relevant parties,"" said Wang Wenbin, the spokesperson.
""China once again asks all parties to the conflict to cease fire and stop fighting, and take measures to prevent the recurrence of such vicious incidents,"" Wang told a regular news briefing.
China would take the necessary steps to safeguard the lives and property of its citizens, he added.
Earlier, the state-controlled Global Times newspaper said five people in Nansan, a subtropical town near Myanmar, were taken to hospital after being wounded on Wednesday by the stray shells.
A video of the incident circulated on social media by the paper showed one person lying on a pavement as people shouted, ""Call the police!""
In the video, the paper added that officials in Zhenkang, a city in the southwestern province of Yunnan, had confirmed shelling had strayed from Laukkai, in Myanmar's northern region of Kokang, at about 2:00 p.m. (0600 GMT) on Wednesday.
The incident comes after China's embassy in Myanmar urged its nationals last week to leave Laukkai as soon as possible, citing growing security risks.
RESTIVE REGION
For years, Kokang in Myanmar's Shan state has been a volatile and restive region.
In 2015, shells from the area also landed across the border in Yunnan amid fighting between Myanmar government troops and rebels, injuring one Chinese and four Myanmar nationals and angering Beijing.
Some battles took place as close as 500 m (540 yards) from the China-Myanmar border at the time.
In 2009, clashes in the same area forced tens of thousands to flee across the border into China, Chinese state media and rights groups have said.
In mid-December, the United Nations estimated more than 660,000 people had been displaced in Myanmar since Oct. 27, and put the corresponding nationwide total at a record 2.6 million.
China has urged citizens to avoid travel to northern Myanmar, and advised those already there to seek safety or return home.

Gaza's Ministry of Health said on Facebook that the latest deaths bring the death toll of Palestinians to 22,438 with 57,614 wounded since the start of the conflict on Oct. 7. The ministry claimed that 70% of the deaths are of women and children. The totals don't identify which may have been part of Hamas fighters.
Gaza officials said that the Israeli military has killed 326 health professionals and has destroyed 121 ambulances, limiting their ability to care for the injured.
They claimed that Israel intends to target more than 200 health facilities in Gaza, including 30 hospitals and 53 health centers that are out of service.
The Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday it killed Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Mamdoh Lulu in an airstrike.
""[Lulu] served as an assistant to the heads of the northern region of the Gaza Strip in the Palestinian Islamic organization, and was in contact with senior officials of the organization's headquarters abroad,"" the Israel Defense Forces said on X, formerly Twitter.
""Lulu was killed in an attack by an IDF aircraft, led by the Fire and Intelligence Center in the Southern Command and directed by the Shin Bet and the Intelligence Division.""
The IDF said earlier that they killed five fighters from Hamas and destroyed an arsenal belonging to the group amid a stepped-up military campaign in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
Troops of the 4th Brigade Combat Team called in an Air Force airstrike that killed three fighters attempting to plant a bomb among Israeli positions and killed two more holed up in a building nearby, Israel Defense Forces said in a post on X.
""A fighter jet attacked a weapons warehouse of the terrorist organization Hamas in the same area of ​​the city.""
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society also said Thursday the IDF had struck its facilities in the city for the second time in two days, killing at least one person and injuring several others.
""IDF targeting the PRCS headquarters in Khan Younis which has led to the killing of one person and 6 injuries,"" the relief organization said in an update on X.
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a situation report that the Al Amal hospital and PRCS in Khan Younis were bombed multiple times throughout Wednesday, but said it could not confirm casualty numbers.
Hundreds of displaced families that had been sheltering in the building and PRCS headquarters had attempted to evacuate following the first bombing on Tuesday in which five deaths were reported, including a five-day-old baby.
A training center run by PRCS within the hospital complex was severely damaged in that attack.
On a visit to Al-Amal, OCHA and the World Health Organization witnessed first-hand the displacement of civilians and the extensive damage to the hospital where an estimated 14,000 people were sheltering at the hospital at the time of the attack
The ReliefWeb roundup also said the U.N. and other humanitarian agencies had been prevented from delivering urgently needed life-saving humanitarian assistance north of Wadi Gaza for the past three days by Israeli forces either blocking or delaying access.
The convoys were bringing medicines that would have provided vital support to more than 100,000 people for 30 days, as well as eight trucks of food for people facing ""catastrophic and life-threatening food insecurity.""
""Humanitarian organizations are calling for urgent, safe, sustained and unhindered humanitarian access to areas north of Wadi Gaza, which has been severed from the south for more than a month.""
However, OCHA acknowledged ongoing fierce fighting was also a factor.
Meanwhile, at the other end of Israel overnight and into Thursday, Israeli forces hit Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon despite the group's leader, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah, warning Israel would pay a very high price for a war on its northern neighbor.
An Air Force fighter jet struck a Hezbollah observation post and military infrastructure in the Maron al-Ras district followed shortly afterward by an attack on an anti-tank squad in the same area,"" the IDF said in a social media post.
During the night, IDF forces fired mortars to ""remove a threat"" on the Israel-Lebanon border in the Rav A Taltin area, according to the update.
In a live video broadcast from a rally commemorating the late Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on the anniversary of his assassination in a 2020 U.S. drone strike, Nasrallah threatened Hezbollah would fight Israel with no ""limits, ceiling, rules or restraints.""
""Who thinks of [engaging] in a war with us, he will regret it if God wills,"" Nasrallah said adding that such a wider war would be ""very, very, very costly."""

GANDHINAGAR, India (Reuters) -India's Gujarat state is in talks with chipmakers in Japan, South Korea and the United States for investments in the state, its top minister said on Thursday, in pursuit of India's ambitions of becoming a chipmaker for the world.
Semiconductor manufacturing is one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's key business agendas but initial bids to offer $10 billion in incentives to the chipmaking industry have floundered, with some proposals stalled or cancelled.
Gujarat, which is Modi's home state and one of India's major industrial hubs, has recently held investment talks with some chipmakers, and officials have visited Japan to meet some executives from the chips industry there, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel told Reuters in an interview.
""We continue to hold investment talks with semiconductor companies in Japan, South Korea and the U.S.,"" he said, without disclosing names of the companies citing ""non disclosure agreements"".
India's chipmaking ambitions, first laid out in 2021, have suffered setbacks and the country does not yet have any semiconductor manufacturing plants.
Taiwan's Foxconn backed out of a $19.5 billion chips joint venture with India's Vedanta, saying ""the project was not moving fast enough"". Foxconn and Vedanta have since decided to go solo, and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries is also exploring opportunities.
Gujarat has also held talks with Foxconn over a semiconductor plant, and U.S. memory chip firm Micron Technology Inc is also building a chip assembly and testing facility in the state.
Patel's comments come ahead of the biennial Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit next week in which the state expects to secure investments in sectors including renewable energy, electric vehicles and electronics manufacturing.
The summit is expected to draw a record number of foreign and domestic investors to the western state in what is seen as Modi's big push to promote investment in the country just months ahead of national elections, in which he will seek a third term.
India is increasingly becoming a sought after investment destination, especially as companies look to diversify their supply chain beyond China.
Tom Bailey, head of ETF Research at HANetf, said India was at an advantage due to its large size and an increasingly educated population.
""The moves are emblematic of the rise of the so-called 'China plus one' supply chain diversification strategies of multinationals,"" he said.

LSN0BKRVWA-120,Israel warns of ‘short window’ to remove Hezbollah from Lebanon border,Paul Nuki,"January 5, 2024 at 3:46 AM·6 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-warns-short-window-remove-194641371.html,"Israel’s defence minister warned on Thursday that there is only a “short window” of time for a United States-led diplomatic push to secure Hezbollah’s removal from its border and prevent a new front opening in the north.
The comment came as some fighters in the Lebanese terrorist group’s elite Radwan force, set up to infiltrate Israel, pulled back from the border, Israeli military sources told The Telegraph.
Yoav Gallant told Amos Hochstein, the US special envoy, that Israel would not tolerate the militant group on its border post-Oct 7 and that an inflection point was fast approaching where it would be removed by either diplomatic or military means.
“There is only one possible result – a new reality in the northern arena, which will enable the secure return of our citizens,” Mr Gallant told Mr Hochstein, who arrived in Israel on Thursday in an urgent bid to prevent a new Israel-Lebanon war.
“Yet we find ourselves at a junction. There is a short window of time for diplomatic understandings, which we prefer. We will not tolerate the threats posed by the Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, and we will ensure the security of our citizens,” he added.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, repeated the message to Mr Hochstein, saying that the return of Israeli citizens to their homes in the north was one of the main goals of the war. Dozens of towns near the border have been evacuated for fear of a cross-border incursion.
Tensions in the north have soared following a drone strike in a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut on Tuesday that killed several senior Hamas operatives, including Saleh al-Arouri, the group’s deputy political leader.
American, French and British diplomats are now rushing to try to negotiate the implementation of UN resolution 1701, which calls for the establishment of a demilitarised zone between Israel and the Litani river in southern Lebanon.
The resolution was agreed by both sides following the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war but never properly implemented or enforced by the UN.
As tensions on the border have escalated since Oct 7, with daily rocket attacks and an estimated 140 Hezbollah and other militants killed, France has launched a concerted diplomatic push in Lebanon but has largely been rebuffed.
A visit by a French envoy in early December resulted in a venomous attack on Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper.
“The narcissistic French president didn’t get even for a moment that the Arabs all know the limits of France’s power,” it said.
“But the man likes to play with the big boys, and despite France not holding cards enabling it to sit at the table, its president jumps up from the back benches and asks to give him a position.”
Israeli military analysts are sceptical that a meaningful diplomatic solution can be reached and that Israel would be alert to the “charade” of compliance with 1701.
Brigadier general (Res) Assaf Orion, a former head of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) strategic division and a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that some of Hezbollah’s Radwan forces had been withdrawn from the border area but that was probably for “tactical” reasons.
He said that the IDF remained “massively deployed” in defensive positions along the border, adding: “There’s no use in keeping a fast assault force in place when you’re not going to use it and when your surprise is gone, so they are falling back.”
The same thinking would probably prevail longer term, Mr Orion said. “They will say ‘we’re fully committed to [resolution] 1701 and you must stop Israeli’s aggression’ and all that jazz. But the actual action – the troop deployment – will be mostly affected by Israel’s force employment and not by diplomacy.”
A diplomatic agreement may be enough to return the 80,000 residents of the evacuated Israeli towns and kibbutzim to their homes along the Lebanon border but whether it would suffice for the Israeli defence establishment was not yet clear, Mr Orion said.
He said that there has been a “transformation” in the country’s thinking about security post-Oct 7; Israel had misjudged Hamas’s intentions before the attack and had pledged not to make the same mistake again.
It had said that it would not tolerate militarily capable terrorist groups camped on its borders, while its military philosophy had shifted from “degrade and deter” to “degrade and defeat”, Mr Orion added.
A senior official in the Biden administration told reporters on Wednesday that Mr Hochstein had met with Abdallah Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, and that the United States has a “diplomatic effort underway to help resolve some of the tension” between Israel and Hezbollah, without elaborating further.
Hezbollah meanwhile was reported to be “demanding political reassurances” within Lebanon in return for the implementation of resolution 1701.
A senior Lebanese military commander inferred that it was trying to secure the Lebanese presidency in return for its cooperation.
“The presidency is not a consolation prize, neither at the level of the domestic situation, nor in terms of the strategic equations,” Samir Geagea, the leader of the Lebanese Forces, is reported to have said.
“The implementation of [resolution] 1701 has nothing to do with the presidential post in any way whatsoever,” he stressed.
Mr Gallant is reported to have pushed to attack Hezbollah immediately after Oct 7 but was talked down by the United States, which wanted time to assemble a naval task force in the area to bolster Israel’s air defences.
He may now push again to open a new front in the north – Israel’s towns in the north have already been evacuated, the fighting in Gaza is slowing, the American task force remains in place and there remains popular support for the war in Israel.
Nevertheless, Hezbollah is a much more formidable force than Hamas in terms of numbers, professionalism and capability.
Its arsenal of rockets, many precision guided, is said to number up to 150,000 – more than enough to overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome air-defence system.
Mr Orion said that the scale of a war in Lebanon had yet to be fully internalised by the Israeli public and would not be taken lightly by any political leader.
“As [the Israeli politician] Benny Gantz used to tell the general staff [of the IDF]: operations we do when we can, wars we do when we must.”
On Thursday, more than 1,000 mourners attended the funeral of Arouri in Beirut, calling on Hamas to avenge his death.
A machine gun was laid on top of his coffin and those of two other Hamas military wing commanders also killed in the Israeli drone strike.

CBM9Y9ZTQG-121,Israel-Hamas war: IDF 'dismantling Hamas command centres' in Khan Younis,Maighna Nanu,"January 4, 2024 at 8:13 AM·15 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-hamas-war-idf-dismantling-161326146.html,"The Israeli military has said it is dismantling Hamas command and control centres in Gaza’s key southern city of Khan Younis.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had killed a number of Hamas fighters in the area and had “significantly damaged” the group’s terror infrastructure during recent operations.
Col Mickey Sharvit, commander of the Kiryati Brigade, said there was “no innocent infrastructure” in the areas in which the IDF is operating amid mounting calls for the Israeli military to do more to safeguard civilians.
“We encounter terror in almost every home, in hospitals and schools. Our forces even eliminated terrorists who emerged from an underground [tunnel] in a school,” he said.
The update came as fresh Israeli shelling killed 14 Palestinians in Khan Younis, including nine children, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.
Gaza residents also said Israeli planes and tanks had bombarded three refugee camps in the centre of the enclave during attacks that were heavier than those experienced for several days.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the claims.
Thanks for following today’s liveblog.
We will be back tomorrow with all the latest updates.
Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, has said that the time-span for a diplomatic resolution with Hezbollah is “limited”.
Mr Gallant told Amos Hochstein, a US diplomatic envoy, that “Israel would prefer to resolve the military conflict with Hezbollah through diplomatic means, but the time span for this is limited.”
Mr Hochstein, an adviser to Joe Biden, is working to soothe tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, a senior US official told Reuters.
Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, and Catherine Colonna, French foreign minister, agreed to seek steps to avoid wider conflict in the Middle East following strikes in Lebanon and Iran, the US State Department said.
In a telephone call the day before, the two top diplomats “discussed the importance of measures to prevent the conflict in Gaza from expanding, including affirmative steps to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank and to avoid escalation in Lebanon and Iran,” Matthew Miller, State Department spokesman, said.
It comes ahead of another trip to the Middle East by Mr Blinken, his fourth since Hamas fighters infiltrated Israel and carried out a major attack on October 7, triggering massive Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called on Israel to avoid escalation earlier, “particularly in Lebanon,” where Israel was suspected to be carrying out a strike on Tuesday that killed a senior Hamas leader.
Hundreds of people attended the funeral of Hamas number two Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut who was killed during a strike on Lebanon that has been blamed on Israel.
Calling on Hamas to avenge his death and the killing of five other members of the Palestinian militant group on Tuesday, the mourners gathered at a mosque to recite the prayer of the dead before marching to Shatila refugee camp, where three of the Hamas members were to be buried.
The coffins of the three, Aruri, Azzam al-Aqraa, of the Hamas military wing Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and Mohammad al-Rais, were draped in Palestinian and Hamas flags.
A machine gun was laid on top of each coffin and heavy gunfire rang out as the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery, drowning out chants of “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest) by mourners waving Palestinian flags and those of Hamas ally Islamic Jihad.
“Abu Obeida, bomb Tel Aviv,” the mourners shouted, addressing the Gaza spokesman of the Hamas military wing by his nom de guerre.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have strongly condemned comments by two Israeli ministers calling for Palestinians to emigrate from the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for “a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents” and the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip on Monday, a day after far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich made similar comments.
Saudi Arabia “categorically condemns and rejects the comments of the two ministers”, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
The nation called on the international community to act in the face of the Israeli government’s “persistence” in violating international law “through its statements and actions”.
Qatar, which played a mediating role in the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas at the end of November, also “condemned in the strongest terms” the comments made by the two ministers.
The Israeli government under prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not officially suggested plans to evict Gazans or to send Jewish settlers back to the territory since the war broke out in October.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels must stop their “illegal” attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea or “action will be taken”, Lord Cameron has said.
“It’s not to do with Gaza, it’s not to do with Israel,” Britain’s foreign secretary told reporters on a visit to Pristina, Kosovo.
“This is about the freedom of navigation. This is about the ability of ships to carry their cargo.
“The world economy, every economy, will suffer if ships keep coming under attack in this illegal and unacceptable way. And these attacks need to stop or actions will be taken.”
Israeli forces searched houses in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm on Thursday, detaining hundreds of people suspected of militant activities, the military said.
Tulkarm, the location of one of the main crossing points between the West Bank and Israel, has seen repeated raids by security forces since the October 7 attack by Hamas.
According to residents, Israeli forces detained at least 120 people and demolished three houses, including one belonging to a member of the Tulkarm Brigades, an armed militant group linked to the Palestinian faction Fatah.
In a statement, the military said: “IDF forces continue to operate, alongside other Israeli security forces, in a broad divisional operation to suppress terrorism in the Nur Shams refugee camp in Menashe.”
The Tulkarm Brigades said fighters were exchanging fire with the Israeli forces.
Iran observed a day of mourning on Thursday for the at least 84 people killed when twin explosions ripped through a crowd commemorating the slain Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani.
The death toll was revised down from around 100 the day after what Iranian authorities labelled a “terrorist attack”, which also left hundreds wounded near Soleimani’s tomb in the southern city of Kerman.
No one claimed responsibility for the explosions in Iran, which has suffered deadly attacks in the past from jihadists and other militants. The country has also seen the targeted killings of officials and nuclear scientists, thought to be at the hands of Israel.
The blasts ripped through crowds who had come to honour Soleimani, four years after a US drone strike in Baghdad killed the veteran senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader,  blamed “evil and criminal enemies” of the Islamic republic  on Wednesday, without naming them, and vowed a “harsh response”.
Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has said he is “very disturbed” by high-level Israeli officials’ statements on plans to transfer civilians from Gaza to third countries.

The funeral of slain Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri will take place at 3pm this afternoon in the Lebanese capital Beirut, according to a Hamas official, reports Lizzie Porter, in Jerusalem.
Arouri will be buried after a ceremony at the Imam Ali mosque in the Tariq al-Jadida area of Beirut, the official said.
The deputy head of Hamas’ politburo and leader of its operations in the occupied West Bank was assassinated in an Israeli drone strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday night.
Israel is unlikely to attack the funeral procession, which would be seen in Lebanon as a further provocation. Tensions between the two countries are already on a knife edge with daily cross-border exchanges of fire as Lebanese militants Hezbollah fight in solidarity with Hamas gunmen in Gaza.
A senior Biden education official has resigned, claiming the administration was turning a “blind eye” to atrocities committed in Gaza.
Tariq Habash, who was a political appointee, said he could not represent an administration that “does not value all human life equally.”
Mr Habash, a Palestinian American, wrote in his resignation letter: “I cannot stay silent as this administration turns a blind eye to the atrocities committed against innocent Palestinian lives, in what leading human rights experts have called a genocidal campaign by the Israeli government.”
He added: “I cannot be quietly complicit as this administration fails to leverage its influence as Israel’s strongest ally to halt the abusive and ongoing collective punishment tactics that have cut off Palestinians in Gaza from food, water, electricity, fuel, and medical supplies, leading to widespread disease and starvation.”
It marks the first resignation of a political appointee over Mr Biden’s Israel policy. Mr Habash was a policy advisor in the Education department’s Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development.
Members of the UN Security Council called on Yemen’s Houthis to halt their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, saying they are illegal and threaten regional stability, freedom of navigation and global food supplies.
Addressing the council’s first formal meeting of 2024, members also demanded that the Houthis release the Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated cargo ship linked to an Israeli company, and its crew, which the group seized on November 19.
Some members urged the council to take action to halt the Houthi missile and drone attacks. But the body took no formal steps in the open session before going into closed consultations.
The United States believes the situation has reached an “inflection point,” Chris Lu, a US representative to the United Nations, told the council.
“These attacks pose grave implications for maritime security, international shipping and commerce, and they undermine the fragile humanitarian situation in Yemen,” threatening aid deliveries to the war-torn country, Mr Lu said.
At 6pm Beirut time, the world tuned in to listen to Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, the region’s foremost militant group.
Would he unleash a hellfire of rockets on Israel in revenge for Tuesday’s killing of a Hamas delegation on Lebanese soil, or would he hold off?
And what of the twin explosions that ripped through a crowd in the Iranian city of Kerman on Wednesday, killing more than 100 civilians near the grave of the slain Revolutionary Guards general Qassem Soleimani?
Would that also be attributed to Israel and, if so, might Iran order its proxy Hezbollah and Nasrallah to launch a major assault on Israel?

Neither Hezbollah nor Israel want a war, a US official has suggested, amid growing fears of a wider regional conflict.
“From everything that we can tell, there is no clear desire for Hezbollah to go to war with Israel and vice versa,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In a speech in Beirut on Wednesday, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, vowed that his powerful Iran-backed Shi’ite militia “cannot be silent” following the killing of Hamas deputy Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday.
Nasrallah said his heavily armed forces would fight to the finish if Israel chose to extend the war to Lebanon, but he made no concrete threats to act against Israel in support of Hamas, Hezbollah’s ally also backed by Iran.
Israel neither confirmed nor denied assassinating Arouri but has promised to annihilate Hamas.
Anthony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, will visit the Middle East on his fourth trip to the region since the October 7 attack.
The top US diplomat will leave Thursday evening from Washington on a trip that will include Israel, the US official said, on condition of anonymity.
It will mark Mr Blinken’s fourth trip to the region and fifth to Israel - excluding a visit accompanying President Joe Biden - since Hamas militants carried out the deadliest-ever attack inside Israel on October 7, triggering massive retaliation.
Ahead of the announcement of Mr Blinken’s visit, Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, echoed the fears of many across the Middle East about the Israel-Hamas war expanding.
“It is in no one’s interest - not in the interest of any country in the region, not in the interest of any country in the world - to see this conflict escalated any further than it already is,” Mr Miller said.
An imam who was shot on Wednesday outside a mosque in New Jersey has died, the US state’s attorney general said, adding that the killing did not initially appear to be driven by “bias” or domestic terrorism.
Hassan Sharif was shot multiple times near a mosque in Newark, just west of New York, before being taken to hospital where he later died, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said.
“We do not yet know the motivation for this crime [but] the evidence collected thus far does not indicate that this was an act motivated by bias, or an act of domestic terrorism,” said Platkin.
He added that “in light of global events, and with a rise in bias that many communities are experiencing across our state - particularly the Muslim community - there are many in New Jersey right now who are feeling a heightened sense of fear.”
The state is home to 300,000 Muslim Americans, he said.
China said it was “deeply shocked” by twin bomb blasts that killed at least 95 people in Iran, with whom Beijing has close ties.
The two explosions on Wednesday - labelled a “terrorist attack” by Iran’s state media and regional authorities - sparked fears of a widening conflict in the region.
Wang Wenbin, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said Beijing was “deeply shocked by the serious terrorist attack... which resulted in heavy casualties”.
“We express our deep condolences to the victims and our sincere sympathy to the injured and the families of the victims,” he said at a regular press conference.
“China opposes all forms of terrorism, strongly condemns terrorist attacks and firmly supports Iran’s efforts to maintain national security and stability,” he added.
Iran blamed the blast on Israel and the United States and its supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed a “harsh response”. The United States has denied involvement.

W2PHQVGGQ5-124,Parents of Cyprus school volleyball team players killed in Turkish quake testify against hotel owner,Associated Press,"January 4, 2024 at 7:35 AM·2 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/parents-cyprus-school-volleyball-team-133536389.html,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Parents of school volleyball team players who perished when their hotel crumbled in last year’s powerful earthquake testified in the trial against the hotel’s owner Thursday, with one father describing how hopes of finding his two children alive quickly turned to despair.
The hotel owner and 10 other people are standing trial accused of negligence over the deaths of 72 people, including members of the team who had traveled from the breakaway north of ethnically divided Cyprus to attend a competition.
A total of 39 students, their teachers and parents were staying in the Isias Grand Hotel in the city of Adiyaman when the region was hit by a 7.8-magnitude quake and an equally strong aftershock. Thirty-five of them died. A group of tourist guides were also guests at the hotel.
The trial, which opened on Wednesday, is the first relating to the Feb. 6, 2022 earthquake that hit Adiyaman and 10 other provinces in southern Turkey, leaving more than 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
The hotel’s owner, Ahmet Bozkurt, family members and other defendants face between 32 months and more than 22 years in prison if found guilty of charges of “willful negligence.”
Bozkurt has denied the charges against him, insisting there was no wrongdoing.
“The disaster of the century occurred,” the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying in his defense. “My hotel was destroyed, just like 850,000 other constructions.”
Among those who testified on Thursday was Osman Akin, a gym teacher from northern Cyprus, who lost two of his children in the hotel rubble.
Akin and 16 other people were staying at a special lodge for teachers in the neighboring province of Kahramanmaras - the epicenter of the quake - which he said resisted the tremblor.
“We left (the lodge in Kahramanmaras) without even a nosebleed,” Anadolu quoted him as saying.
“Our children aged between 11 and 14 were buried in a rubble of sand (in Adiyaman). We hoped to reach our children (alive) and when that hope ended, we wanted to find (their bodies) in one piece,” he said.
Irem Aydogdu, whose sister Imran was among the victims, asked that the defendants be handed heavy sentences.
“My sister suffocated in a pile of sand,” she said. “These children were the bright faces and the pride of Cyprus.”
The indictment claims the hotel was initially built as a residence, that another floor was added to the structure in 2016, that building regulations were not complied with and that materials used in the construction were of inferior quality, according to Anadolu.
Poor construction and failure to enforce building codes even in Turkey's earthquake-prone areas has been blamed for the extent of the destruction."
BWZVTR3EEY-125,Pornhub Is Now Blocked in Montana and North Carolina,Complex,"January 5, 2024 at 5:54 AM·2 min read",20240104,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/pornhub-now-blocked-montana-north-215406337.html,"To kick off 2024, Pornhub has blocked its website in North Carolina and Montana in protest of the bills from the two states regulating online pornography access.
As reported by 404Media, Pornhub has restricted access to its website and other Aylo-operated pornographic content services, which include Brazzers and Redtube, because the states introduced legislation prohibiting users from enjoying porn online without ID verification proving they're 18 or older. Pornhub isn't against the idea of age-gating adult content, but the company wants device identifiers for age verification instead of the methods imposed by the legislation in these states.
Per the Associated Press, North Carolina snuck the ID verification to view porn law into its bill on high school computer curriculum, while Montana passed a standalone ID verification law in May, 2023. If people in these states want to view pornographic material online, they will need to present ""digitized identification"" to verify their age or use a third-party verification tool.
If users in these states attempt to access Pornhub, they will be greeted with a video with adult video star Cherie DeVille explaining why they can't use it. In addition, there's a message from the company explaining how the legislation could potentially cause more harm than good.
""While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit and adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk,"" the statement reads. ""In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we've seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.""
Montana and North Carolina join a growing list of states with restricted access to Pornhub. Louisiana, Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Utah already passed legislation similar to that in the other two states.

04QGXS5BER-126,Prince Andrew named in Jeffrey Epstein court documents as secret files made public,Tara Cobham,"January 4, 2024 at 7:52 PM·4 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/prince-andrew-named-jeffrey-epstein-091216344.html,"Prince Andrew has been named in court documents relating to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein after a judge ordered the release of secret case files.
US Judge Loretta Preska ruled on 18 December that documents believed to relate to more than 150 people who were either associates, friends or victims of disgraced financier Epstein should be made public.
The trove includes 40 documents of evidence from Johanna Sjoberg, who has claimed the Duke of York touched her breast while sitting on a couch inside the US billionaire’s Manhattan apartment in 2001.
In her 2015 testimony, Ms Sjoberg said Maxwell called her to an upstairs closet, and showed her a puppet of the prince.
“I just remember someone suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get on the couch,” she recalled. “And so Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet, the puppet on her lap.
“And so then I sat on Andrew’s lap, and I believe on my own volition, and they took the puppet’s hands and put it on Virginia’s breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.”
The prince has always strongly denied the allegations against him, while Buckingham Palace previously said all accusations made against the duke are “categorically untrue”.
In her deposition, Maxwell recalls Andrew visiting Epstein’s home in the US Virgin Islands once, and insisted there were “no girls” present.
One of the other exhibits unsealed on Wednesday included a 2015 email sent by Maxwell in which she appeared to reference Prince Andrew and former US president Bill Clinton.
“I have already suffered such a terrible and painful loss over the last few days that I can’t even see what life after press he’ll even looks like - statements that don’t address all just lead to more questions,” Maxwell wrote, according to the documents. “... what is my relationship to clinton ? Andrew on and on. Let’s rest till monday. I need head space.”
The legal files are part of a 2015 US defamation case by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite who supplied Epstein with underage girls. Ms Giuffre appeared in an infamous photograph when she was younger, alongside Andrew and Maxwell.
Although the case was settled in 2017, Maxwell’s attorneys had fought for the names to continue to remain private. Their objection was lifted in 2022, a year after she was convicted and sentenced to two decades in prison, following arguments from representatives of the media that documents that were sealed as part of the case should be made public.
The files identify individuals whose names had been previously redacted. Judge Preska ordered some individuals should be named because they had already given interviews to the media – including Ms Sjoberg.
Those listed include “alleged victims, people not accused of wrongdoing…and absent third parties.” Being identified through the court documents does not necessarily mean that the individual was involved in or aware of any wrongdoing by Epstein.
The parties had until midnight on 1 January to object to the ruling, with only 10 people identified in the papers successfully arguing that their right to privacy as victims outweighs the public’s right to know their names.
Andrew stepped down from public life after the furore over his friendship with Epstein and paid millions to settle a civil sexual assault case to Ms Giuffre, a woman he claimed never to have met.
The duke was cast out of the working monarchy and no longer uses his HRH style after Ms Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein, accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17. Andrew has denied the claims.
Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.
Maxwell has been imprisoned since July 2020, despite numerous attempts from her defence counsel to have her released on bail. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison at the federal court in the Southern District of New York in June last year.
The socialite indicated her desire to appeal shortly after her conviction, with her lawyers claiming victims had “faded, distorted and motivated memories”. Her appeal is currently scheduled to be heard in November next year."
JZ64GPOB2A-127,Putin speeds up a citizenship path for foreigners who enlist in the Russian military,DASHA LITVINOVA,"January 4, 2024 at 12:06 PM·4 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-speeds-citizenship-path-foreigners-180629110.html,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a decree that speeds up a path to Russian citizenship for foreigners who enlist in the country's military amid the 22-month-old war in Ukraine.
The move comes as Moscow is trying to replenish its troops in Ukraine by various methods, including the recruitment of migrants. Russia is a magnet for hundreds of thousands of people from poorer Central Asian countries, and many of them seek citizenship each year.
Putin first allowed fast-track citizenship for foreigners who sign contracts with the Russian army in September 2022, shortly after announcing a partial mobilization to draft 300,000 reservists for Ukraine.
Those immigrants who signed a contract for at least a year and take part in active hostilities for at least six months were allowed to apply for citizenship without demonstrating sufficient knowledge of Russian or the fact that they'd lived in the country for five straight years under a residency permit. Spouses and children were also eligible to apply. Authorities were obligated to decide on such applications within three months, according a presidential decree at the time.
Another Putin decree from May 2023 additionally simplified the procedure: the clause about participating in active hostilities for at least six months was removed, and anyone who signed at least a year-long contract during the Kremlin's “special military operation” in Ukraine, as well as their spouses and children, was allowed to apply in the fast-track procedure.
The decree signed Thursday made the citizenship path even quicker, saying a decision on such applications shouldn't take more than a month, instead of three. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on why Putin decided on that change.
The new decree comes amid regular media reports of police raids in Russian cities that target migrants According to the reports, those detained in such raids are often offered or even pressured to sign contracts with the military, and those who have recently acquired Russian citizenship are sent to enlistment offices to determine whether they're eligible for mandatory service.
The most recent raid, reported by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, took place on New Year's Eve in St. Petersburg and saw more than 3,000 migrants detained in the streets. The report cited an anonymous police source as saying the goal of the raid was finding men to recruit into the army.
In fall 2022, Moscow authorities ran advertisements for enlistment and offers of fast-track citizenship in Uzbek, Tajik and Kyrgyz languages on several bus routes, the RBK news outlet reported. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin also promised to set up a makeshift enlistment site at a government service office for migrants outside Moscow.
Since invading Ukraine, Russia's leadership has sought to boost its military strength. Putin has twice ordered it to increase the number of troops, most recently in December, to bring it to a total of 1.32 million. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has declared a force of 1.5 million is needed “to guarantee the fulfillment of tasks to ensure Russia’s security.” He didn’t say when the military would reach that size.
The Kremlin previously considered the size of its military as sufficient, but the calculus changed after hopes for a quick victory were shattered by fierce Ukrainian resistance.
In August 2022, Putin ordered an increase in the size of the Russian military to 1.15 million starting from Jan. 1, 2023. In September 2022, he ordered the mobilization of 300,000 reservists. That number is counted as part of the military’s current strength.
While Putin repeatedly has said there was no need to round up more, his mobilization decree is open-ended, allowing the military to call up additional reservists when needed and essentially keep those already drafted serving indefinitely. That decree also banned soldiers from terminating their contracts.
Regional authorities have tried to bolster the ranks by forming volunteer battalions for Ukraine. Across Russia’s vast territory, a campaign to entice more men to enlist has been underway for months, with advertisements promising cash bonuses, recruiters making cold calls to eligible men, and enlistment offices working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed.
Putin said last month that 486,000 new soldiers have signed contracts with the military in 2023. He didn't say how many of them were foreign nationals.
Some media reports and rights groups say the authorities also have offered amnesty to prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty.
Both Russia and Ukraine have kept a tight lid of secrecy on their military casualties. The Russian military has confirmed only just over 6,000 military casualties, but Western estimates are much higher. In October, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia has “likely suffered 150,000-190,000 permanent casualties,” a number that included troops that have been killed and permanently wounded.

At least 230 Ukrainian prisoners of war returned to their homes and a total of 248 Russian servicemen were released from Ukrainian territory on Wednesday after the United Arab Emirates brokered a swap deal between the two nations.
This is the 49th prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia during the war, Kyiv’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.
The UAE is among a handful nations to have maintained close ties with Russia in spite of Putin’s decision to invade a European neighbour, which has otherwise left Russia isolated on the world stage and facing mounting Western and international sanctions.
Officials from the UAE’s foreign ministry said the successful swap was due to “strong friendly relations between the UAE and both the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine, which were supported by sustained calls at the highest levels”.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said that of the 230 of Ukrainian troops freed, 213 are soldiers and sergeants, 11 are officers and six were civilians.
230 of our people. Today, 213 soldiers and sergeants, 11 officers, and 6 civilians returned home. I am grateful to everyone who achieved this result.We remember each and every one of our people. And we must return all of them.🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/RCeYnLYPn4
— Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) January 3, 2024
“Despite all of the challenges, we have good news today. 230 freed people. Initially, there was no information about some of them being held captive. They were considered missing in action. It is critical to keep hope alive,” he said.
Ukraine is seizing every opportunity and raising the issue of returning prisoners of war at any international meeting that may be helpful, he said, adding that negotiations have “not ceased for a single moment”.
Ukraine will keep working to bring back its people, Mr Zelensky said, thanking top officials in Kyiv who worked on the exchange.
Some of the Ukrainians released yesterday were held by Russia since 2022. Among them were those who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine’s Snake Island and the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
Russia has not offered any details of the exchange of its prisoners with Ukraine."

Russia is also looking to obtain missiles from its ally Iran as it runs short of arms nearly two years into President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, it said.
The White House's comments came as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for boosting production of missile launchers in preparation for a ""military showdown"" with South Korea and the United States, the official Korean Central News Agency said.
The Pyongyang-supplied missiles with ranges of around 900 kilometers (550 miles) were fired by Russia in two attacks on Ukraine within the past week, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
""Our information indicates that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile launchers and several ballistic missiles,"" Kirby told reporters in a briefing at the White House.
""This is a significant and concerning escalation of the DPRK's support for Russia.""
The development underscored the need for the US Congress to pass a package of vital military aid for Ukraine, without which the pipeline of support will soon run dry, Kirby added.
Air defenses for Ukraine, which has come under a barrage of aerial attacks by Russia in recent days, were ""absolutely"" a priority, he said.
""It's critical that Congress meets this moment and responds by providing the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves,"" Kirby said.
Russian forces launched at least one of the North Korean-supplied missiles on December 30, which landed in an open field in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to the spokesman.
Moscow's forces then fired ""multiple"" ballistic missiles into Ukraine as part of a mass aerial attack on January 2, he added.
- Intensifying strikes -
Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University, told AFP that the Moscow-Pyongyang arms transfers could be Russia's way of ""expressing its annoyance"" over Seoul's own role in the war.
South Korea, which is a major arms exporter, ""has been assisting Ukraine indirectly through an arms deal with NATO countries to make up for their arms supplies to Kyiv,"" he said.
Seoul has signed deals worth billions of dollars to send tanks and howitzers to Poland, a key ally of Ukraine.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered this arms race between the two Koreas,"" Choi added.
The United States and its allies will raise the fresh arms transfers at the United Nations Security Council, as it represents a breach of UN sanctions against North Korea, said Kirby.
Britain said it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's use of North Korean missiles.
""Russia is turning to North Korea for its weapons in pursuit of its cynical and ill-conceived military aims in Ukraine. This is symptomatic of its isolation on the world stage and a sign of its desperation,"" a Foreign Office statement said.
North Korea would pay a ""high price"" for breaching UN sanctions, it added.
Russia also intends to purchase missiles from its ally Iran and talks are under way on the purchase of close-range ballistic missiles although no agreement has yet been reached, Kirby added.
The United States said in October that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia, but it was the first time it had reported the use of such weapons.
Kim Jong Un traveled to Russia's far east in September and met Putin, sparking concern among Kyiv's allies over the possibility of a potential arms deal.
Putin, who launched his invasion in February 2022, promised to intensify strikes on Ukraine after an unprecedented attack on the Russian city of Belgorod over the weekend.
Kyiv says the latest attacks underline the need for Western allies to speed up delivery of air defense equipment, combat drones and long-range missiles.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed in his New Year's address last week to wreak ""wrath"" against Russian forces in 2024, warning Kyiv had upped domestic production.

39U3WM5XB6-134,Ukraine war: US says Russia using North Korea ballistic missiles,BBC,"January 5, 2024 at 10:19 AM·3 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-us-says-russia-223005077.html,"Russia has used ballistic missiles and launchers supplied by North Korea in its war on Ukraine, the US has said.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called it a ""significant and concerning escalation"" relating to Pyongyang's support for Russia.
He said the US would raise the matter at the UN Security Council and impose additional sanctions on those working to facilitate arms transfers.
Moscow has denied any such collaboration.
Hours after the White House made the accusations, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for missile launch vehicle production to be expanded in the country.
The North Korean leader visited Russia to discuss potential military co-operation in September.
The US has previously accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons, but this is the first time US intelligence has shared details about ballistic missiles - self-guided rockets that can reach targets 900km (500 miles) away.
It is unclear what North Korea will get in return for providing the weapons to Russia. Some Western countries have raised concerns over the potential transfer of weapons or military technologies to Pyongyang.
In 2017, a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank suggested that North Korea was able to quickly develop new missiles by obtaining a Soviet RD-250 rocket engine from illicit channels operating in Russia or Ukraine. Ukraine denied the allegation and said Russia was to blame.
But that year, North Korea was able to rapidly expand its missile arsenal, introducing two new systems: the medium-range Hwasong-12 and the intercontinental Hwasong-14.
Speaking during a White House press briefing on Thursday, Mr Kirby said Russia's procurement of ballistic missiles from North Korea was a direct violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions.
""We will demand that Russia be held accountable for yet again violating its international obligations,"" he said.
He also said the US believed Russia was planning on purchasing close-range missiles from Iran, but that it had not done so yet.
The UK said it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's use of ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea in Ukraine.
""North Korea is subject to a robust sanctions regime, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,"" a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.
In his briefing, Mr Kirby also urged US Congress to approve extra US funding for Ukraine ""without delay"".
""The most effective response to Russia's horrific violence against the Ukrainian people is to continue to provide Ukraine with vital air defence capabilities and other types of military equipment,"" he said.
""Iran and the DPRK [North Korea] are standing with Russia. Ukrainians deserve to know that the American people and this government will continue to stand with them.""
The last US military aid package to Ukraine, worth some $250m (£195m), was approved by the White House on 27 December.
Talks on further funding have stalled in Congress because of a lack of support among Republicans, who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal.
Ukraine has warned that its war effort and the country's public finances are at risk if further Western aid does not come soon."

""In response to Russia's activities with Iran and North Korea, we are taking several measures with our allies and our partners,"" he announced.

WVW8CIZEG1-139,What to know about Iran's deadly twin blasts,AFP,"January 5, 2024 at 2:39 AM·3 min read",20240104,https://news.yahoo.com/know-irans-deadly-twin-blasts-150910758.html,"The Islamic State jihadist group said Thursday that it carried out twin bombings which killed 84 people in Iran, but its claim is unlikely to entirely silence those who see an Israeli hand amid its war with Iran ally Hamas.
Labelled a ""terrorist attack"" by Iranian authorities, Wednesday's bombings hit crowds commemorating Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani, four years after his death in a US drone strike.
Soleimani, who headed the Guards' foreign operations arm the Quds Force, was also a staunch enemy of IS, a Sunni Muslim extremist group which has carried out previous attacks in majority-Shiite Iran.
In a statement on Telegram, IS said two of its members ""activated their explosives vests"" among the crowds who had come to honour Soleimani, who remains a revered figure in Iran.
Iran has yet to complete its investigation into the twin suicide bombings but here is a look at what we know so far:
- What happened? -
The bombers struck near the Martyrs Cemetery at the Saheb al-Zaman Mosque in Kerman, Soleimani's southern hometown where he is buried.
Iranian investigators had already confirmed that the first blast at least was the work of a ""suicide bomber"" and believed the trigger for the second was ""very probably another suicide bomber"", the official IRNA news agency reported earlier, citing an ""informed source"".
- Who's to blame?  -
Speaking before IS published its claim, President Ebrahim Raisi's deputy chief of staff for political affairs, Mohammad Jamshidi, charged that ""the responsibility for this crime lies with the US and Zionist regimes (Israel) and terrorism is just a tool"".
Current Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani said the Kerman crowd was ""attacked by bloodthirsty people supplied by the United States and the Zionist regime"".
Iran has long fought a shadow war of killings and sabotage with arch enemy Israel, and regularly accuses it, along with the United States, of inciting unrest in the country.
But for Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, Wednesday's attack ""doesn't have the hallmarks of previous Israeli covert ops in Iran"", referring to killings of officials and nuclear scientists blamed on Israel.
Washington rejected any suggestion that it or ally Israel was behind the deadly blasts, while Israel declined to comment.
""The United States was not involved in any way, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous,"" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
The Security Council called on all UN member states on Thursday ""to cooperate actively"" with Iran in holding ""perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable"".
""Any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,"" the Security Council statement said.
- What's next? -
Iranian security analyst Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh said the attacks may have involved Sunni extremists but ""were not possible without"" US and Israeli intelligence services.
He said they could be ""a sign sent to force Iran to negotiate and ask it to cooperate in the management of regional tensions"".
The United States has accused Iran of ""actively facilitating"" attacks on US forces in the Middle East. It also said Tehran was ""deeply involved"" in attacks by Yemen's Huthi rebels on merchant vessels in the Red Sea.
President Ebrahim Raisi has said Iran sees it as ""its duty to support the resistance groups"" but insisted that they ""are independent in their opinion, decision and action"".
Iran has been actively battling jihadist and extremist groups that have claimed multiple attacks in the country over the years.
""The next question is how is Iran going to respond,"" said Vaez.
""If it blames Israel, it is likely to try to respond in kind -- targeting high value or soft targets somewhere.
""If it blames IS... expect arrests/executions and even missiles fired into their bases in the region.""

2IE34267R8-143,California lieutenant governor ‘swatted’ after push to boot Trump from ballot,Christopher Cadelago,"January 5, 2024 at 7:50 AM·2 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/california-lieutenant-governor-swatted-push-235055543.html,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the victim of a “swatting” call last weekend at her San Francisco home, authorities confirmed exclusively to POLITICO, following a series of elected officials being targeted with phony calls to police after they pushed to remove former President Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot.
The incident at Kounalakis’ Pacific Heights condominium came days after California’s No. 2 official wrote to California Secretary of State Shirley Weber urging her to exclude Trump from California’s 2024 primary. Weber did not acquiesce to Kounalakis’ request, siding with Gov. Gavin Newsom who telegraphed to fellow Democrats not to get ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court and dismissed the moves as “political distraction.”
San Francisco Police responded to Kounalakis’ home about 11:20 a.m. on Dec. 30 after receiving reports of a possible shooting. The officers arrived on the scene and determined there was no merit to the call, public information officer Eve Laokwansathitaya said Thursday.
Kounalakis and her husband, Markos, were not at home at the time, said Aleksandra Reetz, the lieutenant governor’s deputy chief of staff. Their two college-aged sons were there when police arrived, Reetz confirmed to POLITICO.
Kounalakis, a candidate for governor in 2026, is the latest politician to have an armed response arrive at her doorstep since the Colorado Supreme Court on Dec. 19 ruled that Trump was ineligible to run for president due to his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Last Friday, state police went to the home of Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows after she barred Trump from the ballot, sparking widespread condemnation from Republicans who note that he hasn’t been convicted of a crime. That incident remains under investigation, and Bellows and her staff continue to receive threatening communications, she told the Portland Press Herald.
A broad range of politicians and other public figures have been targeted by swatting calls for a variety of reasons that aren’t always tied to Trump. The pranks are designed to fool unsuspecting police into responding with force, sometimes with their arms drawn. Callers have reported fake incidents at the homes of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, and Republican Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has claimed multiple incidents, criticizing the FBI while lauding local police for their response.
Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, also a Republican, said that his Naples home was targeted while he and his wife were out on Dec. 27 and called the incident a waste of law enforcement resources “in a sick attempt to terrorize my family.”"
LE53TZQDV9-144,China launches anti-dumping probe into European Union's brandy makers,Paul Godfrey,"January 5, 2024 at 7:30 AM·2 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/china-launches-anti-dumping-probe-133021203.html,"Jan. 5 (UPI) -- China launched an anti-dumping probe Friday into European Union brandy exporters after a preliminary inquiry found their products dominated its multi-billion dollar market and could be unfairly disadvantaging domestic producers.
The Chinese Commerce Ministry probe into brandy imports in containers under 53 gallons, in response to a November complaint filed by the China Liquor Industry Association on behalf of the domestic brandy sector, will look at the impact on Chinese firms, the Ministry of Finance said in a news release.
""According to the evidence provided by the applicant and the preliminary review of the Ministry of Commerce, the total output of the applicant's relevant brandy accounted for the main part of China's total output of similar products in the same period in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and the first half of 2023 which meets investigation criteria set by Anti-Dumpling Regulations,"" the MoF said.
""Dumping"" is the practice of selling goods in another country at below-cost prices as a way of offloading excess supply or increasing market share.
The Chinese probe is an apparent jab at France, the world's largest exporter of fine brandies such as Remy Martin and Hennessy, after Paris played a central role in persuading the European Commission to launch an investigation in September into whether subsidies China provides to its electric vehicle makers were anti-competitive.
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the time that global markers were ""flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars and their prices are kept artificially low by huge state subsidies.""
China reacted angrily to the probe, calling it a ""blatantly protectionist act.""
Three weeks ago, the commission launched a second separate investigation into allegations China was dumping biodiesel onto the E.U.'s $34 billion market for the renewable fuel after a complaint from the bloc's producers that the prices of Chinese imports were ""artificially low.""
China's probe into EU brandy has echoes of a wine war with Australia in 2020 amid deteriorating relations between the two countries in which China slapped duties on Australian imports of up 212% after an investigation found China's domestic winemakers were being unfairly disadvantaged."
Y7NEPI5DT9-145,FDA approves Florida's request to import cheaper drugs from Canada,Brandon Livesay - BBC News,"January 6, 2024 at 3:27 AM·2 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/fda-approves-floridas-request-import-192620272.html,"The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Florida's request to import prescription drugs from Canada to rein in drug prices in the state.
Medicines in Canada can be nearly half the price of US counterparts and some drugs cost almost $400 a pill in Florida.
The FDA's decision could open the door for other states to follow suit.
The major policy shift overrides decades of opposition from the US pharmaceutical industry.
The industry's major lobbying group has already indicated it will try to intervene.
Florida estimates the programme, which allows the import of certain prescription drugs used to treat conditions such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and mental illness, will save state taxpayers up to $150m (£118m) a year.
The sky-high costs of prescription drugs have been an ongoing political issue in the US, where prices are among the highest in the world.
According to a report by the OECD group of industrialised nations, the US spends more than double the average amount spent by other member countries on prescription medicines per capita.
For example, where the UK paid approximately £246 ($314) per head in 2023, the US paid $1,139.
In a statement announcing the FDA's authorisation, Commissioner Robert Califf said the administration would continue to work with states and Indian tribes on these proposals.
""These proposals must demonstrate the programmes would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" he said.
Florida's approval does come with requirements, including how the drugs are labelled and ensuring they meet FDA specifications and standards.
US government targets lowering cost of 10 key drugs
The state's health care administration will need to submit quarterly reports to the FDA that outlines cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
There will also be restrictions on who can access the imported drugs.
The FDA's decision comes after President Joe Biden's executive order in 2021 - which directed federal agencies to work with states on lowering costs through importation plans.
An online statement published on Thursday from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America President and CEO Stephen J Ubl said the FDA's decision was ""reckless"".
He said his organisation would consider ""all options for preventing this policy from harming patients"".
It is not known how Canada's healthcare system will react to Florida's plan, but it could stoke fears of drug shortages for its own citizens.
Canada banned the export of some prescription medicines in 2020 to prevent a shortage in the country after then-US President Donald Trump proposed a plan to import drugs from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans."

Following an 18-month investigation, James said the NRA fostered “a culture of self-dealing, mismanagement and negligent oversight,” costing the group $64 million over three years.
The NRA and LaPierre have denied wrongdoing. The case initially sought to completely dissolve the NRA, but that provision was thrown out last year. James also demanded LaPierre and another executive be removed from their posts.
LaPierre remains a defendant in the case, which is set to go to trial starting Monday.

James hailed LaPierre’s resignation in a statement Friday while committing to continue the case.
“While the end of the Wayne LaPierre era is an important victory in our case, our push for accountability continues. LaPierre’s resignation validates our claims against him, but it will not insulate him or the NRA from accountability,” she said. “Our case will move ahead, and we look forward to proving the facts in court.”
The trial is expected to last about six weeks, with the future of the organization hinging on its outcome.
LaPierre’s lasting legacy
LaPierre led the NRA for over three decades and has been an employee since 1977. In that time, the group has grown from a modest gun safety advocacy group to one of the most powerful lobbying interests in Washington.
Championing legislation in Congress and statehouses across the country, the NRA’s political influence could be felt in every major race, with the group’s endorsements making or breaking many candidacies.
The group also spent hundreds of millions on legal services, challenging gun control measures nationwide.
The group’s major legal victories include last year’s Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which threw out New York state handgun regulation and started a wave of legal challenges to other gun control measures in dozens of states. The NRA supported the suit.

The organization has faced legal and financial trouble in recent years. Outside the ongoing New York civil case, fundraising has fallen since its recent peak in 2016.
The group’s fundraising and membership have fallen steeply in recent years, losing about a half-million members from 2021-22, according to gun violence news nonprofit The Trace.
The organization raised $213 million in 2022, about half of its 2016 total, according to the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
As gun owners and activists begin to look to upstart rival advocacy organizations, the NRA has struggled to keep its title as the king of the gun lobby. Dwindling finances forced the organization to file for bankruptcy in 2021, though a judge ruled that the process could not go forward.
The NRA’s future
The NRA has not been without LaPierre at its head since George H.W. Bush was president. The monumental shift that will likely come with his replacement will define the future of the group.
Long-time NRA executive and Head of General Operations Andrew Arulanandam will become the interim CEO & EVP of the NRA, the group announced Friday.
“On behalf of the NRA Board of Directors, I thank Wayne LaPierre for his service,” NRA President Charles Cotton said. “Wayne has done as much to protect Second Amendment freedom as anyone.”
“Wayne is a towering figure in the fight for constitutional freedom, but one of his other talents is equally important: he built an organization that is bigger than him,” he continued. “Under the direction of Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA will continue to thrive – with a renewed energy in our business operations and grassroots advocacy. Our future is bright and secure.”

LORUSHVO5H-147,"Florida can import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada, US regulators say",The Associated Press,"January 5, 2024 at 11:45 PM·3 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-import-cheaper-prescription-drugs-154546820.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the way for Florida’s first-in-the-nation plan to import lower-priced prescription drugs from Canada, a long-sought approach to accessing cheaper medications that follows decades of frustration with U.S. drug prices.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.
Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.
The policy change represented a seismic shift after decades of lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.
But the politics have shifted in recent years, with both parties — including former President Donald Trump — doubling down on the import approach.
The FDA said Florida’s program will be authorized for two years. Under federal requirements, state officials must test the drugs to make sure they’re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.
Florida’s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
“These proposals must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement.
Many people already buy at least some of their medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, although technically it’s illegal to import them.
Work on allowing state imports began under Trump, a relentless critic of industry pricing.
Under the current regulations, states can import certain medicines through pharmacies and wholesalers. DeSantis has previously estimated taxpayers could save up to $150 million annually under the program.
The state’s proposal includes a number of drug classes, including medications for asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD; diabetes; HIV and AIDS; and mental illness.
The medications would be only for certain people, including foster children, inmates, certain elderly patients and — eventually — Medicaid recipients.
Like most developed nations, Canada sets limits on the prices drugmakers can charge if they wish to enter the market. Health officials there previously have suggested their country’s prescription drug market is too small to have any real impact on U.S. prices.
The U.S. has long had the highest prescription drug prices in the world, with essentially no government limits on what companies can charge. Only in 2022 did Congress pass a law allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for a small number of medications used by seniors in the Medicare program. The first such negotiations are set to take place later this year.

OTYK9JQR1V-148,"Florida can import prescription drugs from Canada, US regulators say",MATTHEW PERRONE,"Updated January 6, 2024 at 6:30 AM·4 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-import-prescription-drugs-canada-153101085.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the way for Florida's first-in-the-nation plan to import prescription drugs from Canada, a long-sought approach to accessing cheaper medications that follows decades of frustration with U.S. drug prices.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.
Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.
The White House called Friday’s action “a step in the right direction,” and encouraged more states to apply for importation.
“For too long, Americans have been forced to pay the highest prescription drug prices of any developed nation,” White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said in a statement.
But even as U.S. politicians applauded the plan, Canadian health providers said it was impractical given the supply challenges the country already faces.
“Historically, we’ve had some pretty devastating drug shortages in Canada,” Joelle Walker, spokesperson for the Canadian Pharmacists Association, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation “So the idea that they could import them from us is not really feasible.""
The policy represents a major shift in the U.S. after years of successful lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.
But the politics surrounding the issue have shifted in recent years, with both parties — including former President Donald Trump — doubling down on the import approach.
Jeff Johnson, director for AARP Florida, said he was excited about the federal decision, though he said it’s only one step of many the group would like to see to help lower prescription drug costs. He noted savings won’t be noticed by most people, but the state will save money overall.
“Unless our healthcare coverage comes through Medicaid or through some another state-run program, we probably won’t save that money on prescription drugs,” Johnson said. “If there are enough different things out there that help reduce drug prices, together they’ll make a difference.”
The FDA said Florida’s program will be authorized for two years, though imports won't begin immediately. Under federal requirements, state officials must first test the drugs to make sure they’re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.
Florida’s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
The FDA action was first reported by The New York Times.
DeSantis, who is battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, previously sued the Biden administration for allegedly delaying approval of the import program. Several other states are also awaiting federal approval.
“After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,” said DeSantis in a statement.
The FDA is likely to face legal challenges over the decision, which the pharmaceutical industry's trade organization called “a serious danger to public health.”
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan,"" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement Friday.

AYR6F49N61-149,Florida gets first-ever FDA approval to import drugs from Canada,Nathaniel Weixel,"January 5, 2024 at 11:21 PM·2 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-gets-first-ever-fda-152106638.html,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved Florida’s plan to import certain prescription drugs directly from Canada, the first time a state has ever been allowed to do so.
The approval marks a major shift in U.S. drug policy and comes despite fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which is likely to sue. The FDA has also raised safety concerns about importing drugs from outside the U.S., because it can’t guarantee their safety.
Individuals are allowed to buy from Canadian pharmacies, but states have long sought to purchase cheaper drugs directly from Canadian wholesalers.
Prescription drugs are cheaper in Canada, as in most other countries, because the government can directly negotiate the price with drug companies.
The approval marks a political victory for both President Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate, both of whom have been prioritizing lowering drug prices.
The Trump administration in 2020 issued rules allowing states to apply for drug importation, and Florida was the first to apply. A 2021 executive order from Biden gave the policy new momentum and directed federal agencies to work with states on importation plans.
But FDA inaction led DeSantis to sue the agency, accusing it of “reckless delay” in approving the request.
According to Florida, the state will begin by providing prescription drugs in a small number of drug classes, including medications to help individuals who have chronic health conditions such as asthma, COPD, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental illness.
Only state programs, including Medicaid, the prison system and facilities run by the Department of Children & Families, would get the imported drugs.
The industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and two other groups sued the Trump administration in 2020 over the importation effort, but the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge last year.
In a statement Friday, the group said it was “considering all options” for preventing the policy from happening.
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan. Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health. Politicians need to stop getting between Americans and their health care,” PhRMA President and CEO Stephen J. Ubl said.
“PhRMA is considering all options for preventing this policy from harming patients.”

VKLFTMLJ6C-150,Florida will soon be able to import prescription drugs from Canada. What to know,Michelle Marchante,"January 5, 2024 at 10:18 AM·6 min read",20240105,https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-soon-able-import-prescription-161858549.html,"Florida is the first state to be given the OK by federal regulators to import certain prescription drugs from Canada, a move that is expected to help save taxpayers millions.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the state’s request to import medication from Canada on Friday, the deadline given by a judge in a lawsuit over the issue.
While some people already buy medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, it’s technically illegal to import them, according to the Associated Press.
With this approval, Florida will be able to import medications for its Medicaid recipients, as well as for facilities run by the Florida Department of Children and Families, people who are under the care of the Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities, patients at county health departments and inmates in the custody of the Florida Department of Corrections.
“After three long years of waiting for FDA approval, we are excited to finally have the opportunity to see this vision come to fruition and provide Floridians access to safe and affordable prescription drugs,” said Jason Weida, secretary for Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration, in a statement. “As we move forward, we will continue to work every day to find ways to lower costs for Florida’s vulnerable populations.”
The state on Friday said it estimates the program will save Florida taxpayers $183 million per year once the program is fully implemented, with plans to import medications to treat various conditions, including HIV, AIDS, mental illness, prostate cancer and urea cycle disorder. The state expects to save up to $180 million in the first year.

However, before the state can begin importing drugs from Canada, Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration will have to tell the FDA what drugs it wants to import, verify that the drugs are tested, authentic, comply with the FDA’s standards, and relabel the drugs to be consistent with FDA-approved labeling. The FDA will have to review and approve the drugs.
The state agency will also be required to submit a quarterly report to the FDA that includes information about the imported drugs, cost savings and any possible safety and quality issues. Under the authorization, Florida will be allowed to import select drugs from Canada for two years from the date the FDA is notified of the first drug shipment to be imported.
Other states have also submitted requests to the FDA to import medications from Canada. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said the agency is committed to working with states and Indian tribes who create proposals that demonstrate programs that would “result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs.”
Prescription drugs cost more in the U.S. than in other countries, in part because the U.S. doesn’t impose a limit as to how much pharmaceutical companies can charge, while other countries, like Canada, do. However, Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors, can now negotiate with drug companies on certain high-cost medications because of the Inflation Reduction Act, with negotiated prices set to go into effect in 2026.

In 2021, the U.S. Government Accountability Office did an estimate comparison of the prices for 20 brand-name drugs in the U.S. to the same drugs in Australia, Canada and France. Its analysis found that retail prices in the U.S. for these drugs were 2 to 4 times higher than in other countries. Florida says some medications cost almost $400 per pill.
While Congress passed a law allowing drug importation two decades ago, federal officials kept delaying it over safety concerns, one of the main arguments drug companies have used against it, the New York Times reported.
Then in 2020, President Donald Trump green-lit states to submit proposals to the FDA to import medications from Canada. President Joe Biden continued the push in 2021 with an executive order directing the FDA to work with states and Indian tribes to ensure that their importation programs could help reduce the cost of medication for people in the U.S., while still ensuring that the drugs were safe.
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2019 signed into law a bill that would let the state import prescription drugs from different countries, including Canada. The state first needed to get its drug importation program approved by the FDA. The state applied in 2020, and nearly two years later, sued the federal agency over its delay in reviewing its proposal. A federal judge ordered the FDA to decide on Florida’s proposal by Jan. 5.
There’s support in the U.S. to import medications from Canada. A 2019 survey by KFF, a nonprofit health research group, found that nearly 80% of respondents support buying prescription drugs imported from licensed Canadian pharmacies. However, some experts have expressed skepticism about how effective the importation of Canadian medications will be in reducing the cost of pricey, brand-name drugs.
“Pharma is smart. They know exactly how much Canada needs to buy. They’re not going to oversell to Canada knowing it can be imported into the U.S., especially for a big state like Florida,” said Emma Dean, assistant professor of health management policy at the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School.
“It’s politically popular. People like to think that they can pay Canadian prices, the practical reality is they probably won’t change most people’s prices they pay,” Dean added.
The pharmaceutical industry is also against the push to import medications from other countries. It’s warning that allowing medications from foreign countries could pose a health risk, despite the fact that the imported drugs would have to comply with FDA standards.
“Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health,” Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for pharmaceutical companies, said in a Friday statement.
Canada likely won’t make it easy, either.
In 2020, Canada prohibited companies from exporting certain medications meant for the Canadian market to other countries like the U.S. if it would cause or worsen a drug shortage in Canada. The Canadian government has also previously cast doubt on whether the U.S. push to import Canadian medication would reduce drug prices, noting that the Canadian market is smaller.
In a statement released Friday evening, the Public Health Agency of Canada said that the 2020 measure covered “all drugs that are eligible for bulk importation to the U.S., including those identified in Florida’s bulk importation plan, or any other US state’s future importation programs.”
Anne Génier, spokesperson for the agency, said the Canadian government’s priority is protecting the domestic supply of prescription drugs.
“The Government of Canada is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need and has been clear in its position: bulk importation will not provide an effective solution to the problem of high drug prices in the U.S.” she wrote."

The demand comes nearly four months after the motion was originally filed on Sept. 8.
Giuliani pleaded not guilty to a set of charges surrounding the broad Georgia election interference case, which saw 19 people charged with crimes, including former President Trump. Prosecutors alleged Giuliani knowingly lied in attempts to sway Georgia electors to overturn the 2020 election results.
Attorneys for the former New York City mayor argued in the September dismissal motion that there were “deficiencies” in the original indictment.
“Defendant moves this Court to quash the indictment against him, as it is not perfect in form and substance, fails to provide sufficient notice as to what he must defend against at trial, and the pleadings in said indictment are insufficient to protect him from double jeopardy in a separate prosecution,” his attorneys wrote.
The motion describes the 98-page indictment against Giuliani and the other defendants as “conspiratorial bouillabaisse consisting of purported criminal acts, daily activities, and constitutionally protected speech.”
Four of the 19 defendants have pleaded guilty to crimes to avoid trial, including three of Trump’s attorneys. A trial date is not yet set for the case, but prosecutors requested it begin in August.

RZ3MW5HEUQ-152,Israeli defense minister lays out vision for post-war Gaza,Haley Ott,"January 6, 2024 at 2:35 AM·3 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-defense-minister-lays-vision-183500265.html,"Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday laid out a four-pronged plan for how Gaza could be governed after the war. While it is the first time a senior Israeli official has laid out such a vision, it does not represent official policy.
Under the plan, Hamas would no longer control Gaza. Israel would maintain military operational freedom, but there would be no Israeli civilian presence there.
The plan suggests that a U.S.-led international task force would be responsible for rebuilding Gaza. It says local Palestinian bodies would control civil affairs, and there would be roles for Egypt and other moderate Arab states.
The plan does not mention the Palestinian Authority, the body that has powers in the occupied West Bank.
Gallant said that the plan depended on Hamas no longer posing a security threat to Israel or Israeli citizens.
Internal dissent
The plan angered at least one member of Israel's far-right, ultranationalist coalition government, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
""Gallant's 'day after' plan is a rerun of the 'day before' October 7. The solution for Gaza requires out-of-the-box thinking and a changed conception,"" Smotrich said, according to the Times of Israel newspaper.
Smotrich and ultra-nationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have been advocating for the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, provoking rebuke from the United States.
""The rhetoric that we have seen from those two individuals was inflammatory, it was irresponsible and it was in direct contradiction of the policy of the government of Israel that has been repeatedly articulated to us, including by the prime minister himself,"" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a briefing Wednesday. ""We have been told that those statements do not reflect the policy of the government of Israel. We believe that is the correct decision. The secretary [Antony Blinken] has made very clear on a number of occasions that there must be no forced resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza, that Gaza is Palestinian land and should remain.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far not made any detailed comments about his vision for Gaza after the war.
Fighting continues
Fighting continues in Gaza, with the Hamas-run ministry of health saying dozens of people were killed in the last 24 hours. A health ministry official said that Israel had conducted airstrikes is al-Mawasi, an area designated safe by the Israel Defense Forces, and killed 14 people, CBS partner network BBC News reported. Over 22,400 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
About 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed in Hamas' brutal terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, and around 240 people were taken hostage. At least 170 IDF soldiers have been killed in the war since it began.
And tensions continued to boil on other fronts.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said a response to the killing of Hamas official Saleh Al-Arouri in Beirut on Tuesday was ""inevitably coming.""
""We cannot remain silent on a violation of this magnitude because it means the whole of Lebanon would be exposed,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech, according to the AFP news agency.
Nasrallah said that since the killing of Al-Arouri, Hezbollah fighters have carried out 670 operations and targeted 48 Israeli border positions and 11 rear bases, AFP reported.
There have been exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon since the war began, sparking fears that the conflict could open up on another front. At least 175 people have been killed in Lebanon, including 129 Hezbollah fighters. In northern Israel, at least nine soldiers and four civilians have been killed, and thousands have been evacuated from their homes in border communities.

Earlier, the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces’ National Resistance Center reported that Russians are massively recruiting mercenaries from Cuba for the war against Ukraine, and then sending them to the eastern front line. At the same time, Cubans are sent to the front lines because they are ""not spared.""

6SDM6NV5TO-157,North Korea fires artillery shells near South Korean islands,AFP,"January 6, 2024 at 3:42 AM·4 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/n-korea-fires-artillery-shells-053210281.html,"North Korea fired an artillery barrage near two South Korean border islands Friday, Seoul's defence ministry said, prompting a live-fire drill by the South's military.
Residents of the two islands were ordered to evacuate to shelters and ferries were suspended amid one of the most serious military escalations on the peninsula since Pyongyang fired shells at one of the islands in 2010.
North Korea's military said it had conducted a naval live-fire drill as a ""natural countermeasure"" against South Korean threats, according to a statement on the official Korean Central News Agency.
Seoul's defence ministry said the rival military fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells near Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong, two sparsely populated islands situated just south of a defacto maritime border between the two sides.
It said the shells landed in a buffer zone created under a 2018 tension-reducing deal, which fell apart in November after the North launched a spy satellite.
Resuming artillery fire in the buffer zone ""is a provocative act that threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula and escalates tensions"", Seoul's defence minister Shin Won-sik said.
In response, Seoul's military will take ""immediate, strong, and final retaliation -- we must back peace with overwhelming force"", he added.
North Korea's military warned Seoul should not commit ""a provocation under the pretext of so-called counteraction"", according to KCNA. It threatened the North would ""show tough counteraction on an unprecedented level"".
It said the shells fired did not even have ""an indirect effect"" on Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong.
Pyongyang's major ally and benefactor China called for ""restraint"" from all sides, while the United States urged North Korea to end its ""destabilizing actions and return to diplomacy"".
- Evacuation orders -
Yeonpyeong, which has around 2,000 residents, is about 115 kilometres (70 miles) west of Seoul. Baengnyeong, with a population of 4,900, is about 210 kilometres west of Seoul.
Local officials said residents had been told to evacuate to shelters as a ""preventative measure"" ahead of the South Korean military drill. The order was lifted hours later, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
One resident of the island said they were ""shaking in fear"" at the barrage.
""At first I thought it was the shells fired by our own military... but was told later it was by North Korea,"" Kim Jin-soo, a Baengnyeong resident told local broadcaster YTN.
In November, Seoul partially suspended the 2018 military accord to protest Pyongyang's putting a spy satellite into orbit. The North then scrapped the deal completely.
""The nullification of the (accord) increases the possibility of military clashes in the border areas,"" Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.
He added that ""the evacuation of our residents raises psychological and security concerns, which can ultimately destabilise the economy of South Korea"".
- 2010 clash -
In 2010, in response to a South Korean live-fire drill near the sea border, the North bombarded Yeonpyeong island killing four South Koreans -- two soldiers and two civilians.
That was the first attack on a civilian area since the 1950-53 Korean War.
South Korea returned fire in an exchange which lasted more than an hour, as the two sides traded more than 200 shells, sparking brief fears of a full-fledged war.
Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in decades, after the North's leader Kim Jong-Un enshrined the country's status as a nuclear power into the constitution while test-firing several advanced inter-continental ballistic missiles.
At year-end policy meetings, Kim warned of a nuclear attack on the South and called for a build-up of the country's military arsenal, warning that conflict could ""break out any time"".
To deter Pyongyang, the United States deployed a nuclear-powered submarine in the South Korean port city of Busan and flew long-range bombers in drills with the South and Japan.
North Korea described the deployments as ""intentional nuclear war provocative moves"".
On Friday, KCNA said Kim called for the ramping-up of missile launcher production ""given the prevailing grave situation that requires the country to be more firmly prepared for a military showdown with the enemy.""
His comments came after the White House accused North Korea of providing Russia with ballistic missiles and missile launchers that were used in recent attacks on Ukraine. Washington has called this an escalation of Pyongyang's support for Moscow.

A3JICMFLYV-159,Russian oligarch's firm files $1 billion claim against Ukraine over bank nationalization,Martin Fornusek,"January 5, 2024 at 10:47 PM·2 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-oligarchs-firm-files-1-144704291.html,"ABH Holdings S.A. (ABHH) banking group, whose main shareholder is sanctioned Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, filed an arbitration request and a claim of over $1 billion against Ukraine over the nationalization of Sense Bank, the company said in its press release on Jan. 4.
Ukraine seized Sense Bank, a Ukrainian branch of Fridman's Alfa-Bank, in the summer of 2023 as its owner had been placed under sanctions. The oligarch is wanted in Ukraine for financially supporting the Russian war machine during the full-scale war.
ABHH, a Luxmebourg-based entity that operates Alfa-Bank, brought its claim to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) based in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 29.
""The legal basis for the claim is the Treaty between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and the Government of Ukraine on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments,"" the press release read.
The firm called the complaint ""an acid test of the rule of law in the West,"" adding that it seeks ""full compensation for the unlawful expropriation.""
The Ukrainian state bought 100% of Sense Bank's shares for a symbolic 1 Hr ($0.03) on July 22 last year and appointed new management.
""The government decided on the state's participation in the withdrawal of SENS BANK JSC from the market in order to ensure the stability of the financial system of Ukraine and protect the interests of depositors and other creditors of the bank,"" the Finance Ministry said in justification of the decision.

On May 29, Ukraine's parliament adopted a bill allowing to nationalize banks owned by sanctioned individuals.
According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), Fridman has poured around 2 billion rubles ($22 million) into Russian military plants since the start of the full-scale invasion.
The oligarch is under both international and Ukrainian sanctions, and Kyiv has blocked the assets of several of Fridman's companies.
ABHH called Ukraine's justifications for the nationalization of inventions and ""black PR."" While pointing to damages caused to Sense Bank's owners and beneficiaries, the press release does not mention Fridman by name.

6QNITXNFWI-161,South Korea’s military says North Korea fired artillery into maritime buffer zone in ‘provocative act’,"Gawon Bae, Jessie Yeung and Brad Lendon, CNN","January 5, 2024 at 4:40 PM·5 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-military-says-north-063544970.html,"South Korea’s military condemned its northern neighbor on Friday after Pyongyang fired artillery rounds that fell within a maritime buffer zone that has long been a flashpoint between the two.
North Korea fired more than 200 rounds between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m off its west coast, near South Korea’s Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong islands, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
The artillery fell north of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), a disputed de facto border drawn up by the United Nations at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The incoming rounds did not harm any civilians or military, the JCS added, calling the incident a “provocative act that threatens peace and heightens tension on the Korean Peninsula.”
In response South Korea’s military held its own maritime shooting exercise on Friday afternoon, with the defense ministry saying it was to “respond to North Korea’s provocation of shooting artilleries inside the no-hostile act zone this morning.” There were “no unusual movements” by the North Korean military during the exercise, it said.
Ahead of the exercise, Yeonpyeong residents were ordered to evacuate to nearby shelters and “refrain from doing outdoor activities,” according to a government website message, and a local resident who told CNN they received the same message via text.
Photos from the island showed people gathering near designated shelters, some sitting inside and others milling around outside.
Yeonpyeong, a tiny island that only measures 3 square miles, is home to more than 2,100 people, according to its local office website. Baengnyeong island, about 18 square miles, has more than 4,900 residents.
It is not unprecedented for North Korea to fire shells into the maritime buffer zone but such acts do raise tensions.
The hermit nation resumed firing artillery within the buffer zone after scrapping an inter-Korean military agreement last November, the JCS said. Multiple rounds were also fired in the same area in late 2022.
The military agreement was signed in 2018 as part of efforts with the United States to contain the threat of war on the Korean Peninsula, and broaden the buffer zone between the two Koreas.
But relations have deteriorated since, with Seoul pulling back from the agreement, and both sides stepping up military exercises and weapons tests.
The South Korean military is now working with the US to track related movements, and will take “actions corresponding to North Korea’s provocation,” the JCS said Friday.
“It is not unusual for North Korea to fire artillery into the West Sea during its winter exercises,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. “What’s different this year is the two Koreas have recently backed away from a military confidence-building agreement, and Kim Jong Un has publicly disavowed reconciliation and unification with the South.”
On Sunday, North Korean state-run news agency KCNA reported that the hermit nation’s leader Kim Jong Un had said the state will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with South Korea.
Kim said inter-Korean relations have become “a relationship between two hostile countries and two belligerents at war,” according to the KCNA report. He reportedly added that if the US and South Korea attempt a military confrontation with the North, its “nuclear war deterrent will not hesitate to take serious action.”
The Northern Limit Line runs 3 nautical miles from the North Korean coastline and put five islands close to the coast under South Korean control.
North Korea has proposed a different line that would roughly extend the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two nations southwest into the Yellow Sea, rather than hug North Korea’s shoreline.
Yeonpyeong Island lies off South Korea’s northwest coast, right by the border with its northern neighbor – and has been the location of hostilities between the two sides before.
In November 2010, Pyongyang launched an attack on the island, killing two marines and two civilians. The attack also injured 15 South Korean soldiers and three civilians, South Korea said. It prompted an island-wide evacuation, and South Korean forces returned fire.
The North blamed the South at the time for provoking that attack by holding an artillery drill in the waters near Yeonpyeong.
The island shelling also came half a year after North Korea torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, killing 46 of the 104 sailors aboard, during joint US-South Korea naval exercises. North Korea denied the sinking, which a Seoul-led multinational investigation team concluded had come from a torpedo fired by a North Korean midget submarine.
The 2010 clash was one of the worst flare-ups of violence in years; at the time, the secretary general of the United Nations called North Korea’s attack “one of the gravest incidents since the end of the Korean War.”
The war has technically never ended; an armistice brought hostilities to a halt in 1953 – but there’s never been a peace treaty.
Though diplomats in Seoul and Washington have in recent years discussed an agreement to end the war, those efforts have faltered as tensions in the Korean Peninsula rose again – especially with Pyongyang ramping up its weapons development program and missile testing.

They were said to have inflicted an undisclosed number of losses on Russian forces in the frontier region of Belgorod, according to a post by Ukraine’s military intelligence agency on Telegram.
Video footage, shot from a helmet camera, shows Ukrainian troops mining a road in the Grayvoron district that was said to have been inspected by Russian commanders because of poor conditions in the area.
At one point, an exchange of gunfire can be seen as Kyiv’s troops move through a heavily-wooded area.
There have been several cross-border incursions into Russia since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion.
The most notable was a raid by a Kyiv-backed Russian opposition group, which involved Western armoured vehicles, in May last year.
Thank you for following today’s live blog. We will be back tomorrow with all the latest updates.

Russian officials in the southern border city of Belgorod have offered to evacuate worried residents, following waves of fatal Ukrainian ‘revenge attacks’.
“I see several appeals on social media where people write: We are scared, help us get to a safe place,” Belgorod region governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a video message.
“Of course we will. We have already moved several families,” he added.
He said residents would be transported to the towns of Stary Oskol and Gubkin, where they would be housed in “comfortable conditions”.
“You will stay there for as long as necessary,” he said, but warned there would not be enough temporary accommodation to house everybody.
Rustem Umerov has conducted calls with various European defence ministers to express gratitude for their continued support and to discuss further aid supplies.
Mr Umerov thanked Bjørn Arild Gram, Norway’s defence minister, for “strengthening our air defence and fostering the Maritime Capabilities Coalition”.
In a “meaningful” conversation with Latvian counterpart Andris Spr&umacr;ds, the Ukrainian defence minister discussed how it “will increase production of UAVs.”
And in a “productive call” with W&lstrok;adys&lstrok;aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Polish deputy prime minister and defence minister, Mr Umerov said he was “thankful” for Poland’s support.
Sweden is pulling humanitarian aid from Mali over its support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Swedish minister for foreign trade and international development cooperation has told TV4.
Johan Forssel said: “When we cooperate with other countries, we also want those countries to cooperate with Sweden, but Mali’s military junta instead turns to Russia and supports its full-scale war against Ukraine.”
The West African nation has so far abstained on UN resolution votes concerning Russia’s war in Ukraine and voted against a resolution to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council.
Sweden has provided Mali with £304 million ($388 million) in aid over the past 10 years.
Russia has struck Ukraine with missiles supplied by North Korea, an adviser to Volodymr Zelensky has said.
Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential aide, said: “The masks are completely off. The Moscow regime is no longer concealing its intentions.”
His remarks came as the governor of Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region said it had been hit with non-Russian made missiles.
Oleh Synehubov said: “We are conducting all the necessary examinations. I will say for now that the markings have been erased from these missiles, but what we can see (is that) the country which produced it is not the Russian Federation.”
On Thursday, the US accused Moscow of using North Korean projectiles to attack Ukraine.
John Kirby, the US National Security Council spokesman, said ballistic missiles with ranges of around 550 miles were fired by Russian forces in two separate assaults within the past week. Washington also alleged that Russia intends to purchase missiles from Iran.
Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied conducting any arms deals, but vowed last year to deepen military relations.
Micheál Martin has reiterated his support for Ukraine’s accession into the European Union and called on the international community to remain steadfast in its support for the nation.
The Fianna Fáil politician, who serves as Tánaiste, minister for foreign affairs and minister for defence, said: “Ukrainians continue to defend their country and their freedom with courage and resilience.
“The international community, including Ireland, must also remain firm in its resolve to support them.”
He added: “Ukraine belongs with the European family. Ireland will remain one of the strongest advocates of Ukraine’s European path and we will continue to support them along their journey.”

Ramzan Kadyrov, head of the Chechen Republic, has proposed exchanging Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in return for the lifting of United States sanctions against his family, according to the TASS and RIA Novosti news agencies.
Kadyrov is said to have offered the release of 20 POWs in exchange for the removal of US sanctions against his relatives, planes and horses.
It comes after the Putin-ally called for the execution of family members of suspected criminals that evade capture.
During a meeting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Chechen Republic on December 30, Kadyrov said: “As is customary from time immemorial, if one of the relatives has done wrong and the criminal cannot be found, their brother, their father would be killed.”
Belarus’s authoritarian leader has granted himself lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution with a decree that also bars exiled opposition leaders from standing in presidential elections.
The law, signed by Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday, theoretically applies to any former president and members of his or her family.
In reality, it is only relevant to the 69-year-old himself, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for almost 30 years.

Russia has confirmed that it blocked the UN’s nuclear watchdog from accessing parts of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant, but said it was for safety reasons.
Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been on the ground monitoring the plant since September 2022, six months after it was captured by Moscow’s forces.
Responding to an IAEA statement saying their team had been blocked from reactor halls, Renat Karchaa, an official at Russia’s Rosatom, alleged they tried to access “containment shells”.
“A containment shell, and especially a sealed one, is not a museum or an area for free walks,” Karchaa told Russia’s RBC news outlet.
“While in ‘sealed’ mode, personnel access to the containment shells is prohibited and is only permitted with unambiguous justification and in emergency cases,” he added.
Rafael Grossi, IAEA chief, had said in a statement on Wednesday that experts had not been allowed to access reactor halls in three of the plant’s units for two weeks.
He said the IAEA would continue to request access to the reactor halls, where the reactor core and spent fuel are located.
The Russian city of Belgorod bordering Ukraine urged residents to secure their windows with tape Friday to protect themselves from frequent Ukrainian shelling.
City authorities posted instructions on how to apply the tape on Telegram, saying: “This is a good way to protect them from the blast wave. The glass will not shatter into small fragments.”
It comes after the city was targeted by another round of Ukrainian shelling overnight, hours after local schools were ordered to extend their holiday closures because of the risk of further attacks.
Russia’s national elections commission registered the first two candidates who will compete with Vladimir Putin in the March election on Friday, which Putin is all but certain to win.
The commission approved putting Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party and Vladislav Davankov of the New People Party on the ballot for the March 15-17 vote.
Neither poses a significant challenge to Putin, who has dominated Russian politics since becoming president in 2000. Both candidates’ parties are largely supportive in parliament of legislation backed by Putin’s power-base United Russia party.
Kyiv said that Russia attacked Ukraine with nearly 30 Iranian-designed attack drones overnight but 21 of them had been downed.
“A total of 29 Shahed-136/131 strike UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched,” Ukraine’s air force said on social media, adding that its forces had shot down 21 of the drones over regions across the country.
Nepal has stopped issuing permits to its citizens to work in Russia and Ukraine until further notice, an official said on Friday, after at least 10 Nepali soldiers were killed while serving in the Russian army.
Nepal asked Russia not to recruit its citizens and to immediately send all Nepali soldiers back to the Himalayan nation, also compensating the families of those killed.
The government has said that up to 200 Nepali citizens were estimated to be working in the Russian army, and foreign minister N.P. Saud told the state-run RSS news agency that about 100 Nepalis are reported to be missing.
Nepali soldiers, called Gurkhas, are known for their bravery and fighting skills, and have been serving the British and Indian armies following the independence of India in 1947 under an agreement between the three countries. There is no such agreement with Russia.

On the night we first met, backstage at his comedy show in spring 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky looked more scared than I would see him for a while.
It wasn’t only stage fright. He looked half mute with fear, his lip clenched, eyes fixed on the floor. His bid to become the president was about three months old, and the premiere of his new variety show was about to begin.
His media adviser showed me backstage, where the performers were already in costume. ‘Give him a minute,’ she said when she saw me sidling up to Zelensky. He had a lot on his mind.
Earlier that day, someone had called in a bomb threat at the theatre. The anonymous voice said the building was rigged with explosives. It sounded like a hoax, and Zelensky told his troupe not to panic. Police officers had found nothing suspicious but they advised the theatre to call off the show. Zelensky conferred with the venue’s management and they decided to carry on. This would be his last big show before the elections.

Russia’s border city of Belgorod was targeted by another round of Ukrainian shelling overnight, hours after local schools were ordered to extend their holiday closures because of the risk of further attacks.
Vyacheslav Gladkov, the local governor, said at least two people were wounded in the latest shelling, as Telegram channels circulated what appeared to be images of damaged cars in the area.
The attack marked the latest in a string of recent deadly strikes on Belgorod, situated about 20 miles from Ukraine’s north-eastern border, in apparent retaliation for a series of aerial assaults by Moscow’s forces.
Schools in several municipalities close to the Ukrainian border were ordered to extend their holidays beyond the planned winter break amid the incidents, Gladkov said earlier on Thursday.Russian schools have been closed this week as the country celebrates Orthodox Christmas on January 7.
Russia’s defence ministry claimed it repelled a Ukrainian attack over Crimea on the same day, shooting down 36 drones over the annexed peninsula.
Kyiv’s attempted “attack using aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles against targets on the territory of the Russian Federation was thwarted”, the defence ministry said in a statement on Telegram.
It said its air defence systems “destroyed and intercepted” 36 Ukrainian drones over Crimea, a peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and which Kyiv has vowed to reclaim.
Another Ukrainian drone over Russia’s western Krasnodar region was destroyed, the ministry added.
Kyiv has struck the Russian-controlled territory throughout the war, launching missiles and drones at Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city, in a bid to suppress Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet.

North Korea has provided Russia with ballistic missiles and missile launchers, which have been used in recent attacks on Ukraine, in a major escalation of support for Moscow, the White House has said.
Russia is also looking to obtain missiles from its ally Iran as it runs short of arms nearly two years into President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, it said.
The White House’s comments came as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for boosting production of missile launchers in preparation for a “military showdown” with South Korea and the United States, the official Korean Central News Agency said.
The Pyongyang-supplied missiles, with ranges of around 550 miles, were fired by Russia in two attacks on Ukraine within the past week, John Kirby, the US National Security Council spokesman, said.
“Our information indicates that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile launchers and several ballistic missiles,” Mr Kirby told reporters in a briefing at the White House.
“This is a significant and concerning escalation of the DPRK’s support for Russia.”
Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive near Kharkiv as Moscow ramps up its bombardment of the north-eastern city and the surrounding region.
Moscow’s forces struck the city and 15 surrounding settlements with missiles, artillery and mortars on Thursday, according to local officials.
Targets included both civilian buildings and military positions in what is seen as preparation for a large-scale offensive in the coming weeks, a source close to Ukraine’s armed forces said.

The timing of the raid was not specified.
HUR gathered intelligence that senior Russian military officials in Belgorod Oblast’s Grayvoron district were organizing an inspection in response to growing discontent and grievances among personnel regarding their service conditions, HUR reported on Jan. 5.
The rank-and-file local officers “scrambled” and began conducting active engineering works before the arrival of the “Moscow inspectors.” It was at that time that Ukrainian special forces planned the sabotage operation.
Intelligence officers mined the only road used by the occupiers in the area and attacked a Russian platoon stronghold.
“As a result of the fire raid involving small arms and mortars, as well as detonation on Ukrainian mines, the enemy suffered losses,” HUR reported.  “The number of eliminated and wounded occupiers is being clarified.”
Explosions also occurred in Belgorod on Dec. 30.  Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov stated that the regional capital was shelled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces struck military targets in Belgorod, Ukrainian media reported.
Drone debris fell in the city center due to “unprofessional actions of the Russian air defense” and “planned provocations.”  Russia reported 24 fatalities at the time.

JIKJBM9GSO-165,Ukraine's Security Service arrests agricultural businessman suspected of collaborating with Russians in Kherson Oblast,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 5, 2024 at 2:43 AM·2 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-security-arrests-agricultural-businessman-084327236.html,"The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) has detained the owner of an agricultural holding in Kyiv suspected of supplying food products to the Russians on the left bank of Kherson Oblast.
Source: SSU
The SSU states that it has gathered evidence against the founder of one of the largest agricultural holding companies in Ukraine, who is suspected of financing armed aggression by the Russian Federation.
Quote: ""The investigation materials indicate that the food company controlled by the suspect is located in the temporarily occupied left bank of Kherson Oblast and is operating in Russia’s interests. In particular, this company is one of the main suppliers of food products to Russian forces stationed in Ukraine's south,"" the statement says.
SSU personnel detained the suspect in his son's apartment in Kyiv, where he was hiding and planning to escape to Russia. In 2022, the businessman organised the ""re-registration"" of the agricultural company in the so-called Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation for Kherson Oblast.
The SSU adds that the suspect's business is collaborating with the Russian occupational authorities, paying over RUB 100,000 per month to its budget. Additionally, the company is one of the main sponsors of the Russian fund supporting participants in the ""special military operation"" [as the war against Ukraine is called in Russia – ed.].
It is also documented that the businessman handed over warehouse facilities at the company’s production complex in the temporarily occupied Kakhovka district in Kherson Oblast to the Russian forces.
Documents, seals, computer equipment and a mobile phone were seized during the arrest and searches, confirming the fact that he had cooperated with Russia. Based on the evidence collected, SSU investigators served the suspect with a notice of suspicion under Article 111-2.1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The man faces up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property.

F6XBZ92R6F-166,US FDA to allow Florida to import cheaper drugs from Canada,Khushi Mandowara and Deena Beasley,"Updated January 6, 2024 at 6:11 AM·3 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/us-fda-allow-florida-import-144611327.html,"By Khushi Mandowara and Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Florida on Friday won authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to directly import prescription drugs from Canada, the first state to get such approval for a strategy that could lower prices for medicines.
Drug costs in the U.S. are higher than in Canada and other countries where government-run healthcare systems negotiate prices for individual prescription drugs.
But importation faces challenges. In the past, Canada's government has opposed any U.S. plans to buy Canadian prescription drugs, citing threats to the country's drug supply or higher costs for its own citizens. The pharmaceutical industry opposes the plan and has long fought such schemes.
Drug pricing experts said it would be difficult to put into place. The U.S. population is nearly 10 times the size of Canada, said Dan Ollendorf, chief scientific officer at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.
""This is probably another area of leverage as opposed to anything that will materially make an impact,"" he said. ""Just the idea that a state could bring in drugs from Canada might help with negotiations over discounts and rebates.""
Health Canada told the New York Times importation will not solve high drug prices in the U.S., but did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
For years, supporters of importation policy have said buying drugs from another country could help lower costs in the U.S., where more than half of Americans are covered by private health plans.
The U.S. government has taken steps to start negotiating prices. Under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the government's Medicare health program for people over 65 will be authorized to negotiate prices with drugmakers, but only for a limited number of medications, starting in 2026.
The pharmaceutical industry has said the plan will not lead to lower costs for consumers and will put the safety of the U.S. drug supply at risk.
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the industry's leading trade group, said it was deeply concerned about the plan and looking at its options.
""The importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health,"" PhRMA CEO Stephen Ubl said in an emailed statement.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020 finalized a plan allowing states to submit import proposals. President Joe Biden followed with a 2021 order for the FDA to work with states on the plans. Florida first submitted its proposal to the FDA in November of 2020.
FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said other states seeking similar approvals ""must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs.""
Florida still needs to submit drug-specific information for FDA review and approval as well as evidence that the drugs it seeks to import have been tested to comply with FDA standards, the agency said.
Florida must also submit a quarterly report that includes information about the imported drugs, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues, the FDA said.

Source: European Pravda, citing State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller at a briefing.
Quote: ""So there are going to be battlefield developments back and forth, where you see each side gaining or losing territory. But when you look at the ultimate stakes of this war, it’s quite clear that Ukraine is going to exit this war independent, strong, with an improved economy, and looking west,"" he noted.
At the same time, Miller reiterated that from the very beginning, Russia wanted Ukraine not only to orient itself to the East but to become a part of Russia.
""I think people forget oftentimes the actual stakes of this war and what Vladimir Putin’s actual goal was, and what Ukraine has actually achieved and what it continues to achieve. Remember that Putin launched this as a war of total conquest where he wanted to take over Ukraine,"" Miller said.
Background:
Earlier, the White House announced that the Russian army had not learned the lessons of the war of aggression against Ukraine in two years.
Additionally, the US presidential administration does not believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war of aggression against Ukraine, despite separate reports in the media.
Earlier, The New York Times claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been sending signals through intermediaries since at least September that he is ready to agree to a ceasefire in the war of aggression against Ukraine, which would include freezing hostilities on the current contact line.

JL3QSEUH3K-168,Victim of Austin shooting rampage laid to rest almost a month later in Guatemala,"Emiliano Tahui Gómez, Austin American-Statesman","January 5, 2024 at 7:01 PM·5 min read",20240105,https://news.yahoo.com/victim-austin-shooting-rampage-laid-110124927.html,"It is Qʼeqchiʼ tradition that, on the third day after a funeral, the family of the deceased return to the burial site to lead the loved one’s spirit — who has remained around the house, in residents’ thoughts and dreams — to its body.
The family gathers around the tomb and thanks the departed. They reminisce, console and reassure. It’s for everyone’s peace of mind.
On Thursday morning at the town cemetery in La Caoba, a small town of about 1,500 in northern Guatemala, Abelino Pop Ba stood next to his brother’s cement tomb to recall their childhood dreams. Abelino reminded his brother that though they had not lived out full lives in each other’s companies as they had wanted, they had, for many years, worked together and escaped the poverty of their youths. Abelino asked him not to worry about the family in Guatemala, whom the brother had called almost daily and often supported during his time in the United States.
“I told him to stay and rest, that it wasn’t his fault or mine or any of ours” that he had died with unfinished hopes and dreams, Abelino said in Spanish.
Abelino’s brother, Emmanuel Pop Ba, 32, was one of the four Austin victims of the Dec. 5 shootings that Austin police believe were committed by a San Antonio-area man who first killed his parents. Emmanuel, a well-respected and well-loved workman, had lived in Austin for six years at the time of his death. He was survived by his three children and partner in the United States and a mother and two full brothers in Guatemala. His Tuesday interment in his hometown — nearly a month after his death — marked some closure for Emmanuel’s family.
‘He was the best father’: Death of man in Austin shootings leaves family unsure of future
Emmanuel’s body arrived in Guatemala on Monday in a shiny coffin draped in the American and Guatemalan flags. He was given three ceremonies that day: one at his parent-in-law’s home in the town of La Libertad, another at the nearby house he had under construction at the time of his death, and the third, a wake, at the Pop family home in La Caoba.
Videos from the celebrations of life show what appear to be hundreds of people at each occasion. There were Qʼeqchiʼ-language Catholic ceremonies and eulogies at each. Between the events, a caravan of dozens of motorcycles followed the hearse van carrying Emmanuel’s body. Into the nighttime, into the rain, their honks croaked and croaked.
Abelino attributed the community’s broad support of his family to its strong sense of identity — as Qʼeqchi'-speaking people — and the Pop family’s good standing.
“People are united here. That’s how we are here. Something happens and people come and support each other,” he said. “They don’t leave you in pain; they take it on alongside you.”
He also believed that Emmanuel’s gruesome death had shocked a community that has sent large numbers of migrants to the United States. News of naturally occurring deaths from the North have arrived before. There has even been a case of a death from drunk driving, he said, but no one from the town has ever died like Emmanuel did.
On Tuesday, several hundred mourners gathered for the burial ceremony in the yard outside of the Pop family home. Guests quickly filled the 400 rented chairs, leaving others to stand, Abelino said. Women wore their brightly colored shawls. A few rays of sun passed through the clot of clouds. After about three hours of hymns and speeches, a procession followed the casket for 25 minutes, down forested roads and past cow fields, to the town cemetery.
Emmanuel was entombed aside his father and grandmother. As with local tradition, his clothes, including the outfit he wore when he graduated with a teaching credential, were placed alongside his coffin.
Abelino said the Pop family was relieved and satisfied to have Emmanuel buried in his hometown.
“You can die in another part. But this is where you grew up, where you made memories (and) were born. … He had left, but he had always said he was not going to stay away,” Abelino said.
“That is why he had to return.”
Austin shooting victims: Family says blue alert could have saved shooting victim
Emmanuel’s partner, Domitilia Caal Pop, stayed by her phone on Monday and Tuesday to watch the ceremonies through Facebook video streams from her apartment in Austin.
It brought her some solace to see the burying of her partner approach a conclusion.
“Before I couldn't sleep, asking myself, ‘What are they doing to him (at the morgue, at the funeral homes)?' But now I know that he’s resting,” she said in Spanish.
Uncertainties about her and her daughter’s ability to return to the U.S. restrained her urges to return and see the funeral services in person, she said.
Her family had a wake in Austin on Dec. 28. Family members came from throughout Texas, as did many strangers, countrymen living in the surrounding areas, who stopped to pay their respects and introduce themselves.
In the days since the interment, Domitilia and her family began a novenario, or the nine days of mourning in Catholic tradition that include a nightly rosary. In the rite, she said, she was finding the opportunity she needed to ask for some tranquility for her now-deceased partner, and for herself.
It’s the question Domitilia continues to ask herself.
The shock of the incident has left her feeling insecure in Austin, she said. The fright of a looming and indiscriminate danger accompanies her when she leaves her apartment and when she thinks of the children’s imminent return to school from winter break.
Should she and the children all return to Guatemala? Should they all try to stay in Austin? Could the kids go back to Guatemala while she stays in the States to work?
One is an economic sacrifice. The others, emotional ones. There are legal complications to each.
“It’s all still up in air,” she said.

Hua Quoc Anh, a local content creator, was fined for posting ""false information,"" per Lao Dong
He regularly shares posts of his travels and has over 700,000 followers on TikTok.
Vietnamese authorities fined a man $300 after he posted a TikTok suggesting that Angkor Wat, an ancient temple complex in Cambodia, was located in Thailand, the state-owned media outlet Lao Dong reported in Vietnamese.
Hua Quoc Anh, a Vietnamese makeup artist and content creator, posted a TikTok of his photo shoot at Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, the second-largest city in Cambodia. The video, with overlaid images of the Thai flag and royalty, was posted on November 4, per Lao Dong. The phrase ""Hello, Thailand"" could also be heard in the video, per the report. The video has since been deleted, the report said. Business Insider saw a screenshot of the video, but did not watch the TikTok before it was deleted.
On Wednesday, the Vietnamese government charged Quoc Anh with providing ""false information"" and ""insulting the reputation of agencies organizations, honor and dignity of individuals,"" per Lao Dong. He was fined 7.5 million Vietnamese dong, or $300, per the statement.
The Vietnamese government said Quoc Anh was required to ""strictly comply with relevant legal regulations when using the internet"" and had to use it in a ""responsible, civilized, progressive"" manner, per Lao Dong. Vietnam's Department of Information and Communication did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
""Right now, Quoc Anh has too many emotions in his heart that cannot be described in a few lines of text,"" Quoc Anh wrote in Vietnamese in a Facebook post on Wednesday, adding that he was ""safe"" after meeting with authorities. In the same post, he included a photo of himself outside Vietnam's Department of Information and Communication in the capital Ho Chi Minh City. Quoc Anh did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Quoc Anh, who has over 250,000 followers on Facebook and over 700,000 followers on TikTok, frequently shares posts of his travels and photoshoots abroad.
Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, told the Japanese news agency Nikkei that the incident was ""ridiculous.""
""No one really believes that Siem Reap belongs to Thailand,"" Robertson said. ""So the appropriate step would have been to laugh at this social influencer's ignorance rather than resort to criminal penalties,"" he added.
It's not the first time authorities in Southeast Asia have charged people over videos posted on social media platforms. In September, Indonesia sentenced a woman to two years in jail after she posted a video saying an Islamic phrase and eating pork on TikTok. In November, a woman in Singapore was sentenced to a week in jail after she posted videos on TikTok of her fiancé at a police station.

4NEEWHOW7R-170,"2 seats adjacent to Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout were empty, officials say","Kerry Breen, Faris Tanyos","Updated January 10, 2024 at 6:09 AM·5 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/faa-orders-temporary-grounding-certain-183330482.html,"The Federal Aviation Administration said that they will temporarily ground and require ""immediate inspections of certain Boeing 737 Max 9 planes"" after the door on an Alaska Airlines plane blew out mid-flight on Friday night, forcing an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon.
In a news conference in Portland Saturday night, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy called the event an ""accident, not an incident.""
Homendy, who would not speculate on a cause, said that the plane was forced to return to Portland International Airport just minutes after takeoff ""after a mid-cabin door plug...departed the airplane, resulting in rapid decompression.""
She said that no one happened to be seated in the two adjoining seats, 26A and 26B, to the blown-out door.
""We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,"" Homendy told reporters.
Homendy said there were an undisclosed number of ""minor injuries,"" but no severe injuries. The airline also reported that several passengers suffered injuries that required ""medical attention,"" but all have since been ""medically cleared.""
""With that said, I imagine this was a pretty terrifying event,"" Homendy said. ""We don't often talk about psychological injury, but I'm sure that occurred here.""
Homendy also disclosed the head rests for seats 26A and 25A were lost during the blowout, as was part of the seatback for 26A.
The blowout on Alaska Airlines Flight No. 1282 forced the plane, carrying 174 passengers and six crew members, to make an emergency landing just minutes into its trip from Portland to Ontario, California.
""All of a sudden I heard, like, a big bang. I didn't know exactly what was going on,"" one woman aboard the flight told CBS News. ""I look up and the oxygen masks were hanging from the ceiling and then I look to my left and there's this huge chunk, part of the airplane just missing. The wind is just extremely loud, there's wind blowing everywhere.""
The door blew off at an altitude of about 16,000 feet, Homendy said, noting that it was fortunate that the plane had yet not reached a cruising altitude of between 30,000 and 35,000 feet.
""Think about what happens when you're in cruise,"" Homendy said. Everybody's up and walking, folks don't have seatbelts on. They're going to restrooms. The flight attendants are providing service to passengers. We could have ended up with something so much more tragic.""
The blown-out door still has not been located by authorities. Based on radar, it is believed to be somewhere in the Cedar Hills suburb in the western Portland metropolitan area, Homendy disclosed, off Barnes Road and Highway 217. Anyone who finds it is asked to contact the NTSB. The FBI is assisting in that search.
""Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections,"" the airline said.
Homendy's news conference came just after the FAA released an ""Emergency Airworthiness Directive"" Saturday evening requiring safety inspections for 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft in operation worldwide. Such directives are issued ""when an unsafe condition exists that requires immediate action by an owner/operator,"" according to the agency.
Safety inspections for each plane will take between four and eight hours. There have been about 218 such planes delivered around the world, the FAA said, but not all such aircraft were in operation at the time the EAD was issued.
""Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB's investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said.
Transportation officials applauded the FAA's quick decision.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Saturday, ""Safety will always be the top priority for our Department and for FAA. Administrator Whitaker has acted to order these aircraft grounded pending the inspections necessary to ensure that they are safe to operate.""
The Flight Attendants Union said, ""This is a critical move to ensure the safety of all crew and passengers, as well as confidence in aviation safety. Lives must come first always.""
Alaska Airlines disclosed in a news release Saturday that the plane in question had been recently delivered from Boeing on Oct. 31.
""If this had happened at higher altitude, the odds are it could have been a whole lot worse,"" CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg said. ""...This still seems like an anomaly, because if its actually a design fault with the entire fleet, you have a very serious problem.""
Alaska Airlines said that the portion of the plane which tore off is known as a ""plug door — a specific panel of the fuselage near the rear of the aircraft.""
The airline said Friday that it would ground all 65 of its Boeing Max 9 aircraft.  On Saturday morning, the airline said that inspections on more than a quarter of the fleet had been completed with ""no concerning findings,"" and that those planes would be returned to service.
However, after the airline cleared the 18 aircraft, the FAA then issued its order, and all 18 aircraft were again grounded.
Alaska Air said that it had canceled 160 flights as of Saturday afternoon, impacting about 23,000 fliers. The airline noted that guests whose flights had been canceled by the groundings could rebook their travel or request a refund.
""We deeply apologize to our guests whose flights have been impacted,"" the airline said.
Boeing said in a statement to CBS News that ""Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers. We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane. In addition, a Boeing technical team is supporting the NTSB's investigation into last night's event. We will remain in close contact with our regulator and customers.""
In the U.S., only Alaska Airlines and United Airlines use the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft. United has about 80 of the planes, but it's not clear how many were operating at the time of the Alaska Airlines incident. United expects about 60 flight cancelations Saturday due to the grounding.
United said the airline is working directly with impacted customers to find them alternative travel options.

“The oxygen masks dropped down, and I look to my left to hear and see wind blasting, with a piece of the wall gone,” said passenger Elizabeth Le. “There was no one in the window seat but a mom and her teenage son sitting [on] the aisle.”
Le said the mother apparently saved her son from getting pulled out of the plane.
“I looked up and saw that the son’s shirt was completely off and his skin was very red, most likely due to the cold air. I heard after from the son’s friend that the mom had to drag him back into the plane after the piece flew off.”

[10:20 PM] Matt RawlingsOne passenger told KOIN 6 about the reaction from others on the plane.
“Everyone was very calm, actually. It kind of helped. Everyone was just focused on making sure we were back on the ground safely,” he said.
He also said that other passengers heard a pop on the plane and that people’s belongings flew out.
The airline released the following statement Friday night: “The safety of our guests and employees is always our primary priority, so while this type of occurrence is rare, our flight crew was trained and prepared to safely manage the situation. We are investigating what happened and will share more information as it becomes available.“
The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement to CBS News that the crew reported a “pressurization issue,” which the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are now investigating.
The Boeing 737 Max 9 flight was certified in November 2023. Boeing said it has a technical team standing by to support the investigations.

NNL4TC16WW-172,Alaska Airlines grounds 737 Max 9 planes after section blows out mid-air,Thomas Mackintosh & Kathryn Armstrong - BBC News,"January 7, 2024 at 2:18 AM·5 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/alaska-airlines-plane-lands-portland-071858186.html,"Alaska Airlines says it has returned some of its grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 jets to service after one of its planes lost a section of fuselage mid-flight.
The airline apologised to those affected, saying an inspection found ""no concerning findings"".
On Friday one of its planes had to make an emergency landing in the US state of Oregon after an outer section of the plane fell off.
The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely in Portland.
Boeing said it was aware of the incident and was ""working to gather more information"".
The UK Civil Aviation Authority told the BBC it was ""monitoring the situation very closely"".
Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: ""There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped.
""They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt was sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.""
Diego Murillo said the gap was ""as wide as a refrigerator"".
Fellow passenger Elizabeth Lee added: ""Part of the plane was missing and the wind was just extremely loud. but everyone was in their seats and had their belt on.""
Jessica Montoia described the flight as a ""trip from hell"" adding a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind.
Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: ""Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.""
A later statement said that more than a quarter of those plans had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found.
The flight to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data.
Images sent to news outlets show the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen.
Other pictures show the seat closest to the affected section, a window seat that passengers said was unoccupied, leaning forward without its cushion.
""My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,"" Mr Minicucci said. ""I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants.""
In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion.
""We are an emergency,"" she said. ""We are depressurised, we do need to return back.""
According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines.
The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 ""returned safely... after the crew reported a pressurisation issue"".
Boeing said a ""technical team stands ready to support the investigation"".
Flydubai told the BBC that its three Boeing 737 Max 9 had a ""different configuration with mid-aft cabin exits"" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks.
""We will follow any guidance issued by Boeing once more information is available,"" a spokeswoman added.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident.
The Boeing 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues.
The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board.
Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had ""an enormous safety record"".
""While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,"" he told BBC News.
""But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet""
More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory, Reuters news agency reported.
About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows.
Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.

KYUC2W0IQ5-173,Anti-racists slam blackface use in Spain's Epiphany parades,"David Latona, Joan Faus and Eva Manez","Updated January 6, 2024 at 7:36 AM·4 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/anti-racists-slam-blackface-spains-115438267.html,"By David Latona, Joan Faus and Eva Manez
ALCOY, Spain/BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Anti-racism activists in Spain have called for a ban on the use of blackface seen in many of the country's traditional Epiphany celebrations.
Rita Bosaho, the first Black woman in Spain's parliament, said the practice - part of annual Jan. 5 parades on the eve of Epiphany that depict the biblical Three Kings who brought gifts to Jesus - tarnish the memory of enslaved people and disempower Black children.
In the parades, actors portraying the kings, or Magi, ride past on floats and fling sweets, which are eagerly scooped up by children. Early Christian texts describe one of the kings, Balthazar, as African and Renaissance paintings often depict him as Black.
In the eastern town of Alcoy that has a long tradition of the parades, dozens of people acting the role of pages accompanied the kings in Friday's event, their faces painted black and with exaggerated, red-painted lips. Some ran along the edge of the crowd high-fiving children.
Bosaho, who led the Equality Ministry's racial diversity department from 2020 to 2023, said the use of blackface in the parades persisted because of a lack of debate on racism that she said permeated Spanish society.
""It sends a message that racism, that our skin doesn't matter,"" Bosaho added.
A spokesperson for the Equality Ministry was unavailable for comment during the holiday period.
A 2021 study commissioned by the Equality Ministry found that although nearly half of people of African descent living in Spain were born in the country, only 12% described themselves as ""Afro-Spanish"" and 60% said they did not feel Spanish due to discrimination they suffered.
People defending the use of blackface say they mean no harm and are just continuing a tradition.
The northeastern town of Igualada holds the oldest parade in the Catalonia region and most of its around 800 participants wear blackface.
""We don't consider ourselves xenophobic nor racist, nor do we consider racist the fact that some people dress up and apply makeup to act in a role and to bring joy to kids,"" said Eduard Creus, who leads the private organisation behind the parade.
In Alcoy, the large gathering of pages with the kings are usually white local youths wearing blackface.
""We have our faces painted black because it's always been done and it's a great way for the local children of Alcoy who know us to be unable to know who we are,"" said Paula, who did not give her last name.
The local authority in Alcoy declined to be interviewed.
MADRID INCIDENT
A video published on Thursday by authorities in Madrid's Chamartin district showed a white actor playing Balthazar wearing blackface and addressing children in an apparently mock-West African accent, sparking a widespread outcry online and in the media.
""It's incredible that among the 120,000 residents of Madrid who are of African descent, they were unable to find a single one who can play the role of Balthazar,"" said Eduardo Rubino of the left-wing Mas Madrid party, describing the accent as ""pathetic"" and ""pure racism"".
Madrid's deputy mayor told reporters the video was a ""regrettable error"" by the company that produced it and said the city would seek an explanation.
Antoinette Torres, the founder of Afrofeminas, an online community seeking to boost Black womens' visibility, said there was a ""lack of political will to tackle racism"" but that nationwide legislation was needed to protect minors and end practices such as blackface.
""Normalising these tendencies leads to things that shouldn't be tolerated in the 21st century are still happening in Spain,"" she said, mentioning last year's hanging of an effigy depicting Black Real Madrid player Vinicius Jr from a bridge.
She added that many Spaniards do not see blackface as racist because the education system does not teach the country's past links to slavery and colonialism.
Spain once had a protectorate that comprised part of modern-day Morocco and colonies in what are now Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara, and engaged in the slave trade into the 1800s.

B7W88G0Z4Z-174,Blinken meets with Turkey's Erdogan as Israeli-Hezbollah fighting escalates,Don Jacobson,"January 6, 2024 at 7:11 AM·3 min read",20240106,https://www.yahoo.com/news/blinken-meets-turkeys-erdogan-israeli-151149263.html,"Jan. 6 (UPI) -- U.S. Secretary Antony Blinken kicked off a Middle Eastern diplomatic push Saturday, meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as Israel's war with Hamas threatened to expand into a regional conflict.
Blinken met with Erdogan and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan at Istanbul's Vahdettin Mansion, Turkish officials said, and has further stops scheduled in Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank, and Egypt through Thursday.
In his meeting with Fidan, Blinken ""discussed the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Sweden's NATO accession process, bilateral & regional issues,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Officials also published a photo of the top U.S. diplomat shaking hands with Erdogan but offered no comments on what they discussed.
Blinken's Middle East trip comes as fighting between Israel and Hamas' Lebanese allies Hezbollah reached new levels as the weekend began, raising fresh concerns the fighting would spiral into a regional conflict.
Hezbollah fired about 40 rockets into Israel's Meron area from Lebanese territory on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces said, later adding that further rocket launches were aimed at the Toula and Margaliot areas.
בהמשך להתרעות שהופעלו במרחב הצפון, זוהו כ-40 שיגורים משטח לבנון שחצו לשטח ישראל במרחב מירון. לא זוהו שיגורים או כלי טיס עוין שחצה לשטח ישראל במרחבים אחרים בצפון הארץ.

The Iran-backed Shiite militant group said in a statement the launches targeting the ""Meron air traffic control base"" atop Mount Jarmaq were ""part of the initial response to the crime of assassinating the great leader Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri.""
Al-Arouri, a senior Hamas leader, and two companions were killed Tuesday in an Israeli drone strike in Beirut's southern suburbs, regarded as a Hezbollah stronghold.
The IDF said its forces responded with strikes against ""a series of Hezbollah targets"" in southern Lebanon, including a launch site, military buildings and ""terrorist infrastructure.""
The U.S. State Department said Blinken's Middle East visit is aimed at preventing the spread of the Israeli-Hamas conflict to other theaters, including Lebanon and the Red Sea, where Washington is committed to deterring attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels on commercial shipping.
""The Secretary will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to working with partners to set the conditions necessary for peace in the Middle East, which includes comprehensive, tangible steps toward the realization of a future Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel, with both living in peace and security,"" U.S. officials said on Thursday.
European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell also launched a Middle East diplomatic mission on Saturday, arriving in Lebanon to meet with Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Abdallah Bou Habib and Lebanese Armed Forces Commander General Joseph Aoun.
""Good meeting with Speaker Nabih Berri on the Gaza war & its impact on Lebanon, stressing the need for regional de-escalation & a political solution,"" Borrell said in a post on X. ""Also discussed the internal situation. In these difficult times it is crucial for Lebanon to have strong functioning institutions.""
He also met with Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro Sáenz, commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, to whom he ""reaffirmed EU's strong support to the UN mission, which plays a crucial role in preventing and mitigating escalation."""
COI0607FSM-175,Blinken says Turkey is committed to a 'positive' role in postwar Gaza as he opens a diplomatic push,MATTHEW LEE,"Updated January 6, 2024 at 12:24 PM·5 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/blinken-opens-latest-urgent-mideast-100956911.html,"CHANIA, Greece (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that Turkey is committed to playing “a positive, productive” role for postwar Gaza and prepared to use its influence in the region to prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from broadening even more.
The latest Mideast mission by America's top diplomat opened with talks in Turkey and Greece before shifting to the region for “not necessarily easy conversations” with allies and partners about what they are willing to do “to build durable peace and security.”
Blinken’s fourth visit in three months comes as developments in Lebanon, northern Israel, the Red Sea and Iraq have put intense strains on what had been a modestly successful U.S. push to prevent a regional conflagration since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, and as international criticism of Israel’s military operation mounts.
Blinken held meetings with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, in Istanbul about what Turkey and others can do to exert influence, particularly on Iran and its proxies, to ease tensions, speed humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza and begin planning for reconstruction and governance of postwar Gaza. Much of the territory has been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombardments.
In Chania, a port city on the Mediterranean island of Crete, Blinken later visited with Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, at his residence. “These are difficult and challenging times,” Mitsotakis said.
Blinken's day was ending in Jordan, with stops in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Sunday and Monday. Blinken will visit Israel and the West Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday before wrapping up the trip in Egypt. He said his priorities are protecting civilians — “far too many Palestinians have been killed” — getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza, ensuring Hamas cannot strike again and developing a framework for Palestinian-led governance in the territory and “a Palestinian state with security assurances or Israel.”
The ultimate goal, he said, is lasting peace, and his talks will focuses on what U.S. allies and partners are prepared to do to help with that process.
“These are not necessarily easy conversations. There are different perspectives, different needs, different requirements, but it is vital that we engage in this diplomacy now both for the sake of Gaza itself and more broadly the sake of the future for Israelis and Palestinians and for the region as a whole,” Blinken said.
“There is clearly a strong desire among the majority of people in the region for a future that is one of peace, of security, of de-escalation of conflicts, of integration of countries and that’s one path, that’s one future. The other future is an endless cycle of violence, a repetition of the horrific events that we’ve seen and lives of insecurity and conflict for people in the region, which is what virtually no one wants.”
Turkey, and Erdogan in particular, have been harshly critical of Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the prosecution of the war and the impact it has had on Palestinian civilians.
But Blinken told reporters before he flew from Crete to Amman that ""from our conversations today, it’s clear that Turkey is prepared to play a positive, productive role in the work that needs to happen the day after the conflict ends and as well more broadly in trying to find a path to sustainable peace and security.’’ Blinken would not go in details about what he heard from the Turkish officials.
``I think they’re also prepared … to use the ties, the influence they have, the relationships they have with some of the critical players and some of the critical countries in the region to do everything possible to deescalate and to prevent the conflict from spreading. ... They clearly have a shared interest with us in doing just that and I’m confident from these conversations that they’re going to make every possible effort,” Blinken said.
Hours before Blinken's meetings, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia fired dozens of rockets at northern Israel and said the barrage was an initial response to the targeted killing, presumably by Israel, of a top leader from the allied Hamas group in Lebanon’s capital this past week.
Stepped-up attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have disrupted international trade and led to increased efforts by the U.S. and its allies to patrol the vital commercial waterway and respond to threats. The coalition of countries issued what amounted to a final warning to the Houthis on Wednesday to cease their attacks on vessels or face potential targeted military action. Since Dec. 19, the militants have carried out at least two dozen attacks in response to the Israel-Hamas war.
From the Turkish officials, Blinken sought at least consideration of potential monetary or in-kind contributions to reconstruction efforts in Gaza and participation in security arrangements, according to U.S. officials.
Blinken also stressed the importance that the U.S. places on Turkey's ratification of Sweden’s membership in NATO, a long-delayed process that the Turks have said they will complete soon. Sweden’s entry to the alliance is seen as a significant response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
A Turkish official said Fidan told Blinken that Israel’s “increasing aggression” in Gaza was a threat to the region and he called for an immediate cease-fire and the delivery of “uninterrupted” humanitarian aid. Fidan said negotiations for a two-state solution should begin “as soon as possible,” according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issues in the private talks.
Fidan also said Turkey was awaiting the outcome of its request to upgrade its fleet of F-16 fighter jets and stressed that the ratification of Sweden’s NATO membership lay in the hands of the Turkish parliament.

Blinken visited Turkey on Saturday in what was his fourth visit to the region in three months.
Fighting in Gaza has put intense strains on what had been a modestly successful US push to prevent a regional conflagration in the weeks after the war began - and growing international criticism of Israel’s military operation.
Earlier on Saturday, Blinken met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to discuss what Turkey and others can do to exert influence, particularly on Iran and its proxies.

They are also trying to solve the problem of how to ease soaring tensions, speed up humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza and begin to plan for reconstruction and governance of post-war Gaza, much of which has been reduced to rubble by three months of intense Israeli bombardments.
In Greeve, Blinken will meet Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at his residence on the Mediterranean island of Crete.
Mitsotakis and his government have been supportive of US efforts to prevent the Gaza war from spreading and have signalled their willingness to assist should the situation deteriorate further.

In Istanbul, US officials said Blinken would be seeking Turkish buy-in, or at least consideration, of potential monetary or in-kind contributions to reconstruction efforts.
The top US diplomat also wants some form of Turkish participation in a proposed multi-national force that could operate in or adjacent to the territory.
Turkey's leader has been particularly critical of Israel for the prosecution of the war and the impact it has had on Palestinian civilians.
According to a Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issues, Fidan told Blinken that Israel’s “increasing aggression” in Gaza was a threat to the region.
The Turkish minister also called for an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of “uninterrupted” humanitarian aid, saying negotiations for a two-state solution should begin “as soon as possible.”
Blinken will end his Saturday in Jordan which, apart from Israel, has been the secretary’s most frequent stop on his recent Middle East tours.
Jordan will be the first Arab nation visited by Blinken, followed by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Sunday and Monday.
Blinken will then visit Israel and the West Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday before wrapping up the trip in Egypt.
As well as pressing Israel for dramatic increases in humanitarian aid to Gaza, a shift toward less intense military operations and a concerted effort to rein in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank by Jewish settlers, Blinken will be urging reluctant Gulf Arab nations to work with the US on the future of Gaza."
0KZSF3L7QO-177,Boeing passenger jets grounded after fuselage rips open mid-flight,Harriet Barber,"January 7, 2024 at 1:18 PM·9 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/boeing-passenger-jet-makes-emergency-110612692.html,"More than 170 Boeing passenger jets have been grounded after a refrigerator-sized hole opened up in a plane mid-flight.
Phones, magazines and even the shirt off a child’s back were sucked out of an Alaska Airlines service from Oregon to California on Friday, prompting concerns about the Boeing 737 Max 9 plane used by commercial airlines all over the world.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded 171 US-operated planes while officials perform safety checks. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has demanded that all planes of the same model are inspected before entering UK airspace.
The grounding of hundreds of aircraft, which are mainly used for internal American flights, risks causing knock-on delays and travel chaos in the coming days.
Preliminary investigations on Saturday suggested that the faulty section of the plane was a deactivated emergency door built into the aircraft, but it was not in use at the time.
Jennifer Homendy, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the two seats next to the portion of fuselage that blew out were unoccupied.
“We are very, very fortunate here that this didn’t end up in something more tragic,” she added.
Passengers said their phones and other loose items were ripped from their hands as the cabin suffered an “explosive” depressurisation and was forced to return to Portland for an emergency landing.
One toddler seated near the hole had his shirt pulled from his back as his mother tried to stop him from being dragged out of the plane’s cabin.
A passenger said the boy appeared to have lost his shirt, and his skin looked red and irritated. Flight attendants reportedly helped the mother and son move to the other side of the plane a few minutes later.
In the distress call to air traffic control, a woman can be heard saying: “We are an emergency. We are depressurised, we do need to return back.”
Pilots made the emergency landing 35 minutes after takeoff, and around 15 minutes after the section of the plane detached.
Emma Vu, a passenger on the flight, later posted her text messages to members of her family on TikTok.
She wrote: “I am so scared right now. Please pray for me,” adding: “Please, I don’t want to die.”
Evan Smith, another passenger, told reporters: “There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise – and all the air masks dropped.
“They said there was a kid in that row who [had] his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn’t go with it.”
Diego Murillo, also on the flight, said the gap was “as wide as a refrigerator,” while another, Elizabeth Lee, described the deafening noise as a powerful wind tore through the cabin.
“Part of the plane was missing and the wind was just extremely loud,” the 20-year-old said. “It was honestly horrifying.”
She added that the whipping wind meant that announcements made over the speaker system were inaudible.
No serious injuries were initially reported among the 171 passengers and six crew members. One flight attendant reportedly sustained minor injuries.
Passengers who experienced the ordeal were given a complimentary flight by the airline with more leg room, and free drinks and snacks.
Alaska Airlines grounded all 65 of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft for testing, to ensure the accident is not repeated on any of its other services.
Ben Minicucci, the company’s chief executive, said: “Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.”
“My heart goes out to those who were on this flight – I am so sorry for what you experienced,” he added.
Boeing said it was aware of the incident and is “working to gather more information”.
“The FAA is requiring immediate inspections of certain Boeing 737 Max 9 planes before they can return to flight,” said Mike Whitaker, an FAA administrator.
United Airlines also said on Saturday it had temporarily suspended service on all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to run inspections required by the FAA.
Meanwhile, the CAA said there are no Boeing 737 Max 9 planes registered in the UK and that the impact on British travellers is therefore likely to be “minimal”.
A spokesman for the company said: “We have written to all non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask for confirmation that inspections have been undertaken prior to any operation in UK airspace.”
China’s aviation regulator said it is conducting an emergency meeting to consider a response to the incident, including a possible grounding of the Boeing Max fleet in the country.
Images show the hole which opened up was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing, where the aircraft sometimes has an emergency exit.
Alaska Airlines chose not to configure its plane with an emergency door there, and the panel that covered the hole in the fuselage appears to have been ripped off.
The plane had only been in service for a month, having been certified in October, according to FAA records.
The incident comes fewer than three months after Alaska Airlines suffered an attempted hijack by an off-duty pilot who appeared to be suffering a psychotic episode.
Joseph Emerson, 44, later said he was under the influence of psychedelic mushrooms when he attempted to cut the plane’s engines and open the emergency exit, believing he was in a dream.
The Max is the newest version of Boeing’s 737 – a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on US domestic flights. The plane went into service in May 2017.
The model has been described as “the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history” after a series of safety issues and investigations.
Two Max 8 planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and leading to a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9 planes. They returned to service only after Boeing made significant modifications.
About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data show, and they are primarily used in the US by Alaska Airlines and United.
The FAA said its inspection of the domestic fleet of 737 Max 9 planes would take between four and eight hours per aircraft.
By Saturday afternoon, Alaska Airlines said it had already begun clearing some of its fleet for takeoff, after safety inspections that returned all-clear.
Other international operators that use the plane include Copa, Aeromexico, Turkish Airlines and Icelandair.
A Boeing spokesman said: “Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers.
“We agree with and fully support the FAA’s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.
“In addition, a Boeing technical team is supporting the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into last night’s event. We will remain in close contact with our regulator and customers.”
The Alaska Airlines incident could have been much worse if passengers had not been wearing their seat belts or quickly secured their oxygen masks, according to experts.
The jet had reached 16,000 feet when a chunk, described as the size of a “refrigerator,” was ripped off.
Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University said: “This is a very, very serious situation, and it could have been a lot worse.”
He said the incident underscores the importance of passengers keeping their seat belts fastened while seated in an aircraft, even if the fasten-seat belt light is off.
“If someone had been sitting in that seat and they weren’t buckled in, it would have been a different situation.”
In previous incidents, passengers have tragically died after being fully or partially sucked out of broken windows. In 2018, Jennifer Riordan died after being partially sucked out of a window on a Southwest Airlines plane hit by debris from a blown engine at an altitude of 32,000 feet.
Passengers are also encouraged to quickly secure oxygen masks if their aircraft becomes damaged.
Prof Graham Braithwaite, an expert on flight safety at Cranfield University, said: “It appears to have happened rapidly. In this situation, the aircraft will depressurise very quickly; the air will rush out, there might be mist in the cabin, and certainly a loud noise.
“It will be pretty dramatic and scary for passengers.”
The incident would have been more severe if it occurred at cruising altitude, he added.
Depressurisation is more forceful at higher altitudes; for example, if the plane is cruising between 30,000 to 35,000 feet, and it can be more extreme on smaller flights. The larger the damage to the aircraft structure, the faster the decompression rate.
Prof Braithwaite said: “This one was at 16,000 feet, and the cabin would be pressurised between 8,000 to 10,000 feet, so the pressure difference would not have been as much as if they were at 30,000 to 35,000 feet.
“On the flight deck, they will want to descend quickly to get the aircraft down to 10,000 feet, at which people can breathe normally.”
Oxygen masks at high altitudes are essential for avoiding hypoxia. Hypoxia is a state caused by low oxygen levels in the arterial blood, leading to confusion and difficulty breathing, and if sustained, it can lead to brain damage.
He said: “When a decompression happens, it is imperative that everyone on board gets an oxygen mask on. The risk of developing hypoxia happens quite quickly, which stops people from thinking logically.”
The temperature also plummets as the cabin temperature equalises with the outside air. Additionally, air whips through the cabin, and a mist or fog can descend from the change in humidity.
Debris and unsecured items may also fly around the cabin or be ejected from the aircraft, while dust can limit visibility.
Airline staff encourage passengers to remain calm and not remove loose personal items from bags or seat pockets. They may also instruct passengers to sit in the brace position and protect their heads from loose items.

Chanel Iman first joined the SI Swimsuit family in 2014, when the Atlanta native traveled to Madagascar with photographer Derek Kettela. She returned to the fold the next two years, and her work took her to Utah with the SI Swimsuit team and visual artist James Macari next. Iman’s most recent brand feature took place in 2016, when she posed for Ruven Afanador in Zanzibar.
While all three of the 33-year-old’s features with SI Swimsuit have been absolutely breathtaking, Iman’s spread in East Africa was by far the most daring. In addition to rocking sheer one-pieces and bold, strappy black bikinis, Iman bravely posed with a python for several snapshots while on location.
“I started off with one python snake and then they brought out the second one,” she told People at the time. “It was really easy because their mouths were taped, but there’s always that fear that the tape might come off and they might just squeeze the crap out of you … especially when they’re around your neck, and they’re on your arms, you don’t know what they’re gonna do, so there’s always a little bit of fear that something could go wrong on the shoot.”
The model’s bravery was well worth it, as the resulting images are absolutely stunning.
Today, Iman is the proud mom of three children. She and her fiancé, Davon Godchaux, got engaged last spring while in Italy. They welcomed a baby girl in September, and Iman shares her two other daughters with her ex-husband, Sterling Shepard.

B3W84ZTC7V-179,Downing of 3 Su-34s in Kherson Oblast alters Russian dynamics – UK Defence Intelligence,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 6, 2024 at 4:02 AM·1 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/downing-3-su-34s-kherson-100205971.html,"UK Defence Intelligence has assessed that the downing of three Russian Su-34 fighter jets over the south of Ukraine has affected the operations of the Russians on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.
Source: UK Defence Intelligence review dated 6 January, as reported by European Pravda
Details: UK intelligence recalled that Ukrainian defenders downed three Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers on the southern front on 22 December.
Quote: ""Previously, Russian tactical air power had been playing a key role in the south, especially attacking Ukraine's bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River,"" the analysts said, adding that after 22 December, Russian fighter jets ""almost completely ceased crewed operations"" for some time.
""There is a realistic possibility that the lack of air support contributed to the failure of an attempt by Russian Ground Forces' 18th Combined Arms Army to clear the bridgehead,"" UK Defence Intelligence believes.
The report notes, however, that in recent days Russia has again intensified tactical airstrikes in the area of the Ukrainian bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro River, ""at a lower level than before the shootdowns"" of the Su-34s.
""This once again demonstrates that Russia's inability to establish air superiority in the early stages of the Russia-Ukraine war continues to undermine their daily operations,"" the review concludes.
Background:
On 5 January, UK Defence Intelligence reported that ground combat operations in Ukraine over the past week have featured either a static front line or very gradual, localised advances by Russian forces in critical areas.

FCYEIQ3IIV-180,Federal officials order grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners after plane suffers a blowout,"CLAIRE RUSH, DAVID KOENIG and BECKY BOHRER","January 6, 2024 at 11:53 AM·6 min read",20240106,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-airlines-flight-makes-emergency-035312343.html,"Federal officials on Saturday ordered the immediate grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners until they are inspected after an Alaska Airlines plane suffered a blowout that left a gaping hole in the side of the fuselage.
The required inspections take around four to eight hours per aircraft and affect about 171 airplanes worldwide.
Alaska Airlines said in a statement that of the 65 737 Max 9 aircraft in its fleet, crews had inspected the paneled-over exits as part of recent maintenance work on 18 planes, and those were cleared to return to service Saturday. Inspections for the remaining aircraft were expected to be completed in the coming days, the company said.
An Alaska Airlines jetliner blew out a portion of its fuselage shortly after takeoff 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) above Oregon late Friday, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing as its 171 passengers and six crew members donned oxygen masks.
No one was seriously hurt as the depressurized plane returned safely to Portland International Airport about 20 minutes after departure.
Authorities are still looking for the door from the paneled-over exit and have a good idea of where it landed, near Oregon Route 217 and Barnes Road in the Cedar Hills area west of Portland, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference late Saturday.
“If you find that, please, please contact local law enforcement,” she said.
It was extremely lucky that the airplane had not yet reached cruising altitude, when passengers and flight attendants might be walking around the cabin, Homendy said.
“No one was seated in 26A and B where that door plug is, the aircraft was around 16,000 feet and only 10 minutes out from the airport when the door blew,” she said.
The headrests were gone on seats 26A and 25A and 26A was missing part of its seatback. There were also clothing items strewn about the area, Homendy said.
There has not been a major crash involving a U.S. passenger carrier within the country since 2009 when a Colgan Air flight crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people onboard and one person on the ground. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines flight arriving from South Korea crashed at San Francisco International Airport, killing three of the 307 people onboard.
Passenger Evan Smith said a boy and his mother were sitting in the row where the panel blew out, and the child’s shirt was sucked off him and out of the plane.
“You heard a big loud bang to the left rear. A whooshing sound and all the oxygen masks deployed instantly and everyone got those on,” Smith told KATU-TV.
Homendy could not confirm reports that anyone had a shirt sucked off by the depressurization or provide details yet about what happened to those sitting closest to the blown fuselage.
Homendy and investigators from the NTSB arrived in Portland on Saturday to begin an investigation that is likely to last months.
Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said the inspection of the company's 737-9 aircraft could take days to complete. They make up a fifth of the company's 314 planes.
“We are working with Boeing and regulators to understand what occurred ... and will share updates as more information is available,” Minicucci said. “My heart goes out to those who were on this flight – I am so sorry for what you experienced.”
Alaska canceled more than 100 flights, or 15% of its Saturday schedule by midday, according to FlightAware. United said the plane inspections would result in about 60 cancellations.
The Port of Portland, which operates the airport, told KPTV that the fire department treated minor injuries at the scene. One person was taken for more treatment but wasn't seriously hurt.
Flight 1282 took off from Portland at 5:07 p.m. Friday for a two-hour flight to Ontario, California. About six minutes later, the chunk of the fuselage blew out as the plane was at about 16,000 feet (4.8 kilometers). One of the pilots declared an emergency and asked for clearance to descend to 10,000 feet (3 kilometers), the altitude where the air would have enough oxygen to breathe safely.
'We need to turn back to Portland,"" the pilot told controllers in a calm voice that she maintained throughout the landing.
Videos posted by passengers online showed a gaping hole where the paneled-over exit had been and passengers wearing masks. They applauded when the plane landed safely about 13 minutes after the blowout. Firefighters then came down the aisle, asking passengers to remain in their seats as they treated the injured.
The aircraft involved rolled off the assembly line and received its certification two months ago, according to online FAA records. It had been on 145 flights since entering commercial service Nov. 11, said FlightRadar24, another tracking service. The flight from Portland was the aircraft's third of the day.
Aviation experts were stunned that a piece would fly off a new aircraft. Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said he has seen panels of fuselage come off planes before, but couldn’t recall one where passengers “are looking at the lights of the city.”
He said the incident is a reminder for passengers to stay buckled in.
“If there had been a passenger in that window seat who just happened to have their seat belt off, we’d be looking at a totally different news story.”
The Max is the newest version of Boeing’s venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights. The plane went into service in May 2017.
The president of the union representing flight attendants at 19 airlines, including Alaska Airlines, commended the crew for keeping passengers safe.
“Flight Attendants are trained for emergencies and we work every flight for aviation safety first and foremost,” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in a statement Saturday.
Two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and leading to a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9 planes. They returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.
Last year the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane.
Max deliveries have been interrupted at times to fix manufacturing flaws. The company told airlines in December to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.

IBK0U27R7A-181,"Florida can import prescription drugs from Canada, US regulators say",Matthew Perrone,"January 6, 2024 at 3:09 PM·4 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-import-prescription-drugs-canada-210926491.html,"WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the way for Florida's first-in-the-nation plan to import prescription drugs from Canada, a long-sought approach to accessing cheaper medications that follows decades of frustration with U.S. drug prices.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.
Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.
The White House called Friday’s action “a step in the right direction,” and encouraged more states to apply for importation.
“For too long, Americans have been forced to pay the highest prescription drug prices of any developed nation,” White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said in a statement.
But even as U.S. politicians applauded the plan, Canadian health providers said it was impractical given the supply challenges the country already faces.
“Historically, we’ve had some pretty devastating drug shortages in Canada,” Joelle Walker, spokesperson for the Canadian Pharmacists Association, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation “So the idea that they could import them from us is not really feasible.""
The policy represents a major shift in the U.S. after years of successful lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.
But the politics surrounding the issue have shifted in recent years, with both parties — including former President Donald Trump — doubling down on the import approach.
Jeff Johnson, director for AARP Florida, said he was excited about the federal decision, though he said it’s only one step of many the group would like to see to help lower prescription drug costs. He noted savings won’t be noticed by most people, but the state will save money overall.
“Unless our healthcare coverage comes through Medicaid or through some another state-run program, we probably won’t save that money on prescription drugs,” Johnson said. “If there are enough different things out there that help reduce drug prices, together they’ll make a difference.”
The FDA said Florida’s program will be authorized for two years, though imports won't begin immediately. Under federal requirements, state officials must first test the drugs to make sure they’re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.
Florida’s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
The FDA action was first reported by The New York Times.
DeSantis, who is battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, previously sued the Biden administration for allegedly delaying approval of the import program. Several other states are also awaiting federal approval.
“After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,” said DeSantis in a statement.
The FDA is likely to face legal challenges over the decision, which the pharmaceutical industry's trade organization called “a serious danger to public health.”
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan,"" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement Friday.
Many people already buy at least some of their medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, although technically it’s illegal to import them.
Work on allowing state imports began under Trump, a relentless critic of industry pricing.
Under the current regulations, states can import certain medicines through pharmacies and wholesalers. DeSantis has previously estimated taxpayers could save up to $150 million annually under the program.
The state’s proposal includes a number of drug classes, including medications for asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD; diabetes; HIV and AIDS; and mental illness.
The medications would be only for certain people, including foster children, inmates, certain elderly patients and — eventually — Medicaid recipients.
Like most developed nations, Canada sets limits on the prices drugmakers can charge if they wish to enter the market. Health officials there have suggested their country’s prescription drug market is too small to have any real impact on U.S. prices.
Until recently, the U.S. government had almost no leverage over the prices set by drugmakers. Only in 2022 did Congress pass a law allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for a small number of medications used by seniors in the Medicare program. The first such negotiations are set to take place later this year.

V32U06P00T-182,Massive California wave kills Georgia woman visiting beach with family,"Doc Louallen, USA TODAY","January 5, 2024 at 6:36 PM·3 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/massive-california-wave-kills-georgia-003627719.html,"A woman from Georgia visiting a California beach with her family died Saturday morning after strong waves hit them, the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office confirmed.
Brindha Shunmuganathan, 39, and her two children were at Pismo Beach when a large wave around 9 a.m. knocked them down, authorities said.
According to police, Shunmuganathan and her family stayed in a nearby hotel while on vacation. They decided to go to the beach, and a large wave came up while taking pictures and knocked them down.
Fox26 News reported that family members rescued the two children; however, the mother was stuck on a rock bed and continuously hit by oncoming waves.
Bystanders who saw the event pulled Shunmuganathan from the waters and attempted to save her by doing CPR, police said. The Pismo Beach Police Department told USA TODAY officers arrived at the scene about 9:11 a.m. Saturday, where they tried to save Shunmuganathan.
After several attempts, she was pronounced dead at the scene by medics who came moments later, police said. The San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office said investigators are waiting for an autopsy to determine Shunmuganathan's cause of death.
This week, the West Coast is expected to experience a swell with big waves and coastal flooding. The strong El Niño pattern in the Pacific Ocean is causing hazardous waves up to 16 feet in size to return to the California coast.
The National Weather Service advises people to stay safe from the ocean. Deadly waves can surge up the beach by at least 150 feet. Experts say it's important to avoid standing on logs on the beach, as large waves can roll or lift these hefty, water-soaked logs, posing a severe safety risk.
Patrick Barnard, a research geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Pacific Coastal Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, previously told USA TODAY the ocean has risen by approximately 10 inches over the last century along the West Coast, and this trend is gaining momentum.
""We're riding on a higher baseline when these larger waves come in, so you tend to have larger coastal impacts, more erosion, and more flooding,"" Barnard said.
On Dec. 30, 2023, The Ventura County Fire Department issued an evacuation warning for some residences bordering Pacific Coast Highway, due to high surf impacting structures in the area.
The recent waves caused significant damage to government buildings in Ventura County, led to erosion of beaches, and resulted in numerous water rescues throughout the state. According to coastal experts and meteorologists who spoke with USA TODAY, the waves are most likely low-frequency, gravity-induced waves originating from offshore, which create a massive runup due to the rough surf and high water conditions.
At least eight people were injured last week in Ventura County when a rogue wave jumped a seawall and cleared out cars and people in its path.

Ukraine says its ""I Want to Live"" hotline guarantees confidentiality and humane treatment.
Russian troops often turn themselves over to Kyiv due to poor treatment from their own commanders.
More than 220 Russian soldiers have surrendered to Ukraine by appealing to the ""I Want to Live"" hotline.
The hotline, operated by the Main Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine, allows Russian soldiers to surrender and guarantees that their detention abides by the Geneva Conventions.
About 1,000 requests for surrender are pending, says Vitalii Matviienko, who leads the surrender scheme, per The Financial Times.
The project's website has been visited more than 48 million times, and the hotline and Telegram chatbot have received more than 26,000 calls since opening, The Kyiv Independent reports.
Access to the hotline and chatbot was blocked in Russia by Russian officials last year, but the scheme is still accessible via VPN.
A propaganda video for the ""I Want to Live"" project addresses Russian soldiers with: ""Ask yourself a question - what are you fighting for?"" per the BBC.
Russian pilot Maksim Kuzminov defected to Ukraine along with his Mi-8 helicopter in August 2023 with the assistance of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
He was promised a reward of the hryvnia equivalent of $500,000.
Kuzminov's high-profile surrender led to a 70% increase in calls to the ""I Want to Live"" hotline in one day, per the Defence Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
A big win for the ""I Want to Live"" hotline became public in October. Russian lieutenant Daniil Alfyorov and 12 men he led, who were deployed on the Kherson front, defected to Ukraine, providing vital military intelligence, The FT reported.
Some surrendered soldiers, like Kuzminov, have chosen to stay in Ukraine with their families, who were also evacuated from Russia, The Kyiv Independent reports.
In certain instances, Russian prisoners may play a role in facilitating exchanges, as shown by the large-scale exchange on January 3, which saw 230 Ukrainian POWs returning home.
A law passed by Ukraine's parliament in April 2022 offers up to $1 million to Russian military personnel facilitating equipment transfers to Ukraine, depending on the type of equipment handed over.
Meanwhile, Russians are surrendering en-masse, citing ""inhumane"" and ""lying"" commanders, the Kyiv Post reports.
The Ukrainian military reports a growing trend of entire groups of Russian soldiers surrendering en masse, said Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesperson for the Tavria Grouping of Troops, per the Kyiv Post.
Shtupun attributes this to what he describes as an ""inhuman attitude"" exhibited by their commanders.
""For refusing to deploy on pointless assaults or for other offenses, some officers would strip them naked in winter cold and hold them in cold pits, beating them and threatening them with execution,"" said Shtupun.
Video evidence supporting these claims has surfaced, including footage showing Russian soldiers rebelling against their commanders. A video released by the Russian anti-corruption group Gulagu.net depicted soldiers being beaten and forced to stand in holes they had dug for hours.
Ukrainian military officials said that Russian forces are killing their own injured soldiers with drones to stop them from surrendering.
Russia has killed its soldiers as ""a reaction to the fact that there are quite a few people willing to surrender to Ukrainian captivity,"" said Andriy Yusov, a representative for Ukraine's military intelligence agency.
Russia's mounting losses are jeopardizing its military capabilities. According to UK intelligence, it could take Russia up to 10 years to replenish its military strength to what it was before the full-scale invasion.
As of December, Russia had lost 87% of the troops it had before the war, per a US intelligence assessment.

It is the second recent instance of such an aircraft glitch; Trudeau's departure from India in September 2023 was delayed by a couple of days after a G20 summit.
""We can confirm two Royal Canadian Air Force CC-144 Challengers were in Jamaica supporting transport for the prime minister,"" a spokesperson for Canada's defence department said.
An inspection uncovered the maintenance issue on Tuesday, before Trudeau’s departure date, the spokesperson added. A maintenance team and aircraft were sent to the island to restore the craft to service the next day.
Trudeau was able to return on the original plane, the spokesperson said.

K3SX4FDT0E-186,North Korea fires 60 rounds of artillery near South Korean border island,AFP,"January 6, 2024 at 8:42 PM·4 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-fires-60-rounds-124208527.html,"North Korea's military fired over 60 artillery rounds near Yeonpyeong Island on Saturday, Seoul's military said, a day after both sides staged live-fire drills in the same area near their contested maritime border.
""North Korean forces conducted artillery fire with over 60 rounds"" northwest of Yeonpyeong Island on Saturday afternoon, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
On Friday, North Korea fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells near Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong, two sparsely populated islands situated just south of a defacto maritime border between the two sides.
Residents of the two islands were ordered to evacuate to shelters and ferries were suspended during one of the most serious military escalations on the peninsula since Pyongyang fired shells at one of the islands in 2010.
Both Friday and Saturday, North Korea's shells landed in a buffer zone created under a 2018 tension-reducing deal, which fell apart in November after the North launched a spy satellite.
Seoul's military said Saturday that ""the repeated artillery fire within the prohibited hostile act zone by North Korea poses a threat to the peace on the Korean Peninsula and escalates tensions"".
""North Korea, following its claim of the complete nullification of the 'September 19 Military Agreement', continues to threaten our citizens with ongoing artillery fire within the prohibited hostile act zone,"" the JCS said, referring to the 2018 deal.
""In response, our military will take appropriate measures,"" it said.
- 'No effect' -
North Korea said Friday that its live-fire drills had not even had ""an indirect effect"" on the border islands.
Yeonpyeong, which has around 2,000 residents, is about 115 kilometres (70 miles) west of Seoul. Baengnyeong, with a population of 4,900, is about 210 kilometres west of Seoul.
In November, Seoul partially suspended the 2018 military accord to protest Pyongyang's putting a spy satellite into orbit. North Korea then scrapped the deal completely.
""It feels as if going back to the era of the Cold War, where the other side's actions are deemed violations and provocations, while one's own actions are seen as defensive and justified responses,"" Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.
He urged Seoul to explore the possibility of working with China -- North Korea's major ally, which has urged restraint from both sides -- to reduce tensions on the peninsula.
""The downside of the tit-for-tat strategy is the inability to take a moderate approach first, even when anticipating significant losses, due to pride,"" he said.
""It is crucial for the leaders of North and South Korea to always remember that when verbal bombshells turn into actions, it will not only mean the end of their regimes but also the demise of our nation.""
- 2010 incident -
In 2010, in response to a South Korean live-fire drill near the sea border, North Korea bombarded Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans -- two soldiers and two civilians.
That was the first attack on a civilian area since the 1950-53 Korean War.
South Korea returned fire in an exchange that lasted more than an hour, as the two sides traded more than 200 shells, sparking brief fears of a full-fledged war.
Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in decades, after the North's leader Kim Jong Un enshrined the country's status as a nuclear power into the constitution while test-firing several advanced inter-continental ballistic missiles.
At year-end policy meetings, Kim warned of a nuclear attack on the South and called for a build-up of the country's military arsenal, warning that conflict could ""break out any time"".
On Friday, KCNA said Kim called for the ramping-up of missile launcher production ""given the prevailing grave situation that requires the country to be more firmly prepared for a military showdown with the enemy"".
His comments came after the White House accused North Korea of providing Russia with ballistic missiles and missile launchers that were used in recent attacks on Ukraine. Washington has called this an escalation of Pyongyang's support for Moscow.
The two Koreas remain technically at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a treaty, and most of the border between them is heavily fortified, with their contested maritime border never officially delineated.

GR17F4DNX4-187,North Korea fires shells near South Korean islands for a second day,Mike Heuer,"January 7, 2024 at 3:56 AM·2 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-fires-shells-near-195630621.html,"Jan. 6 (UPI) -- North Korea fired artillery shells near two South Korean islands for a second straight day Saturday, but the shells were fewer in number and landed in waters above the Northern Limit Line, officials said.
South Korea's military said North Korea fired about 60 shells that landed in waters near the same two islands but north of a demarcation line separating the territorial waters of North Korea and South Korea in the Yellow Sea, Yonhap News Agency reported.
The islands are located near the western border between the two Korean nations.
North Korea fired some 200 artillery shells near the South Korean islands of Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong for over two hours Friday morning. Many of the shells landed in the sea below the NLL, prompting South Korea to respond with artillery salvos totaling about 600 shells that landed in its territorial waters.
South Korea ordered locals to occupy emergency shelters on the two islands Friday for protection. No such order was made after Saturday's shelling, however.
No damage, deaths or injuries occurred due to the shelling on either day, South Korean officials said.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Saturday's shelling occurred for about an hour starting at 4 p.m. local time.
North Korea previously shelled Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, which killed four people and injured 18 more. The 2010 shelling occurred after boundary disputes arose and the United States and South Korea conducted joint military exercises in the area.
A 2018 military pact between the two Koreas created the NLL to diffuse tensions between the two nations that share the Korean Peninsula. North Korea withdrew from the pact in November after launching its first military satellite to orbit the Earth.
The latest round of live-firing near the border separating the Yellow Sea territorial waters between the two nations represents a threat to peace, the South Korean military said in a statement calling for an immediate cease-fire."

Johnson died at the age of 88 on New Year’s Eve.
A viewing for Johnson will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m Monday at the Hall of State at Fair Park in Dallas, according to Star-Telegram media partner, WFAA-TV. A prayer service will follow the viewing, scheduled from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Concord Church at 8808 Pastor Bailey Drive.
Johnson’s funeral will be held at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Jan. 9., at Concord Church.
Services will end with a graveyard service at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 10, at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.
Johnson served almost three decades in Congress representing Dallas and the North Texas area. The first black member of Congress from Dallas and the third female Texas native elected to the U.S. House, Johnson won reelection 15 times before retiring in 2023.
“She was a remarkable and loving mother, mother-in-law, grandmother and great grandmother, as well as a trailblazer and public servant,” said her son, Kirk Johnson, in a Facebook post Sunday announcing her passing.
Born Dec. 3, 1935 in Waco, Johnson attended Southern Methodist University, Texas Christian University, Saint Mary’s College and worked as a nurse prior to her political career.
She was also a champion of women’s and minority rights.
After announcing her retirement, she quickly endorsed U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas, who filled Johnson’s seat in 2023.
“Throughout her life, and as the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, she was an icon and mentor to generations of public servants, through whom her legacy of resilience and purpose will endure,” Biden said in a statement Sunday. “Jill and I send our love to her family, including her son Kirk and her grandchildren Kirk Jr., David, and James; to her many friends; and to the people of Texas’ 30th Congressional District, who were so fortunate to have her as their champion for so long.”
Johnson’s family invites all who wish to participate in commemorating her life to the services.
“The memorial services of Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson will provide an opportunity for friends, colleagues, and the community to celebrate and honor the extraordinary life and legacy of her remarkable contributions to public service,” the family said in a statement, according to KXAS-TV. “Memorial services will include tributes, reflections, and remembrances from those who were touched by Congresswoman Johnson’s dedication and leadership. These services aim to capture the essence of her enduring impact on the community and the nation.”"

The discovery came when the family had the artefact examined by art experts as they prepared to sell their house in Herzele, west of Brussels.
Photos of the marble relief, which had been inlaid for years in a wall of the home, were emailed to an expert at the Gallo-Roman Museum in Tongeren, Belgium.
Its director of exhibitions, Bart de Marsin, who is also an archaeologist, quickly identified the object as a likely ancient relic.
""It soon became clear to us that it was an object from Pompeii, stolen in the 1970s,"" he told Belgian daily De Standaard.
When Marsin travelled to Herzele to identify the object, his intuition was confirmed: it was indeed from Pompeii.
On the marble plaque are reliefs representing an earthquake that hit Pompeii in 62 BC, with part of the walls in the process of collapsing"", he said.
""In Pompeii, there are only two pieces of material evidence of the earthquake. These are very important objects for the history of the city.""
The owner said he had bought the bas-relief from a street vendor while on holiday in Italy in 1975, adding that he had no idea it was an original.
The family is hoping to obtain financial compensation for keeping it for so long.

Five of the dead were children. A U.N. official in Ukraine expressed horror at the incident.
Rescue efforts extended into the night. Pictures posted online by regional governor Vadym Filashkin showed teams sifting through piles of smouldering rubble in the dark as well as a burned-out vehicle.
Filashkin told Ukrainian television that Russian forces at about 3 p.m. engaged in ""mass shelling"" of Pokrovsk with S-300 missiles.
""As a result of this barbaric attack, 11 people died, including five children aged from three to 17 years,"" he said.
""Ten people were injured. Rescue operations are continuing. Closer to morning we will have a better understanding of the final numbers of those who were injured.""
Filashkin had earlier said the main strike had targeted the town of Pokrovsk and nearby villages lying about 80 km (50 miles) from the Russian-held regional centre of Donetsk.
Russian forces, he said, were ""trying to inflict as much grief as possible on our land.""
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address, said the attack ""quite simply targeted ordinary, private homes. And Russia must be made to feel that none of these strikes will pass without consequences for the terrorist state.""
""TRULY HORRIFIED""
Denise Brown, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said she was ""truly horrified"" by the strikes and, particularly, the deaths of children.
""These were just children who have been killed because of this war,"" Brown said in a statement.
Recent Russian attacks on towns, she said, were ""leaving behind an outrageous number of children. Women and men killed and injured and a trail of loss and destruction.""
There was no immediate response to a request for comment on the incident from Russia's Defence Ministry.
A Russian military statement issued earlier on Saturday said its forces had struck a command post used by a Ukrainian military formation near Pokrovsk, referring to the town by its Soviet-era name Krasnoarmeisk.
And a senior Moscow official working in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, Rodion Miroshnik, said Ukrainian forces had shelled a hospital in Donetsk, injuring three patients. Pictures he posted online showed damage to rooms and some outbuildings.
Russia denies targeting civilians in the war launched with the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
But its forces in the past two weeks have intensified attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns. Ukraine has retaliated with strikes on targets in the Black Sea and on some Russian border areas, including missile and drone attacks that killed 25 people in the city of Belgrade this week.
The governor of Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, adjacent to Donetsk, said one person was killed in drone strikes near the town of Nikopol, a frequent Russian target on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
And officials said three people were injured in Russian shelling of areas of Kherson region to the southwest.

88GTBJHIT1-191,Russians record fake videos of civilian hostages being released,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 6, 2024 at 9:29 PM·3 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/russians-record-fake-videos-civilian-132959553.html,"Russia has abducted thousands of civilian Ukrainians from Ukraine. They are being illegally held hostage and often called prisoners of war, so it is extremely difficult to bring back such people.
Source: Petro Yatsenko, head of the press service of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War
Details: According to Petro Yatsenko, it is not necessary to call the homecoming of civilian hostages an exchange.
""The word ‘exchange’ is not suitable here. That is, we would have to catch Russian civilians somewhere and exchange them. Of course, we will not do this. But the problem is really huge. Because there are many civilians that Russia has captured and imprisoned.
They don't even have any legal basis to actually keep these people in jail. They are trying to accuse them of obstructing the so-called ‘special military operation’, and they are still making up something"", said Yatsenko [Special military operation is a Russian propaganda term for the war in Ukraine – ed.].
The Coordination Headquarters is also aware of cases where the Russians simply release civilian hostages who have been held captive.
""But they release them without documents or means of subsistence. Then it is very difficult for them to get out, for example, from Russia or from the temporarily occupied territories to the territory controlled by Ukraine,"" says the head of the press service.
According to Petro Yatsenko, earlier it was proposed to exchange civilian Ukrainians for Russian servicemen.
""But this is also not an option because many Ukrainians live in the occupied territories. This will be an incentive for them to capture everyone in order to exchange them. This is not an option. And this is where international pressure is important,"" Yatsenko explains.
He also noted that the Russians are very creative in how they use hostages. They often record videos of civilians being released when, in fact, they continue to hold them captive.
""We have seen Russians on camera allegedly releasing civilians they had imprisoned. For the video, they said: ‘Here is a checkpoint on the border with the occupied territory. And now we let you go, go anywhere you want.’ And these people seemed to be going somewhere, but then they did not come to Ukrainian territory."" Yatsenko added.
He is convinced that the actions of the Russians are aimed at causing as much suffering as possible to the civilian population of Ukraine and discouraging them from helping their troops.
The head of the press service of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War also drew attention to the lack of activity by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in working on the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war.
Thus, in Ukraine, the ICRC has full access to the absolute majority of places of detention of prisoners, while on the Russian side, it has access to only a few.
""We would like the ICRC to be more active in demanding this access and helping. Now we see that they have started to work more actively, in particular in terms of delivering parcels and visiting these places. And now they are faced with the fact that Russia has allegedly signed all the documents on access but is not going to comply with them; there is no interaction."" concludes Yatsenko.
Background: 230 Ukrainians were brought back from Russian captivity for the first time since August 2023.

VQ7W53OLOB-192,UK police launch fraud inquiry over post office IT scandal,AFP,"January 6, 2024 at 2:20 AM·2 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-police-launch-fraud-inquiry-102020694.html,"UK police have announced they are investigating possible fraud offences committed during Britain's post office scandal, described as one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British legal history.
More than 700 people running small local post offices received criminal convictions between 1999 and 2005 after faulty accounting software made it appear that money had gone missing from their branches.
The prosecutions for theft and false accounting have received new attention following a television drama about one branch manager's fight for justice that was aired on British television this week.
London's Metropolitan Police said late Friday that officers are ""investigating potential fraud offences arising out of these prosecutions"".
The probe also includes money recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of civil actions, the force added in a statement.
The Met had already been investigating potential crimes of perjury and perverting the course of justice relating to investigations and prosecutions carried out by the Post Office.
Two people have been interviewed under caution but nobody has been arrested since the investigation opened in January 2020.
The scandal has been described at an ongoing public inquiry as ""the worst miscarriage of justice in recent British legal history"".
The Horizon IT system had been developed by the Japanese technology giant Fujitsu.
The Post Office began installing the software in the late '90s, but flaws in its programming showed up deficits in branch accounts.
Postal service executives, refusing to acknowledge problems with the software, forced workers to repay the shortfalls.
Some were imprisoned or left out of pocket, while others failed to find other jobs and lost their homes.
In December 2019, a High Court judge concluded that the system contained a number of ""bugs, errors and defects"".
Eighty-six postmasters have so far seen their convictions overturned and £21 million ($26 million) has been paid in compensation.
The UK government announced in September that every postmaster convicted would receive a payout of hundreds of thousands of pounds.
The four-part television series, ""Mr Bates vs the Post Office,"" shown on ITV, has led to 50 potential new victims contacting lawyers, British media has reported.

The Russian state news agency TASS said 248 Russian servicemen were released during the prisoner swap.
According to Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Rossiya Segodnya media group, 75 Russian servicemen were also exchanged for five members of the Ukraine's Azov regiment designated as a terrorist organization in Russia.
UAE's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its appreciation to the governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine for their cooperation and response to the UAE mediation efforts to make the prisoner exchange process a success, despite the challenges posed by the current war conditions.""
The UAE added that it is committed to continuing efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine as it called for diplomacy, dialogue and reducing escalation.
UAE's Foreign Ministry said the prisoner exchange was ""one of the largest prisoner exchanges between the two sides since the beginning of the war."""
2OP0F3S7ET-194,"Ukraine war: Atesh, the group spying on Russians in occupied Crimea","Jessica Parker - BBC News, Kyiv","January 6, 2024 at 9:12 AM·7 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-atesh-group-spying-011237509.html,"""I had a hunch that someone was watching me. My heart was pounding.""
A man, who we're calling Agent One, takes photos as he crouches down in some bushes.
He tells us he's part of a group called Atesh - a word that means fire in Crimean Tatar.
And via a messaging app, he describes his secret life to the BBC: spying on Russian forces in occupied Crimea.
""For probably two weeks, I planned in my head how and what I would do,"" he says. ""Planned the route, the main backup, what I should say in case I was noticed.""
Agent One is thorough. He takes multiple shots from multiple angles.
But it's dangerous - potentially deadly - work. On one occasion, moments after investigating a site, he noticed a group of Russian servicemen nearby.
""[That] was a terrible moment,"" he says. ""I managed to lean down [by a] car and pretended that I had a problem with the wheel.""
""Miraculously, they just didn't talk to me.""
Atesh says it collects information on Russian military movements - mostly in Crimea but also in other occupied areas and even inside Russia itself.
Operatives say their information has aided high-profile Ukrainian strikes on Crimea, such as hits on a Russian landing ship and submarine - the Minsk and Rostov-on-Don - and an attack on the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in September 2023.
Most recently, Atesh said it had carried out reconnaissance work this week after a Ukrainian strike on a possible radar station in Yevpatoria.
Military bloggers in Russia dismiss the network as an online invention of Ukrainian intelligence, designed to overstate levels of resistance.
Yet Russian media also report that Atesh is a terrorist organisation, banned by the Kremlin.
Through messaging apps and a handler for the group, the BBC has spoken with five men who say they're active agents for Atesh - including one who says he currently works for Russia's military.
While their accounts cannot be independently verified, a senior source within Ukraine's defence and intelligences services told the BBC that the testimonies are credible.
The agents say they're willing to speak to us because they want to show there is an active resistance movement.
""Crimeans are not all zombies and [are] ready to resist even in conditions of total censorship,"" Agent One says.
The Russian serviceman who the BBC spoke to - Agent Five - knows his double life is dangerous.
""The stakes are very high - no one wants to go to jail."" Those caught face treason charges and long prison sentences.
""Everything must be approached carefully and with your head. Mistakes in such activities are simply unacceptable.""
Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014, eight years before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Ethnic Russians now make up the majority of the population, but significant Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities remain.
The BBC contacted Atesh directly and spoke to a handler based in unoccupied Ukraine.
The men will not reveal their identities due to the risk of arrest.
""The Russian special services are constantly trying to identify partisans,"" Agent Two tells us.
He hides the work he is doing from even his closest family.
These men say they started carrying out reconnaissance work because of their opposition to Moscow's actions.
They tell us they provide intel on air defences, depots, military bases and soldiers' movements, sometimes staking out sites for weeks.
Agent Two says he's not paid for his work, but he is refunded for his expenses, like fuel.
Our main contact, the handler, would not comment on how the group is funded except to say there are ""several"" sources of income.
A different body - the National Resistance Centre, which operates under Ukraine's Special Operation Forces - is openly funded by the government and works with Atesh.
It insists Atesh is not a propaganda construct and that the intel is of high value.
""A missile attack with Storm Shadow or Himars is a very expensive thing,"" says its spokesman, who wears a mask and goes under the pseudonym of ""Ostap"".
""We can't let ourselves throw ammunition randomly as the Russians do. We have to verify the information we're getting.""
Agent Two describes driving more than 100km (62 miles) to survey a military site. He walked ""for a long time"", before managing to find a gap in a fence.
He squeezed through it, to gather photos and information on military vehicles.
""It's exciting,"" he says. ""Adrenaline rises incredibly powerfully at such moments.""
In the days that followed, he heard there had been a successful strike in that area.
""This is the moment I am most proud of,"" he says.
Huge attacks on Russian military targets in Crimea are seen by Kyiv as a key part of a counter-offensive that has faltered elsewhere, notably on the frontlines.
The peninsula is of high strategic importance as it is essentially an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"", says retired Ukrainian Navy Captain Andriy Ryzhenko.
Based in Crimea before the annexation and now in Kyiv, he says the peninsula is used by Russia to ""project power"" from the Black Sea towards the Mediterranean and Atlantic.
It has forced Ukraine to create a new sea route for grain ships to steer clear of the peninsula, after Russia pulled out of a deal to allow shipments.
Yet satellite imagery indicates Ukrainian strikes have caused Russia to move assets away from occupied Sevastopol and to the Russian port of Novorossiysk.
For Atesh, the threat of infiltration by pro-Russian operatives is very real, in a murky world of agents and double agents.
""We try not to disclose strategic plans to the agents who are at risk of being taken by the FSB,"" says our handler, in reference to Russia's Federal Security Service.
""A person knows only what he needs to know.""
A third agent tells us that ""filming the military of a country that is at war is suicide"", but the risk is justified because of Russia's ""criminal war"".
""If I am caught, then I will face the basements of the FSB and [accusations of being] a 'traitor' to the Motherland.""
But, with the risk, comes the possibility too of reward.
""We often see the fruits of our work,"" says Agent Four. ""When… Russian military [sites] are hit, so that only ashes remain.""
Sometimes it's just a quick photo or two. Sometimes Agent Four observes areas over a prolonged period.
""To find out all the routes of patrols, find out where all the exits and entrances are, what equipment is on the territory, or what exactly is stored at the facility.""
Each man tells us he works alone, contacting only a ""curator"" to whom the information is passed.
Atesh appeared as a network after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and is by no means the only resistance organisation in occupied areas.
It claims to be a grassroots movement that's grown from a small group which now numbers ""thousands"".
An ""oath"" posted on the Telegram messaging app in September 2022 said, ""I swear by my blood and my soul"" to be faithful to the Atesh movement and ""fight for the Ukrainian state"".
There are reported to be strong links to the peninsula's Turkic-speaking Crimean Tatar population - although representatives of that community who the BBC spoke to said they did not start Atesh.
The group regularly posts about its work on Telegram, even uploading photos.
While the movement mainly appears to provide logistical information, partisan activists also claim to have carried out violent attacks - such as killing 30 Russian soldiers in a military hospital and a car-bomb attack in Russian-occupied Kherson.
The handler we speak to concedes that they are keen to publicise the group - to recruit more agents and unnerve the Russians.
But all those the BBC spoke to say their priority is ending Russia's invasion and its occupation of Ukrainian land.
Agent One says that, in Crimea, they live in ""terrible conditions"" of propaganda and control.
""But I am absolutely sure that we are gradually bringing our liberation of Crimea closer.""

Military intelligence reports cross-border raid on Russian positions in Belgorod Oblast
Armed Forces report striking Russian arsenals in occupied Crimea
Governor claims Russia attacked Kharkiv Oblast with foreign-made missiles
Russian attacks target, damage front-line power plant again
Ukrainian forces of the military intelligence agency, HUR, reported on Jan. 5 that its forces engaged in a cross-border raid on Russian positions in Belgorod Oblast and inflicted an undisclosed number of losses.
Incursions into Russia's western Belgorod Oblast have been reported on several occasions since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.
Most notable were high-profile skirmishes that occurred after a group of armed men calling themselves members of the Free Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps recorded videos saying they had crossed into Russia in May 2023 and taken hold of several villages.
HUR said it had received intelligence that Russian commanders planned to inspect military positions in the Gayvoron district of Belgorod Oblast, some 80 kilometers west of the city of Belgorod and the location of the May 2023 incursions.
The inspections were allegedly due to complaints from Russian soldiers about poor conditions in the area, according to the report.
HUR said it mined the only road in the area and attacked a Russian platoon, sharing a video of parts of the assault. The number of casualties inflicted is still being determined, the HUR said.
The incursion comes after Russia claimed that at least 24 people were killed in an attack on Belgorod on Dec. 30.
Several Ukrainian media outlets reported, citing anonymous sources in Ukraine's special services, that Ukrainian forces had launched an attack on military facilities in Belgorod in response to Russia's Dec. 29 massive attack on Ukraine that killed over 50 people.
Debris from anti-air munitions fell in the Belgorod city center “due to the unprofessional actions of the Russian air defense,” according to the sources.
The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify any of the claims. Kyiv generally does not comment on reports of attacks and explosions on Russian soil.

Ukrainian forces struck on Jan. 4 Russian ammunition warehouses near the village of Pervomaiske in Russian-occupied Crimea, Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 5.
In recent months, Russian-occupied Crimea has seen an uptick in Ukrainian attacks in an attempt to disrupt Russian logistics and derail its southern defenses.
Pervomaiske is located in northern Crimea, closer to the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Kherson Oblast.
The exact number of ammunition warehouses struck near the village is unknown. The Ukrainian military said that the attack was carried out during the day.
Multiple explosions were reported in the Crimean cities of Sevastopol and Yevpatoriia in the afternoon of Jan. 4, followed by the Russian Defense Ministry’s claim that its forces shot down 10 Ukrainian missiles over the peninsula.
Later the same day, Ukraine’s military said it had struck a Russian military command post near Sevastopol, which is home to Russia’s Black Sea fleet.
Overnight on Jan. 4, explosions were heard again in several cities of Russian-occupied Crimea, as well as in Russia’s Black Sea port city of Novorossiysk.
The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its forces had destroyed and intercepted 36 Ukrainian drones over the peninsula and another over Russia’s Krasnodar region, where Novorossiysk is located.
Kyiv has not commented on the overnight attack.
A Ukrainian missile strike early on Dec. 26 hit and apparently destroyed the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk, docked in the Crimean city of Feodosia.
Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia's Black Sea fleet since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, including the sinking of the flagship cruiser Moskva in April 2022 and a devastating missile attack on the fleet's headquarters in occupied Crimea that reportedly killed more than 30 officers.
Some of the missiles that Russia used to strike the city of Kharkiv and the region in late December and early January were produced in a foreign country, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Jan. 5.
The day before, the White House reported that Russia had already used ballistic missiles supplied by North Korea to attack Ukraine. Ukraine’s Air Force reported it can’t confirm this information yet.
Syniehubov said at a press conference that Ukrainian authorities are still investigating the origin of the missiles Russia used to attack Kharkiv Oblast.
“The markings have been erased from these missiles, but we can see that the country of manufacture is not the Russian Federation,” said the governor, as cited by ArmyInform, the Defense Ministry's news agency.
According to the White House, Russian forces launched at least one of the North Korean-supplied missiles into Ukraine on Dec. 30, and this missile appears to have landed in an open field in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Russia also used multiple North Korean missiles to strike Ukraine on Jan. 2, Kirby said, including as part of its overnight mass attack that killed five people and injured 130 more.
One of the primary targets of the Jan. 2 mass attack was Kharkiv, which Russian troops hit with multiple Iskander ballistic missiles, killing two people and injuring over 60.

Russian attacks on Jan. 4 again damaged a front-line thermal power plant operated by Ukraine's energy giant DTEK that has been struck repeatedly before, the company reported on Jan. 5.
For security reasons, DTEK didn't specify the location of the plant, presumably to avoid giving up sensitive information about the location of Ukraine's critical infrastructure.
Over the winter of 2022-2023, Russia engaged in a persistent campaign to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing large-scale outages and damage to the grid.
Russia began intensifying its attacks against Ukraine's cities and critical infrastructure as the temperatures dropped at the end of 2023, mirroring its strategy from last year.
DTEK said the plant struck on Jan. 4 had been attacked more than a dozen times in the past 2.5 months. In one Russian strike, five workers were injured.
The Jan. 4 strike caused serious damage to the plant's equipment but caused no casualties.

""The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks,"" which aired on Investigation Discovery, answered some lingering questions about the bizarre case and shocked producers with additional uncertainties that may prompt a follow-up series.
""'Natalia Speaks' is one of those projects where the further we dug in, the more twists and turns we uncovered,"" Investigation Discovery President Jason Sarlanis told The Hollywood Reporter, detailing last-minute developments in production.
""Our viewers are so invested in Natalia’s case we felt our series needed to reflect the constantly shifting truth of her situation. One thing has always proven to be true with Natalia’s story — nothing is ever what it seems.""
ADOPTED GIRL ACCUSED OF 'MASQUERADING' AS 6-YEAR-OLD SPEAKS OUT IN NEW DOC: 'DO I LOOK LIKE A MONSTER TO YOU?'
The six-episode series is a follow-up to its counterpart, released in May, which focused on the claims of adoptive parents Kristine and Michael Barnett.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Due to flooding at the Ukrainian hospital where she was born, she has no birth certificate to legally identify her age. Adding to the confusion, FBI Special Agent Kenneth J. Maxwell told producers, the judge who handled the girl's adoption proceedings was later terminated for corruption.
QUESTIONS FACE FAMILY THAT CLAIMED THEY ADOPTED ADULT 'MASQUERADING' AS 6-YEAR-OLD: LAWYER
Anna Gava, Natalia's birth mother, said in interviews that she gave her daughter up for adoption due to her disability.
The Indiana couple adopted Natalia in April 2010, believing she was a 6-year-old.
But after six months of alleged strange behavior, the parents claim they began to suspect their daughter was an adult woman scamming their family. Natalia has a form of dwarfism called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, giving her a small frame that left her true age a mystery without medical testing.
According to the earlier docuseries, Natalia hoarded knives, placed thumbtacks facing upward so the family would step on them unwittingly and, at one point, attempted to poison her adoptive mother with Pine-Sol.
But in her most recent interview, Natalia attempted to clear her name.""In every lie is a hidden truth, but you’ve gotta dig enough to be able to see it,"" Natalia said. ""They’re not going to get away with this. This is my side of the story. Do I look like a monster to you?""
ADOPTED GIRL ACCUSED OF 'MASQUERADING' AS 6-YEAR-OLD SPOTTED WITH NEW DAD SELLING FIREWORKS ON PARKING LOT
The Barnetts successfully petitioned a court in Marion County to change Natalia's birth year from 2003 to 1989, making her legally 22.
They moved her into an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, according to the documentary, and moved with their three biological sons to Canada. There, neighbors noticed that the new renter struggled with everyday household tasks and often went hungry.
Although she was legally an adult, the Barnetts were charged in 2019 with neglect of a dependent due to her disability.
The adoptive father was found not guilty by a jury in 2022, while the mother's charges were dismissed this year. Both parents defended themselves against accusations against them in the documentary, claiming Natalia was an adult capable of caring for herself.
DAD WHO CLAIMS HE ADOPTED VIOLENT ADULT 'MASQUERADING' AS 6-YEAR-OLD BREAKS DOWN OVER 'ABUSE'
Through a blood sample via TruDiagnostic, a medical lab specializing in biological aging, producers of the series determined Natalia is 22 years old, disputing her legal age of 34.
In a possible explanation of the Barnetts' motivation to change Natalia's age, documentarians assert the couple wanted to exploit the girl for money. Their son Jacob inspired ""The Spark,"" Kristine Barnett's book about raising her son with autism and his academic achievements, which earned a $600,000 advance and had a pending movie deal, according to the documentary.
But when the girl was tested and found to be of average intelligence, legal expert Beth Karas hypothesized in the series that the couple plotted to have her removed from their home.
First, Karas posited, the Barnetts had the girl's age changed legally. Because her genetic disorder rendered her a dependent for whom they would be legally responsible regardless of age, they fabricated details of her alleged sociopathic behavior to place her in a prison or psychiatric facility.
Natalia was committed to Larue Carter, an Indiana mental hospital, in June 2012, but the facility quickly determined she wasn't mentally unstable.
She was subsequently sent to a halfway house, where she called her adoptive parents and told them she was afraid to live with drug addicts.
Michael Barnett told producers they took the girl back to avoid negative appearances if the girl was harmed.
But Natalia, who confronted her adoptive father in the last episode of the new series, claims she was abused by the couple. She was pepper-sprayed three times, she said, and Kristine once gave her three times her prescribed dose of heart medication in an attempt to kill her.
Natalia also described how her adoptive mother forced her to insert a tampon at 7 years old. This caused her to bleed, she claims, which Kristine later used as false evidence she was menstruating.
But new details from Natalia's latest adoptive parents, Bishop Antwon Mans and his wife Cynthia, raised more questions.
The Mans family has publicly defended Natalia on television shows like ""Dr. Phil"" and even stood by her when she confronted her former adoptive father for the documentary.
But two weeks before the series was slated to air and six months after they formally adopted her, the couple made a frantic call to producers.
""Something ain’t right with Natalia,"" Bishop Mans said in an audio clip aired in the last 90 seconds of the series. ""This girl is tweakin’. I feel like she’s the enemy of the house. And she said to us we have held her hostage. … We're done, we're done with her.""
""Natalia is stabbing her family in the back over a complete lie,"" Cynthia can be heard saying, backing up her husband's claims.
""Our series was already finished and locked, but we instantly mobilized with our producers to ensure that this shocking development was included in our finale,"" Sarlanis told The Hollywood Reporter of the twist. ""We genuinely thought Natalia had found a happy ending with her new family, so you can imagine we were all thoroughly shocked when that call came from the Mans.""
Now that it has aired live, ""The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks"" is available for streaming via HBO Max and Discovery +.

Y0Q8ZHR6N1-198,US criticizes Burundi leader call to stone gay couples,AFP,"January 6, 2024 at 7:53 AM·1 min read",20240106,https://news.yahoo.com/us-criticizes-burundi-leader-call-235358628.html,"The United States on Friday criticized Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye after he called for public stoning of same-sex couples, the latest anti-gay broadside by an East African leader.
""The United States is deeply troubled by President Ndayishimiye's remarks targeting certain vulnerable and marginalized Burundians,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.
""We call on all of Burundi's leaders to respect the inherent dignity and inalienable rights, including equal access to justice, of every member of Burundian society,"" he said.
The statement did not explicitly mention LGBTQ rights, a delicate topic in much of Africa, but was a clear reference to remarks by Ndayishimiye at a public event late last month.
Responding to a question on gay couples, Ndayishimiye said, ""Personally, I think if we see these kind of individuals in Burundi, we should put them in a stadium and stone them.""
Burundi's relationship has improved in recent years with the United States, which had imposed sanctions in 2015 over a deadly crackdown on dissent as Ndayishimiye's predecessor Pierre Nkurunziza controversially sought a third term.
The United States in 2022 agreed to a five-year aid package with Burundi after removing sanctions, in part crediting reforms by Ndayishimiye.
The US statement Friday did not threaten repercussions. Last month, the United States restricted visas to officials from Uganda who implement a new law that carries potential death sentences for homosexual relations.
President Joe Biden promised on taking office in 2021 to advocate forcefully at home and abroad for LGBTQ rights, although US diplomats often say a quiet approach is more effective.

CO3XA494DH-201,A Kansas man pleaded guilty to selling plane parts to Russia. Here's how Russian airlines have struggled with sanctions.,Pete Syme,"January 7, 2024 at 7:03 PM·2 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/kansas-man-pleaded-guilty-selling-110301050.html,"Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky pleaded guilty to his part in a scheme selling aircraft parts to Russia.
Plane safety incidents tripled in Russia last year compared to 2022, as it struggles with sanctions.
Russian operators have resorted to smuggling in spare parts, or cannibalizing grounded jets.
A Kansas business owner pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and money laundering in relation to selling aircraft parts to Russia, the Department of Justice announced last month.
The scheme highlights how Russia has struggled to keep its commercial planes in the air since western sanctions were imposed after Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, the owner of KanRus Trading, took part in ""a years-long conspiracy to circumvent US export laws by filing false export forms,"" the DoJ said.
He was arrested in March last year, alongside KanRus vice-president Douglas Robertson, who pleaded not guilty to 26 counts, The Associated Press reported.
According to the plea agreement seen by Business Insider, the pair conspired to sell avionics equipment to Russian customers. It added they attempted to conceal the sales by naming false end users, and shipping via countries including the United Arab Emirates.
Buyanovsky also admitted that he did business with Russia's security agency, the FSB, on at least one occasion.
The DoJ said he and Robertson removed an FSB sticker from a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) before sending it to another US company to be repaired. Then, they replaced the sticker and smuggled it back to the FSB.
Buyanovsky consented to the forfeiture of over $450,000 worth of avionics equipment, and a sentencing hearing is scheduled for March 21. He faces up to 25 years in prison.
Despite the sanctions, Russia has managed to keep many jets flying — smuggling in an estimated $14 million of spare parts, or cannibalizing them from grounded jets and creating a ""Frankenstein fleet.""
However, plane safety incidents in Russia tripled last year as airlines struggled to maintain their fleets.
That included a Ural Airlines A320, which made an emergency landing in a Siberian field after its hydraulics system failed.
The airline has been trying to repair the jet so it can take off from the field.
Sanctions also resulted in 700 leased planes, worth some $12 billion, being stranded in Russia.
Lessors managed to retrieve some aircraft before a new law was implemented allowing foreign jets to be reregistered as Russian, BBC News reported.

XWC0C2MIFC-202,Argentina's snub may strain China ties but Brics has 'dodged a bullet',South China Morning Post,"January 7, 2024 at 5:30 PM·5 min read",20240107,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentinas-snub-may-strain-china-093000594.html,"Argentina's snub of the Brics developing economies may further strain relations with China but the bloc has ""dodged a bullet"", according to analysts.
There has been uncertainty over the relationship between China and Argentina since far-right economist Javier Milei was elected president of the Latin American nation in November. While Milei has softened his tone recently, he had campaigned on breaking ties with China, stating that its people were ""not free"" and that Argentina would no longer work with nations ""ruled by communism"".
Milei's China policy is a stark contrast to that of his centre-left predecessor Alberto Fernandez, who in 2022 signed onto Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. His attendance at the Beijing Winter Olympics that year and the belt and road forum in October were seen as signs of growing ties.

But Milei has made clear that his country's ""geopolitical alignment"" is with the United States and Israel, whose ongoing attack on Gaza has alienated much of the Global South.
Milei - whose letter to Brics leaders in December said the moment was not ""opportune"" for Argentina to join as a full member - is seemingly fulfilling his pledge to ditch Fernandez's efforts to seek closer ties with developing economies.

According to Josef Gregory Mahoney, a politics and international relations professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai, Beijing had anticipated that Argentina would join Brics, so its withdrawal was ""a source of some embarrassment"".
But he said it would be Argentina that lost out over the decision.
Argentina, which is facing a deepening economic crisis, was among six countries invited in August to join Brics - made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - to form an 11-nation bloc. Fernandez had endorsed joining the alliance as an opportunity to reach new markets.
""I wouldn't really describe Argentina's decision as a setback for Brics or China - it's a setback for Argentina,"" Mahoney said.
He added that Beijing had been eager to grow the bloc ""in ways that balance different regional interests without alienating current members"", given that some were ""less enthusiastic about expansion"".
""Given the poor state of the Argentine economy and the damage that's being done to it by Milei's economic policies, his withdrawal is a blessing in disguise for the other Brics members - they've dodged a bullet,"" Mahoney said, adding that the radical libertarian was pursuing ""shock therapy policies"" such as a move to slash the value of the Argentine peso by over 50 per cent against the US dollar.
According to Zhang Chi, associate lecturer of international relations at the University of St Andrews, Milei's decision on Brics reflects a broader concern among developing countries being pressured to choose between the US-led world order and alternative systems.
""In the short term, Argentina's decision to pivot towards the West and align with the US, despite receiving goodwill from Chinese President Xi Jinping, may lead to a decrease in diplomatic and economic engagement with China,"" Zhang said.
In November, Xi sent a congratulatory message to Milei on his election, saying he was ready to work with the new leader to ""continue the China-Argentina friendship, help the development and revitalisation of our respective countries through win-win cooperation, and promote steady and far-reaching development of China-Argentina relations"".
""In the long term, if other Latin American countries follow Argentina's lead in re-evaluating their involvement in Brics, where China plays a major role, it could potentially weaken the bloc's regional economic influence and undermine China's growing influence in Latin America,"" Zhang said.
""China has emerged as South America's foremost trading partner, wielding substantial influence through extensive foreign direct investments and lending, particularly in energy and infrastructure sectors via the belt and road,"" she said, noting that 21 South American nations had joined the initiative.
Those links have worried Washington, while for Milei it has become imperative to ""convey a more pronounced alignment with the US, particularly following his recent meetings with US officials"", according to Zhang.
""This shift signifies a deliberate departure from prior policies and a renewed emphasis on aligning with the US while taking a more assertive stance against China,"" she added.
Mahoney likened Milei's style to that of former US president Donald Trump, especially his stated goal of strengthening bilateral ties with nations without going through international organisations like Brics.
""Milei is a right-leaning populist who ran against the previous government's policies, which had pursued Brics membersship, and he also used Trump-style dog whistle tactics to demonise the Chinese government,"" said Mahoney, adding that his election victory ""surprised pundits"".
Mahoney said Milei, like Trump, used ""radical, populist messaging to appeal to deeply frustrated, polarised electorates who are fed up and willing to try something new"".
Xu Qinduo, a political analyst at the Chinese think tank Pangoal Institution, argued that had Argentina joined Brics it might have made the bloc more attractive to other Latin American countries.
""Argentina is the second-largest economy in [South America] and remains a major agricultural power, despite its chronic economic crisis,"" Xu said. ""Having it join Brics would make it more influential as a bloc of emerging economies and perhaps more representative of the Global South.""
Xu said some Latin American countries were concerned about being seen as ""anti-West"" by taking part in Brics, while others were focused on economic opportunities. Members benefit from loans from the New Development Bank established by Brics in 2014, and from more access to regional economies.
Despite rejecting Brics and attempting to ""demonstrate his loyalty to Washington"", Xu said Milei was open to developing trade and investment ties in other ways.
""There are reasons for Argentina to maintain trade ties with the Brics countries,"" Xu said. ""Brazil, China and India are among its top five trading partners.""

SKEWR3224Y-203,European Council president’s early resignation announcement ignites race to replace him,Our Foreign Staff,"January 8, 2024 at 6:25 AM·3 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/european-council-president-early-resignation-222507844.html,"European council president, Charles Michel, announced on Sunday that he will step down early, setting off a race against time for EU leaders to prevent the role falling to Viktor Orban, the nationalist Hungarian president.
The 48-year-old former Belgian prime minister has been organising EU summits and government meetings since 2019 and should leave office in November 2024.
But he said he would leave early as he will stand in the European parliament elections to be held in June. Mr Michel will be the head of the liberal Reformist Movement in the elections.
Mr Michel said: “Four years after starting my term as a European leader, it’s my responsibility to give an account of my work these past years and to propose a project for Europe’s future.”
An EU summit is scheduled for just after the June 6-9 elections, and “at this moment it will have to decide when my successor will take up the job”, Mr Michel said.
If European Union leaders cannot find a successor by then, Mr Orban, who has had frequent battles with Brussels, could take the job temporarily.
As council president, one of Mr Michel’s main tasks has been overseeing EU summits that have decided the bloc’s responses to crises including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr Orban has maintained close ties to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, since the war started.
Hungary is due to take over the rotating presidency of the 27-member group from July 1. In that role, it organises EU ministerial meetings.
Mr Michel said he will remain as the council president until he is sworn in as a European parliament deputy, which is scheduled for July 16.
His move has been criticised by some European politicians.
Sophie in’t Veld, a Dutch MEP for the liberal centrist Renew Europe party said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Mr Michel had abandoned his duties.
“The captain leaving the ship in the middle of a storm. If that is how little committed you are to the fate of the European Union, then how credible are you as a candidate?” she asked.
His move also heightens speculation over many top EU jobs which must be decided by November. The elections for 720 MEPs every five years set off fierce horse-trading for the top EU jobs, including the European Commission and European Council.
Ursula von der Leyen, the EU commission president, who like Michel was appointed in 2019, has kept quiet on whether she intends to seek a second term.
Mr Michel has said that the EU summit in June could bring forward the appointment of his successor to avoid the risk of a long wait with no one in the post.
Mr Michel said normal procedures could be “changed by a simple majority” vote.
Defending his decision to quit early, Mr Michel said: “There are many tools if there would be the political will to avoid Viktor Orban.
“It would be very comfortable for me... to wait until December, not to run, not to be accountable... not to participate in the debate,” he said, adding that he could have negotiated a new role “behind the scenes”.
Mr Michel said he had informed EU leaders of his decision on Saturday and “most have reacted positively”.

WI7NJ3VEPI-204,Florida lawmakers return to Tallahassee with lighter agenda as DeSantis focuses on Iowa,"Ana Ceballos, Lawrence Mower, Romy Ellenbogen","January 7, 2024 at 6:30 PM·8 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-lawmakers-return-tallahassee-lighter-103000828.html,"On his political ascent, Gov. Ron DeSantis has used Florida’s annual legislative session as rocket fuel, pushing an aggressive agenda in recent years that has rewired state institutions with right-wing orthodoxy, punished critics and enthused conservatives around the country.
But with lawmakers set to reconvene in the Florida Capitol on Tuesday, and DeSantis’ fading presidential ambitions hinging on contests playing out this month more than 1,000 miles away, the two-term governor is returning to Tallahassee this week to what could be his most tamped-down legislative session yet.
While things could change quickly, more than a dozen lawmakers and consultants interviewed by the Herald/Times say they’re expecting a less explosive session than in recent years, when the GOP-controlled Legislature approved restrictions on transgender care, a six-week abortion ban, limits on what can be taught in public schools and an historic expansion on school choice, among other polarizing issues.
But a slower pace in Tallahassee, they say, is not an indication that DeSantis is losing influence over the legislative process as he struggles on the national stage. Like the governor, many Republicans say that after pushing Florida further to the right in recent years, they expect a sleepier session as the race for the Republican presidential nomination plays out.
“The last year was a year where I feel like we got 10 years worth of bills, and for us, that has been really fantastic,” said Sen. Jason Brodeur, R-Lake Mary. “It’s like the dog that caught the bumper. Now what do we do?”
Unlike last year, when DeSantis rolled out a slew of contentious measures that helped generate headlines in the lead-up to his presidential campaign, this year the governor has been relatively quiet on state issues.
He has asked state lawmakers to continue paying for some of his top political priorities — including another $5 million to continue his migrant flights program and $45 million to pay teachers $3,000 to undergo civics training crafted by conservative organizations. But he has pitched no major new initiatives, and his proposed spending plan for state government suggests he intends to do less in the name of “efficiency.”
On the presidential campaign trail, DeSantis is telling voters he has already fulfilled the agenda he set for his time in the governor’s office.
“I can stand here and say, I’ve delivered on 100% of what I promised I would do,” DeSantis said at a campaign event in Scott County, Iowa in late December.
Lawmakers are similarly signaling a slow-down in pace. By the deadline to file bills, senators had filed just over 800, well below the roughly 1,000 they file each year. In the House, which has three times as many lawmakers as the Senate, representatives have filed even fewer bills — just 695. Last year, they filed 919, and they regularly filed more than 2,000 bills in prior years.
In past sessions, DeSantis largely set the agenda. And for the most part, lawmakers obliged.
In the last two years alone, he has had Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate create an elections police force, restrict the teaching of race-related issues in schools and workplaces and create a program to relocate migrants to other parts of the country. Lawmakers also passed a 6-week abortion ban, allowed Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit, restricted treatment for children with gender dysphoria and gave every school-age kid vouchers or education savings accounts. They expanded restrictions on sexual orientation and gender identity discussions in K-12 schools and cracked down on Disney after the company disagreed with DeSantis.
“We’ve passed all of his priorities,” said Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, who endorsed DeSantis’ opponent, former President Donald Trump, in the primary. “I don’t know if there’s anything left from the standpoint of major policy initiatives that he’s trying to tackle.”
But even if they don’t match the breakneck pace of recent years, lawmakers still expect to be busy.
“Just like a goldfish will always grow to fill the size of the tank you put them in, our ambitions for session will always grow to fill the full 60 days,” said state Rep. Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota.
So far, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, wants to pass legislation to create more doctors and nurses in Florida, and to “deregulate” public schools to put them on a level playing field with private schools. House Speaker Paul Renner, her counterpart in the House, has said he wants to regulate kids’ use of social media. Other lawmakers are proposing new regulations on the use of artificial intelligence, a rollback of child labor laws to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work more hours during the school week and penalties for college students who back “foreign terrorist organizations” such as Hamas.
Lawmakers are also seeking to make changes to the state’s gaming laws, prompting questions about whether new casinos could come to Miami-Dade County. And they are taking steps toward regulating kratom, a controversial substance derived from the dried leaves of a tropical Southeast Asian tree that over the past decade has been tied to hundreds of deadly overdoses.
And while there are fewer politically-charged issues this year compared to recent years, there are still some measures that could spark emotional debates in the state capitol building.
Lawmakers have proposed eliminating a statewide three-day waiting period to buy a rifle or a shotgun, a move that would undo one of the changes enacted after the Parkland high school mass shooting. DeSantis was receptive to the idea when asked about it Thursday during a CNN town hall.
“You shouldn’t have to be on a mandatory waiting period. Instant checks will do the job,” he said.
Two lawmakers are also reviving DeSantis’ wish to make it easier to sue media companies for defamation. And legislators are crafting legislation to reform regulations impacting condominium owners and associations.
Despite DeSantis’ mission-accomplished campaign message, Democrats — and many Floridians — say the state still has plenty of problems left to solve.
Homeowners insurance premiums haven’t gone down despite years of reforms. Auto insurance rates are among the highest in the country. Rent and housing costs are through the roof. State government has been beset by widespread vacancies. Florida needs to invest billions to renovate its prisons. And a growing number of condo owners are increasingly frustrated about state laws limiting their ability to hold condo and HOA boards to account.
Republicans and Democrats have filed various bills to lower premiums for some homeowners.
“Of course he’s trying to project success at the legislative level,” House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said of DeSantis. “But let’s be honest. We know what that means. What has it done for Floridians?”
“To me, it’s like he’s used the Legislature as his vanity project for his own ambition,” Driskell added.
Even Trump is needling DeSantis as the governor returns to Tallahassee, with a super PAC erecting billboards along the drive from the governor’s mansion to the state Capitol building urging DeSantis to “quit the campaign and get back to work!”
Just as the torrid pace of recent legislative sessions accompanied DeSantis’ ascendance to presidential contender, the relative placidity expected over the next two months comes as his prospects of earning the GOP’s 2024 nomination are dimming.
Virtually every national and state-level poll shows DeSantis trailing Trump — the primary contest’s clear frontrunner — by wide margins. The upcoming Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15 are widely seen as make-or-break for the governor.
But legislators and lobbyists said the mood heading into Tuesday shouldn’t be misconstrued as DeSantis losing control over Florida’s Capitol.
“If anyone thinks that he’s not going to be the same Ron DeSantis, the person who is driving the conversation both in the state of Florida and nationally, they are sorely mistaken,” said Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican who is a close ally of DeSantis.
Ingoglia acknowledged that the lead-up to this session has been quieter than in recent years. That’s partially due to DeSantis splitting his time on the presidential campaign trail and Tallahassee, and also because of the timing of this year’s session, he said.
“Let’s not forget that this is an early session in an election year, and traditionally those years do not produce the same type of spotlight legislation as a normal session,” Ingoglia said.
Brian Ballard, a lobbyist who has been involved in Florida’s legislative sessions since 1986, said it would be “foolish” to think DeSantis’ influence is dwindling.
“What is happening on the presidential side is of interest, but the fact that he’s a governor with three years left — two [legislative] sessions after this — makes him incredibly powerful,” Ballard said.
For the most part, that’s because DeSantis has strong relationships with Renner and Passidomo, the two Republicans who carry the agenda in each chamber — and who largely agree with the governor’s priorities.
“I am a big believer that in the Legislature, there’s probably 20 people that matter a lot, and of those 20 people, I think the governor’s relationship is strong,” Ballard said.
But one thing is likely to change: a small but loud group of Republicans who have publicly endorsed Trump in the presidential race are more willing to criticize DeSantis this session.
State Rep. Juan Porras, R-Miami, is one of them. He believes the governor’s influence over the Legislature could wane midway through the legislative session based on the governor’s performance on the national stage.
“I think he was seen as the shining star of our state and nobody could ever dare speak against him,” Porras said. “I think as time goes on, and some of these election results start coming in, I think you might see a lot more people start to break.”"
UZIFD2E1HU-205,"Hasina wins Bangladesh vote, but low turnout and opposition boycott raise doubts over its legitimacy",KRUTIKA PATHI and JULHAS ALAM,"Updated January 7, 2024 at 8:20 PM·5 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/fear-violence-looms-over-contentious-022028845.html,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has won an overwhelming majority in Bangladesh's parliamentary election after a campaign fraught with violence and a boycott from the main opposition party, giving her and her Awami League a fourth consecutive term.
While the Election Commission has been slow to announce the results of Sunday's election, TV stations with journalists across the country reported the Awami League won 224 seats out of 299. Independent candidates took 62, while the Jatiya Party, the third largest in the country, took 11 seats and Kallyan Party got 1. The results for the rest of the constituencies were still coming in.
The election was held in 299 out of 300 parliamentary seats. In one seat, the election was postponed as required by law after an independent candidate died.
A final official declaration from the Election Commission is expected on Monday.
At least 18 arson attacks preceded the vote but the election day passed in relative calm. Turnout was around 40%, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said after the polls closed.
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former premier Khaleda Zia refused to accept the election outcome, saying Bangladeshi voters have rejected the government's one-sided election.
Security incidents, including four deaths in an arson attack on a passenger train on Friday, intensified tensions ahead of the election that was shunned by Zia's party and its allied groups. They accuse Hasina of turning Bangladesh into a one-party state and muzzling dissent and civil society.
Authorities blamed much of the violence on the BNP, accusing it of seeking to sabotage the election. On Saturday, detectives arrested seven men belonging to the BNP and its youth wing for their alleged involvement in the train attack. The party denied any role in the incident.
On Sunday, a supporter of an Awami League candidate was stabbed to death in Munshiganj district near the capital, Dhaka, officials said. Police did not comment immediately.
A victory for the 76-year-old Hasina, the country’s longest-serving leader and one of its most consequential, would come with a deeply contentious political landscape.
The vote, like previous elections, has been defined by the bitter rivalry between Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP, led by Zia, who is ailing and under house arrest on corruption charges, which her supporters claim are politically motivated.
The two women ran the country alternately for many years, cementing a feud that has since polarized Bangladesh's politics and fueled violence around elections. This year’s vote raised questions over its credibility when there are no major challengers to take on the incumbent.
Badshah Mia, a rickshaw puller in Dhaka, said he wouldn't vote given the limited choices, adding that the atmosphere didn’t exude that of “a fair election.”
Sakibul Hasan Chowdhury, a businessman, felt the same. “There is no opposition and no candidate of my choice. So how would I benefit from voting?”
A small business owner, Habibur Rahman, said he was voting for the ruling party candidate in his constituency but added that there didn't seem to be much of a turnout.
Critics and rights groups say the vote follows a troubling pattern, where the past two elections held under Hasina were sullied by allegations of vote-rigging — which authorities have denied — and another boycott by opposition parties.
The government has rejected a monthslong demand by the BNP to have a neutral caretaker government administer Sunday's vote.
The government has defended the election, saying 27 parties and 404 independent candidates are participating. But with scores of candidates from the Awami League running as independents and mostly smaller opposition parties in the race, analysts say Hasina's win is near inevitable.
Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said none of those contesting would be able to mount much of a challenge to Hasina’s party. “The outcome is all but guaranteed, and that is that the Awami League will return (to power) again,” he said, noting that ""Bangladesh’s democracy will be in an extremely precarious state once the election is done.”
The vote has also been called into question by accusations of a sweeping crackdown against the BNP. The party says about 20,000 of its members were jailed ahead of the vote on trumped-up charges. The government disputed the figures and denied that arrests were made due to political leanings, saying the numbers of those arrested were between 2,000-3,000. The country’s law minister in an interview with BBC said 10,000 were likely arrested.
Abdul Moyeen Khan, a former minister and BNP leader, said the spate of arrests forced him and scores of other party members to go into hiding for weeks until candidacy nominations were halted. “It was the only way we could ensure our safety and carry on raising our voice (against the government)” he said.
“We are not boycotting an election — what we are boycotting is a fake and one-sided election that this government is carrying out,” Khan added.
Hasina is credited with transforming the economy of a young nation born out of war and making its garment sector one of the world’s most competitive. Her supporters say she has staved off military coups and neutralized the threat of Islamic militancy. And internationally, she’s helped raise Bangladesh’s profile as a nation capable of doing business and maintaining diplomatic ties with countries often at odds with each other, like India and China.
Yet her critics say her rise has risked turning Bangladesh into becoming a one-party state where democracy is under threat, as emboldened government agencies increasingly use oppressive tools to mute critics, shrink press freedoms and restrict civil society.
The global economic slowdown is also being felt in Bangladesh, exposing cracks in its economy that have triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.
After casting her ballot, Hasina dismissed concerns over the legitimacy of the vote, telling reporters she was accountable to the people and whether they accepted the election or not was what mattered to her.
“I’m trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country,” she added. “Without democracy, you cannot make any development.”

Hamza al-Dahdouh, himself an Al Jazeera journalist and cameraman, was travelling with other reporters in southern Gaza when he was struck by a drone.
Mustafa Thuraya, a freelance journalist, was also killed and a third reporter was wounded.
A video posted online showed Wael al-Dahdouh crying next to his son’s body and kissing his hand. Later, after his son’s burial, he said that journalists in Gaza would keep doing their job.
“All the world needs to see what is happening here,” he said.
Mr Dahdouh is well known to viewers across the Middle East after he learned during a live broadcast in October that his wife, 15-year-old son, seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson had been killed in an Israeli air strike. Eight members of his extended family were also killed.
“Nothing is harder than the pain of loss. And when you experience this pain time after time, it becomes harder and more severe,” Mr Dahdouh said on Sunday.
According to Hisham Zaqout, an Al Jazeera correspondent, the three journalists were travelling to the Moraj area northeast of Rafah – designated a “humanitarian zone” by the Israeli army – but which had reportedly experienced recent bombings.
Hamza had been planning to report on the aftermath of the bombings in the area, including a strike on a house, according to Al Jazeera.
Footage broadcast by Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of the strike on the car they had been travelling in, and a body covered in blood being moved.
“Hamza was not just part of me. He was the whole of me. He was the soul of my soul. These are tears of sadness, of loss. These are tears of humanity,” Mr Dahdouh said at the funeral.
In December, Mr Dahdouh was also wounded during filming and treated for shrapnel wounds. His cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa was killed.
The Israel-Hamas war that started on Oct 7 has been deadly for journalists. The Committee for the Protection of Journalists, an international watchdog, said as of Saturday, 77 journalists and media workers had been killed – 70 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese.
In a message to his father the day before he died, Hamza wrote on social media: “You are steadfast and patient. Do not despair of God’s mercy. Be certain that he will reward you.”
The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike.

R3GQNYUX7D-209,Russian POWs thank Ukrainians for humane treatment during recent exchange – video,The New Voice of Ukraine,"January 7, 2024 at 5:08 AM·2 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-pows-thank-ukrainians-humane-110800351.html,"Russian prisoners-of war expressed their gratitude towards Ukrainian forces for their humane treatment, Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said on Facebook on Jan. 6, commenting on a video of his recent conversation with Russian POWs awaiting exchange.
""Another confirmation of Ukraine's strict adherence to the Geneva Conventions,” Lubinets wrote.

“It is important that the Russians once again said that they had no complaints and thanked us for our humanity.”
When asked how they were treated in captivity, the POWs replied: ""good,"" ""normal."" ""humane,"" ""arms and legs intact"".
""We somehow expected a different attitude, not so positive,” one of the POWs said on camera.

“They didn't humiliate our honor and dignity, they treated us normally.”
The prisoners also mentioned that they were allowed to contact their families, correspond through letters, and receive medical care.

Lubinets, for his part, urged the Russians to share their positive experiences when they return home and expressed his desire for “exactly the same conditions for Ukrainian POWs.” He also wished that the Russians would stop coming to Ukraine with weapons.
224 Ukrainian POWs and six civilians have returned home after a prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Jan. 3, including 130 soldiers, 55 national guardsmen, 38 border guardsmen, one police officer, and six civilians who had been illegally detained.
Lubinets later added that the number included defenders of Azovstal and Mariupol more broadly, as well as of Snake Island, whose defiant stand against the Russian Navy has been a rallying cry for Ukrainians since the first weeks of the full-scale invasion.
He further stated that Ukraine strives to exchange all its citizens and continues to work on this issue. This was the 49th official exchange, with 2,828 prisoners exchanged in total, and the largest since February 24, 2022. It was the first publicly announced prisoner swap in six months.
Freed Ukrainian prisoners-of-war from the latest swap all evidenced extreme amounts of weight loss, and require medical and psychological treatment after likely being tortured in captivity, Lubinets noted.

Israel said its aircraft fired on Palestinian militants who had attacked troops in the city of Jenin. The Palestinian ministry said the strike targeted people who had gathered at the site. Eyewitnesses said the attack happened as Israeli forces were withdrawing.
Four of those killed were brothers, according to family members.
Mujahid Nazzal, a Palestinian doctor and first responder at the scene, told Reuters one of the dead was hit directly by a missile and the strike also seriously wounded a seventh person.
Another witness, Ahmed Suleiman, said, ""The air strike happened at the entrance of Jenin in an area called Martyr's Triangle. You can see the effects of the missile. Blood and body parts scattered everywhere.""
An Israeli border police officer was killed and others wounded when their vehicle was hit by an explosive device during operations in Jenin, the Israeli military and police said.
A helicopter helped rescue them with covering fire, the military said, adding that an aircraft fired at a ""terrorist squad that hurled explosives and endangered our forces, a number of terrorists were killed"".
The Jenin Brigade, an armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack on the Israeli security forces.
The West Bank had already seen its highest levels of unrest in decades during the 18 months before the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by the militant Hamas group that rules Gaza.
Confrontations in the West Bank have risen sharply since Israeli forces launched their retaliatory offensive on Gaza, seeking to wipe out Hamas.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers and settlers over the past weeks and security forces have made thousands of arrests.

BJY2WLETD8-211,South Korea accuses North Korea of firing hundreds of artillery shells near disputed border area,Miranda Nazzaro,"January 7, 2024 at 6:53 AM·2 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-accuses-north-korea-125357205.html,"South Korea accused North Korea of firing hundreds of artillery shells near its disputed sea boundary for the third straight day as the North pledges further military action in response to any provocation.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Sunday claimed North Korea fired off over 90 rounds near the country’s western sea boundary with the North, the Associated Press reported. The South warned of an overwhelming response if the North does not stop halt the firings, the news wire added.
Kim Yo Jung, the sister of the North’s leader Kim Jong Un, said Sunday the Korean People’s Army (KPA) detonated blasting powder, which simulated the sound of its coastal artillery, in a test of the South Korean military’s detection abilities.
She maintained the North did not fire a “single shell” into the disputed waters.
“The result was clear as we expected. They misjudged the blasting sound as the sound of gunfire and conjectured it as a provocation,” Kim said in a statement issued by state media KCNA, adding later, “The ridiculous behavior of these puppets in military uniform is nothing new today.”
Kim reiterated the North will “launch an immediate military strike” if the South “makes even a slight provocation,” calling the South “gangsters.”
“I cannot but say that [South Korean] people are very pitiful as they entrust ‘security’ to such blind persons and offer huge taxes to them,” she said. “It is better 10 times to entrust security to a dog with a developed sense of hearing and smell.”
In the wake of the North’s firings last Friday, South Korea directed troops on border islands to fire artillery rounds near the sea boundary. The shells landed at the buffer zone between the two countries, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The area was created under a 2018 agreement that required the two Koreas to dismantle or disarm several guard posts and created a no-fly zone at the border and a ban on aerial reconnaissance and live-fire exercises.
Tensions between the two Koreas have spiked in recent months as the North continues missile tests and the South expands military training with the U.S. The recent breaches of the 2018 agreement put the deal at risk, with experts warning the North will boost weapons tests in the coming months, the AP reported.

SJP3K1EFI7-212,Thousands of mourners in Islamabad attend funeral for Pakistani cleric gunned down in broad daylight,Associated Press,"Updated January 6, 2024 at 6:09 AM·2 min read",20240107,https://news.yahoo.com/thousands-mourners-islamabad-attend-funeral-113151866.html,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Thousands of mourners attended a funeral Saturday for a Pakistani Sunni Muslim cleric gunned down in broad daylight on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, police and a spokesman for the cleric's organization said.
The funeral of Masoodur Rehman Usmani was held a day after unidentified gunmen shot and killed him and wounded his driver in the neighborhood of Ghauri Town, according to a statement from Islamabad police.
No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which is a rare occurrence in this part of Pakistan. Police said they were using closed-circuit TV footage to track down the assailants, and vowed that they would be arrested and brought to justice.
Authorities in Islamabad have stepped up security by deploying additional police and some embassies were advising their nationals to avoid visiting the area where the funeral for Usmani was to be held.
Usmani was a deputy secretary at the Sunni Ulema Council, which emerged after Pakistan outlawed the Sipah-e-Sahaba extremist group, which has been accused of killing thousands of Shiites in recent decades across the country.
Sunni clerics in their speeches at the funeral asked the government to ensure the arrest of those responsible for Usmani's killing. Top cleric Ahmed Ludhianvi threatened a sit-in in Islamabad if they were not arrested within the week.
The funeral was livestreamed on social media by organizers, who wanted to hold the event outside parliament. But police refused their request, and the event was instead held in a busy commercial area in Islamabad.
Pakistan has suffered frequent sectarian violence between the majority Sunni and minority Shiite groups, but authorities say it is still unclear who was behind the killing, although mourners were seen chanting slogans against Shiites and neighboring Iran, which is often accused by Sunni groups of backing Shiite organizations in Pakistan.
Most Sunnis and Shiites live together peacefully in Pakistan, though tensions have existed for decades."

Danish model Josephine Skriver first posed for the SI Swimsuit Issue in 2020, when she traveled to the Dominican Republic with photographer Kate Powers. The stunning images that resulted from the collaboration in the Caribbean resulted in Skriver earning Rookie of the Year honors.
The 30-year-old returned to the fold in both ’21 and ’22, and her work with the brand took her to Sacramento, Calif., and Montenegro. Skriver is known for her time as a Victoria’s Secret Angel, and has also collaborated with notable brands like Armani, Balmain, Gucci, Max Mara, Tom Ford, Calvin Klein and Rag & Bone.
Today, Skriver is a proud mom of one. She and her husband, musician Alexander DeLeon, welcomed a daughter named Aurora last summer. She’s also the cofounder of JOJA, an activewear brand she founded with fellow supermodel and best friend Jasmine Tookes.
“JOJA is a woman-owned brand that designs with attention to detail, keeping women’s bodies in mind,” Skriver told us of the company last year. “We believe that every detail matters, and we put great effort into every aspect of our designs, from selecting the right materials to stitching each piece with precision. Our goal is to create clothing that is both fashionable and practical, making every woman feel confident and beautiful.”

QW47KV0YVV-218,"A loud boom, a blast of icy wind and sheer terror on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282",Christopher Goffard,"January 7, 2024 at 6:02 PM·4 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/loud-boom-blast-icy-wind-000252146.html,"The airplane was three miles into the sky and still climbing when passengers heard the boom and felt the blast of icy wind. A chunk of the metal membrane separating the 171 passengers and six crew members from the freezing mid-troposphere had unexpectedly ""departed the airplane,"" as transportation officials clinically put it.
No serious injuries were reported aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which made an emergency landing at Portland International Airport in Oregon on Friday night with a door-shaped gap in its side and a cabin full of frightened people.
But transportation officials say the midair blowout could have been calamitous if it had happened a little later in the flight, when the plane was at cruising altitude with passengers unbuckled and walking around.
""We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,"" said Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents.
""I imagine this was a pretty terrifying event,"" Homendy said. ""We don't often talk about psychological injury, but I'm sure that occurred here.""
The airliner was a new one, a Boeing 737 Max 9 that went into service late last year. Investigators will try to figure out what caused one of its so-called plug doors — described by some experts as ""fake doors"" — to be ripped loose in the air above Oregon.
With 178 seats, the plane is not required to have emergency exit doors at the spot, so builders installed sealed panels where the doors otherwise would have stood on each side.
Investigators are searching for the missing plug door, which is believed to have landed near the Cedar Hills neighborhood of Greater Portland. The NTSB is asking anyone who finds it to contact police.
Alaska Airlines said Sunday that all 65 of its Max 9s were grounded, and that it had canceled 170 flights Sunday affecting 25,000 passengers. On Saturday, United Airlines said it had grounded all 79 of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft for inspection, and that 270 flights were canceled over the weekend as a result of Friday night's incident.
Flight 1282 left Portland International Airport just after 5 p.m. Friday, headed to Ontario International in Southern California on an expected two-hour flight. It was traveling about 440 mph , at an altitude of about 16,000 feet, and had been airborne about 10 minutes.
Then passengers heard what some called a boom and some called a pop, as the faux door flew off and exposed bare insulation around it. Some passengers screamed and hurried to put on oxygen masks that had dropped. One passenger told KTLA-Channel 5 that the blowout ripped the shirt completely off a teenage boy.
The blowout ripped the headrests off some seats. There were seven empty seats in the plane, authorities said, and by a stroke of luck the two closest to the hole — 26A and 26B — happened to be empty.
An audio recording between the pilot and an air traffic controller describes what happened next. The pilot calmly explained that the plane had depressurized and needed to return to Portland International.
""We're now leveling 12,000 and left turn heading 340,"" the pilot said. ""We do have information zero. We'd like to get lower, if possible ...""
""Did you declare an emergency?"" asked the air traffic controller. ""Or did you just need to return to ...""
""Yes, we are emergency. We are depressurized. We do need to return back to ... Our fuel is 18,900 pounds and we have 177 passengers on board.""
""Do you need time to burn off some fuel before you land?""
""Negative.""
""Are you ready to approach now?""
The pilot said the plane was about 10 minutes away.
""Roger. Just let me know when you're ready,"" the air traffic controller said.
""We'll let you know. Alaska 1282.""
""The only information we have is a depressurization issue. ... The emergency aircraft will be the next arrival,"" the air traffic controller said. ""They are on a two-mile final. And you can expect access to the runway.""
Passengers applauded as the plane landed safely, about 13 minutes after the blowout.

9996FA95FD-220,Albina neighborhood’s donation from Nike co-founder listed among biggest of 2023,Jashayla Pettigrew,"January 8, 2024 at 7:15 AM·2 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/albina-neighborhood-donation-nike-co-151500724.html,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — A philanthropy magazine determined that Nike co-founder Phil Knight made one of the top donations of 2023 when he and his wife allocated millions of dollars to a historically Black neighborhood in Portland.
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a news company that reports on nonprofit organizations, published its yearly list of the biggest charitable donations on Tuesday.
Multnomah County Board unanimously approves funding for proposed treatment center
The top 11 donations cost $3.5 billion overall, but the magazine notes that most of the donors are multibillionaires. Together, the donors have an estimated net worth of $305.1 billion.
According to The Chronicle, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett took the top spot with a donation of $541.5 million. The money went toward the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, a charitable organization named after the businessman’s first wife.
The second-place spot went to James Simons, who founded New-York-based hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. The founder’s $500 million gift was dedicated through his science and mathematics charity the Simons Foundation, and to scholarships at Stony Brook University in New York.

Oregon resident and Nike co-founder Phil Knight was tied at No. 3 with a $400 million donation. In April, he and his wife Penny gifted the money to the 1803 Fund: an initiative dedicated to revitalizing the Albina neighborhood.
The area was once known as a hub for Black Portlanders, but the director of Albina Head Start previously told KOIN 6 that redlining and “urban renewal” in the 1970s pushed out many residents who called it home.
“Rebuild Albina officials plan to renovate the area, pay for education programs and education-related services for children and their families, and support a range of projects meant to deepen the area’s cultural roots,” the Chronicle of Philanthropy wrote. “The Knights are giving the money both personally and through their Knight Foundation.”

MYR35YD9N8-221,Bangladesh PM Extends Her Rule in Polls Shunned by Rivals,Arun Devnath,"January 8, 2024 at 3:10 AM·4 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/bangladesh-pm-extends-her-rule-174115687.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina retained her title as the world’s longest serving female head of government after her party swept most of the parliament seats in an election boycotted by her opponents and voters.

Hasina’s Awami League party won 223 of 299 seats for a simple parliament majority, according to unofficial results from the offices of the Election Commission. The election for one seat was postponed.
The poll body has put the turnout at 41.8%, the second lowest since the country’s return to democracy in 1991. It’s a sharp drop from the 80% participation in polls in 2018, as voters heeded a campaign by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party to shun the election and draw attention to the sweeping crackdown her government carried out in the run up to the polls.
The vote was the culmination of a monthlong campaign beset by daily street protests, the jailing of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus and viral videos of ruling party leaders pushing voters to cast ballots or risk losing government benefits.
Dhaka was deserted with heavy security around voting centers and there were few reports of clashes between opposition supporters and police officials. In a sign the country was still on edge, Hasina, who is also the president of the Awami League, asked supporters not to organize rallies to celebrate the victory, according to party official Sayem Khan.
The taka edged higher on Monday, rising 0.05% to 109.55 against the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The nation’s currency dealers currently set limits on the exchange rate.
Hasina, set for a fourth straight term in power, has overseen one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and lifted millions out of poverty as part of her development agenda — achievements often overshadowed by her turn to authoritarianism.
Still, the economy is struggling with dollar shortages, which has prompted Moody’s Investors Service and others to downgrade Bangladesh’s credit ratings. The government was earlier forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for $4.7 billion in emergency loans after the pandemic and soaring commodity prices depleted foreign exchange reserves.
Speaking at a post-election briefing on Monday, Hasina said she remains focused on the country’s economic development. “Economic progress and a better life for everybody will be my main aim for the next five years,” said Hasina. “Development is my main aim.”
About 120 million people were eligible to vote for 299 of the 350 seats in parliament. In recent weeks, prominent leaders from Awami League have been shown on social media video clips telling voters that they risked losing their benefits if they didn’t take part in the elections.
The BNP boycotted the national vote in response to Hasina refusing to step aside and allowing a caretaker government to run the poll. In response her Awami League party targeted a 50% turnout and allowed some of its leaders to contest as independents to spur voter interest.
As polling stations closed, opposition leaders congratulated voters for not casting their ballots, according to the Daily Star.
“What we have been saying for the one year that the people of Bangladesh have turned down this government has been shown today before everyone in the country,” said BNP leader Abdul Moyeen Khan. “We’ll continue our movement together with the people in a peaceful process.”
The US, the biggest buyer of Bangladesh’s exports, called for free and fair election ahead of Sunday’s vote, and imposed visa curbs on members of Hasina’s ruling party and law enforcement officials in September.
Hasina defended her relationship with the US on Monday, saying Bangladesh has “good relationship” with Washington. “I want to continue to have good relationships with every country, to develop my country very quickly,” she added.
Police arrested several opposition leaders in the months before the election. Hasina’s main rival and BNP leader Khaleda Zia faces suspended jail sentences on graft charges that her supporters say are trumped up.
Human Rights Watch said in a November report that almost 10,000 opposition activists have been arrested since a planned rally by the BNP on Oct. 28. Nobel winner Yunus was given a six-month jail sentence by a Dhaka court last week in a case his supporters say was politically motivated.

JFZB6SVYTG-222,Blinken meets Qatari leader in Middle East trip aimed at containing Israel-Hamas conflict,Darryl Coote,"January 8, 2024 at 12:31 PM·3 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/blinken-meets-qatari-leader-middle-043108706.html,"Jan. 7 (UPI) -- Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza ""could easily metastasize,"" causing more insecurity and suffering, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Sunday as he met with Arab leaders in the Middle East as he tries to prevent the conflict from expanding.
The United States' top diplomat made the comment to reporters alongside Qatari Prime Minister Al Thani in Doha during his fourth trip to the region since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 and amid a diplomatic push to contain the conflict to the Palestinian enclave of Gaza as it threatens to spill into neighboring countries.
Blinken said ""the heart of discussions"" Saturday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Jordanian King Abdullah II and Thani on Sunday have been centered on preventing the conflict from spreading.
""We share a commitment to ensure that the conflict does not expand, and I think we also share a commitment to use the influence, the relationships, the ties that we have with different parties in the region to try to avoid escalation and to deter new fronts from opening,"" he said.
""This is not just a regional issue; it's a matter of global concern.""
His trip to Turkey, Greece, Jordan and Qatar, and which will also include stops in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Egypt through Thursday comes amid a precarious time in region.
On top of the war in Gaza, fighting between Israel and Hamas' Lebanese ally Hezbollah continues to escalate, Houthi rebels continue attacking shipping vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting the important trade route, and militants continue striking U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Syria -- all of which threatens to expand the initial conflict.
Thani told reporters that Qatar has been working with international and regional partners to achieve de-escalation and improve access to humanitarian aid in Gaza, but he remarked that the violence is increasing.
""We believe that we need to contain the crisis as soon as possible and to reach a cease-fire in Gaza, which will also help on de-escalating the region,"" he said.
Blinken's trip also comes as Israel has transitioned to a less intensive phase of its military operation in northern Gaza and amid discussions about the future governance of the Palestinian enclave, with some far-right Israeli politicians stating Palestinians should relocate.
Both Blinken and Thani reiterated their support for Palestinians to be able to return to their homes in Gaza.
""They cannot and they must not be pressed to leave Gaza,"" Blinken said. ""We reject the statements by some Israeli ministers and lawmakers calling for a resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza.""
Nearly 23,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war that began Oct. 7 when Hamas launched a bloody surprise attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 Israelis with another 240 taken hostage.
UP to 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza, more than 85% of the enclave's population, have been displaced, many multiple times over, according to the United Nations relief agency of Palestine refugees.
Blinken said he has discussed efforts with world leaders on his trip to prevent further Palestinian deaths."
Q6FR8GPXXJ-223,Britain's BT to turn street cabinets into EV charging points,Reuters,"January 8, 2024 at 4:50 PM·1 min read",20240108,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/britains-bt-turn-street-cabinets-085029480.html,"LONDON (Reuters) - BT, Britain's biggest telecoms group, said it would convert the first of its street cabinets traditionally used to house cabling to an electric vehicle (EV) charging unit in a pilot that could lead to a network of 60,000 new points.
The first unit will be installed at a cabinet in East Lothian, Scotland, BT said on Monday, adding that it will roll out further trials across Britain in the coming months.
BT said its research showed a shortage of chargers on Britain's roads was deterring some people from buying an EV, with 38% of drivers saying they would have an EV already if charging were less of an issue.
There were 53,906 EV charging points across the UK at the end of December, according to figures quoted by BT from Zapmap. The government wants to increase the number to 300,000 by the 2030s.
Tom Guy, managing director of BT's start-up arm Etc, said: ""Our new charging solution is a huge step in bringing EV charging kerbside and exploring how we can address key barriers customers are currently facing.
""Working closely with local councils in Scotland and more widely across the UK, we are at a critical stage of our journey in tackling a very real customer problem that sits at the heart of our wider purpose to connect for good.""
BT said it would retrofit the cabinets to add a charge point alongside the existing broadband service with no need to create a new power connection.
EV charging can be deployed in cabinets used for current copper broadband services, or in those due for retirement, depending on the space and power available, it added.

IY8CK41IFS-225,Charles Michel’s election bid sparks race to stop Orbán from taking European Council reins,Mared Gwyn Jones,"January 8, 2024 at 10:46 PM·5 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/charles-michel-election-bid-sparks-144628583.html,"Charles Michel unexpectedly announced on Saturday that he would be the lead candidate for his Belgian liberal party - the Reformist Movement (MR) - in the European elections which take place on 6-9 June.
This means Michel, a former Belgian prime minister who has presided over the European Council since 2019, is highly likely to be elected as a member of the European Parliament (MEP) and stand down as Council chief following the election.
The EU’s 27 heads of government now have less than six months to name his successor. The President's role involves chairing European Council meetings and brokering agreements among member states, including on sensitive budget and foreign policy decisions.
According to EU treaties, in the absence of a president, the country that holds the six-month rotating presidency of the Council takes on caretaker responsibility. This means that without a successor, Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán would take control of the Council when his country’s takes on the rotating presidency on 1 July.
A European Council source brushed off the potential disruption of Michel's surprise announcement, saying that the decision on his successor was “due to happen in June 2024.”
“It is therefore possible to have the next president of the European Council starting his duty in summer 2024, if the European Council decides so,” the source said.
June's European elections will trigger a reshuffle of Brussels' top jobs, but the process sometimes takes months due to the intricate nature of discussions and the need to ensure political, geographical and gender balance between appointments.
Many have denounced Michel for a move that will throw a shadow of uncertainty over the Council during a politically pivotal moment.
Speaking to Euronews, Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet Professor of European Union Law at HEC Paris said that Michel's decision risks triggering a ""constitutional crisis.""
""As Michel abruptly ends his mandate at the most critical moment when the powers of the council are at their peak (...) he is set to become a lame duck president with little authority,"" Alemanno explained.
""This is really terra incognita,"" he said, adding that Michel was pursuing ""his own self-interest"" rather than wider European Union interests.
Dutch MEP Sophie in 't Veld, a liberal who belongs to the same political family as Michel, sharply criticised his decision on social media platform, X: “The Captain leaving the ship in the middle of a storm. If that is how little committed you are to the fate of the European Union, then how credible are you as a candidate?”
As Michel abruptly ends his mandate at the most critical moment when the powers of the council are at their peak (...) he is set to become a lame duck president with little authority.
The possibility of Orbán seizing influence in Brussels in the second half of the year has spooked many in the EU capital. The nationalist prime minister, recently seen shaking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hand in Beijing, is infamous for being a thorn in Brussels’ side.
The bloc’s proposed €50-billion package in long-term financial support to Ukraine is currently being held up after Orbán vetoed its approval during a European Council summit in December.
It followed the release of €10 billion in EU funds to Budapest, previously frozen due to backsliding on the rule of law. The move fuelled speculation that Orbán is using his veto power in the Council to pressure Brussels to unfreeze more frozen cash.
Orbán also consistently uses anti-EU rhetoric to foster Eurosceptic sentiment among his domestic audience in Hungary.
His government recently personally targeted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a billboard campaign and implied that Brussels wanted to ""create migrant ghettos in Hungary"" in an inflammatory public consultation.
EU lawmakers have in the past cast doubt over Hungary and Orbán's credibility to take on the Council's presidency in the second half of 2024.
In a non-binding resolution adopted last June, MEPs questioned ""how Hungary will be able to credibly fulfil this task in 2024, in view of its non-compliance with EU law and the values enshrined in Article 2 (of the EU treaties), as well as the principle of sincere cooperation.""
Despite having no executive powers, the EU state that holds the Council's presidency can wield significant influence over the institution's functioning by setting the agenda, hosting meetings, steering negotiations and organising votes.
Should the president's responsibilities fall temporarily into the hands of Orbán, it could increase his capacity to shape the EU's legislative calendar in the last six months of 2024.
But Alemanno told Euronews that he believes leaders are unfazed by the prospect of Orbán stepping in temporarily to do the job.
""I'm not so sure that European leaders are so afraid of Mr. Orbán,"" Alemanno explained.
""Otherwise they would have taken many more measures in order to counter his defiant stance vis-à-vis (...) foreign policy and rule of law and a number of issues,"" he said, adding that Orbán's role would be limited to chairing meetings should he need to step in.
European Council chiefs are usually former heads of state, with a preference for leaders versed in complex negotiations or with experience managing coalition governments.
Names speculated for the role include the Netherlands' current caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte, who was forced to step down in July amid a coalition rift over the issue of immigration, or former Luxembourgish premier Xavier Bettel.
Portugal's caretaker prime minister Antonio Costa was also speculated for the role, but his candidacy could be marred by a sprawling corruption investigation involving his key aides.
The EU treaties also allow the 27 leaders to change the rules should they fail to name a successor. Fourteen member states, representing a simple majority, could vote to block Orbán from temporarily taking on the president's responsibilities and appoint another temporary chief.
Alemanno predicts that a ""temporary, interim"" successor will be found in due time, with a permanent replacement then named after the June ballot."
PLDZW4KRXG-226,China sanctions five US defence firms over Taiwan arms sales,Peter Hoskins - Business reporter,"January 8, 2024 at 7:47 AM·1 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/china-sanctions-five-us-defence-042647955.html,"China has announced sanctions on five Western defence firms over the latest round of US arms sales to Taiwan.
The announcement comes as Taiwan prepares to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 13 January.
US weapons sales to Taiwan are a frequent source of tension between Beijing and Washington.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, a claim Taiwan's government rejects.
Last month, the US State Department approved a $300m (£236m) sale of equipment to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that the sanctions were ""In response to these gravely wrong actions taken by the US"".
It also said the recent arms sales ""seriously harm China's sovereignty and security interests, undermine the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"".
The companies being sanctioned were named as BAE Systems Land and Armament, Alliant Techsystems Operation, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions.
China will freeze the assets of the companies and ban people and organisations in China from engaging them, the Foreign Ministry said.
The BBC has contacted the US embassy in Beijing for comment.
Beijing has ramped up its pressure on Taiwan ahead of the elections that could redefine the island's relationship with China.
In his annual New Year's Eve address, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his claim that Taiwan would ""surely be reunified"" with China.
He also struck a stronger tone than last year's message, when he spoke about Taiwan being part of the ""same family"".
China sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. Taiwan considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders."
BPJ9YDKYLB-227,China says foreign consulting agency head spied for Britain,AFP,"January 8, 2024 at 2:15 AM·2 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/china-says-foreign-consulting-agency-081537468.html,"China's spy agency said Monday the head of a foreign consultancy had been found to be spying for Britain's MI6 intelligence service.
The Ministry of State Security said in a WeChat post that Britain's Secret Intelligence Service -- also known as MI6 -- used a foreign national with the surname Huang to establish an ""intelligence cooperation relationship"".
Huang, who headed a foreign consulting agency, ""entered China several times under instructions to use their public profile as a cover to collect China-related intelligence for Britain... and seek other personnel whom MI6 could turn"", the MSS said.
Huang allegedly passed 17 pieces of intelligence, including confidential state secrets, to MI6 before he was identified, according to the MSS.
The ministry also claimed he had received ""professional intelligence training"" in Britain and had used ""specialist spying equipment"" to send communications.
The MSS said an investigation had ""promptly discovered criminal evidence that Huang was engaged in espionage activities, and took criminal coercive measures in accordance with the law"".
The statement did not provide further details of Huang's identity or employer, or describe their current condition or whereabouts.
Britain's embassy in Beijing directed an AFP request to comment to the Foreign Office in London, which did not immediately respond.
China's foreign ministry declined to provide further comment when asked about the case at a regular press briefing.
- Trading allegations -
China and Britain have traded barbs in recent months over allegations of perceived espionage and its resulting impact on national security.
Britain's government has warned that Chinese spies are increasingly targeting officials, allegations that Beijing has denied.
A researcher at the British parliament was arrested last year under the Official Secrets Act and subsequently denied spying for Beijing.
China, which has a broad definition of state secrets, has publicised several other alleged spying cases in recent months.
In May, authorities sentenced 78-year-old American citizen John Shing-wan Leung to life in prison for espionage, though Beijing has not provided substantial details of his case.
And in October, the MSS published the story of another alleged spy, surnamed Hou, who was accused of sending several secret and classified documents to the US.
China last year also conducted raids on a string of big-name consulting, research and due diligence firms.
Last May, China said it had raided the offices of US consultancy firm Capvision in order to safeguard its ""national security and development interests"".
Beijing also questioned staff at the Shanghai branch of another American consultancy, Bain, in April.
And authorities detained workers and shuttered a Beijing office belonging to US-based due diligence firm Mintz Group in March.
The US government and its chambers of commerce warned that the raids damage investor confidence and the operations of foreign businesses in China.

A seven-judge bench in the capital Islamabad overruled a six-year-old decision by their predecessors that had banned Sharif from holding public office for the rest of his life.
The chief justice announced the brief decision live on national television channels.
The Supreme Court had cut short Sharif's third term in power in 2017 and ordered he must not be allowed to contest an election again.
But a vague article of the constitution under which Sharif was disqualified was later done away with by parliament by fixing the maximum period of disqualification at five years.
Six out of seven judges argued the parliament's decision was supreme and held grounds over the court's ruling.
Sharif was later convicted on three separate graft charges by lower tribunals in 2018 and put in jail, but he was acquitted last year.
Sharif, who has ruled Pakistan three times but could never complete his term due to differences with the powerful army, is the front runner again, his party announced last month.
The 74-year-old is credited for ending power outages and building a web of highways to link the country with China, Afghanistan and Iran and ultimately to Central Asia and Europe.
Sharif was a key partner of China for President Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
He allowed Beijing access to the markets in the Middle East, Africa and Europe through overland and seas routes through Pakistan."

The task force has been asked to review this question and develop recommendations that “strengthen our campus climate so that all voices and perspectives are welcomed and respected,” according to Randall’s letter to task force members, which was released on Monday.
The 14-member Viewpoint Representation and Expression Task Force, with faculty, student, staff and trustee representation, will be led by Jason Perry, the U.’s vice president for government relations and director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics.
In assembling the panel, Randall lifted up the works of the late University of Utah President David P. Gardner, who wrote: “The University is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus, it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views. Only in this way can it best serve American democracy.”
Randall, in his letter to the task force members, wrote, “In 2024, we must expand on President Gardner’s vision and ensure that our campus welcomes and respects the broad range of voices and perspectives of our students, as well as our faculty, staff and the communities we serve.”
He continued, “It is in this spirit that I ask you to take on the important task of evaluating and assessing our campus climate related to respect and acceptance of varying ideological viewpoints.”
Randall asked the task force, in the next nine months, to provide him with the results and conclusions about the U.’s current campus climate based on survey research and focus groups with students, faculty and staff.
The task force has also been asked to issue a report in 18 months that includes:
• Results, findings and conclusions about the current campus climate based on survey research and focus groups with students, faculty and staff.
• A review and evaluation of policies and practices related to viewpoint diversity. This includes examining whether current policies are being followed and making recommendations for revised policies and practices.
• Recommendations on future research the university should undertake on this issue.
• Recommendations on speakers, dialogues, forums and debates that model best behavior and assistance on implementing the proposals.
Other task force members include:
• Michele Ballantyne, the U.’s associate general counsel.
• Paul Cassell, professor of law.
• Maria Garciaz, university trustee.
• Harriet Hopf, professor of anesthesiology and incoming Academic Senate president.
• Jason Ramirez, Dean of Students.
• Hollis Robbins, Dean of the College of Humanities.
• Jared Rutter, professor of biochemistry.
• Bassam Salem, university trustee.
• Mary Ann Villarreal, Vice President for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.
• Jeff Herring, chief human resources officer.
• Marie Wintress, Staff Council chairperson.
• Undergraduate student representative.
• Graduate student representative.
The announcement follows a communication from the U.’s senior leadership to all hiring units on Friday to discontinue use of diversity statements in hiring practices.
“In light of recent statements made by elected leaders and directives from the Utah Board of Higher Education to eliminate diversity questions or statements used in hiring at Utah’s higher education institutions, all hiring units at the university should discontinue the use of any type of diversity statements or similar practices as part of their unit-level applicant or employee hiring processes,” the statement said in part.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, during the PBS Utah Governor’s Monthly News Conference in December, said he thought it was “bordering on evil that we’re forcing people into a political framework before they can even apply for a job in the state.”

When the 2024 general session of the Utah Legislature convenes next week, it is anticipated some Republican lawmakers will introduce legislation on the use of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, on state-supported college campuses, though none of the bills have yet been made public.
Last year, Sen. John Johnson, R-North Ogden, introduced legislation that would have defunded all DEI offices at Utah’s public colleges and universities but that proposal stalled.
Rep. Katy Hall, R-South Ogden, plans to run a bill that would target diversity statements after similar legislation was defeated in a Senate committee during the 2023 session."
7ZFTMF7WMW-230,Ex-chairman of China Everbright Group expelled from Communist Party,"Michelle Toh, CNN","January 8, 2024 at 2:56 PM·3 min read",20240108,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-chairman-china-everbright-group-053421394.html,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
Another former top business leader in China has been kicked out of the Chinese Communist Party, showing how a crackdown on the country’s financial sector is continuing into the new year.
Tang Shuangning, the ex-chairman and party chief of the China Everbright Group, has been expelled over “serious violations of disciplines and laws,” the country’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the National Supervisory Commission jointly announced in a statement Saturday.
The CCDI, which serves as China’s top anti-corruption watchdog, said an investigation had found that Tang had “abandoned his duties,” failed to act in diffusing financial risks and took bribes.
He illegally accepted funds and gifts, such as valuable calligraphy and paintings, and took advantage of his position to “seek profits” from people he helped to get job promotions, according to the statement.
Tang even illegally accepted huge amounts of property and “butler-style services,” the agencies said.
He also brought books into China deemed to have “serious political issues,” the authorities said. China Everbright Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tang’s suspected crimes will be referred to prosecutors for further review and potential prosecution, while the income and property he illegally received will be confiscated or transferred, according to the statement.
Tang was one of China’s most influential business leaders in his role as chairman from 2007 to 2017 at China Everbright, one of the country’s oldest and largest state-owned financial conglomerates. He also previously served as vice chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
He is one of the latest formerly high-flying executives to run afoul of authorities in China — and the second from China Everbright to be dismissed from the party in recent months.
Last April, Li Xiaopeng, another former chairman of China Everbright who had succeeded Tang, was put under investigation after being suspected of “serious violations of law and discipline,” the CCDI said.
In October, Li was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested for allegedly taking bribes, according to Xinhua.
On Monday, the China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group said a senior executive had been taken into custody.
In a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange, the company, which is the electric vehicle unit of troubled property giant Evergrande, said its vice chairman, Liu Yongzhuo, had been detained “on suspicion of illegal crimes.” It did not provide any details, and its shares plunged 7% after it was suspended from trading.
Altogether last year, the commission investigated more than a dozen senior executives at the country’s most powerful financial institutions, according to a previous CNN analysis of statements posted on the CCDI’s website.
They included big names at the very top of China’s financial system, such as Liu Liange, former chairman of state-owned Bank of China, and Wang Bin, former head of state-owned China Life Insurance.
Other executives to come under scrutiny by the CCDI include Bao Fan, a star investment banker and tech dealmaker, who went missing last February and was later reported by Chinese state media to be in the custody of the anti-graft agency.
The investment firm he led, China Renaissance, has since named an interim replacement, appointing an acting chief executive in October.
Zhang Hongli, a former senior executive at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), was also the subject of a CCDI probe in November.

As the war approaches its second anniversary, both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of causing dozens of civilian casualties in a sharp escalation of attacks.
""This morning, unfortunately, began again with a massive missile attack,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his daily address.
""Forty-five people were injured, and at this time, we know of four dead,"" he said.
Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and high-rise buildings in Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rig, killing one person, deputy head of the presidency Oleksiy Kuleba said.
A separate missile attack in the western region of Khmelnytsky killed two people, officials said, while an elderly woman in the Kharkiv region died after being pulled from the rubble of her home.
Moscow said in its latest defence ministry briefing that it had struck only ""military"" targets.
Bolstered by Western air equipment, Ukraine's defence forces had been destroying most of the drones and missiles that Russia launched in regular aerial strikes.
But it downed just 18 out of 51 missiles on Monday.
""A large number of ballistic missiles were launched today... Many said the rate (of destroyed missiles) is not very high,"" air force spokesman Yuri Ignat acknowledged.
But air defence achieved ""a good result"", Ignat said, with all drones destroyed and some Russian missiles also missing their targets.
Ukraine has warned it needs continued support to sustain its air defence systems amid the escalation in aerial attacks.
- Wounded, evacuations in Belgorod -
Russia has also seen renewed assaults.
After downing two drones over the border region of Bryansk on Monday, Russian forces destroyed 10 Ukrainian rockets over the region of Belgorod in the evening, the defence ministry said.
The Belgorod region has been particularly targeted recently, with waves of deadly strikes that prompted evacuations.
""Ten targets were shot down as they approached the city,"" regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said, reporting that three people had been wounded by shrapnel.
Gladkov earlier said 300 people had been relocated from the border city of Belgorod because of Ukrainian shelling.
This is the biggest evacuation from a major Russian city since the conflict began.
The residents who decided to leave are being housed in temporary accommodation in the towns of Stary Oskol, Gubkin and the Korochansky district, further from the border, Gladkov said.
""Over the past 24 hours we received 1,300 requests to send Belgorod children to school camps away from the city in other regions,"" he added.
The Kremlin has tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy on the home front, but recent strikes on Belgorod have brought conflict in Ukraine closer to home for many Russians.
On December 30, Ukrainian shelling of the city killed 25 people, prompting schools to shut for an extended period.
Moscow vowed to intensify strikes on Ukraine in response to the attack, the deadliest in Russia since the start of the war in February 2022.

6RY0TFVK5K-232,French cognac makers hit back at Chinese anti-dumping probe,Reuters,8 January 2024 at 6:51 pm·1-min read,20240108,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/french-cognac-makers-hit-back-105147042.html,"PARIS (Reuters) - French cognac makers have hit back at claims by China that they are dumping brandy in the Chinese market, saying the price discounts alleged are unusually small for such a formal investigation.
That ""raises the question of the real purpose of the process"", the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC), which represents French cognac makers, said in a statement to Reuters.
Last week China opened an anti-dumping investigation on brandy imported from the European Union, a step that appears to be mainly targeted at France and adds to ongoing trade disputes between Beijing and Brussels.
BNIC said in its statement that China’s commerce ministry launched the investigation of alleged dumping of European brandy based on price reductions of 15.88%.
""This level appears singularly low compared to what is generally accepted as justification for an anti-dumping investigation,"" it said.
News of China's investigation knocked shares in French spirits companies Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard lower on Jan. 5.
Trade disputes between China and Europe have been mounting over the past year, with both sides exchanging accusations of unfair competition and protectionism.
BNIC said the unusually small discount alleged to launch the Chinese probe ""reinforces our conviction that our future exchanges with the Chinese authorities will demonstrate that our commercial practices are fully compliant with Chinese and international regulations.""

The UAE was one of the first nations to sign onto the Artemis accords in October 2020. Although the UAE’s space program is in its early phases, the Arab nation has made great strides in the past few years. The UAE launched an ambitious first mission to Mars, which successfully entered into orbit around the Red Planet in February 2021. UAE astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi launched to the International Space Station in March 2023 as part of SpaceX’s Crew-6 mission, and became the first Arab astronaut to conduct a spacewalk outside the space station.
Russia was originally supposed to provide the airlock for Lunar Gateway but began to pull away from the project in 2021 as the relationship between NASA and Roscosmos started disintegrating.

4Z6C0IHOAG-235,Heathrow slowdown as British Airways lengthens connection times,Simon Calder,"January 9, 2024 at 8:07 PM·3 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/heathrow-slowdown-british-airways-lengthens-190514314.html,"Stress levels at Heathrow Terminal 5 are set to reduce... but some British Airways passengers will be waiting significantly longer for connections.
The airline is to increase the minimum connection time (MCT) at Heathrow from an hour to 75 minutes, to reduce the risk – and commercial cost – of missed onward flights.
By lengthening connections, the airline hopes fewer passengers will end up being stranded or rebooked.
However, it will mean longer journey times for passengers connecting at the hub, putting the flag carrier at a commercial disadvantage compared to European rivals. For example, it is now three times longer than the MCT at Vienna airport for passengers connecting between Star Alliance flights.
Passengers from Nice heading for Los Angeles can no longer arrive in California at lunchtime by transiting through London. Up to 8 January, travellers on the first flight from the south of France had 65 minutes to connect with the British Airways departure at 10.10am, giving an arrival time of 1.25pm. While a lunchtime arrival is still feasible on KLM via Amsterdam, Lufthansa via Frankfurt or Air France via Paris, the first “legal” connection on BA reaches Los Angeles at 4.10pm.
From Berlin, a passenger hoping to connect on the British Airways afternoon flight to Miami will need to leave the German capital 70 minutes earlier than previously.
A spokesperson for British Airways said: “Following customer feedback, we’re increasing the minimum connection time for some of our flights through Heathrow T5.
“This will give customers more time to make their next flight and reduce the risk of missing their onward service, which we know is incredibly frustrating.”
Connections between Terminals 3 and 5 – which require a bus connection taking around 10 minutes – retain the existing 90-minute minimum.
British Airways says passengers who made bookings before the change and have connections shorter than 75 minutes have been contacted and offered alternative connections.
Terminal 5 opened almost 16 years ago as the solution to British Airways’ big structural problem: most intercontinental flights used Terminal 4, while Terminal 1 served domestic and most European flights. Connections between the two were fraught.
The £2.5bn new structure at the west of the airfield was the solution. After some industrial-scale teething problems, Terminal 5 is now working well for British Airways and its sister airline, Iberia.
The change was first picked up by the frequent-flyer website Head for Points – whose editor, Rob Burgess, said: “British Airways has been very public about its desire to reduce aircraft delays at Heathrow, and ensuring transit passengers don’t get stuck in Flight Connections is a help.
“It would make more sense to tackle the root of the problem at Heathrow, however, rather than simply enforce longer connecting times. When Zurich can guarantee a connection in 40 minutes and Frankfurt in 45 minutes, BA is simply making itself less attractive to transit passengers.”
The minimum connecting times for international-to-international flights at European competitors for British Airways – and Heathrow – are now significantly shorter:
Amsterdam: 50 minutes
Frankfurt: 45 minutes
Paris CDG: 60 minutes
Vienna: 25 minutes
Zurich: 40 minutes
British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and other carriers with connecting traffic at Heathrow face another threat to their transit business: the UK’s Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).
The new permit is currently obligatory for Qatari travellers, with Gulf and Jordanian nationals requuring the permit by next month.
The government says that by the end of the year, an ETA will be required by every “non-visa national” flying to the UK, even if they merely wish to spend two hours between flights.
At other major aviation hubs outside the US, passengers transferring from one international flight to another need only documentation valid for their final destination."

Kamikawa conferred with Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski in Warsaw and a placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. She also was scheduled to meet President Andrzej Duda.
She began her visit to Poland on Saturday, but interrupted it to make an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she pledged Japan’s continued support for the country as it tries to defend itself against Russia's full-scale invasion. Japan announced during her visit that it would contribute $37 million to the NATO trust fund to provide Ukraine with drone detection systems.
In Warsaw, Kamikawa told reporters during a short news briefing that she went to Ukraine to show Japan's “enduring solidarity with Ukraine” and praised Poland for its role in helping Ukrainian refugees.
""Japan will continue to work with Poland to end Russia’s aggression against Ukraine as soon as possible and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine,” she said, in comments translated by an interpreter.
Both she and Sikorski said at a news conference that Japan and Poland are strong strategic partners who intend to strengthen their ties further.
Kamikawa said that the two countries are united by their values and principles, and noted that their talks also focused on the situation in East Asia.
Sikorski said that he expressed condolences to the minister over an earthquake on the Noto Peninsula that left at least 168 dead and dozens missing and a deadly collision of a large passenger plane and a Japanese coast guard aircraft.
“I have already expressed our condolences to the minister for the tragic earthquake on the Noto Peninsula and for the airplane accident, while congratulating her on such a smooth evacuation, thanks to which so many human lives were saved. I assure you of our solidarity with Japan in these difficult times,"" Sikorski said."

In remarks carried on state media, Safadi was quoted as telling his French counterpart Catherine Colonna during a phone call the danger of the spread of war was ""rising by the day"" with Israel continuing to wreak ""death and destruction in Gaza.""
Safadi added that Netanyahu's right-wing nationalist ruling coalition government sought to implicate the West directly in a regional war that would only ""doom the region to more conflict and destruction"".
""Israel's aggression against Gaza has exceeded all the human, legal and moral limits,"" Safadi said adding that there was no longer any pretext that prevented the U.N. Security Council from adopting a mandatory resolution to end the war.
The Jordanian official said the failure of the U.N.Security Council so far to impose a ceasefire ""reflects double standards and a selective application of international law.""
Safadi said Jordan and France stood against the mass displacement of Palestinians outside Gaza and agreed that Israel should allow home many of the 2.3 million inhabitants of the enclave it has now squeezed into the south near the Egyptian border who fled northern Gaza.

I3S5X24KCS-238,Letter from Roman emperor leads to discovery of cult temple hidden beneath parking lot,Moira Ritter,"January 9, 2024 at 5:24 AM·2 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/news/letter-roman-emperor-leads-discovery-212413287.html,"Some 1,600 years ago, a group of Roman empire citizens in Italy received a letter from Emperor Constantine, allowing them to celebrate a religious holiday in their hometown rather than traveling to a faraway festival.
Experts discovered Constantine’s response, known as a rescript, in the 18th century — and archaeologists have just used it to make a “monumental discovery.”
A team of researchers from Saint Louis University unearthed “three walls of a monumental structure that evidence suggests belonged to a Roman temple that dates to Constantine’s period,” Douglas Boin, a history professor at Saint Louis University, said in a Jan. 5 university news release.
The ruins were found in Spello, a “famous medieval hilltop city,” the university said. They date to Constantine’s rule of the Roman Empire, which was between 324 A.D. and 337 A.D.
Boin began searching in Spello after reviewing Constantine’s rescript, according to the university. In his letter, Constantine granted the townspeople permission to celebrate at home on the condition that they erected a temple honoring his ancestors and worship them.
Constantine was famously the first Roman emperor to practice Christianity. But his request to the Spello people reflects “Imperial Cult” beliefs, indicating that the transition from paganism to Christianity was not a quick one, experts said.
The “Imperial Cult” is also known as the “Cult of Emperor,” according to the Harvard Divinity School. It involves “the worship of Emperors and their families as divine” which began with Julius Caesar’s death in 44 B.C.
“(The temple) would be a remarkable addition to the landscape of this corner of Italy. It will significantly aid in the understanding of the ancient town, the ancient townscape and city society in the later Roman Empire,” Boin said in the release. “It shows the continuities between the classical pagan world and early Christian Roman world that often get blurred out or written out of the sweeping historical narratives.”
Boin and his team conducted “underground imaging” in hopes of finding evidence of the temples ruins, the university said. After several weeks, they finally caught a glimpse of something “promising” — beneath a parking lot.
Archaeologists carefully dug up the parking lot and discovered “two adjoining walls,” according to the university. Further digging revealed what experts believe is an inside wall of the temple.
“There’s evidence from other places throughout the Roman world that Christian rulers supported imperial cult practices,” Boin said. “It is unlike any temple that I know about from the Mediterranean world of the fourth century Roman Empire...This changes everything about how we perceive the pace of social change and our impression of the impact of social and cultural change.”
The team of experts will return to the site next summer to completely excavate the site and examine the ruins in their entirety, the university said.
Spello is about 100 miles north of Rome.

YU8OKCKQ6W-239,Lockheed Martin to Replace Greece's Entire Helicopter Fleet. Is Lockheed Stock a Buy?,"Rich Smith, The Motley Fool","January 8, 2024 at 10:15 PM·5 min read",20240108,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-replace-greeces-entire-141500206.html,"It's been more than 2,300 years since the nation of Greece was last considered a military powerhouse -- around about the time Alexander the Great was burning down Persepolis.
Today, the country's air forces lean heavily on aging F-16 fighter jets first flown in the 1970s, and even more sclerotic F-4 Phantom jets that date back to 1960, flying alongside similarly Vietnam-war era UH-1 ""Huey"" helicopters. But Greece's military is about to get an upgrade.
As the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency -- the Pentagon arm responsible for coordinating foreign military sales contracts -- advised Congress last month, the U.S. State Department has just cleared a Greek request to buy a whole fleet of new UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).
Assuming Congress approves the sale, Lockheed Martin stands to reap nearly $2 billion in revenue ($1.95 billion to be precise) from this deal. So what does this all mean for shareholders? Let's find out.
In this initial deal, Greece intends to purchase 35 Black Hawks from Lockheed, along with 80 engines to power them (two per helicopter, plus 10 spares), and a whole list of ancillary equipment (radar, radios, and other electronics, machine guns, rocket launchers, and ammunition, for example). Thus, multiple defense contractors are likely to share in the revenue from this deal -- but as primary contractor, all the money will run through Lockheed Martin.
Greece intends to use the new helicopters to replace the Hellenic Army's current multi-role helicopter fleet, which, according to data from FlightGlobal's 2024 World Air Forces report, leans heavily on 63 UH-1H Huey helicopters built by Textron's (NYSE: TXT) Bell Helicopter unit.
And that number may be instructive. Can 35 Black Hawks actually do the work of nearly twice as many Hueys? Perhaps, if the new Black Hawks are easier to maintain and require fewer repairs than the older Hueys they replace. But also perhaps not.
As it turns out, an October report from online news site FlightGlobal noted that Greece initially intended to purchase 49 Black Hawks from Lockheed. If it turns out that this remains Greece's intention, and the initial 35-helo purchase is just a first installment on Greece's shopping list, this deal could actually turn out to be about 40% bigger than it seems -- implying Lockheed Martin might get another $780 million in revenue out of it, growing the size of this deal to $2.7 billion.
What would that mean for Lockheed Martin? Rotary and mission systems, the Lockheed unit that owns Sikorsky and builds the Black Hawk, is currently the company's second-biggest revenue producer at $18.1 billion collected in 2022 (the most recent full year for which we have data). Rotary is the company's second to last most profitable segment, however, generating operating profit margins of only 9.2%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, a bit below the 10.5% operating profit margin for Lockheed Martin as a whole.
Thus, even at the upper end of its estimated value, this deal will only add about $250 million in incremental profits for Lockheed Martin, or about 3% of Lockheed's total annual take -- and this amount will probably be spread over a period of years. Thus, even at $2.7 billion, this deal isn't going to be enough to move the needle on Lockheed Martin stock, which still seems pricey to me at nearly 17 times earnings, and 1.7 times annual sales.
(As a general rule, I prefer to buy defense stocks at a price-to-sales ratio of 1 or less.)
Curiously, defense investors might actually be better off taking a look at Textron, the company whose helicopters are being replaced (in Greece at least) by Lockheed's helicopters.
Seemingly priced similarly to Lockheed stock at 17 times trailing earnings, Textron's price-to-sales ratio of 1.2 seems closer to fair value. Analysts polled by S&P also anticipate that Textron will grow earnings faster than Lockheed over the next five years, at a rate approaching 12%, versus Lockheed Martin's growth rate of 7%.
While neither stock is a clear-cut buy for me at current prices, I suspect Textron stock is still closer to bargain territory than is Lockheed. Investors looking for a defense stock to own in 2024 should keep an eye on Textron.

YEONPYEONG ISLAND, South Korea (Reuters) - As Kim Jeoung-hee huddled in a bomb shelter on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, scared and confused with around 250 other people, memories flooded back of the day in 2010 when North Korean troops shelled near their homes.
Authorities told them to take shelter on Friday as North-South tensions spiked again. This time no-one aimed any shells at the small patch of land just on the southern side of the two Koreas' disputed maritime border.
But the alarm was a reminder of how vulnerable Yeonpyeong remains more than 13 years after the bombardment that killed two soldiers and two civilians there, and left an unconfirmed number of North Korean casualties after South Korea fired back.
""Every time I hear a bang I get scared,"" Kim told Reuters on Monday, standing in the same bomb shelter, a bunker buried in a hill with toilets, a small kitchen and blankets inside. ""Everyone is living with that nightmare.""
Friday's scare came after North Korea fired off more than 200 shells a few miles from the island, and still more over the weekend, in what it described as artillery drills. The South responded on Friday with its own live-fire exercises.
The corresponding actions marked a further escalation between the rivals. In November North Korea said it would deploy stronger armed forces and new weapons on its border with the South, a day after Seoul suspended part of a 2018 military accord in a protest over Pyongyang's launch of a spy satellite.
The breakdown of the 2018 agreement left many on Yeonpyeong fearing they could be back in the firing line.
Kim said he and other island leaders met with South Korean military officials earlier on Monday to air their concerns about Friday's alarm, including what he said was a lack of clarity and communication. They also requested that the military help provide food in the future, after children and elderly had to spend up to four hours underground.
""Considering what happened 14 years ago, this shouldn’t have been dealt with this way,"" Kim said. ""If there’s a real emergency, residents deserve to know what really is happening.""
The ferry service was also suspended that day, effectively trapping residents on the island, Kim said. ""Everyone here has been held hostage,"" he said.
CHINESE FISHING TRAWLERS DISAPPEAR
South Korea's Defence Ministry acknowledged it had not sent the islanders a notice when North Korea started firing on Friday, but said that was because the drills were taking place some distance away.
The ministry said it asked local authorities to send out an alert later after it launched its own exercises, as it worried North Korea might respond.
""In the future, our military will continue to strictly consider public safety-related matters and collaborate with the relevant local government,"" a spokesperson told Reuters.
On Monday, many of the passengers on the ferry that runs twice daily to the island were young South Korean marines in uniform, dozing or listening to music next to camouflaged rucksacks.
Around 30% of the island's roughly 2,000 registered inhabitants are military personnel.
Off the coast a South Korean naval vessel could be seen, and marines patrolled the streets.
Chinese fishing trawlers that often crowd the waters nearby have been conspicuously absent so far in January - a further cause for concern as those vessels often disappear when tensions rise, a coast guard official told Reuters.
""This time, again they are apparently staying away,"" said the official who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. ""Probably North Korea might have given a warning to them already.""
Kim said he and his fellow islanders were scanning the horizon, waiting for the return of the Chinese fleets, and the reduction in tensions that might herald.
""We look at Chinese fishing boats and feel more comfortable,"" he said.

Ousman Sonko fled there in 2016, shortly before Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, accused of heading a repressive regime, lost power.
Mr Sonko, 54, was arrested after non-governmental organisations presented evidence of his alleged involvement in killings, rape and torture.
But his lawyer said that he was not responsible for what happened.
Philippe Currat is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that The Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, which was ""never... under [his] authority"" was behind the alleged crimes.
Switzerland is trying the case under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows countries to prosecute people on their territory, even though the events may have taken place elsewhere.
Mr Sonko is the highest-ranking government official ever to be prosecuted under this principle in Europe.
Human rights groups believe the trial, taking place in the southern Swiss city of Bellinzona, could be a warning to repressive governments everywhere that the arm of the law can be very long indeed.
Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent
The witch hunts which left The Gambia traumatised
Switzerland's charge sheet against Mr Sonko is extensive.
It includes the participation in, or ordering of, killings, torture and rape - all targeting political opponents. These could constitute crimes against humanity under Swiss law.
Swiss investigators travelled to The Gambia and interviewed dozens of alleged victims and witnesses - nine will be in court to testify.
From 1996 until 2016, The Gambia was ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, whose time in office, according to Human Rights Watch, was characterised by ""widespread abuses, including forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings"".
Mr Sonko was Mr Jammeh's right-hand man, his role as interior minister putting him in charge of the security services, including, allegedly, a sinister paramilitary group known as ""the Junglers"".
But in 2016, shortly before Mr Jammeh himself lost power, Mr Sonko fled to Switzerland, where he claimed asylum.
Within months he was arrested, after an NGO, Trial International, gave the Swiss authorities details of abuses he was allegedly involved in.
After six trips to The Gambia and 40 interviews with complainants, the Swiss attorney general drew up the charge sheet.
This is only the second time that Switzerland has ever tried someone under universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity.
The first case, in June 2023, saw former Liberian militia leader Alieu Kosiah sentenced to 20 years for crimes including rape, murder, and cannibalism.
Other countries are also bringing cases against former members of Mr Jammeh's regime.
In October, Germany handed a life sentence for crimes against humanity to Bai Lowe, a one-time member of ""the Junglers"".
Later this year, a court in the US state of Colorado will begin the trial of an alleged former member of the same group.
Although The Gambia has created its own transitional justice process to address abuses committed under Mr Jammeh's rule, human rights groups say its work has so far been very slow.
Even in the Swiss trial against Mr Sonko, one of the plaintiffs who had been scheduled to testify died before the case came to court.
But for those who do testify, ""being invited before a court of law, to tell their stories, is a way for them to heal. And if the federal court does reach a guilty verdict, it will be an enormous relief for them. They will get the answers they have been waiting for for many years,"" Trial International's Benoit Meystre said.
The court case is expected to last a month with a verdict coming in March.

The Polish military had observed increased activity in Russian long-range aviation for several hours, which was associated with the launch of missile strikes on targets located in Ukraine.
""All necessary procedures have been initiated to ensure the safety of Polish airspace, and the situation is constantly monitored,"" the command said.
According to top Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine, using cruise, air, ballistic, anti-aircraft guided missiles and attack UAVs. A total of 59 air strikes were recorded. The air defense forces destroyed 18 cruise missiles and eight Shahed drones.

BXVMT9V6VY-244,Polish EU Commissioner threatens to block Ukraine's duty-free trade with EU,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 8, 2024 at 6:28 AM·2 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/polish-eu-commissioner-threatens-block-122850942.html,"Janusz Wojciechowski, the European Commissioner for Agriculture, has warned of a new crisis that could be triggered by excessive agricultural imports from Ukraine to the EU, saying he may not support a new European Commission (EC) regulation on the extension of duty-free trade with Ukraine.
Source: a letter from Wojciechowski to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Valdis Dombrovskis, EC Vice-President for Trade, as reported by European Pravda, citing Polish media outlet RMF FM
Details: The letter sets out the Polish commissioner's position on the proposed new EC regulation on extending the duty-free trade regime with Ukraine.
RMF FM has unofficially learned that Janusz Wojciechowski will not support the regulation unless his proposals are taken into account. The EC's internal consultations on this issue end tomorrow.
Wojciechowski is proposing that the new regulation should contain safeguard provisions similar to those that the EC applied in the past to imports of Ukrainian rapeseed, maize, sunflower and wheat.
The Polish commissioner is also advocating for quantitative restrictions on sugar and poultry, imports of which, he believes, are growing rapidly and threaten to destabilise the EU market.
""The extension of trade privileges for Ukraine under the EU regulation, which expires this year, without safeguards and quantitative restrictions threatens to trigger a new crisis of excess imported agricultural products from Ukraine,"" Wojciechowski said in the letter.
The European Commissioner noted that the EU ""should rethink the concept of its aid, which implies unlimited openness"". He blames the current state of affairs on Russia, which is blockading the Black Sea and pushing Ukraine out of its traditional markets in Asia and Africa.
Wojciechowski reiterated his proposal to support the transit of Ukrainian grain to EU seaports from which it can be transported on to African and Asian markets.
Background:
The European Commission announced in September that it would not extend restrictions on agricultural imports from Ukraine beyond 15 September, but Kyiv agreed to take measures to restrict imports from its side.
Despite this, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have decided to impose unilateral restrictions, with Warsaw saying their restrictions will remain in place indefinitely. Slovakia’s ban will last until the end of the year.
The European Commission said in late November that it has observed no adverse effects of Ukrainian agricultural imports on European markets.

Murat Kurashev, a 36-year-old handyman, entered the plea before Chief U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller without any plea agreement from prosecutors and faces up to 20 years in prison.
Kurashev appeared in court in an orange Sacramento jail jumpsuit with waist shackles and used a Russian interpreter to enter his guilty plea.
The FBI arrested Kurashev in February 2021 after his indictment by a federal grand jury on a charge that he attempted to provide “material support or resources” to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, also known as HTS.
HTS also is known as the “Organization for the Liberation of the Levant,” according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and once was affiliated with al-Qaeda. HTS later split off and aimed to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to CSIS.
Court filings say Kurashev attempted to provide financial support to the group despite knowing that HTS “was a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,” and that evidence in the case included a video of HTS fighters that Kurashev watched while driving on a Sacramento-area freeway.
Prosecutors say in court papers that between July 2020 and February 2021, Kurashev used web-based money transfer services to send $13,000 to two couriers working for Farrukh Fayzimatov, an HTS fundraiser who the Treasury Department says “utilizes social media to post propaganda, recruit new members, and solicit donations for HTS.”
“Records obtained from the money transfer services corroborate multiple transactions from Kurashev to the couriers in Turkey usually in increments of $1,000,” court papers say. “The couriers retrieved the funds often within 24 hours of transfer.
“Surveillance footage from money transfer businesses captured Kurashev in the midst of the transactions. The FBI also located evidence on Kurashev’s phone that shows that on or about February 10, 2021, Kurashev transferred $200 worth of Bitcoin directly to a wallet for Fayzimatov.
“Fayzimatov sent the wallet address directly to Kurashev via an encrypted mobile messaging application on the same day. Kurashev responded, ‘sent.’ It appears that Kurashev attempted to delete these messages from his cellular device.”
Prosecutors wrote that investigators’ review of social media and encrypted messaging discussions between the two “demonstrated that they believed that providing money in support of the HTS’s fighters was tantamount to being engaged in violent jihad.”
“During these conversations with Fayzimatov, Kurashev mentioned that he wished he could join the fight in Syria as a mujahideen and regretted that he could only provide financial support,” prosecutors wrote. “The conversations between Fayzimatov and Kurashev make clear that Kurashev was fully aware of Fayzimatov’s participation in and work on behalf of HTS and his violent extremist ideology.”
Some of the online solicitations Kurashev viewed sought funds for “military equipment, boots, clothing, firearms, and, in one case, a motorcycle,” court papers say.
“Moreover, FBI forensic analysis of Kurashev’s Apple iCloud account revealed it to be replete with violent extremist content, including at least one video depicting HTS fighters,” documents say. “It appears that Kurashev watched this video while driving his work van along Interstate 80.”
Kurashev, who is in custody at the Sacramento County Main Jail, faces sentencing March 18."

BZA5FFI5WN-247,Somaliland's defense minister resigns over deal to give Ethiopia access to the region's coastline,OMAR FARUK,"January 8, 2024 at 2:53 PM·2 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/somalilands-defense-minister-resigns-over-205355038.html,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Somaliland's defense minister has resigned to protest his government signing an agreement to allow landlocked Ethiopia to access Somaliland's coastline.
“Ethiopia remains our number one enemy,” Abdiqani Mohamud Ateye said in an interview with local television on Sunday.
Somalia has protested the deal as a threat to its sovereignty by Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia decades ago but lacks international recognition for its claims of being an independent state.
Ateye asserted that in an earlier meeting with Somaliland President Muse Bihi Abdi, he expressed his belief that stationing Ethiopian troops in Somaliland was fundamentally inappropriate.
He said he also argued that the proposed construction site for the Ethiopian marine force base rightfully belonged to his community, but that the president dismissed his concerns.
There was no immediate response from the Somaliland or Ethiopian governments to the minister's assertions.
Somaliland, a region strategically located next to the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991 as the country collapsed into warlord-led conflict.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Somaliland's president signed the memorandum of understanding for access to the sea last week. As part of the deal, Somaliland would lease a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) stretch of its coastline to Ethiopia.
Somaliland’s defense minister accused Ethiopia's prime minister of attempting to acquire the stretch of coastline without proper negotiations. “Abiy Ahmed wants to take it without renting or owning it,” he said.
The agreement has triggered protests across Somaliland, with citizens divided over the deal. Some see potential economic benefits. Others fear compromising their sovereignty.
With a population of more than 120 million, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world. It lost its access to the sea when Eritrea seceded in 1993. Ethiopia has been using the port in neighboring Djibouti for most of its imports and exports since then.
While in the short term the agreement may not affect regional stability because Somalia has no means to impose its will by force on Somaliland, in the longer term states like Djibouti and Egypt may be affected, said Matt Bryden, strategic advisor for Sahan Research, a Nairobi-based think tank.
“Djibouti may perceive a threat to its commercial interests as Ethiopia’s principal port. Egypt may resist Ethiopia’s ambitions to establish a naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Members of the African Union and Arab League will be lobbied by all parties to take positions. So an escalation in political and diplomatic posturing on all sides is very likely,” he said."
6FMFW5OKWY-248,South Korea accuses North Korea of firing hundreds of artillery shells near disputed border area,Miranda Nazzaro,"January 7, 2024 at 8:53 PM·2 min read",20240108,https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-accuses-north-korea-125357205.html,"South Korea accused North Korea of firing hundreds of artillery shells near its disputed sea boundary for the third straight day as the North pledges further military action in response to any provocation.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Sunday claimed North Korea fired off over 90 rounds near the country’s western sea boundary with the North, the Associated Press reported. The South warned of an overwhelming response if the North does not stop halt the firings, the news wire added.
Kim Yo Jung, the sister of the North’s leader Kim Jong Un, said Sunday the Korean People’s Army (KPA) detonated blasting powder, which simulated the sound of its coastal artillery, in a test of the South Korean military’s detection abilities.
She maintained the North did not fire a “single shell” into the disputed waters.
“The result was clear as we expected. They misjudged the blasting sound as the sound of gunfire and conjectured it as a provocation,” Kim said in a statement issued by state media KCNA, adding later, “The ridiculous behavior of these puppets in military uniform is nothing new today.”
Kim reiterated the North will “launch an immediate military strike” if the South “makes even a slight provocation,” calling the South “gangsters.”
“I cannot but say that [South Korean] people are very pitiful as they entrust ‘security’ to such blind persons and offer huge taxes to them,” she said. “It is better 10 times to entrust security to a dog with a developed sense of hearing and smell.”
In the wake of the North’s firings last Friday, South Korea directed troops on border islands to fire artillery rounds near the sea boundary. The shells landed at the buffer zone between the two countries, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The area was created under a 2018 agreement that required the two Koreas to dismantle or disarm several guard posts and created a no-fly zone at the border and a ban on aerial reconnaissance and live-fire exercises.
Tensions between the two Koreas have spiked in recent months as the North continues missile tests and the South expands military training with the U.S. The recent breaches of the 2018 agreement put the deal at risk, with experts warning the North will boost weapons tests in the coming months, the AP reported.

WB38VWFRBS-249,Taiwan is heading for a pivotal election that will define its fraught relationship with China. Here's what's at stake.,"Stuart Lau, Politico","January 8, 2024 at 8:27 PM·8 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-heading-pivotal-election-define-122717398.html,"Taiwan is set to hold a tight presidential election on Saturday.
The main choice is between pro-Western and pro-China candidates.
The choice has huge implications for Taiwan as China tries ever more aggressively to take it over.
Stuart Lau is the EU-China correspondent for Politico. Business Insider and Politico share a parent company, Axel Springer.
TAIPEI — The stakes for Taiwan's democracy could hardly be higher in a tight presidential election on Saturday, with China's leader, Xi Jinping, delivering an ominous New Year's address in which he insisted ""reunification of the motherland is a historical inevitability.""
The vote cuts to the heart of a battle for regional influence between Beijing and Washington, and all eyes will be on China's reaction to Saturday's vote.
The nightmare scenario for global security would be a regional conflict centered on an island that makes more than 90% of the world's advanced microchips, vital for iPhones and electric vehicles alike.
The frontrunner by a narrow margin is Vice President William Lai of the Democratic Progressive Party. Lai is a proponent of Taipei's sovereignty and is seeking to shore up relations with the US, Europe, and other democracies.
His main rival is Hou Yu-ih, from the Kuomintang party, who takes a friendlier approach to Beijing.
The winner will succeed Tsai Ing-wen from the DPP, who has served two terms, an eight-year stint over which Beijing has upped its aggression toward Taipei.
This has been particularly true in recent months, with the Taiwanese defense ministry saying in September that a record number of Chinese warplanes had crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, the 100-mile waterway separating the island from the mainland.
China's Communist government, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, views the DPP as an archnemesis and wants to see it out of power.
The big question is how Beijing will react if the pro-independence forces win an unprecedented third term.
On Saturday evening, both Lai and Hou staged election rallies in the same district in Taoyuan, a city close to the capital, attracting tens of thousands of mostly middle-age and older supporters.
Both parties claimed an attendance of over 100,000. The DPP was out to burnish its credentials as a staunch opponent to a hostile Beijing.
""Only by building a strong national defense can we protect the Taiwan Strait's security,"" Lai told the crowd.
Hou, by contrast, sought to cast the DPP as corrupt and liable to precipitate a showdown with Xi.
""Corruption is on the way, dark money is on the way, warmongering is on the way, and Taiwan independence is on the way,"" he said at a rival gathering nearby.
""Taiwan independence"" is a loaded phrase as Beijing warns such a move ""means war.""
Here's what you need to know about the race:
It's basically a three-way contest.
Lai of the DPP is vying to succeed his boss, the outgoing Tsai, and has been vice president for the past four years. Beijing is extremely critical of Lai, who called himself a ""pragmatic worker for Taiwan independence"" in 2017.
He's joined by Bi-khim Hsiao, the vice-presidential candidate who's a famous figure in Washington, having served as Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US.
Lai, a 64-year-old Harvard graduate, hails from a humble background.
His father died in a mining accident when he was not yet a year old, and he was among six children raised by his mother. Before he became vice president, he was the mayor of Tainan and later Taiwan's premier.
On the Beijing-friendly front, the KMT, or Nationalist Party, is represented by Hou, a former police officer who is the mayor of New Taipei City, just outside the capital.
Hou, however, is viewed with skepticism by some in the KMT.
Within the KMT, the hardcore supporters believe in a pan-Chinese identity, as many of their families came from the mainland and moved to Taiwan reluctantly only after the Communist takeover in 1949.
Hou's family, in contrast, had been in Taiwan for generations, and is considered as native Taiwanese instead of Chinese from mainland provinces.
This tension prompted Hou to show proof of his father's record as a KMT veteran and warship repairer during fighting against the Communists in the 1940s, even though he was also conscripted by the Imperial Japanese Army during the colonization of Taiwan. After the wars, his father became a butcher.
There's a third party this time (which is not always the case): the Taiwan People's Party, led by former Mayor Ko Wen-je of Taipei, who's especially popular among young voters.
The party claims to occupy the middle ground between the two traditional camps.
There's no clear favorite.
Taiwan has a 10-day blackout period on polls ahead of the election.
In the most recent numbers, released last week, the DPP's Lai led Hou by 3 to 11 percentage points across different polls. Ko consistently came last.
But pollsters also cautioned about significant fluctuations.
In previous months, Lai's lead was often within the margin of error, showing it's all to play for, especially as Ko's TPP peels off youthful support and complicates the arithmetic.
There will be just one round. The candidate with the highest number of votes will be the winner on a first-past-the-post basis, regardless of the turnout or share of votes.
Some 19.3 million of the island's 23.6 million people are eligible voters. One million of them will be voting for the first time.
In the most recent presidential contest, in 2020, Tsai won 57%, with a record 8 million votes.
Her popularity boost was thanks largely to shock in Taiwan over Beijing's heavy-handed response to the Hong Kong protests in 2019.
The new president will be sworn in May 20.
The national parliament, or the Legislative Yuan, is also up for grabs on the same day, with the 113 lawmakers to be chosen.
The TPP vows to win enough seats to block either the DPP or the KMT from securing a simple majority, though polling remains inconclusive whether this would be likely.
Lai, the sitting vice president running as a candidate, appealed on Saturday to supporters to back all DPP candidates in the legislative poll too, warning that he would not be able to run the country efficiently if his party failed to take at least half of the legislature's seats.
The result was announced at 10:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. ET) four years ago.
As soon as the polls close at 4 p.m., counting begins and is constantly updated, so there's a good chance of clarity before the final official announcement.
The election forms part of a broader geopolitical rivalry between China and the US.
While Beijing has been beefing up its military for any conflict in the South China Sea, Chinese officials have also stressed military options are a last resort — at least in public statements — if peaceful reunification is no longer feasible.
If the ruling DPP wins, it would be the first time that the pro-independence party has won power for a third successive term since Taiwan became a democracy in 1996.
Beijing could interpret that as a signal that there's little public appetite for future reunification, especially among the younger generation that has less connection with China, raising the specter that Beijing could feel the need to up the stakes.
With that in mind, military tensions are already on the rise. In addition to the increased brinkmanship with warplanes, China in October launched a ""Long March"" satellite-carrying rocket into space over Taiwan, the first to take such a path.
Beijing blames the Taiwanese government for pushing the island into ""the abyss of catastrophe.""
""The DPP authorities are seeking independence by relying on the US, turning Taiwan into a powder keg and an island of explosives,"" the Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said in December.
To some degree, Taiwan is already prepared for an escalation.
After then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's whirlwind visit in 2022, Beijing's People's Liberation Army launched unprecedented joint military exercises around Taiwanese airspace and waters.
The danger is that China could go further this year.

Source: European Pravda with reference to a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the four countries
Quote from the statement: ""Today we have jointly initiated dispute settlement proceedings before the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) against the Islamic Republic of Iran for using weapons against a civil aircraft in flight in breach of its international legal obligations under Article 3bis of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention).""
Details: The ministers argue that Tehran has refused to take full international legal responsibility for the downing of flight PS752 over the last four years, despite all attempts at negotiations, so it was decided to refer the dispute to the ICAO Council.
Quote: ""Initiating these proceedings today reflects our commitment to the families who deserve justice. It also reflects our trust in the ICAO council, and the international community writ large, as guardian of the safety and security of civil aviation, including by settling disputes when they arise. It is necessary that those who violate the rules are held accountable.""

Source: Colonel Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, during the national 24/7 newscast
Quote: ""A large number of ballistic missiles were fired by the enemy, including Kinzhals and missiles that lock on the target along a ballistic trajectory (Kh-22s), six (ballistic) Iskanders, and S-300/S-400 missiles. All of them fly on a ballistic trajectory.
It should be understood that such targets can be shot down only by systems capable of doing it, in particular by Patriot systems.
That is why this is the result today. Many are already saying that the ""percentage of downed missiles is low"". The percentage remains the same as it was (in particular when it comes to Kh-101 missiles, with 18 out of 24 of them shot down).
Details: Ihnat also noted that 100% of the Shahed assault drones launched at Ukraine on the night of 7-8 January were shot down (8 out of 8 UAVs). He also said not all the missiles that the Russians had launched had reached their targets. However, these details would not be disclosed, so as not to ""make life easier for the enemy"".
Background: On the night of 7-8 January, the Russian occupiers fired 59 aerial weapons on Ukraine – missiles of various types and Shahed attack drones; 18 missiles and all eight Shaheds were shot down.
Previously: Kh-22/32 missiles fly on a ballistic trajectory, and special systems are needed to intercept them, such as Patriot air defence systems. The Russians have deployed more than 300 such missiles since the start of the full-scale invasion. No Kh-22/32 missile has ever been shot down.

Upon determining the coordinates of the enemy target, SSO operators directed fire from a missile unit of the Ukrainian forces, destroying the EWC completely.
Triada-2 is an EWC specifically designed to disable communication satellites. The Russians completed its development in the fall of 2018, and by the spring of 2019, Triada-2 was first detected on the territory of the occupied Luhansk Oblast.

The Triada-2 electronic warfare complex (also known as Triada-2.3) is regarded as one of the newest and most classified ""novelties of the Russian defense industry,"" according to ArmyInform, a media outlet run by Ukraine’s Defense Ministry.
Development work on the Triada commenced in 2001 at Moscow Central Research Institute No. 46 of the Russian Defense Ministry. After years of refinement, the first contract for the purchase of an unspecified number of these complexes was signed in 2018. Triada is produced at the Elektropribor plant in the city of Vladimir.
Russian propaganda grandiosely labels it a ""killer of satellite communication,"" claiming it can suppress satellite communication and even completely disable satellites directly from the Earth's surface. Russian propagandists have even credited the complex with a ""victory"" over the Starlink network.
The Ukrainian Armed Forces had previously succeeded in destroying a Triada complex in the Bakhmut sector in July 2023.

XMBGGSOFGE-254,"United, Alaska find loose hardware on jets amid probe into Boeing 737 Max 9 blowout","Jeremy Childs, Matt Hamilton","January 9, 2024 at 6:25 AM·7 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/united-airlines-finds-loose-bolts-222548807.html,"Both Alaska and United airlines have found problems with door plugs on their Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after the ""explosive"" blowout late last week of the same piece of fuselage on an Alaska flight. On Monday, Alaska reported that investigators found ""loose hardware,"" and United also reported loose bolts.
Hardware failure could contribute to the door plug becoming dislodged, despite the presence of 12 ""stops"" in the door plug design, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
The agency is in the preliminary stages of its investigation into the Friday night incident on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which was traveling from Portland International Airport to Ontario. The NTSB found the door shifted upward, and ""all 12 stops became disengaged, allowing it to blow out of the fuselage,"" said Clint Crookshanks, an NTSB investigator, at a news conference Monday night.
Both United and Alaska have grounded their fleets of the commercial airplanes and canceled hundreds of flights in the aftermath of the incident.
The aircraft had reached about 16,000 feet elevation when the cabin underwent ""explosive decompression,"" according to Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, and the door plug burst off the side of the plane.
Among revelations at a Sunday night news conference, the NTSB chief said the door plug the agency had been searching for had been found by a Portland, Ore., teacher in his backyard.
The teacher, referred to only by his first name, contacted the NTSB via email and sent two photos of the piece of fuselage, which was described as a 63-pound piece of the plane that is yellow-green in color on one side and white on the other. Two cellphones that plummeted from the aircraft also were found in the vicinity.
“Bob was a star with all his students today,” Homendy said at Monday's news conference.

A focus of the investigation on Monday was a warning light on Flight 1282 that had illuminated at least three times in the last month — including in the two days preceding Friday night's blowout — possibly indicating a pressurization problem on the aircraft.
Alaska Airlines had restricted the jet from transcontinental routes so that the plane could return to an airport during an emergency, Homendy said.
Because the pressurization light had gone off several times, additional maintenance was ordered on the plane, but it had not yet been performed before Friday's flight.
Homendy said on Monday night, however, that the light was part of a larger system maintaining safe cabin pressure and it had ""operated as designed."" She said there were “no indications whatsoever that this correlated in any way” with the plug door blowout.
This is not the first time loose bolts have been discovered on Boeing 737 Max 9 jets; in late December, Boeing issued a warning to all airlines with 737 Max planes to inspect the aircraft for possible loose bolts in the rudder-control system after an airline reported a missing nut while conducting routine maintenance.
Boeing President and Chief Executive David Calhoun sent a companywide email Sunday canceling the organization's annual leadership retreat to instead host a ""safety webcast"" with members of the executive leadership team.
""While we've made progress in strengthening our safety management and quality control systems and processes in the last few years, situations like this are a reminder that we must remain focused on continuing to improve every day,"" the email read.
Federal officials on Sunday night also pointed out a major obstacle to the Alaska Airlines investigation: The cockpit voice recorder, or black box, from the Friday night flight was erased.
Homendy said that after the aircraft returned to Portland International Airport, no one pulled the circuit breaker on the cockpit voice recorder or otherwise preserved the audio, which holds only its most recent two hours.
""The cockpit voice recorder was completely overwritten. There was nothing on the cockpit voice recorder,"" Homendy said.
Homendy was visibly exasperated by the loss of the black box recording. She noted that it was a ""very chaotic event"" when the plane landed and officials set up an emergency operations center.
""The maintenance team went out to get [the cockpit voice recorder], but it was right at about the two-hour mark,"" she said, later adding: ""We have nothing.""
She pointed to about 10 other recent incidents when voice recorders were overwritten, including a 2017 near-catastrophe at San Francisco's airport when an Air Canada plane almost landed on a taxiway and would have collided with other jets carrying about 1,000 passengers. She called on the Federal Aviation Administration and Congress to implement a rule that would require new and existing planes to store audio for 25 hours, which aligns with European audio-retention practices.
""If that communication is not recorded, that is unfortunately a loss for us and a loss for FAA and a loss for safety,"" she said, ""because that information is key.""
Alaska Airlines did not respond to questions about the cockpit voice recorder or whether the airline would voluntarily install recorders that store audio for 25 hours.
Asked to offer any theories about what caused the plane's door plug to blow off, Homendy demurred.
""Right now we are in a fact-finding phase of the investigation,"" the NTSB chief said, adding that staff were poring over the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft for clues and planned to send key components to a lab to analyze any fractures, paint marks and shearing that could help explain what happened.
Surveying the aircraft, officials found damage in more than a dozen rows inside but had not identified any structural damage to the aircraft. The plug that blew off the plane was covering an unused emergency exit opening near Rows 25 and 26, and was essentially bolted to the aircraft structure. The plug was covered in paneling and included a window so that, from inside the cabin, it would appear indistinguishable from other rows.
Homendy on Sunday praised the crew for their response during the emergency.
The NTSB on Monday interviewed two of the four flight attendants who were on board, according to Hemondy. They, like other crew members, said they faced significant challenges communicating with colleagues after the fuselage blew out — and were not even sure what had occurred.
Homendy said the flight attendants had attended peer-to-peer counseling since the incident.
""This was a really significant event, with zero information at the time,"" Homendy said. ""There is a lot of trauma that they working through. It's going to be a long process. It was terrifying.""
Passengers and crew reported hearing ""a bang,"" she said, when the ""explosive decompression"" occurred after the plug was expelled from the fuselage.
""It was described as chaos, very loud,"" she said. The cockpit door flew open, and the captain partly lost and first officer completely lost their respective headsets.
""Flight attendants reported that it was difficult to get information from the flight deck, and the flight deck was also having difficulty communicating,"" Homendy said.
The plane had six crew members and 171 passengers, including three babies and four unaccompanied minors.
""The flight attendants were very focused on what was going on with those children. Were they safe? Were they secure?""
In a stroke of luck, two seats were empty directly next to the spot where the hole opened in the plane.
Seats in that area showed signs of damage, including sheared oxygen masks, lost headrests and torquing.
""There was a lot of damage to the interior paneling and trim,"" she said. ""It must have been a terrifying event to experience.""
Although U.S. airlines have grounded their planes, European airlines such as Icelandair are continuing to fly Boeing 737 Max 9s; the planes do not have the same configuration as that covered by the FAA order, according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.
Both Boeing 737 Max 9 and Max 8 were previously grounded from March 2019 until November 2020 after two Boeing 737 Max planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people aboard.
The Max's design included a larger engine, the placement of which could cause the craft to pitch up. Software was created to counteract that, but investigators determined that a faulty sensor triggered the software system to nosedive under certain conditions.

KLYD2VH1VL-255,"United Arab Emirates to build NASA Gateway airlock, send astronaut on Artemis mission","Richard Tribou, Orlando Sentinel","January 7, 2024 at 6:32 PM·5 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/united-arab-emirates-build-nasa-003200941.html,"NASA has onboarded another integral partner to its lunar plans by striking a deal with the United Arab Emirates to build part of its lunar Gateway space station and send one of the Arab country’s astronauts on a future Artemis mission.
The deal with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre announced Sunday means the UAE will be responsible for providing the Crew and Science Airlock module to the small station that will act as a temporary home for astronauts during crewed missions at first to the moon, but in time to deep-space destinations including Mars.
It also means a UAE astronaut will get to fly to the station building on the small country’s burgeoning space program that most recently sent its second astronaut to space as part of the six-month-long Crew-6 mission to the International Space Station in 2023.
“As chair of the National Space Council, I have made it a priority to enhance international cooperation in space,” said Vice President Kamala Harris in a press release. “Today’s announcement and partnership between the United States and United Arab Emirates advances this important work. By combining our resources, scientific capacity, and technical skill, the U.S. and UAE will further our collective vision for space and ensure it presents extraordinary opportunities for everyone here on Earth.”
The UAE joins the U.S., European Space Agency, Japan and Canada among partners on Artemis projects. Russia, which is a partner with the ISS, opted out of involvement with NASA’s moon plans.
Ahead of his flight on Crew-6, UAE astronaut Sultan AlNeyadi voiced his hopes his country would have a bigger role to play in deep space.
“We are looking toward missions further into space are looking to join Artemis hopefully in the future. I would love to see a UAE flag on the lunar surface carried on the shoulder of a UAE astronaut,” he said. “Yes I think the UAE is doing a very good job and in the coming 10 years I think we’ll be following the international efforts toward going to space and pushing the boundaries of exploration.”
He followed the first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa Al-Mansoori, who flew to the space station for an eight-day stay in 2019 in a Soyuz capsule riding with Russian cosmonauts. AlNeyadi and AlMansoori were the first two selected for the country’s program when it put the call out in 2017, chosen in 2018 among 4,000 applicants. Already, two other UAE astronauts continue to train with NASA in Houston for consideration on future flights.
The UAE’s space program has a lot of parts in play. It launched a probe to Mars in 2020 that successfully entered orbit in 2021 and in 2022 had sent a rover as a passenger on a commercial lunar lander that was destroyed when that lander failed to make a successful soft landing several months later in 2023. Those missions along with Earth observation satellites and its growing astronaut plans are the realization of the four facets of the UAE space center that was established in 2006. Its new astronaut class includes the country’s first woman as well.
Making a flight to Gateway doesn’t mean the UAE astronaut will walk on the moon, though.
Having completed the successful uncrewed Artemis I flight in 2022, NASA is gearing up to send Artemis II with three NASA and one Canadian astronaut on a short trip around the moon as early as November this year. NASA’s current timeline still puts Artemis III as early as December 2025. That’s supposed to be the first mission to send humans, including the first woman, back to the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo program in 1972.
That mission, though, is dependent on SpaceX completing its Starship and Super Heavy rocket as well as Axiom Space completing new deep-space spacesuits.
NASA’s Jim Free, who recently took on the role of Associate Administrator, the top civil servant in NASA, said in 2023 that SpaceX or other commercial partner delays tied to a lunar landing could mean a shuffle in Artemis missions so that Gateway plans move up the manifest.
Gateway’s timeline for now is tied to Artemis IV, currently on NASA’s long-term budget to not occur until at least 2028. It’s designed to fly with a bigger version of the Space Launch System rocket with more payload space that has yet to be constructed.
NASA announced it would detail Artemis mission updates during a press conference this Tuesday.
Gateway, which is planned to be about one-sixth the size of the ISS, will offer pressurized temporary living quarters about the size of a studio apartment, and act as a command center for lunar missions. It will feature docking ports for spacecraft like the Orion but also lunar landers and resupply craft.
The outpost is not meant for continuous human presence, but will have the power element as well as the eventual addition of a habitation space, capable of supporting four astronauts for 30 to 60 days.
For the UAE, which will also provide continued engineering support for Gateway, the airlock its providing will allow for crew and science to move from the station’s pressurized habitable environment into the vacuum of space. This will be the entry and exit point for astronauts to perform spacewalks such as maintenance on the station and allow for more deep-space science.
“The United States and the United Arab Emirates are marking a historic moment in our nations’ collaboration in space, and the future of human space exploration,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in the release. “We are in a new era of exploration through Artemis – strengthened by the peaceful and international exploration of space. The UAE’s provision of the airlock to Gateway will allow astronauts to conduct groundbreaking science in deep space and prepare to one day send humanity to Mars.”

EOVB5Q9BAX-256,Watch: Joe Biden heckled during speech on Israel,Rozina Sabur,"January 8, 2024 at 3:03 PM·2 min read",20240108,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-heckled-during-speech-israel-210352837.html,"Joe Biden defended his stance on Israel on Monday as a major campaign speech by the US president was disrupted by hecklers calling for a ceasefire.
Mr Biden, 81, said he had been “quietly” working with the Israeli government to reduce their military action and “get out of Gaza”.
His speech at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, had been billed by the president’s aides as his second major event to kick off his 2024 re-election bid.
But it was disrupted by protesters chanting “ceasefire now”. They were escorted from the venue as Mr Biden’s supporters tried to drown out the chants with shouts of “four more years”.
Mr Biden said: “I understand their passion and I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza”.
The Democratic president is facing mounting pressure from his party’s Left flank over his position on the conflict as the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues and the Palestinian death toll grows.
Mr Biden vowed to staunchly support Israel during its military operation against Hamas following the terror attacks of October 7 last year.
However, he has since repeatedly called on Jerusalem to avoid civilian casualties, warning recently that the Jewish state risked losing global support by “indiscriminate” bombing.
The Middle East conflict has exposed a fissure in the Democratic Party over its stance on Israel.
The divide largely runs along generational lines, with younger, more progressive Democratic officials and voters questioning US military support for Israel and criticising the plight of civilians in Gaza.
Mr Biden was addressing the congregation at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Church, where nine black parishioners were shot to death by a white supremacist in 2015.
The president’s appearance in South Carolina came after he encouraged the Democratic National Committee to change the party’s presidential primary calendar to put it first.
The southern state’s large black voting base revived Mr Biden’s struggling campaign in 2020, and African American voters will be critical to his hopes of retaining the White House this November.

7JJG2FREJB-259,5 Cultural Experiences To Have In Libya,Jasmine Osby,"December 25, 2023 at 1:30 AM·3 min read",20240109,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/5-cultural-experiences-libya-173000931.html,"Located in North Africa, Libya is a desert country with a history dating back over a thousand years ago. The majority of Libya is in the Sahara desert, creating a unique style of architecture, culture, and living that is unlike other African countries. Over the years, the country has been wrecked by political havoc and violence. However, some traveling adventurers in Africa have been able to explore some of Libya’s cultural wonders.
With such an expansive past, Libya is home to some of the oldest cities in the world. In recent years, there’s been a rise in graffiti artists with spray painted murals down the street from ancient mosques. Despite its muddied history, Libya has many rich cultural experiences that showcases its Saharan beauty and importance in history.
One of the most well-preserved ancient ruins in Africa, Leptis Magna is a historic city to visit when in Libya. The UNESCO World Heritage Site was formerly a great Roman city. Emperor Septimus Severus was born there and it was one of the country’s most beautiful cities. The city has since fallen to ruin. However, remnants of its greatness are still visible. There’s a large basilica, a giant theater, and marble columns all overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.
Old Town Ghadames City is a true sight. The city’s white walled buildings almost look like sand castles creating one the oldest of the oldest Saharan towns. Historians call the city “the pearl of the desert” and the Libyan city is an early example of an urban desert settlement. Ancient Islamic architecture styles can be found throughout Old Town Ghadames. Travelers will find the city about 6 hours from Tripoli.
The fish market in Tripoli is a great place for travelers to experience authentic Libyan culture. There’s a variety of vendors selling every type of fish and seafood imaginable.The prices are extremely low and everything is fresh. Some travelers said the smell was a bit overwhelming initially. But the low costs, bargain culture, and fresh daily catch made the experience exciting and fun.
During Gadaffi’s rule, graffiti and street art were illegal. However, during the Libyan Civil War, more street artists rose up and took to the streets to express frustration with the political regime. Travelers can find multiple murals throughout the streets of Tripoli depicting change and revolution. Another example of Hip Hop culture on international shores, the graffiti art in Libya showcases both country’s creativity and cultural history.
With Libya being a historically Muslim country, travelers will find many beautiful mosques throughout its desert landscape. While not all of them allow visitors to enter, just seeing the exterior of most of them is enough for those seeking cultural experiences. While in Tripoli, consider visiting both the Al-Majidya and Gurgi Mosques. For an example of an ancient, Libyan mosque, visit the Atiq Mosque in Ajdabiya."

UR3W2IK6QS-261,Alaska flight incident reveals another feature Boeing didn't inform pilots about,Alex Daugherty,"January 9, 2024 at 11:38 AM·2 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/alaska-flight-incident-reveals-another-173842251.html,"The cockpit door aboard last week's troubled Alaska Airlines flight surprised the flight crew by swinging open seconds after the fuselage suffered a potentially catastrophic rupture, according to the chair of the federal agency investigating the incident.
National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said during a news briefing Monday that the cockpit doors flew open immediately after the paneled-over exit door popped off of the fuselage. A flight attendant had to try three times to get it to close again, Homendy said.
“The cockpit doors flew open immediately and at this point the flight attendant in the forward portion of the aircraft was standing. The cockpit door flew open, hit the lavatory door,” Homendy said. “The lavatory door got stuck. She did attempt to shut the door three times, it eventually shut but it did blow open during the explosive decompression.”
Homendy's revelation echoes criticism heaped on Boeing during earlier probes of another in the 737 MAX line of planes, the MAX 8, in which pilots said they were not properly trained on a flight control system on board the plane that was implicated in two deadly crashes overseas. In 2020, pilots were required to undergo new simulator training and training for erroneous angle of attack sensor malfunctions as part of the plan to put the 737 MAX back into service.
“It’s another round of Boeing not telling pilots about an airplane detail, which erodes the trust relationship and more importantly it narrows the safety margin.” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots from American Airlines.
Homendy said that Boeing would make changes to its MAX 9 manual to make clear that the doors are designed to open.
In June, the FAA announced it will require a secondary barrier between the passenger cabin and cockpit of new commercial planes that are manufactured starting in the summer of 2025.

The Jerusalem Post wrote that it is still unclear whether the explosion was caused by a technical error or an explosive device.
Since the start of the Israeli ground offensive in Gaza at the end of October, 185 servicemen and women have been killed and more than a thousand others have been injured, according to military figures.
And 519 servicemen and women have been killed since the October 7 attacks when Hamas militants and other groups launched a bloody raid on Israel, killing 1,200 and kidnapping around 240.
Israel responded with massive airstrikes and a ground offensive which have killed more than 23,000 people and injured tens of thousands more, according to the Hamas-controlled health authority.

UK Oil & Gas (UKOG) had applied to explore a site in Dunsfold, in Mr Hunt's South West Surrey constituency.
The application had been approved by the government, despite it twice being refused by the local Tory council and opposition from Mr Hunt.
The Court of Appeal has now refused permission to appeal the decision.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Hunt said: ""I am bitterly disappointed to learn that the Court of Appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the UKOG planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold.
""I stand ready to provide my assistance and support to local communities in any way possible going forwards.""
The Liberal Democrats, the main challenger in the south of England seat, urged the Chancellor to intervene on the project.
The party's environment spokesman Tim Farron called it a ""shameful outcome"".
""This Conservative Government's policies have resulted in greedy gas barons ripping up the Surrey Hills,"" he said.
""They have railroaded this through the courts despite local outrage at the plans.""
Stephen Sanderson, UKOG chief executive, said: ""We are pleased that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has once again dismissed the legal challenge to our project and has confirmed that its planning consent is entirely lawful, as the company and its counsel has maintained.""
He said the project would be ""beneficial to local and national level energy"" and in keeping with national ""net zero strategies"".
Jennine Walker, from Good Law Project which helped bring the legal challenge, said: ""This is an extremely disappointing outcome.
""With the doors left open to UKOG to go ahead with rolling its drilling rigs through Dunsfold, we could now see huge impacts on the local environment, landscape and businesses.""

The alert, three days ahead of a pivotal presidential and parliamentary election, came as China is increasing balloon flights over the island. It raised additional concerns that Beijing was trying to exert influence over an island it considers a breakaway province it threatens to retake by force.

The incident took place shortly after 3 p.m. local time after an unannounced satellite launch by China.
“The trajectory unexpectedly flew over and went exoatmospheric when the vehicle was above Taiwan’s southern airspace,” the MND said in a tweet. “The air raid alert system was activated in the form of text messages to inform the public. The default English message was not revised and therefore incorrectly stated the launch vehicle as ‘missile.’ The MND extends an apology for any confusion this may have caused.”

After the launch, China’s official Xinhua news agency said a satellite named Einstein Probe (EP) was sent into space by a Long March-2C carrier rocket at 3:03 p.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province.

The misidentified Taiwanese alert raised anew concerns that Beijing was seeking to exert undue influence over the island nation of 23 million.
Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu was giving a press conference to dozens of foreign reporters Tuesday as the shrill alert sounded on mobile phones in the room, Reuters reported. He described the launch as part of a pattern of harassment towards Taiwan, like the recent cases of Chinese balloons spotted over the island.
""All these kinds of tactics are classified as grey-zone activities, (and) continue to remind the people here in Taiwan that there is a danger of war between Taiwan and China,"" he told reporters. ""With these kinds of threats against Taiwan I think we should be clear-eyed, we should not be provoked.""

It is worth noting that Chinese ballistic missiles, which can have similar flight profiles as space launch rockets, at least early on, are a top threat to Taiwan and allied interests throughout the entire region and could rain down on targets during the opening stages of a conflict.
As we reported yesterday, China appears to be ratcheting up the scale of its balloon flights in the skies over Taiwan.
For the past month, the MND has reported instances of Chinese balloons flying over the highly strategic Taiwan Strait. They were initially sporadic flights and remained off the coast. However, there has been a recent surge in activity, with balloons now passing over Taiwan itself.
The MND said it detected three Chinese balloons over the Taiwan Strait on Sunday and claimed all three flew over the so-called Median Line in the Strait, with one reported to have crossed the southernmost tip of the island. That followed a situation Saturday when the MND announced two Chinese balloons had been detected in the previous 24 hours, with one briefly flying over the northern-most tip of Taiwan.
You can see those warnings from the MND below.

The Median Line serves as a de-facto boundary between Taiwan and the mainland. While crossing the median line is not an uncommon occurrence, as we have discussed in the past, the regularity of such flights, mainly by crewed aircraft and drones, continues to cause concerns. Beijing does not acknowledge the existence of the Median Line.
The increase in balloon flyovers comes as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft have dramatically increased the number of flights over the past two years into Taiwan’s self-created Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). That’s a large swath of airspace that covers the island and reaches far into the mainland. There were 110 such sorties in November 2023, a more than four-fold increase from July 2021, according to figures reported by NPR.
PLA aircraft and warships in the Taiwan Strait, and increasingly around the island itself serve as a near-continuous reminder of the scale of the threat that the island faces were Beijing to launch a military operation against it. So too have short-range ballistic missile launches over the island.
In the air, these activities have ranged from large-scale maneuvers by PLA aircraft around Taiwan, including training drills with the live firing of missiles and other weapons and even a virtual blockade, down to incursions by small drones over Taiwan’s outlying islands, some of which have been shot down.
All this has caused tensions to mount, with the false alert becoming a campaign issue on Tuesday.
Taiwan outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen was at a campaign event for her Democratic People's Party (DPP) in the southern city of Kaohsiung. She looked at a mobile phone and said ""this is a satellite, not a missile - don't worry,"" Reuters reported, citing the official Central News Agency.
https://twitter.com/Focus_Taiwan/status/1744638423988830398
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang Party (KMT) criticized the alert, saying it had misled the public.
Whether this false alarm plays a role in Saturday's election that pits the independence-minded DPP against the more reconciliatory KMT remains to be seen.

0M31EHDHD3-267,Company tied to 'quality guru' Perry Johnson at center of massive medical data breach,"Paul Egan, Detroit Free Press","Updated January 9, 2024 at 2:32 PM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/company-tied-quality-guru-perry-162136141.html,"LANSING — A Michigan millionaire politician who calls himself the ""quality guru"" is facing a raft of corporate lawsuits over a massive medical data breach.
The suits, including one filed Friday in federal court in Detroit, have been brought against Perry Johnson & Associates Inc., a health care consulting and medical transcription firm.
The company is registered in Nevada but has offices in Troy at the world headquarters of Perry Johnson Inc. — the firm headed by Perry Johnson, of Bloomfield Hills, who ran unsuccessfully as a 2022 Republican candidate for governor of Michigan and as a 2024 candidate for president. Johnson said during a Friday taping of the WKAR-TV public affairs program ""Off the Record"" that he is still interested in becoming governor of Michigan.
Johnson, who spent more than $20 million of his own money on the two bids for elected office, campaigned as a ""quality guru,"" but was one of several candidates kicked off the Michigan primary ballot after election officials found large numbers of forged signatures in his nominating petitions. Criminal charges are pending against principals of firms hired to collect signatures for Johnson and others.
Now, a privately held company that bears Johnson's name has been targeted in a cyberattack that has compromised the medical and other personal data of close to 10 million people around the U.S., according to The HIPAA Journal, an online publication that specializes in news related to the federal health privacy law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
The proposed class-action filed in Detroit on behalf of a New York woman, alleges the breach was the result of the company's ""failure to secure and safeguard (her) and millions of other individuals' personal identifying information."" The company failed to ""implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices,"" the suit alleges. It says the Perry Johnson & Associates servers that were breached are located in Michigan and it makes claims for negligence and unjust enrichment.
Elizabeth Giannone, a spokeswoman for Johnson, said Tuesday he has no comment on the data breach or the lawsuits ""at this time."" The receptionist at the Nevada office of Perry Johnson & Associates directed questions to an email address, but there was no response to an email sent Monday. A message left for Johnson Monday at his Troy office was not returned. Perry Johnson & Associates was among the Johnson companies featured in a 2022 Bridge Michigan feature about Johnson, during his campaign for governor.
Several other lawsuits were filed earlier, in Nevada and elsewhere, records show. Johnson is not named personally as a defendant in the lawsuits.
Perry Johnson & Associates discovered the data breach in July but did not report it to the federal government until November, according to statements from the company.
The breach affected Northwell Health, which is New York's largest health system, as well as medical facilities in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Ohio. No medical facilities in Michigan have been connected to the breach.
The company said in a November news release that compromised information could include names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, hospital account numbers, admission diagnoses, dates/times of service, Social Security numbers, insurance information, and medical and clinical information such as diagnostic testing results. No credit card information, bank account information, or usernames and passwords were part of the data breach, the company said.
The release said the company confirmed there was unauthorized access to its network from March 27 to May 2 of last year. The company notified its clients about the breach in July before notifying the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Nov. 2, the release said.

3LMB95M5UO-268,"Corporate landlord raised tenants’ rent too much, suit says. $3.7M settlement reached",Julia Marnin,"January 9, 2024 at 11:30 AM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/corporate-landlord-raised-tenants-rent-173000745.html,"A corporate landlord raised the rent for 1,900 homes in California by too much and broke the law in doing so, according to a lawsuit filed by the state’s Department of Justice.
Now Invitation Homes, which oversees about 12,000 rental homes in California, has agreed to settle the case for more than $3.7 million, California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office announced in a Jan. 8 news release.
From October 2019 through December 2022, tenants living in rentals owned by Invitation Homes saw their rents increase by more than what is allowed under two state laws — the California Tenant Protection Act and California’s price-gouging law, according to the lawsuit.
Some tenants’ rent rose by more than 10% after proclamations of state emergencies were issued, a complaint says. This violates the price-gouging law.
Fires, winter storms, droughts, a heat wave, Tropical Storm Kay and an earthquake in Humboldt County prompted state emergency proclamations between 2020 and 2022. No proclamations were listed for 2019 by the state governor’s Office of Emergency Services.
As part of the proposed settlement, Invitations Home has refunded or credited tenants more than $1.68 million, according to the attorney general’s office. This accounts for the extra rent that was paid and 5% interest.
The corporation will also pay $2.04 million in civil money penalties, the office announced.
“Californians are facing a housing crisis of epic proportion,” Bonta said in the news release. “California has laws in place to protect tenants from sudden, large rent increases, and landlords need to be diligent in ensuring that they abide by those laws.”
By agreeing to settle the case, Invitation Homes does not admit or deny wrongdoing, according to a stipulated judgment signed by both parties Jan. 4 and filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
“We are pleased to reach an expeditious and mutually favorable agreement on this matter with the California Department of Justice,” an Invitation Homes spokesperson told McClatchy News on Jan. 9. “We continue to stand proud of our overall business, and in this case, our transparency, timely cooperation, and active engagement with the Department.”
“Notably, this matter highlights the company’s proactive audits and self-directed remediation, much of which occurred prior to receiving any inquiry from the California Department of Justice,” the spokesperson said.
When Invitation Homes realized some of the issues involving rent increases, it “promptly provided remediation to affected tenants,” Bonta’s office said.
The company describes itself as the nation’s largest home leasing company and owns nearly 80,000 homes in the U.S.
The California Tenant Protection Act was established in 2019 to protect tenants from certain rent increases.
According to the law, property owners cannot raise “the gross rental rate for a dwelling or unit more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living, as defined, or 10%, whichever is lower, of the lowest gross rental rate charged for the immediately preceding 12 months, subject to specified conditions.”
As for California’s price gouging law, “cities and counties may have more stringent rent caps that landlords must follow,” the attorney general’s office said.
Invitation Homes must adjust its rental rates for Californians as part of actions it’s required to take under the proposed settlement.
Any rent increases proposed by the company must be reviewed to ensure it complies with state laws, according to the attorney general’s office.
In the U.S., California ranks second for the states with the highest average monthly rent with an average of $1,958, according to a November 2023 Forbes report citing August 2023 rental market data from Apartment List. Hawaii ranked as number one.
Rent nationwide began to skyrocket in 2021 after the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and peaked in July 2022, CNN Business reported in June. At the time of the report, rent decreased since July 2022 but was nearly 25% higher than rent in 2019.

ID9ZZSNT3S-269,David Cameron worried Israel may have broken international law in Gaza,"Sam Francis - Political reporter, BBC News","January 10, 2024 at 4:06 AM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/david-cameron-worried-israel-may-200608448.html,"Lord David Cameron has said he is ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza.
The foreign secretary said he regularly consulted government lawyers over incidents in the war, but refused to say whether the legal advice suggested Israel had acted illegally.
Lord Cameron stressed the government had not changed its support for Israel.
Since the outbreak of war following Hamas' attack on 7 October, over 23,000 Palestinians have been killed.
The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 59,000 Palestinians have been injured.
Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?
Israel says war expected to continue throughout 2024
Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages.
Israel is also fighting a claim from South Africa that it is committing ""genocidal"" acts in Gaza at the International Court of Justice.
Lord Cameron said he did not agree with South Africa's claim.
Speaking during his first grilling by MPs since joining the House of Lords, the former prime minister said: ""I don't think that is helpful, I don't agree with it, I don't think it's right"".
During a tense exchange with SNP MP Brendan O'Hara, Lord Cameron said he has seen things ""deeply concerning"" during the crisis but did not directly criticise the country's actions.
He called on Israel to allow in more humanitarian aid and restore water supplies to northern Gaza.
But Lord Cameron repeatedly side-stepped questions on whether he had seen legal advice suggesting Israel had breached international law, telling the foreign affairs committee ""I don't want to answer that question"".
He said: ""If you're asking me am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law because this particular premises has been bombed or whatever?
""Yes, of course I'm worried about that, and that's why I consult the Foreign Office lawyers when giving this advice on arms exports.""
But he hinted that government lawyers had not suggested international law had been broken. He told MPs the legal advice he had seen was ""consistent with the fact we have not changed"" rules on exporting weapons to Israel.
Tory MP Bob Seely put it to Lord Cameron that he had seen legal advice suggesting the Israeli government is ""vulnerable to a challenge from the Hague court and from elsewhere that in some of the things they are doing in, potentially, in relation to proportionality, there is a vulnerability.""
""It's close to that,"" Lord Cameron replied.
Downing Street later said Israel needs to ""act carefully"" and avoid risking further escalation in its war with Hamas.
Asked if Rishi Sunak shares Lord Cameron's concerns about whether Israel has been acting within international law, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""It is an issue we continue to keep under review and obviously we have made our views clear to the Israeli government at a number of levels on this.""
The spokesman added: ""Fundamentally, though, we recognise that it is Israel that is responding to a terror attack, first and foremost.""
Two British nationals are still being held hostage by Hamas as heavy bombardment and fighting continues to shake the region, Lord Cameron told the committee.
Asked if he knew if the hostages are alive, Lord Cameron said: ""I just don't want to say any more. We don't have any information to share with you.""
During a ceasefire in November, 105 hostages were released by Hamas.
Lord Cameron's comments come as US secretary of state Antony Blinken held talks in Israel seeking to set a plan for Gaza's post-war future.
Mr Blinken has called for winding down of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza to reduce regional tensions.
US officials have called for the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to take over in Gaza and for negotiations to resume on the creation of a Palestinian state."
FZHX9SS59N-270,Former UK opposition leader Corbyn to join South Africa's delegation accusing Israel of genocide,GERALD IMRAY,"Updated January 10, 2024 at 10:24 PM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/former-uk-opposition-leader-corbyn-222244411.html,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Former U.K. opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn will join a South African delegation for this week’s hearings at the International Court of Justice, where the country accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in the war in Gaza, the South African government said Tuesday.
South Africa brought the case against Israel last month, accusing it of intending “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza,” and asked the U.N.'s top court to order Israel to halt its attacks. Israel rejected South Africa's allegations of genocide “with disgust” and said it will defend itself at the court.
South Africa's Justice Ministry said Corbyn was one of a number of “senior political figures from progressive political parties and movements across the globe” who will join the South African delegation at the Hague in the Netherlands for two days of preliminary hearings which begin on Thursday.
Corbyn was the only one of those foreign political figures in its delegation named by the South African government.
Corbyn's leadership of the left-of-center Labour Party in Britain was stained by allegations of antisemitism. He is a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause and a fierce critic of Israel. He was suspended from the Labour group in Parliament in 2020, and later barred from running for the party after Britain’s equalities watchdog found party officials had committed acts of “harassment and discrimination” against Jews and said anti-Jewish prejudice had been allowed to spread within Labour under his leadership.
Corbyn expressed support for South Africa's case against Israel on Monday and criticized the British government in a message posted on X, formerly Twitter.
""Every day, another unspeakable atrocity is committed in Gaza,"" he wrote. “Millions of people around the world support South Africa’s efforts to hold Israel to account. Why can’t our government?”
U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that Britain stands by Israel as it wages war on Hamas in response to the group's surprise Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, when Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians.
Earlier Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed the case filed by South Africa against Israel, calling the allegations “meritless” and saying they distract from efforts to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Israel’s assault in Gaza has killed more than 23,200 Palestinians, roughly 1% of the territory’s population, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. About two-thirds of the dead are women and children. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
South Africa's delegation to the Hague will be led by Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola and will also include senior figures from the office of President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Ministry of Justice, the Justice Ministry said in a statement.
“We are determined to see the end of the genocide that is currently taking place in Gaza,"" Lamola said.
Justice Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri delivered a separate statement on video naming the South African delegation while wearing a red and white checkered Palestinian keffiyeh scarf around his neck.
South Africa is not a global diplomatic heavyweight but its decision to open a case against Israel is a reflection of its historic support for the Palestinians that dates back to the days of the late anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
Mandela compared the plight of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank with that of Black South Africans under the apartheid system of forced racial segregation in his own country, which ended in 1994. South Africa has for years referred to Israel as an “apartheid state.""
South Africa's ruling African National Congress party remains a strong supporter of the Palestinians. Last month, Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, an ANC lawmaker, hosted Hamas officials at a conference in South Africa and invited them to a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his grandfather's death.
The South African Jewish Board of Deputies said it was “disgusted” by the presence of Hamas in South Africa.

Attal was appointed Prime Minister on Jan. 9, 2024. Credit - Christian Liewig— Corbis/Getty Images
Emmanuel Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as France’s youngest ever Prime Minister on Tuesday, after previous Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne announced her resignation on Monday.
Attal is also the first openly gay person to hold the job, making his selection a historic first in multiple categories. He has a civil partnership with Stéphane Sejourné, a French Member of the European Parliament.
Attal previously served as France’s education minister, where he instituted new performance metrics to measure children’s academic performances and implemented a controversial ban on Abayas in schools.
His appointment comes months before the European Parliament elections in June.
According to an IPSOS poll that was released in December, Attal is the French politician with the highest approval rating. He has rapidly climbed the ranks of French politics over the past 10 years, starting out as an obscure advisor in the health ministry.
“When I appointed [Gabriel Attal] as education minister, I knew he had the necessary energy and courage for the task,” Macron said during a TV interview in December. “I’m proud to have nurtured new talents.”
But experts say Attal will grapple with the same challenges as his predecessor. That includes a resurgent right that looks set to make gains in the June European Parliament elections and the lack of a majority in the French parliament that makes enacting Macron's agenda difficult.
Macron has also seen his own popularity decrease in the last year and a half, after mass protests erupted over his pension reform plans and members of his own centrist Renaissance party vehemently opposed an immigration bill he hoped to pass.
The French President has a 30% approval rating, according to Politico's poll of polls.

According to a new filing from a co-defendant in the Trump case, Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade, her alleged partner, to prosecute Trump and benefited financially from the relationship in the form of vacations the two took using funds that his law firm received for working the case.
TOP TRUMP PROSECUTOR, GEORGIA DA ALLEGED TO BE IN 'IMPROPER' ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP: COURT FILING
But also embedded in the filing are invoices for the Law Offices of Nathan J. Wade. One invoice calls attention to ""Fulton County District Attorney’s Office.""
Wade billed the county for a May 23, 2022, event described as ""Travel to Athens; Conf with White House Counsel."" Wade charged $2,000 for eight hours at $250 an hour.
Several months later, Wade billed for ""Interview with DC/White House"" on Nov. 18, 2022. Wade again charged $2,000 for eight hours at $250 an hour, according to the documents.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
The subject of the meetings remains unclear.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
""Fani Willis’ alleged romantic partner/special prosecutor coordinated with the White House while building the political prosecution of Donald Trump,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., posted on X in reaction to the filing Tuesday. ""All on the taxpayer dime.""
""It has become increasingly clear that the Biden White House is directing these baseless, political prosecutions against President Trump because they know they cannot beat him fair and square at the ballot box,"" MAGA Inc. spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""This latest news about Fani Willis is disturbing yet sadly unsurprising.""
Meanwhile, Fulton County records show Wade has been paid nearly $654,000 in legal fees since January 2022, an amount authorized by the district attorney, which is Willis in this case.
The revelations come as part of a motion that was filed on behalf of former Trump campaign official Michael Roman, a co-defendant in the case, in a bid to have the charges against him dismissed.
It cites ""sources close to both the special prosecutor and the district attorney"" as confirming ""they had an ongoing, personal relationship.""
The filing also calls for the entire district attorney's office, including Willis and Wade, to be disqualified from prosecuting the case.
In August, Willis charged Trump out of her investigation into his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state. Trump was charged with one count of violation of the Georgia RICO Act, three counts of criminal solicitation, six counts of criminal conspiracy, one count of filing false documents and two counts of making false statements.
Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Roman, alongside Trump, was hit with a racketeering charge as part of Willis’ case and was charged with seven felony counts last August.

8ETO4IM728-273,Gabriel Attal becomes France's youngest PM as Macron seeks reset,Elizabeth Pineau and Yiming Woo,"Updated January 9, 2024 at 11:59 PM·4 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/frances-macron-name-pm-launches-090738742.html,"By Elizabeth Pineau and Yiming Woo
PARIS (Reuters) -Gabriel Attal promised to be bold and act fast to help the middle class weather the rising cost of living, after President Emmanuel Macron, seeking to breathe new life into his second term, on Tuesday made him France's youngest ever prime minister.
The appointment of Attal, 34, a popular and media-savvy rising star of French politics, signals a desire by Macron to move beyond divisive reforms and improve his centrist party's chances in European Parliament elections in June.
""Dear @GabrielAttal, I know I can count on your energy and your commitment to implement the project of revitalisation and regeneration that I announced,"" Macron wrote on social media after appointing Attal, a close ally and former minister and government spokesman.
Widespread public discontent over surging living costs and last year's contested pension reform have seriously hit Macron's ratings, and his chances in the EU ballot, where his party trails badly behind Marine Le Pen's far-right.
""I'm well aware of the context in which I take on this job,"" Attal said.
""Too many French doubt our country, doubt themselves or our future. I think in particular of the middle class ... who get up every morning to go to work ... and sometimes can't make ends meet,"" he said, promising to work to ""control our destiny and free up France's potential"".
Shorn of a working majority in parliament, Macron has battled to push through his second-term reform agenda, and is now set to focus on more consensual objectives such as aiming to reach full employment.
Attal has polled as one of France's most popular politicians in recent months. A Macron loyalist, he became a household name as government spokesman during the COVID pandemic and earned a reputation as a smooth communicator.
Macron, 46, and Attal have a combined age just below that of Joe Biden, who is running for a second term in this year's U.S. presidential election.
""The youngest president in (France's) history is appointing the youngest prime minister in (France's) history. I want to see it as a symbol of audacity,"" said Attal, who is also the country's first openly gay prime minister.
MORE DYNAMIC, OR MORE OF THE SAME?
Attal replaces Elisabeth Borne, 62, only the second woman to hold the prime minister role in France. A dutiful and hard-working technocrat, her year and a half in office was marked by months of protests over the pension overhaul and riots over the police shooting of a teenager of north African descent.
Macron and Attal may take several days to name a new government. An Elysee aide said the usual Wednesday cabinet meeting was unlikely this week.
In recent weeks Macron, who has struggled to deal with a more turbulent parliament since being reelected in 2022, had signalled that it was time for change.
Some voters seemed to welcome that.
""I think it's very good to have a young person .. because it's a different concept, it's more dynamic,"" said 81-year-old retiree Remi Blondel.
However others were sceptical, with opponents - and some voters - saying not much would change, as Macron takes on the bulk of decision-making himself.
""What can the French hope for from this fourth Prime Minister and this fifth government in seven years? Nothing,"" said Le Pen.
Attal is ""young"" and ""fits nicely into the frame. But beyond that what does the reshuffle change for us? Personally, not much,"" Parisian Sophie Varillon said.
MP Patrick Vignal, who belongs to Macron's Renaissance party, praised Attal, who he said was ""a bit like the Macron of 2017"", referring to the point at which the President first took office as the youngest leader in modern French history, at the time a popular figure among voters.
Attal ""is clear, he has authority"", Vignal said.
The reshuffle is likely to intensify the race in Macron's camp to succeed him in the next presidential election in 2027, with former prime minister Edouard Philippe, Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire all seen as potential candidates - alongside Attal.

The Democratic lawmaker called on fellow House members to enact new legislation to address gun violence, after her own cousin was shot and killed during Friday's deadly shooting spree in Forest Park.
""Not one of us know the day or hour. It happened to our family on Friday, it could happen to yours tomorrow,"" Rep. Scott told lawmakers during her remarks on the House floor.
""I stand here today to say to you all gun violence is real. It is real, and it is time for Georgia to come together, have a conversation and do something about the violence we see going on every day in all of our communities.""
Brandon Harris, 43, was the victim of a random attack.
Police say he died after being shot by 33-year-old Victor Demetrious Baymon.
The suspect reportedly followed his ex-girlfriend to a tax office where Harris was preparing her taxes, and opened fire, killing him.
""Brandon was a good father.  He had four kids,"" Scott told FOX 5's Deidra Dukes.
""His 11-year old's birthday was Friday, something that young man is going to have to live with the rest of his life.  He was excited knowing his dad was coming home, knowing they were going to have a party and celebrate,"" she said. ""But, the celebration turned into sorrow.""
Scott is a gun owner. She said Georgia has good gun laws on the books, but believes state lawmakers must do more to address the deadly gun violence plaguing our communities.
""It's time for Georgia to step up to the plate and do something about this gun violence,"" Scott said. ""We must come up with common sense gun legislation.""
Rep. Scott said she will introduce gun legislation in coming weeks."
AQPX6062SH-275,Hong Kongers in Taiwan firmly support the ruling party after watching China erode freedoms at home,KANIS LEUNG and JOHNSON LAI,"January 9, 2024 at 9:07 AM·6 min read",20240109,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hong-kongers-taiwan-firmly-support-010721191.html,"HONG KONG (AP) — As Taiwan’s presidential election approaches, many immigrants from Hong Kong, witnesses to the alarming erosion of civil liberties at home, are supporting the governing Democratic Progressive Party.
Beijing’s crackdown on dissent in the financial hub has cemented their preference for a party committed to preserving Taiwan’s de facto independence and democratic values ahead of Saturday's vote.
While Taiwanese immigration policies have been less welcoming than some from Hong Kong anticipated, most remain steadfast in their support for the DPP, largely due to the party’s firm stance on autonomy from Beijing, according to interviews with 10 Hong Kongers, over half of whom moved to Taiwan after 2019 anti-government protests.
In Taiwan, citizenship is required to be eligible to vote in a presidential election. Foreigners would need to live in Taiwan for at least five consecutive years to gain citizenship. That requirement drops to three years if they are married to a Taiwanese citizen.
Many Hong Kong people choose to use migration strategies that can fast-track the process and allow for citizenship eligibility within a shorter time frame, including through programs for investors and graduates of Taiwanese universities.
Hong Tsun-ming, a protester who feared arrest and moved to Taiwan in 2019, said he looks forward to having a taste of deciding its fate. The election is a cherished voting opportunity he never had in Hong Kong, where the chief executive is picked by a predominantly pro-Beijing committee. He plans to support the DPP.
Hong has thrown himself into local politics, committed to sharing lessons from Hong Kong.
“It’s to remind Taiwan not to follow the old path of Hong Kong,” said Hong, member of the pro-independence Taiwan Statebuilding Party, which did not field candidates in the presidential race.
Following Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, Taiwan has stood out as a haven for free speech and liberties in the Chinese-speaking world. Over the last three years, tens of thousands of Hong Kongers have migrated to the self-ruled island, many dismayed by the rapid erosion of freedoms that had been promised to remain intact for 50 years in the former British colony after returning to Chinese rule in 1997.
As these immigrants establish new lives in Taiwan, some confront a reality tinged with frustration. Taiwan's concerns over security risks posed by China, which views the island as a renegade province, have complicated application procedures. That has resulted in residency denials for some, particularly those who worked in government-funded entities or companies with strong ties to Chinese businesses. The opacity and protracted process of securing permanent residency have also drawn criticism.
From January 2020 to November 2023, over 37,100 Hong Kongers secured temporary residency, Taiwan's National Immigration Agency reported. Just 5,700 others obtained permanent residency.
Alvin Tam, a first-time voter in the presidential election, was “a bit” disappointed with the DPP-led government after discovering the obstacles his fellow Hong Kongers face in Taiwan. But Tam, a forest therapist who settled in 2018, acknowledged the political factors involved.
He said national security and economic policy direction are his top considerations in voting for a president, and that led him to support the DPP’s ticket of Vice President William Lai and his running mate Bi-khim Hsiao, the former Taiwanese representative to the United States.
“Given our deep-seated resentment stemming from the troubles back home, I can’t see myself supporting any political party that is close with China,” he said.
Taiwan, with a population of 23 million, has never been governed by the People’s Republic of China. But the mainland’s ruling Communist Party insists on unification with Taiwan, by force if necessary.
China has warned that “'Taiwan independence' means war."" Still, many Taiwan residents are undisturbed by that threat.
The DPP, which favors maintaining de facto independence, has led opponents in most polls. Its primary competitor, the Nationalist Party — also known as the Kuomintang or KMT — concurs with Beijing that both sides belong to a single Chinese nation. Another opponent, the smaller Taiwan People’s Party, has advocated resuming dialogue with China.
New immigrant Catherine Lui is unfazed by China's bellicose talk. Lui moved to Taiwan through an investment immigration scheme in 2022, seeking greater freedoms. She was impressed by President Tsai Ing-wen’s support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement in 2019 and found resonance with the DPP’s commitment to democracy and freedom.
Four years ago, Tsai leveraged the Hong Kong protests as an argument against the “one country, two systems” framework that China uses to rule Hong Kong and has suggested for Taiwan. The turmoil in Hong Kong, 720 kilometers (450 miles) away, fortified Tsai’s campaign and played a significant role in her re-election.
Although Lui is not yet eligible to vote, she plans to support Lai by attending his campaign rally in Taipei and has been exploring the island's vibrant political culture.
“If someone doesn’t like Tsai Ing-wen, people are free to use very harsh words,"" she said. “That's impressive.""
Bennis So, professor in the department of public administration at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, said even though the DPP has its imperfections, many new Hong Kong immigrants tend to favor the governing party, driven by concerns that the main opposition party’s immigration policies might be less favorable to them if it comes to power.
But the influence of Hong Kongers on the election outcome is likely to be limited as they make up a small percentage of the electorate, So said. Taiwan's total electorate is an estimated 19.5 million. Official data indicate that from 2015 to 2022, 10,440 immigrants from Hong Kong and the neighboring casino hub of Macao have secured voting rights.
Some from Hong Kong are already actively engaged in Taiwan's political landscape.
At 72, Chui Pak-tai, a former Hong Kong pro-democracy district councilor who secured Taiwan residency 11 years ago, is running for legislative office. Although he faces long odds, his campaign draws attention to the immigration challenges of the Hong Kong diaspora.
Chui was guarded about his choice for the presidential election. He spoke ardently, however, about the economic, political, and international relations expertise that Hong Kong immigrants can offer Taiwan. He also highlighted the shared need for willpower among Hong Kongers and Taiwanese in the face of Beijing’s pressure.
“Hong Kongers and Taiwanese have common needs,"" he said. “Even if it's just on a spiritual level.”

Source: Dmytro Kuleba on air during the national 24/7 newscast on 8 January, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Kuleba noted that according to the current European Council President Charles Michel, the European Union has another six months to elect Michel’s successor after he participates in the European Parliament elections.
Quote: ""You know, as my grandmother used to say, 'we survived hunger, we will survive abundance too' during those six months. Even if Orbán will assume those duties, he will also be the head of the European Union during that time, because of the Hungarian presidency. Well, we’ll just have to survive those six months,"" Kuleba said.
Kuleba emphasised that Kyiv has undertaken ""very intensive work"" on the European track and has a clear understanding of and a plan for ""where we’re going, who’s working with whom, what the decision-making schedule is, and how to advocate for certain decisions"".
""Unlike Russia, we’re all democracies and therefore we must be ready for the changes that can occur in any country at any time,"" Kuleba explained.
""Changes in other countries will never drive us into a stupor, panic, or confusion. Because we know that no matter the situation, we will still work to get what we need. And we will get it,"" Kuleba concluded.
Background: Over the weekend, European Council President Charles Michel announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections in June and leave his post early.
If EU leaders fail to quickly agree on Michel's successor under these circumstances, the European Council presidency will temporarily be assumed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who will hold the Council of the European Union presidency from July 2024 until December.

Y5LW7NOY74-277,Israel assassinates Hezbollah drone chief in air strike on Lebanon,Nataliya Vasilyeva,"January 10, 2024 at 3:34 AM·4 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-assassinates-hezbollah-drone-chief-203435321.html,"The head of Hezbollah’s combat drone operations has been killed by Israeli forces in a second high-profile assassination within 24 hours.
Ali Hussein Barji, who commanded the unit in southern Lebanon, was killed on Tuesday, Hezbollah said.
It came as Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, visited Israel to discuss plans for the future of Gaza once the war ends.
Barji’s car was targeted in an air strike on the town of Khirbet Selm where he had arrived for the funeral of Wissam al-Tawil, another senior Hezbollah commander, who was killed by a suspected Israeli strike on Monday.
The apparent assassination came hours before Hezbollah drones, believed to be under the command of Barji, hit an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base in Safed, eight miles from the Lebanese border.
Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute, said his reported assassination was “another notch up the escalation ladder”.
The IDF has not commented on the strike.
It came as Israel said on Tuesday that residents of more than 40 towns and kibbutzim evacuated from the north of Gaza will not be allowed back until hostilities had ended.
About 76,000 people have fled border areas in southern Lebanon to evade daily rocket attacks, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
Fears of a wider escalation between Israel and Lebanon grew last week when Saleh al-Arouri, a senior Hamas leader, was believed to have been killed in a drone strike on Beirut.
On Tuesday, Mr Blinken called on Israel to take greater steps to protect civilians, allow more aid into Gaza and work with moderate Palestinian leaders, saying regional countries would only invest in the reconstruction of Gaza if there is a “pathway to a Palestinian state”.
He also said he was “crystal clear” that Palestinians must be able to return to their homes “as soon as conditions allow”.
Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, told Mr Blinken that increasing pressure on Iran would be critical to “prevent regional escalation in additional areas”.
Like other Israeli officials, Mr Gallant did not give any indication that there was an end in sight to its military campaign which has already claimed more than 23,000 lives in Gaza.
Israel is set to intensify its operation in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis until it roots out Hamas leaders and frees all hostages captured in an unprecedented cross-border attack on Oct 7, Mr Gallant told Mr Blinken.
Israeli officials are coming under increasing pressure to rescue 136 hostages still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Before he reached Israel Mr Blinken said four key Arab nations and Turkey had agreed to start planning for the reconstruction and governance of Gaza once Israel ends its military campaign.
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey would contribute to “day after” scenarios for Gaza, he said, while also expecting concrete steps towards creating a Palestinian state, something that prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is opposed to.
About 85 per cent of Gaza’s population – 1.9 million people – have been internally displaced, and now most live in intensely overcrowded temporary accommodation in the enclave’s south, according to the UN.
On Tuesday, Israel agreed to allow a UN delegation into northern Gaza to evaluate the damaged infrastructure and map out what is needed for the return of the displaced residents, according to the Axios news website, citing talks between Mr Blinken and members of the Israeli war cabinet.
Mr Blinken reportedly stressed the need to allow Palestinians to return to their homes in the north of Gaza, something that Israel has pushed back against, claiming that the security situation on the ground does not allow it.
Israeli officials also reportedly said they want to see progress towards a new hostage deal before Gazans from the north are allowed to return home.

OWPE9RS2GX-278,ISW: Western air defense and missiles crucial for Ukraine,Abbey Fenbert,"January 8, 2024 at 9:49 PM·2 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/isw-western-air-defense-missiles-054929060.html,"The continued provision of Western air defense systems and missiles is essential as Russia finds new ways to breach Ukraine's air defenses, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote in its Jan. 8 report.
Russian forces launched a series of devastating aerial attacks against Ukraine in recent days, targeting residential areas and civilian infrastructure with missiles and drones. Although Ukraine bolstered its air defenses ahead of an anticipated difficult winter, Kyiv has called for greater air defense support from allies in light of the recent attacks.
ISW analysts said that Russia and Ukraine are engaged in a technological race for air superiority, constantly adapting their air defense systems and long-range strike capabilities to match the other side.
""The inclusion of Western-provided air defense systems into Ukraine’s air defense umbrella has been essential to Ukraine’s ability to defend against Russian missiles, particularly ballistic missiles,"" the ISW wrote.
Ukraine's Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said on Jan. 2 that Ukraine downed a record number of Russian Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles using U.S.-designed Patriot air defense systems.
The ISW said that Ukraine needs continued short-term and medium-term shipments of military aid, particularly defense missiles, in order to protect its growing defense-industrial base from Russian attacks.
Ukraine hopes to scale up domestic weapons production this year, partnering with international manufacturers to produce its own tanks, ammunition, and air defense systems. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 27 that Ukraine had tripled its production of arms and equipment in 2023.
Delays in Western aid also raise fears that the Ukrainian military will run out of essential equipment.
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan convened industry leaders in the defense and technology sectors at the White House on Jan. 8 to speak with senior administration officials on potential battlefield innovations for Ukraine.
Officials said that much of the conversation focused on air defense capabilities, but warned that the U.S. needs to secure funding for Ukraine before it can move forward with these developments.

Alsop, 67, was music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from 2007-08 through 2020-21, the first woman to lead a top-level American orchestra. She agreed to a three-year term with the Philadelphia Orchestra starting with a 2024 tour of China, the organization said Tuesday. She will conduct it for two or three weeks per season.
Alsop debuted with the orchestra in 1990 and has led it 32 times. Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Philadelphia Orchestra's music director since 2012-13, reached out to her along with the orchestra's management. She said the orchestra had long put aside its reputation for a heavy string sound, developed when Eugene Ormandy was music director from 1936-80.
“It's a much different organism that when I first conducted them,” she said. ""They're super-flexible. They're super-engaged. They're super-enthusiastic,
She is in her fifth season as chief conductor of the ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and her first season as chief conductor of the Polish National Radio Symphony and as principal guest conductor of London’s Philharmonia Orchestra. She began in 2020 as the chief conductor of the Ravinia Festival, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Alsop is to make her Metropolitan Opera debut in April leading the company debut of John Adams' “El Niño.”
In 2005, she received a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant.”"
2EJ5X4N93Q-280,MP: Ukraine's latest draft law doesn't include provisions for female conscription,Olena Goncharova,"January 8, 2024 at 5:47 PM·1 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/mp-ukraines-latest-draft-law-014700109.html,"The recent military mobilization draft legislation in Ukraine will not involve the conscription of women or implement a lottery system, Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, said on air. This announcement comes a day before the security committee's scheduled vote on the bill.
""I can say for sure that there will be no lottery (for conscription), there will be no mobilization of women, there will be no property census. In fact it is unconstitutional, there should be no such thing,"" Cherniev said. ""There will be no unconstitutional positions.""
Following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, tens of thousands of men volunteered to join the fight for Ukraine in the initial months. However, enthusiasm has diminished over the 22 months since, leading President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to contemplate the introduction of a new draft law.
Proposed changes on tightening restrictions on draft evaders and outlining plans for further conscription and have faced public criticism. The Ukrainian parliament's Anti-Corruption Policy Committee also noted on Jan. 8 possible corruption risks in the government's mobilization bill.
The officials did not specify what were the exact flaws of the bill but promised to provide the information at a later date.
The Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence has been examining the suggested modifications to the bill since last week. On Jan. 9, it will either endorse the proposed alterations or return the bill to the government for further revisions.

5U4JHKSL2D-281,Portland high school teacher describes finding sought-after door plug from the Alaska Airlines plane,Tom Costello and Dennis Romero and Gisele Lamarre and Hayley Walker,"Updated January 10, 2024 at 11:00 AM·4 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/portland-high-school-teacher-describes-072320834.html,"It took two days to find a door-shaped piece of a plane that was propelled into the air Friday evening when it detached from its host aircraft.
Bob Sauer, a high school teacher, said he hadn't found the panel, called a door plug, in his backyard sooner because he didn't look. On Sunday, he said, a neighbor suggested he check his property, but he took his time, eventually searching his backyard that night with a flashlight.
""It still didn't seem very likely to me,"" Sauer, who lives in the Portland, Oregon, area, said in an interview Monday evening.
He had followed the news of Friday's accident, when the door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max 9 that was filled almost to capacity with passengers.
The accident during the Alaska Airlines flight exposed a large opening in the fuselage and prompted the pilots to turn back to Portland International Airport for a safe emergency landing, they said. No major injuries were reported.
During his nighttime search, Sauer, who teaches physics, spotted something amid the trees he'd planted 20 years ago.
“I noticed against the back property wall underneath that line of cedar trees that I’d planted something gleaming and white,” he said. “I thought, that doesn't belong there. That’s not normal.”
He got closer, his heart thumping, and saw what it was. The door plug was nestled in the trees that appeared to have broken its fall.
""It was unbelievable that that thing that people had been looking for all weekend happened to be in my yard,"" Sauer said.
Sauer reached out to the National Transportation Safety Board, whose investigators — skeptical at first because an earlier find turned out to be just a fluorescent light fixture — asked him for a photo. That confirmed it was America’s most-wanted piece of jetliner fuselage.
NTSB personnel were at Sauer's home first thing Monday morning to take possession of the panel.
""We picked it up this morning, brought it back to begin the examination of the door plug itself in relation really to the plug surround structure,"" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in an interview earlier Monday.
It was being sent to the agency's laboratory for a deeper, microscopic look at its materials, fasteners and condition, she said.
The door plug, which acted almost as a cork would on sparkling wine, popped and led the cabin to depressurize explosively, she said.
It happened at 5:12 p.m., about six minutes after takeoff from Portland International Airport, the NTSB said. The Alaska Airlines flight was only about 14,800 feet in the air, en route to a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet.
The aircraft carried 171 passengers and six crew members, as it headed to Ontario, California, with only a few seats left empty, including the two next to the door plug. Headrests flew away, and frames were torqued on two seats, Homendy said.
Door plugs are used to cover gaps in the fuselage where emergency exits would go if a plane had a greater passenger capacity.
The panels are held in place with specific fasteners and sealed, in part, with the help of the cabin's normal pressurization, which allows planes to be habitable and circulate necessary oxygen so high in the sky.
What caused the door plug to blow out over the Portland area hasn’t been determined.
In an interview Monday, Homendy called the door plug “a really, really key piece of evidence.”
The NTSB had asked for anyone who discovered the door plug to report its location and send photos to the agency. As the NTSB predicted, the panel landed in the community of Cedar Hills, about 7 miles west of central Portland.
Two cellphones believed to belong to passengers were also found nearby, Homendy said.
“I want to start by thanking Bob,” Homendy said at a news conference Monday night, also expressing her gratitude to the community.
“Bob was apparently a star with all his students today,"" she said.
Sauer said he used the episode to demonstrate some elements of physics to students. But he said more time was initially spent at school Monday discussing his notoriety.
""By the time I got to school,"" he said, ""pretty much the whole school knew about it.""
Homendy said the agency offered to send personnel to Sauer's class for a presentation on how the NTSB conducts such investigations to help make travel safer.
But Sauer said he turned down the offer: ""If it wasn't finals week, I would have tried to take them up on that.""

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan arranged the meeting, which lasted five hours and included key members of the National Security Council as well as executives from companies such as Fortem Aerospace, Palantir Technologies, and drone producer Skydio.
The meeting aimed to promote ""renewed emphasis on helping Ukraine overcome these key technological challenges that they have identified as inhibiting their progress and momentum on the battlefield,"" senior administration officials told reporters.
Another senior official detailed the specific areas of technological need the leaders discussed.
""The conversation focused on a number of systems, including unmanned aerial systems, how to counter incoming unmanned aerial systems, and then also addressing the demining challenge,"" the official said.
Sullivan attended parts of the meeting himself, while his deputy Jon Finer led a portion of the event.
Officials said after the meeting that the conversation was a chance to learn about state-of-the-art systems from a cross-section of U.S. industries. The U.S. government hopes it can bring these new capabilities to Ukraine's battlefields.
The officials also pointed out that little progress can be made unless Congress unblocks the billions of dollars in supplemental funding that President Joe Biden has requested for Ukraine. The aid package remains tied up in partisan battles over U.S. border and immigration policy.
The Jan. 8 meeting was not part of the December agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine to increase weapons production, officials said.
Ukraine's Lieutenant General Serhii Naiev warned in November 2023 that the war could expand beyond the country's eastern and southern regions if Russia continued to improve its technology capacities.
Naiev told ABC News that technological strength outweighs how many munitions each side has.

The Justice Department announced that Murat Kurashev, 36, a Russian national who resided in Sacramento, pleaded guilty on Monday to attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. The FBI arrested Kurashev after a federal grand jury handed down the single-count indictment on Feb. 18, 2021.
According to court documents, Kurashev attempted to provide financial support to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is designated by the Secretary of State as a foreign terrorist organization that engages in terrorism in Syria.
Between July 2020 and February 2021, Kurashev was accused of using money transfer services to send approximately $13,000 to two known couriers for an HTS fundraiser. Federal prosecutors say records obtained from the money transfer services documented multiple transactions from Kurashev to the couriers in Turkey, usually in increments of $1000.

The couriers retrieved the funds often within 24 hours of transfer, prosecutors said. Surveillance footage from money transfer businesses captured Kurashev during some of the transactions, according to the DOJ. Prosecutors said social media and encrypted mobile messaging discussions between Kurashev and the fundraiser made clear that Kurashev was fully aware of the fundraiser’s violent extremist ideology and participation and work on behalf of HTS.

Kurashev stated that he wished he could join the fight in Syria as a mujahideen and regretted that he could only provide financial support. As their conversations showed, Kurashev and the fundraiser believed that providing money in support of the HTS fighters ""was tantamount to being engaged in violent jihad,"" U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert's office said.

According to court documents, Kurashev followed the fundraiser’s online presence and various social media accounts, which included solicitations for money to purchase military equipment, boots, clothing, firearms, and, in one case, a motorcycle. Forensic analysis of Kurashev’s Apple iCloud account revealed it to be replete with violent extremist content, including a video depicting HTS fighters, according to the Justice Department.
Kurashev is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller on March 18, 2024. He faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an American think tank in Washington, D.C., Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, HTS or the ""Organization for the Liberation of the Levant,"" traces its beginnings to the outset of the Syrian civil war and has remained a dangerous opposition force throughout the duration of the conflict.

In May 2018, HTS was added to the State Department’s existing designation of its predecessor, the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The think tank says that HTS retains a Salafi-jihadist ideology despite a public split from al-Qaeda in 2017.

But her conviction was only overturned last year.
Stuart Munro, who represented Ms Sinclair, said: ""Were other people prosecuted following that information becoming available?
""Ultimately, why has it taken until 2023 for the first convictions in Scotland to be overturned by the appeal court?""
The Crown Office said that they aimed to ensure ""all miscarriages of justice resulting from unreliable evidence obtained from the Horizon system are identified and overturned"".
Deputy Crown Agent Kenny Donnelly said: ""COPFS estimates up to 100 Scottish cases may be affected.
""This is lower than in England and Wales due to COPFS policy decisions made in response to awareness of the Horizon system issues, and the fact that all cases in Scotland were prosecuted by the procurator fiscal under the application of Scots criminal law.""
Kenny MacAskill, who was Scotland's justice secretary when the Crown Office first became aware of the possible problems, said that he had ""no recollections"" of any discussions with prosecutors or the Lord Advocate at the time.
He told BBC Scotland News: ""In the ether people were aware of issues, but matters were still proceeding and it was, to some extent, under the radar.
""I'm sure Crown officials would not ever seek to prosecute somebody who they knew to be innocent but we need to be assured that they started to make inquiries [into the concerns].""
Mr MacAskill added that the scandal was ""shameful"" and that there had been a ""conspiracy to silence"" those affected.
Dr Andrew Tickell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""The revelation that the Crown Office knew of problems is huge.
""Did they stop prosecuting? Did it occur to them that any of their cases before 2013 might now be unsafe because of these uncertainties?
""At the moment we know less about the Scottish dimensions of this scandal than we do about the rest of the UK.""
Dr Tickell said Scotland was ""just at the beginning"" of addressing the miscarriage of justice, while England and Wales were ""much, much further down the road"".
More than 700 people across the UK were convicted of crimes such as theft or embezzlement on the basis on information from a faulty IT system.
Speaking in Holyrood, Ms Constance said she was seeking talks with the UK government about how best to pardon those affected while ensuring that they remain entitled to compensation.
The justice secretary added that around 80 people in Scotland who may have been affected by the scandal have now been contacted by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).
So far 93 convictions have been overturned across the UK.
And on Tuesday it was confirmed that Paula Vennells, who was in charge of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019, is to hand back her CBE ""with immediate effect""."

Though Sweden's accession to NATO is not yet complete, the government has signaled it is ready to contribute to NATO deterrence and the defense of Baltic countries.
""Sweden and its neighbours are living in the direct shadow of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,"" Kristersson said.
""But Russia’s threats, disinformation and cyber attacks are an attempt to destabilize the whole of Europe.""
Kristersson said that Sweden was ready to ""provide ground combat units"" to defend the Baltic nations and that it planned to ""contribute a reduced battalion to the Canadian-led forces in Latvia"" next year.
Canada now commands NATO's battlegroup in Latvia. Battlegroups of about 1,000 troops were stationed in the Baltics after Russia's illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea in 2014.
Canada has said it hopes to double its forces in Latvia by 2026.
According to the Swedish news outlet DN, Sweden plans to send Latvia a mechanized battalion, consisting of around 800 soldiers as well as armored vehicles and combat cars. Sources told DN the unit should arrive in Latvia in early 2025.
Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds thanked Krsitersson in a post on the social media platform X.
""We are pleased with this important decision, which, together with the upcoming admission of Sweden to NATO, will become a significant investment in strengthening regional security and the defense of Latvia,"" Spruds said.

Kinmen, which lies 200 kilometres (120 miles) from Taiwan island but only seven kilometres from the Chinese mainland, was a battlefield frontline for the nationalists who fled to Taiwan in 1949, and the target of frequent bombardments up until 1979.
Now Kinmen residents are preparing to vote in a crucial presidential election on Saturday that is being watched closely from Beijing to Washington, and whose winner will set democratic Taiwan's course over the next four years.
""Xiamen, Kinmen -- their doors face each other,"" said Lin Ma-teng from his courtyard home on Lieyu, Kinmen's closest inhabited islet to China.
The southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen, which Lin refers to, is close enough to Kinmen to be clearly visible across the narrow strait.
""Big guns, small guns, they shell at each other,"" the 79-year-old former serviceman said.
""Thankfully, Kuomintang held Kinmen,"" he added, referring to the nationalists who today make up Taiwan's oldest political party.
One-time opponents of the Chinese Communist Party, Kuomintang (KMT) has evolved into a political bloc that today sees the economic fortunes of modern Taiwan linked to a close relationship with Beijing.
China has long claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, with President Xi Jinping -- who has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control -- describing ""unification"" as ""inevitable"".
- 'Already independent' -
For the majority of the island's 23 million people accustomed to democratic life, joining authoritarian China is unthinkable
In Taiwan's election, KMT candidate Hou Yu-ih is going up against Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has shaped its platform on sovereignty from China.
The previous vote in 2020 saw a historic landslide for the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen, who enraged China with her stance that Taiwan is ""already independent"".
Over Tsai's eight-year tenure, Beijing refused to engage with her government, ramping up tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
Besides sending in unprecedented numbers of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan, Beijing also staged two massive war games in recent years -- flying missiles to surrounding waters and simulating a blockade of the island.
These actions have upped global worries of a conflict, even if it is ""unlikely in the near term"", Amanda Hsiao of the International Crisis Group told AFP.
""The extent to which tensions will be kept under check in the next four years will depend on how the next president approaches defence reform, and manages relations with Beijing and Washington.""
- 'Future of democracy' -
China's bombardments of Kinmen only stopped in 1979 when the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing.
This is a position maintained today even as Washington becomes Taipei's most important ally and its key weapons provider.
Meanwhile, US-China relations have plummeted, with the two superpowers tussling over technology exports, spying concerns and human rights issues -- but also on the status of Taiwan.
Xi warned US President Joe Biden in November that Washington should ""stop arming Taiwan"" and ""support China's peaceful reunification"", while Biden in turn urged him to ""respect the electoral process"" of the democratic island.
Given its close historical ties to China and the proximity to the mainland, the majority of tiny Kinmen's residents support KMT.
But DPP enjoys broad support among the younger generations who do not identify as Chinese.
""I definitely won't support KMT,"" said 27-year-old Angela Huang, visiting on holiday from Taiwan's southwestern Tainan city.
""People are more aligned with KMT here because of all the ex-soldiers who live here... In (mainland) Taiwan, there's not really as many,"" she tells AFP.
Huang said she would definitely vote on Saturday but has still not decided between DPP and the smaller opposition Taiwan People's Party.
Taiwan ""remains the sole democracy in the Chinese-speaking world"", political scientist Wei-ting Yen of Franklin and Marshall College said.
""In an era marked by democratic backsliding... Taiwan's election is crucial as it exemplifies a thriving democracy in Asia.""
- 'Different political systems' -
Kinmen's wartime relics are popular attractions for Taiwanese tourists.
Visitors can watch uniformed staff re-enact a cannon ""firing"" at China, pose for selfies with abandoned tanks, and marvel at anti-communist slogans still painted on shophouses.
""Our existence is the Chinese people's hope,"" read one sign painted on a doorframe.
Across the water in the Chinese city of Xiamen, a crimson sign lit up at nightfall: ""One country, two systems unify China"".
Retired serviceman Lin said maintaining the ""status quo"" -- in which Taiwan neither declares independence nor becomes part of China -- is the best way forward.
""We are two different political systems after all. No matter how rich China has become... we don't admire that,"" he said.
""We would like things to stay the way it is.""

XAYNZUKH0M-287,Taiwan issues alert over China satellite as poll ramps up security fears,Amber Wang and Sean Chang,"January 9, 2024 at 6:24 PM·4 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-poll-frontrunner-hits-beijing-043058865.html,"Taiwan issued a national emergency alert on Tuesday as China launched a satellite, days before the self-ruled island holds a crucial presidential election that has heightened security worries.
The alert came hours after election front-runner Lai Ching-te, Taiwan's current vice president, accused Beijing of using ""all means"" to influence this weekend's poll, which will set the course of cross-strait ties for the next four years.
Phones across Taiwan blared with a ""presidential alert"" at about 3:15 pm (0715 GMT), around the time Beijing announced the successful launch of its Einstein Probe satellite, which it says will gather astronomical data.
""China launched (a) satellite which flew over the southern airspace,"" said Taiwan's alert in Chinese, urging the public to stay safe.
The English part of the message described it as an ""air raid alert"" warning of a ""missile flyover Taiwan airspace"", but officials said this was a mistranslation.
The defence ministry later apologised for the mistake, saying the default message in English had not been updated.
Foreign Minister Joseph Wu was giving a news conference about the elections when the alert message buzzed on mobile phones, interrupting his address.
He explained that the alert was issued because of possible falling ""debris"".
""When a rocket is openly flying in our sky, some of their tubes or debris will fall in this region,"" Wu told reporters.
He said the launch was part of a pattern of ""grey zone"" activities by Beijing aimed at intimidating Taiwan.
""With this kind of threat against Taiwan, I think we should be clear-eyed, we should not be provoked,"" Wu said.
- 'No illusions' -
Earlier Lai warned voters to have no illusions about China maintaining peace, but said that he would keep the door open for exchanges with Beijing if he takes power.
Saturday's election will be closely watched from Beijing to Washington as voters choose a new leader to steer the island in the face of an increasingly assertive Beijing.
China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, rejecting the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's stance that the island is ""already independent"".
Beijing has maintained a near-daily military presence around Taiwan -- with four Chinese balloons moving across the sensitive median line on Monday, the latest in a series of incursions that Taiwan and conflict experts say is a form of ""grey zone"" harassment.
Lai said that while China interferes in ""every election in Taiwan"", the latest efforts are the ""most serious"".
""In addition to political and military intimidation, (it is using) economic means, cognitive warfare, disinformation, threats and incentives,"" he told reporters.
""It has resorted to all means to interfere with this election.""
- Hong Kong warning -
President Tsai Ing-wen, who is leaving office after reaching the two-term limit, won a landslide in the last election in 2020.
She was carried to victory by the Taiwan public's fears of becoming like Hong Kong, which had seen Beijing crack down on dissent by implementing a national security law after city-wide protests for greater freedoms.
Under her administration, Beijing has refused all high-level communications with Tsai and ramped up political and military pressures against Taiwan.
Lai said Tuesday that ""as long as there is parity and dignity, Taiwan's door will always be open"" for exchanges and cooperation with China under his leadership.
""But we cannot have illusions about peace. Accepting China's 'one-China' principle is not true peace,"" he said, referring to a Beijing doctrine that Taiwan is a part of China.
""Peace without sovereignty is just like Hong Kong. It is a false peace.""
Touting deterrence as a main defence policy, Lai said the DPP's ""pursuit of peace relies on strength, not on the goodwill of the aggressor"".
""The goodwill of invaders cannot be relied on -- if you look at Tibet and Xinjiang in the past, or Hong Kong today, these are all good examples,"" Lai said.
His opponents on Saturday include Hou Yu-ih, a former police chief and mayor with the Kuomintang (KMT), a party which has long encouraged closer cooperation with China.
Hou has said that Lai -- who has previously dubbed himself a ""pragmatic worker for Taiwan's independence"" -- represents a danger to cross-strait relations.

443VIRLOZZ-288,Taiwan presidential candidate Lai says he is willing to reopen talks with China,CHRISTOPHER BODEEN,"January 9, 2024 at 12:13 AM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-presidential-candidate-lai-says-081339920.html,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s leading presidential candidate William Lai said Tuesday he hopes for a reopening of dialogue with China following almost eight years of Beijing’s near-complete refusal to communicate with leaders of the self-governing island it considers its own territory.
But Lai told reporters he would continue the current administration’s policy of maintaining democratic Taiwan’s de-facto independence in the face of Chinese Communist Party threats to annex it by political, military or economic means. China demands that Taiwan's leadership concede its claim of ownership over the island before reopening contacts.
“While aspiring for peace, we harbor no illusions,” Lai said at a news conference ahead of Saturday's polls for the presidency and legislature. “We will build up Taiwan’s defense deterrence, strengthen Taiwan’s capabilities in economic security, enhance partnerships with democracies around the world and maintain stable and principled leadership on cross (Taiwan) Strait relations.”
“Our door will always be open to engagement with Beijing under the principles of equality and dignity. We are ready and willing to engage to show more for the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Peace is priceless and war has no winners,” Lai said.
Lai, currently Taiwan's vice president, is broadly seen as the front-runner in the election to succeed President Tsai Ing-wen, who is barred by law from running for a third term. Most polls show him well ahead of the main opposition Nationalist Party, or KMT, candidate Hou You-yi, who favors eventual unification with China under its own terms, and the alternative Taiwan People's Party's Ko Wen-je, who has also pressed for renewed dialogue with China and the avoidance of confrontation with Beijing.
Voters will also choose a new legislature, where the DPP will seek to hold on to its majority, largely based on its handling of the economy, public welfare and employment opportunities for young people. Skyrocketing housing prices, a declining birth rate and a yawning gap between the super wealthy and working class are also playing into voter sentiments.
Looming over the election has been China's steadily increasing pressure on Taiwan through barring it from major international gatherings, wooing away its diplomatic allies to just a handful, and offering financial inducements to politicians — from the grassroots to top opposition figures who could influence the vote or promote policies increasing Chinese access to the the island's economy.
The People's Liberation Army sends ships and warplanes on daily missions around Taiwan and the island's Defense Ministry has reported a growing number of balloons crossing over from China. The balloon incidents recall the incursion last year of a Chinese balloon that flew over Canada and the U.S. and was eventually shot down by the U.S. Air Force. China claimed the aircraft was a weather balloon that had been blown off-course, but the U.S. said it was carrying sophisticated intelligence-gathering technology.
Over the past 24 hours, the ministry reported four Chinese balloons had passed over the island, while 10 warplanes and four warships had entered airspace and waters near the island, part of a campaign to wear down morale and military resilience. The Defense Ministry said it had monitored China's movements, scrambling jets, dispatching ships and activating coastal missile systems.
Taiwan has been boosting its defenses with new weapons purchases from the U.S. and has expanded national service for men to one year from four months. Those have become contentious issues in the coming election, with Lai and the DPP accusing the KMT of blocking new defense spending, possibly as part of an arrangement with Beijing to gradually hand over control of the island, which split from the mainland amid civil war in 1949 and has never been controlled by the People's Republic of China."
N4UNJ55IOU-289,Taiwan’s ruling party candidate slams Beijing for ‘serious’ meddling in elections,Karina Tsui,"January 10, 2024 at 1:06 AM·2 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-ruling-party-candidate-slams-133453797.html,"Insights from Nikkei, the Financial Times, and Focus Taiwan
Taiwan’s ruling party candidate William Lai accused Beijing of unprecedented interference in the self-governing island’s upcoming elections.
At a press conference on Tuesday, the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Lai, who is also vice president of Taiwan, said that China’s election meddling was its “most serious ever,” accusing Beijing of using “military threats, economic coercion, cognitive warfare, and misinformation” to manipulate voters.
Lai’s remarks came on the same day Taiwan issued an alert over a Chinese satellite that had flown over the island’s southern airspace. Beijing has in recent years ramped up military exercises around Taiwan, which it claims to be part of its territory.
Lai’s comments echo a toughening in Taiwan’s already strong stance against Chinese interference in the island’s matters. Earlier this week the Taiwanese defense ministry said Beijing’s deployment of balloons ahead of the pivotal Jan. 13 vote was “an attempt to use cognitive warfare” to intimidate Taiwanese people. And in a weekend campaign rally, Lai, viewed as a separatist by Beijing, told voters that China was using warships, warplanes, and fake news to “divide voters.” The vice president later warned that if a Beijing loyalist was elected president, there would be “no democracy in Taiwan,” and that the island would “become like Hong Kong.” Lai’s top opponent, Hou Yu-ih of the nationalist Kuomintang party, did not deny Chinese intimidation ahead of the elections but accused the DPP of provoking war by calling for Taiwanese independence.
Taiwanese researchers said that, for the first time, Beijing’s efforts to influence voter perception have been observed both online and in person. One Taiwanese criminologist, who is also running as a parliamentary candidate for the DPP, said that some social media accounts were hacked during the election campaign and used to spread fake news stemming from Chinese accounts, the Financial Times reported. Separately, last week Ma Chih-wei, an independent candidate running in concurrent parliamentary elections was detained and held incommunicado on charges of allegedly taking more than $32,000 in campaign financing from Chinese Communist Party members, with the requirement that she bring home details about Taiwanese intelligence, Focus Taiwan reported."
XJ79HOG85K-290,The US and UK say Bangladesh's elections extending Hasina's rule were not credible,JULHAS ALAM,"January 9, 2024 at 10:41 AM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/us-uk-bangladeshs-elections-extending-024154180.html,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — The United States and the United Kingdom said the elections that extended Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s rule were not credible, free and fair.
Both countries, which have trade and development ties with Bangladesh, also condemned political violence that preceded Sunday's election in which Hasina’s party won more than two-thirds of the parliamentary seats while turnout was low and the main opposition party boycotted.
“The United States remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day. The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated,” State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller said from Washington.
He urged Bangladesh's government to credibly investigate reports of violence and hold those responsible accountable.
The U.K. said the democratic standards were not met consistently in the lead-up to the election.
“Democratic elections depend on credible, open, and fair competition. Respect for human rights, rule of law and due process are essential elements of the democratic process. These standards were not consistently met during the election period. We are concerned at the significant number of arrests of opposition party members before polling day,” the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in the statement.
The U.S. statement said it remains “committed to partnering with Bangladesh to advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, to supporting human rights and civil society in Bangladesh, and to deepening our people-to-people and economic ties.”
Bangladesh is an important partner of the U.S. interest in the Indo-Pacific region along with neighboring India amid growing influence of China.
China, Russia, India and some other countries congratulated Hasina for the victory and pledged to continue to partner with the South Asian nation.
The statements came after Hasina said at a news conference Monday that the elections were free and fair.
Her ruling Awami League won 222 seats of 299 contested. Independent candidates took 62, while the Jatiya Party, the third largest, took 11 seats and three smaller parties got 3 seats. The result in one seat remained undeclared. The election of one seat was postponed because a candidate died.
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and its allies boycotted the election, and voter turnout was a low 41.8%. While election day was relatively calm, a wave of violence preceded the vote.
Zia's party said more than 20,000 supporters had been arrested since Oct. 28 when an anti-government rally turned violent in Dhaka. The government disputed the figures and said arrests were for specific charges such as arson and vandalism.
Bangladesh has a history of political violence, military coups and assassinations. Hasina and Zia governed the country alternately for many years, cementing a feud that has since polarized Bangladesh’s politics and fueled violence around elections. This year’s vote raised questions over its credibility when there are no major challengers to take on the incumbent."
1RSJQS9Z20-291,The U.S. Is Done In Iraq,Daniel DePetris,"January 10, 2024 at 3:50 AM·5 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/u-done-iraq-195024059.html,"U.S. officials ritualistically tout their respect for Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but the fact is that every U.S. president over the last 33 years has bombed Iraq in one way or another. The 1991 Gulf War occurred during George H.W. Bush's administration. Bill Clinton authorized several rounds of airstrikes against Iraqi military facilities, including a four-day bombing campaign in December 1998. George W. Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq in 2003 sucked hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops into a nearly decade-long morass. Barack Obama brought U.S. troops back to Iraq in 2014 after the Islamic State arrived at the gates of Baghdad, while Donald Trump continued the military campaign throughout his term.
President Joe Biden, too, has taken military action in Iraq during his first three years as president. Approximately 2,500 U.S. troops are stationed in several large bases across the country, ostensibly tasked with the ""enduring defeat"" of ISIS. U.S. special operators partner with their Iraqi colleagues to capture and kill ISIS leaders, planners, and facilitators. The U.S. military has also taken unilateral action against Shia militias that have lobbed attack drones and rockets toward U.S. bases on a regular basis since mid-October. On January 4, the U.S. killed Abu Taqwa, a senior commander of the Harakat Al Nujaba militia, in the heart of Baghdad.
The Iraqi government responded with fury to that airstrike in particular, blasting the U.S.-led coalition for violating the agreement governing the U.S. military's operations on Iraqi soil. Days later, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani, who a year ago insisted Baghdad still needed a U.S. military presence, pledged to form a committee to boot U.S. forces out.
The conventional wisdom in Washington, D.C. is to shudder with fright at the news. But for those who have long believed the U.S. military presence in Iraq had lost its utility, two words sum up the development: good riddance.
First, we should be clear about one thing: while ISIS is still around, its capacity to plan and execute large-scale terrorist attacks is severely degraded. ISIS no longer controls any territory in Iraq (or Syria, for that matter), which means the group has lost its ability to tax people living under its thumb. The decline in financial resources, combined with the constant targeting of ISIS commanders and the Iraqi army's growing capabilities, translates into a low pace of attacks from the group (less than 20 per month, according to the Pentagon's inspector general for the counter-ISIS mission in Iraq and Syria). Attacks that do happen are unsophisticated, against targets of opportunity, and typically take place in remote areas where the Iraqi state has long had trouble extending its writ. Whatever support base ISIS once possessed is gone, replaced instead with millions of angry Iraqis who have first-hand experience with ISIS's brutal rule and no intention of letting the organization reemerge as a viable pseudo-state actor.
Despite all this, successive U.S. administrations continue to argue that Washington's job isn't done. Before he retired as the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, Gen. Frank McKenzie predicted that U.S. forces would be in Iraq for years. The Biden administration apparently agrees with this assessment. During a bilateral security committee meeting with Iraqi defense officials last summer, the Defense Department said in a joint statement that both delegations ""reaffirmed their commitment to developing Iraq's security and defense capabilities and determination to deepen security cooperation across a full range of issues to advance our countries' shared interest in Iraq's security and sovereignty, and in the stability of the region.""
Parse the cookie-cutter language, however, and one can see just how maximalist all of these objectives really are. If the U.S. is prefacing a withdrawal from Iraq on the stability of the region, then it either doesn't really want to leave Iraq in the first place or does, but only in the most ideal of circumstances. Either way, the result is the same: a perpetual U.S. military mission with little return on investment.
If U.S. troops weren't dealing with so much risk in the meantime, perhaps advocates of a long-term U.S. military deployment in Iraq would have a halfway decent case to make. But this isn't the reality our troops are dealing with. Iranian-backed militias have attacked U.S. forces more than 115 times since October 17. Some of the militias launching these attacks are technically a part of the Iraqi state. Fortunately, fatalities have been avoided thus far. Even so, the danger is of such sufficient gravity that President Biden authorized a few rounds of precision airstrikes in retaliation. Defense Department assertions that these strikes are having a deterrent effect on these militias don't pass the laugh test for the simple reason that the drone and missile attacks keep coming. U.S. pressure on the Iraqi government to get the militias under control (CIA Director William Burns reportedly warned the Iraqi prime minister of ""harsh consequences"" if the militias couldn't be reeled in) isn't working either. That shouldn't be a surprise; the only reason Al Sudani is in the prime minister's office is because the Coordination Framework, which represents the militias' interests in the Iraqi government, supported him.
U.S. policymakers, therefore, have a choice to make. They can continue the status-quo policy, which amounts to being a willing hostage to an indefinite mission and carrying on with the delusion that any Iraqi prime minister has the power to do much of anything about the militias. Or they can finally admit that the U.S. has succeeded in doing what it set out to do—eliminating ISIS's proton-state—and extricate the U.S. military from a mess only the Iraqis have the ability to clean up.

OZLBVGXKH8-292,Ukraine's Culture Ministry releases updated statistics on cultural monuments damaged by Russia,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 9, 2024 at 10:10 AM·2 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-culture-ministry-releases-updated-161020614.html,"Ukraine's Ministry of Culture and Information Policy (MCIP) released updated statistics on Tuesday (9 January) on Ukrainian cultural monuments that have been damaged or destroyed since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Between 24 February 2022 and 25 December 2023, a total of 872 cultural heritage sites were destroyed or damaged in 17 oblasts of Ukraine, the MCIP reported.
The government body specified that these included 120 monuments of national significance, 682 of local significance, and 70 newly discovered ones.
Among the damaged and destroyed sites, 279 are architectural monuments; 255 architecture and urban planning objects; 203 historic sites, 33 architecture and history monuments; 19 monumental art objects; 17 urban planning and monumental art objects; 18 archaeological sites; 38 architecture and urban planning objects; 38 historic artifacts; 5 urban planning objects, 2 science and technology objects, 1 unit of landscape art, 1 architecture and urban planning or monumental art object, and 1 architecture or monumental art object.
The ministry says the monuments have been damaged or destroyed by the Russians in 17 oblasts:
In Kharkiv Oblast – 216 (including 10 of national importance)
In Odesa Oblast – 119 (including 28 of national importance)
In Donetsk Oblast – 111 (including 12 of national importance)
In Kherson Oblast – 86 (including 12 of national importance)
In Chernihiv Oblast – 70 (including 27 of national importance)
In Kyiv Oblast – 69 (including 16 monuments of national importance)
In Zaporizhzhia Oblast – 38
In Lviv Oblast – 33 (including 2 of national importance)
In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast – 32 (including 1 of national importance)
In Luhansk Oblast – 30
In Sumy Oblast – 25 (including 5 of national importance)
In Mykolaiv Oblast – 22 (including 3 of national importance)
In Khmelnytskyi Oblast – 10 (including 1 of national importance)
In Vinnytsia Oblast – 4 (including 1 of national importance)
In Poltava Oblast – 4 (including 1 of national importance)
In Zhytomyr Oblast – 2 (including 1 of national importance)
In Kirovohrad Oblast – 1
The MCIP is constantly updating data on damage or destruction of cultural heritage sites caused by the full-scale war that Russia has unleashed.
Earlier, Kateryna Chuieva, former Deputy Culture Minister, noted that the exact figures of damaged sites would be available only after the war is over: ""We will see the full picture only after the war ends and only after most of the war zones are cleared of mines and become directly accessible to researchers. To date, we can examine and fully document mainly those sites located in the liberated territories and relatively far from the line of fire.""
UNESCO also keeps its own statistics on damaged cultural sites in Ukraine. In early August last year, it released a list confirming the damage to 274 cultural sites since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.

Ukraine's recent attacks on Russian targets over occupied Crimea seem to be weakening Moscow's air defenses, leaving key areas open to more attacks, new British intelligence suggests.
Last week, the Ukrainian Air Force said it successfully hit the Saki military airbase on the western part of the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula.
The Ukrainian air strikes on enemy targets at the Saki airfield and the Crimean port city of Sevastopol have ""highly likely degraded the awareness and coverage of Russian air defenses over the Crimean region,"" the UK's Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence report on Tuesday.
""This once again demonstrates the ineffectiveness of Russian air defenses in protecting key locations, despite their enhanced preparedness,"" UK intelligence said.
In response to the latest Ukrainian assault on the military airbase, Russia launched missile attacks across Ukraine, targeting several cities including Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia, the British intelligence noted.
""The scale of the Russian response is likely indicative of the level of success achieved by the Ukrainian armed forces' actions"" during the strikes last week, the UK's Ministry of Defense said.
Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs, said Saturday in a post on X that the Ukrainian Air Force was ""carrying out methodical work aimed at destroying the occupiers' control system in Crimea.""
""Over the past few days, the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has carried out a number of successful attacks on enemy targets in the still-occupied Crimea,"" Gerashchenko said.
He said the attack on the Saki airfield targeted the command post.
Gerashchenko described the Saki airbase as ""a first-class military airfield in Crimea, which hosts the Nitka training complex for training deck aviation flight crews.""
Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russian forces downed four Ukrainian missiles over Crimea as well as six anti-ship missiles over the Black Sea.

VOSQZCC9ET-294,UK's Cameron says he's worried Israel may have breached international law in Gaza,Reuters,"January 10, 2024 at 12:27 AM·2 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/uks-cameron-says-hes-worried-162731514.html,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister David Cameron said on Tuesday he was worried that Israel might have breached international law in Gaza, and that the advice he had received so far was that Israel was compliant but there were questions to answer.
Asked during a question-and-answer session with lawmakers if Israel could be vulnerable to a challenge at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague over whether their actions were proportionate, Cameron said the stance was ""close to that.""
Britain has backed Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas attacks but also called on its military to show restraint and act within international law in its offensive in Gaza that has laid waste to much of the Palestinian enclave.
Cameron did not directly answer lawmakers about whether he had received legal advice that Israel might have broken international law, but said some incidents had raised questions over whether there had been breaches.
""Am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law, because this particular premises has been bombed, or whatever? Yes, of course,"" Cameron said as he took questions from parliament's foreign affairs committee.
Cameron said that there was always a ""question mark"" over whether a given incident broke international law, which lawyers would examine and then advise him over.
""The advice has been so far, that they (Israel) have the commitment, the capability and the compliance (with international law), but on lots of occasions that is under question.""
Amid growing international concern over the huge Palestinian death toll from the Israeli assault, as well as a deepening humanitarian crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged Israeli leaders to do more to avoid further harm to non-combatants and to protect civilian infrastructure.

K6AREZSBID-295,US and Chinese military officers resume talks as agreed by Biden and Xi,TARA COPP,"January 10, 2024 at 6:46 AM·3 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/us-chinese-military-officers-resume-224619594.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. and Chinese military officers have resumed talks that were frozen after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in the summer of 2022, a development U.S. officials have said is key to keeping the growing competition between the two great powers from turning into direct conflict.
During the deputy-level talks at the Pentagon, the two parties discussed setting future meetings between their military officers, including potentially scheduling a future meeting between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and newly appointed Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun.
Austin is currently hospitalized due to complications from prostate cancer treatment. He had not been scheduled to attend Tuesday’s meeting. Dong is a former naval commander who was appointed in late December after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed from office.
Li was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 for buying Russian weapons. After he was named the defense minister in March 2023, the U.S. did not lift the sanctions. No U.S. defense secretary has visited China since Jim Mattis visited in 2018.
The face-to-face meetings follow a call between Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his counterpart Gen. Liu Zhenli, several weeks ago, which marked the first senior military communications between the U.S. and China since August 2022.
China’s delegation at the meeting was headed by Maj. Gen. Song Yanchao, deputy director of the Central Military Commission for international military cooperation. He met with Michael Chase, the Pentagon’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan, and Mongolia.
While administrative in nature, the two-day talks do allow both sides to raise policy concerns. In a readout of the meeting, the Pentagon said that Chase talked about operational safety in the Indo-Pacific and the United States' commitment to “our longstanding ‘One China’ policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act,"" the Pentagon said in a readout of the meeting.
“The Department will continue to engage in active discussions with PRC counterparts about future engagements between defense and military officials at multiple levels,” the Pentagon said in the readout.
The agreement to resume the military talks was reached between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their summit in San Francisco last November.
In a briefing with reporters prior to the meetings, a senior U.S. defense official said while the resumption of the talks is a good sign, “we're clear-eyed” that significant differences remain between the two militaries, including the implications of China's movement toward a reunification with Taiwan, which could commit the U.S. to aid in Taiwan's defense. The official spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to provide details ahead of the meeting.
Pelosi's 2022 visit to Taiwan angered China because it claims the island as part of its territory and views visits by foreign government officials as recognition of the island’s sovereignty. She was the highest-ranking American official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.
For the past two years, the Pentagon has faced increased difficulty contacting the Chinese military as the number of intercepts between U.S. and Chinese aircraft and ships sharply rose. According to the Pentagon’s most recent report on China’s military power, Beijing “denied, canceled or ignored” military-to-military communications and meetings with the Pentagon for much of the past two years. The report warned that the lack of such talks “raises the risk of an operational incident or miscalculation spiraling into crisis or conflict.”"
3XDSZ8TQX0-296,US-China defense talks resume as two sides meet in Washington,Noah Robertson,"January 10, 2024 at 6:21 AM·2 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/us-china-defense-talks-resume-222141425.html,"WASHINGTON — Senior Chinese military officials visited Washington this week for two days of meetings with their American counterparts — the latest communication channel between the two nations to restart after more than a yearlong lapse.
The meetings — officially called the Defense Policy Coordination Talks, or DPCT — offered a chance for each country to share concerns and schedule other meetings throughout the year.
“They’re an opportunity for us to be frank and candid with the PRC about how we see the relationship and any concerns that we have,” said a senior American defense official, who spoke with reporters last week on the condition of anonymity.
Starting Jan. 8, the forum occurred for the first time since 2021, after China severed military talks following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. China’s government considers Taiwan a rogue province that will one-day reunite with the mainland.
Since then, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has grown more aggressive around the Taiwan Strait and across the region. In the last two years, PLA jets have buzzed past American aircraft some 180 times, according to the Pentagon. Whereas Chinese ships and planes used to carefully avoid crossing the midline between the mainland and Taiwan, since Pelosi’s visit they now regularly do so.
This change in behavior added to the urgency with which Pentagon officials called for the two militaries to start talking again.
President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed while meeting in San Francisco late last year to resume senior-level military communications. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown officially reopened talks after speaking with PLA Gen. Liu Zhenli, his Chinese counterpart, in December.
This week will be the 17th DPCT, which has historically been held annually, alternating between Beijing and Washington.
On the American side were Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia Michael Chase, leading a team mostly made up of Pentagon officials. Major Gen. Song Yanchao, the Deputy Director of the China’s Central Military Commission’s Office for International Military Cooperation, will lead the Chinese delegation.
A quarter of the meetings focused on scheduling other talks while the rest covered policy, the official said.
In a readout, the Pentagon said that the delegations discussed operational safety, the war in Ukraine, recent behavior from North Korea and U.S. policy toward Taiwan, among other topics.
The next channel to resume will likely be the U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings, during which the two countries’ navies discuss operating near each other safely, the official said.
Despite the talks restarting, the official acknowledged China has a history of cutting off communication to signal displeasure, and there’s nothing preventing that from happening again.
“We’re … clear-eyed about the prospects in that respect,” the official said."
JR9SL2GAIT-297,U.S.-Russian citizen arrested on drug charges in Russia,Patrick Hilsman,"January 10, 2024 at 3:56 AM·1 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/u-russian-citizen-arrested-drug-195604313.html,"Jan. 9 (UPI) -- A dual national of Russia and the United States has been arrested on drug charges, according to a Moscow court.
""The district court of Moscow chose a preventative measure against a U.S. citizen,"" the court press service said in a Telegram post Tuesday.
The court said Robert Woodland Romanov, 32, was arrested for ""illegal acquisition, storage, transportation, manufacture, processing of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues.""
Romanov was born in Russia but adopted by an American couple when he was 2 years old. In 2020 Romanov relocated to Russia where he got in touch with his biological mother.
In a September 2022 Facebook post, Romanov said he did not support Russia's war in Ukraine but would fight if he were to be drafted.
""For those who are worried about my safety out here in Russia, with the current situation and the draft to military service. I'm currently ok. I have not received letter yet,"" Romanov wrote, ""if my letter arms comes, I will not turn away.""
Russia has detained a number of U.S citizens in recent years, including WNBA player Brittney Griner, who was detained in April 2022 before being exchanged for convicted Russian arms dealer Vicktor Bout in December of that year.
U.S. citizen Paul Whelan was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges in 2020 and Wall Street Journalist reporter Evan Gershkovich was detained in March on espionage charges.
The U.S. government condemned the detentions of Griner, Gershkovich and Whelan."
U5PWPOZR57-298,Which US airlines use the Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes?,Kevin Accettulla,"January 8, 2024 at 4:09 PM·1 min read",20240109,https://news.yahoo.com/us-airlines-boeing-737-max-220912219.html,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The Federal Aviation Administration issued an order on Friday grounding all Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft after an incident on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 that resulted in a part of the plane blowing out mid-flight.
The FAA expects the grounding order to affect more than 150 planes globally. So, which airlines use the Boeing 737 MAX 9?
Only two airlines in the United States have the specific 737 MAX 9 model in their fleets.
Alaska Airlines’ website does not specify how many of the 737 MAX 9 aircraft are in its fleet. However, reporting indicates the airline has 65 737 MAX 9 planes.
The Alaska Airlines plane that was involved in Friday’s incident was restricted from flying over water due to a warning light illuminating on three separate flights.
United Airlines has 79 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircrafts in its fleet, according to an airline spokesperson.
The airline said it found some loose bolts in the door plug during its inspections of the aircraft.
The airline said it has canceled 200 MAX 9 flights as of Monday and expects “significant” cancellations on Tuesday.
