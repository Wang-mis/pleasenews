They also removed Justice for RGKar graffiti from the road.
In a rare show of citizens' solidarity, Kolkata is observing its second-night vigil by turning off lights and coming out on streets with candles in their hands in demand of justice for the 31-year-old junior doctor who was brutally raped and murdered at RG Kar Hospital even though there is a strong disappointment among protesters over the cancellation of the Supreme Court hearing on September 5.

The hearing was cancelled as Chief Justice DY Chandrachud will not be holding the court on Thursday.
The announcement is a major blow to the junior doctors and protesters, who had been waiting with bated breath and expecting justice for the victim of the brutal rape and murder that took place at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.
The junior doctors, who have organised this second-night vigil across Kolkata, have thanked people for coming out in huge numbers to express solidarity in seeking justice. The protesters promised to continue their fight until justice is delivered.
