3VXNYSC9VW_FEEX4YVQ4H6LQN7,Nauru cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China,By Kelly Ng,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67978185,"One of Taiwan's last diplomatic allies has cut ties with the island in favour of Beijing, just days after a new president was voted in in Taipei.
Nauru, a tiny Micronesian island, was just one of 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taipei.
But in recent years, Beijing - which insists Taiwan is part of China - has been poaching its diplomatic allies.
Taiwan suggests this latest loss is related to the weekend's election results, which angered China.
The election saw voters pick pro-sovereignty candidate William Lai as their next president, a man Beijing has labelled a ""troublemaker"" over remarks he made in the past supporting Taiwanese independence, which it sees as a red line.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order,"" Taiwanese officials said after Nauru's government announced it would ""no longer recognise [Taiwan] as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory"".
In a media conference on Monday, Taipei's deputy foreign minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of taking advantage of recent ""political fluctuations"" in Nauru to ""buy over"" the country with financial aid.
""China thinks it can suppress Taiwan with such methods, I think it is wrong. The world has noticed Taiwan's democratic development. If [Beijing] continues to use such despicable methods to seize Taiwan's diplomatic relations, democratic countries all over the world will not recognise it,"" Mr Tien said.
Still, his ministry remains ""on strong alert"" to combat further moves from China to isolate Taiwan on an international stage, he said.
China - which sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - welcomed Nauru's decision.
""The decision of the government of Nauru to resume diplomatic relations with China fully demonstrates once again that the one-China principle is the will of the people and the trend of the times,"" China's foreign ministry said.
This is not the first time Nauru has cut ties with Taiwan, which considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.
In 2002, Nauru made a similar diplomatic switch to China - it later restored relations with Taiwan in May 2005.
Analysts said the move by Nauru was not unexpected.
""The likelihood that Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China has been on the cards for a while,"" said Anna Powles, associate professor in security studies at New Zealand's Massey University.
The speed at which Australia pursued a treaty offering climate refuge to Tuvalu citizens late last year reflected concerns that Tuvalu, another Pacific nation, was ""under pressure to switch recognition to China"", Ms Powles said.
""These concerns extended to Nauru,"" she said.
""China is always looking to erode Taiwan's influence, especially in the Pacific, where many small nations are looking for development gains,"" said Mihai Sora, a research fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia.
""As Taiwan has fewer diplomatic allies around the world, each one becomes more important in its claim to sovereignty... And it is quite possible that China will continue to look for opportunities to erode that.""

The name Balochistan can also be used to refer to a wider area that includes land in Iran and Afghanistan. In the past week, both Iran and Pakistan have launched strikes across each other's borders targeting militants in the region.
To understand the escalation in fighting, here's a closer look at Balochistan, which has a distinct cultural and historical identity.
The largest part of Balochistan is in south-western Pakistan. The Pakistani province covers nearly 44% of the country's total land but is home to only 6% of the country's 241 million people. Its history is marred by insurgency, militancy, and human rights violations.
Sharing a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, Balochistan also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.
The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which has resided here for centuries. Balochs remain the largest ethnic group, followed by the Pashtuns. Many Baloch people also live in the neighbouring Iranian province of Sistan-Baluchestan, as well as in Afghanistan.
Balochistan stands out as the richest Pakistani province in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals and is a crucial part of a multi-billion dollar project funded by China called the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
The project is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, with the deep-sea port in the city of Gwadar, near the Gulf of Oman, seen as a vital checkpoint.
China is also involved in mining projects here and the construction of an international airport in Gwadar, which insurgent groups in Pakistan fiercely oppose.
A Canadian mining company, Barrick Gold, holds a 50% stake in a Balochistan mine called Reko Diq, which is considered to be one of the world's largest underdeveloped sites for copper and gold.
Local groups in both Pakistan and Iran are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan.
Recent cross-border tensions escalated with Iran's attack on Pakistan on 16 January, which Pakistan said killed two children. Pakistan retaliated with a missile strike inside Iranian territory, which Iran says killed nine people.
Iran claimed it was targeting Jaish al-Adl, a militant group active against Iran, while Pakistan said it was aiming at the ""hideouts"" of two militant groups inside Iran, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF).
Pakistan's strikes were the first external land attack on Iran since the 1980s. It comes as tensions in the Middle East are high with the Gaza war intensifying. Iran also attacked targets in Iraq and Syria in the same week it attacked Pakistan.
The Pakistani province of Balochistan has long grappled with extensive exploitation of its resources and this has been a major catalyst for insurgency and unrest. Locals, particularly the Balochs, have blamed governments for exploiting and profiting from Balochistan's resources while neglecting the development of the region itself.
Resistance against the Pakistani government and the militant insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan's independence from the British Indian Empire.
Resistance continued in phases through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. After a relatively quiet period, insurgent activities increased significantly from 2003 during the era of military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf. He launched several counter-insurgency operations in Balochistan and a famous Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, was killed in one of the most controversial ones.
Bloody counter-insurgency operations and a crackdown in the province by Pakistan's army and intelligence agencies have reportedly seen tens of thousands of people disappear, allegedly picked up, tortured and killed with impunity by Pakistani security forces. Pakistan strongly denies these accusations.
According to the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), there are more than 7,000 people missing from Balochistan. But the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances says there are just 454 active cases from Balochistan as of October 2023.
Pakistan's interim prime minister recently said in an interview with the BBC that the number was ""exaggerated"", claiming there are only 50 missing people in Balochistan.
Some of these cases are with the Supreme Court and a large group of women and family members have been protesting in Islamabad, demanding people are returned and an end to kidnappings and killings in the region.
Various militant groups have operated in the province but two remain highly active in the region - the BLF and BLA. These groups operate against Pakistan inside Pakistani territory although Pakistan claims they maintain hideouts primarily in Iran and sometimes in Afghanistan too.
Pakistan accuses the Iranian government of offering safe havens to the leaders and militants of these groups, which Iran denies. Pakistan also claims that India financially supports some factions in Balochistan - allegations India denies.
In the past two years, the Pakistani government has expressed heightened concern over reports of joint attacks by the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), an umbrella organisation of various Islamist armed militant groups operating along the Afghan-Pakistani border.
The BLA stands out as the militant group challenging the authority of Pakistan the most. Several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated this group as a global terrorist organisation.
In recent years, the BLA has intensified its attacks, shifting from primarily targeting Pakistan's security forces in Balochistan to focusing on Chinese nationals involved in projects in the region.
Similar to other insurgent groups, the BLF frequently targets gas projects, infrastructure, and security posts in Balochistan. Since 2011, the group has actively carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces, foreign workers, government affiliates, and journalists.
Established in Syria in 1964, the BLF initially joined the Iranian Baloch Revolt, an insurgency of Baloch groups against the Iranian government. After five years of conflict, the group negotiated an end to the fight with the Shah of Iran. Subsequently, the BLF, along with other Baloch groups, turned against the Pakistani state, taking refuge in Afghanistan in the 1970s.

A man who faked his death and fled from the US to Scotland has appeared in court in Utah, where he is charged with raping a woman more than 15 years ago.
Nicholas Rossi, 36, had fought against extradition and claimed to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight.
On Tuesday, he appeared by video link at the Third District Court in Utah.
He denied that he was the suspect and described the suggestion that he was not giving his true name as ""complete hearsay"".

Watch: US President vows retaliation against Houthis if attacks continue
The UK's defence secretary has told Iran to urge its proxies in the Middle East to ""cease and desist"" as the world is ""running out of patience"".
Grant Shapps singled out Yemen's Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, both key allies of Tehran and supporters of Hamas.
The UK joined the US in launching airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen overnight on Thursday.
The Houthis have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea since November.
The Iranian-backed political and military group - who control a large part of Yemen - claims to be targeting ships in response to Israel's attacks on Gaza.
On Friday, US and British forces responded with air strikes on 16 targets in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, including logistical hubs, air defence systems and military depots. A follow-up strike was also carried out on Saturday, US officials said.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Shapps said Iran has a vital role to play in de-escalating Middle East tensions.
Asked about his message to the Iranian government Tehran, he said: ""You must get the Houthi rebels, others who are acting as proxies for you, Lebanese Hezbollah are obvious examples, (and) some in Iraq and Syria, you must get these different organisations to cease and desist because we are, the world is, running out of patience.
""We see you, we see through what you're doing. We see how you're doing it, particularly the Houthi rebels, and no good can come from it.""
Mr Shapps also argued the UK was ""acting in self-defence"" over the threat to container ships and an attack on Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond by a drone last month.
Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel across the border with Lebanon since the Israeli military launched its campaign in response to the unprecedented Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October.
Around 1,300 people were killed in Israel and 240 more kidnapped. Israel's retaliatory strikes and ground offensive in Gaza has since led to more than 23,000 people there being killed.
Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq have also regularly been launching attacks on US military bases in the region since the war broke out.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea increased 500% between November and December last year. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.

6RDUEPXQ2E_OTVDRTYA2LNKEG6,Somalia turns back Ethiopian plane headed for Somaliland,By Ian Wafula,3 days ago,20240117,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68006001,"Somalia has turned away a plane transporting officials from Ethiopia to the self-declared republic of Somaliland in a major escalation of the diplomatic row between the countries.
Somalia's information minister told the BBC the plane did not have permission to be in the country's airspace.
The Ethiopian officials were visiting Somaliland to discuss a deal, which has sparked a huge row.
Somalia considers Somaliland to be part of its territory.
The agreement, signed on 1 January, would allow Somaliland to lease one of its ports to Ethiopia in exchange for a stake in Ethiopian Airlines and possible recognition of Somaliland as a sovereign state.
Somalia has reacted angrily to the deal, calling it an act of aggression.
On Wednesday, the Somali Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) said flight ET8273 had broken international rules that flights must obtain clearance from countries they are passing through.
It had attempted to land at Somaliland's Hargeisa Airport.
Despite this incident, regular flights between the two countries are operating as usual, the SCAA said.
Ethiopia's government has not yet commented, but the head of Ethiopian Airlines confirmed that the plane in question had returned to the nation's capital, Addis Ababa.
Somaliland, a former British protectorate which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, has all the trappings of a country, including regular elections, a police force and its own currency.
But this has not been recognised by any country.
By ordering the Ethiopian plane out of its airspace, Somalia is sending a strong message that Somaliland is not an independent country.
Amid the row between Somalia and Ethiopia, both the US and the African Union have backed the territorial integrity of Somalia and urged all parties to cool tensions."
95NTLS3YF7_MBZAWBAKI2TDZLM,Aptamil baby milk: Big supermarkets cut price of formula,By Sam Gruet,5 days ago,20240115,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67986236,"Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have joined Iceland in cutting the cost of Aptamil baby formula.
It comes after manufacturer Danone cut the price it charges retailers for the majority of its baby milk range by 7%.
Asda said from Monday its customers would also be able to pay for formula using rewards scheme vouchers for the first time.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices for baby formula milk had risen by a quarter in two years.
The regulator found competition was hampered because shoppers were reluctant to switch brands, either because they were recommended by friends and family or because their baby would only drink one.
There are rules banning retailers from advertising discounts on infant formula - for babies up to six months - because it might discourage breastfeeding.
In August Iceland called on the government to ""immediately"" update existing legislation so that retailers were allowed to tell the public when they reduce the price of formula.
The supermarket said at the time it still endorsed breastfeeding, yet rising costs were ""placing unbearable pressure on parents who choose to or have no alternative"" to using formula milk.
Iceland was the first supermarket to announce a price reduction, saying Danone's cuts would be reflected in its stores. Asda said it would continue to work with its manufacturing partners to make sure price reductions were passed on to customers.
Kris Comerford, Asda's chief commercial officer, said the supermarket understood that baby formula was a ""vital necessity"" for many.
He said: ""Whilst we respect the regulations in place regarding the sale of baby formula, we want to do everything we can to help families manage their budget and keep their family fed.""
A Sainsbury's spokesperson said the supermarket was passing on cost savings to customers.
In November, the CMA found just two suppliers accounted for 85% of infant formula sales and there was ""very limited availability"" of cheaper own-brand alternatives.
New parents could make significant savings of Â£500 in the first year of a baby's life on formula milk products by shopping around, the CMA added.
Danone told the BBC it would ""continue to engage"" with the CMA investigation.
The rise in costs has correlated with a spike in formula thefts as part of a surge of shoplifting during the cost of living crisis.
Only one UK retailer, Aldi, sells its own brand. Lidl did not immediately reply to a request to comment.

9OQDS5AQVM_19UE65B31FTTTB4,British brothers jailed and banned from Switzerland for museum heist,By Thomas Mackintosh,4 days ago,20240116,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67988454,"Two British brothers have been jailed after confessing to breaking into a Geneva museum and stealing iconic 14th century Chinese Ming Dynasty antiques.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted to a court in Geneva that they were part of a gang of three who raided the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
The judge found the brothers guilty of aggravated theft and jailed them each for three-and-a-half years.
He also banned the pair from visiting Switzerland for five years each.
The brothers were ordered to pay 15,000 Swiss francs ($17,400; Â£13,770) in damages to the Baur Foundation which manages the Museum of Far Eastern Art.
Their prison terms, for now, are to be served in Switzerland.
Previously, the court heard about 3.5m Swiss francs ($4m; Â£3.2m) worth of damage to the museum was caused in June 2019 by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar in the raid.
Prosecutor Marco Rossier told the court that the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
Passing his judgement, Geneva's Palais de Justice President Patrick Monney agreed with the shared culpability adding the gang ""acted out of desire to enrich themselves"".
""This desire was considerable,"" he said.
""During the burglary on 1 June 2019 the three act together,"" he added, adescribing the events of the evening.
""After checking out the configuration the day before they know where they are going to the point they run once inside.
""They are able to go in through the hole and out through that same hole in less than a minute.""
The court previously heard Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car at Geneva Airport in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, [and acquired] the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup decorated with a chicken, has never been recovered.
During his sentencing President Monney added: ""The prejudice caused is considerable and may be irreparable given the chicken cup has not been found since.""
Before the sentencing, the Ahearnes apologised for their actions and acknowledged the support of their family who were present in court.
Stewart Ahearne said: ""I would like to say sorry to the person who owns the museum for the pain and inconvenience caused. I would like to say sorry to the Swiss society in general. Lastly I'd like to say sorry to Nicola [his partner] and my mum.""
His brother Louis Ahearne added: ""I would like to add my condolences to the museum, Swiss society and my family for the stress I have put them through.""
President Monney said he noted the brothers' admissions, apologies and regrets expressed.
As the brothers were led away, Stewart Ahearne waved at his family while Louis Ahearne blew a kiss in their direction.

A1A6ZMB13U_IWYIMBW92C6ZP67,American XL bully ban in Scotland 'likely by end of month',By Andrew Kerr,9 January,20240110,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-67927591,"A ban on XL bully dogs in Scotland is likely by the end of the month, BBC Scotland News understands.
Due to rising concerns over attacks and even deaths, the breed has been banned by the UK government in England and Wales.
It will be illegal to own this type of dog south of the border from 1 February without an exemption certificate.
On Tuesday Scotland's Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown told MSPs she was urgently reviewing the matter.
And she advised potential owners: ""It would be preferable not to acquire any such dog at the present time in Scotland.""
BBC Scotland News understands that a Scottish ban could be in force by the end of January.
The Scottish Conservatives had pointed to widespread rehoming of the breed to Scotland since the change in legislation in England and Wales.
And Jamie Greene MSP told Holyrood: ""I would not want to be the minister in charge of any policy who dithered and delayed a day longer than is necessary on this issue and another tragedy occurs.""
The Scottish government had complained their UK counterparts had not kept them informed of the action they were taking.
Ms Brown told MSPs: ""The unintended consequences of the UK government policy is that we're now seeing an influx of XL bully dogs coming into Scotland.""
Last week a man claimed to have driven 30 dogs across the border for rehoming purposes.
Under the new UK laws, XL bully owners must apply for a permit, take out insurance, neuter their dogs and pay a Â£92.40 fee by the end of the month in order to keep the animals.
The breed has been linked to a series of attacks including the death of a man in Staffordshire.
The campaign group Bully Watch, which was formed in response to a series of high-profile attacks by the dogs, previously accused the Scottish government and SSPCA of being ""asleep at the wheel"".
And it called for action to be taken in Scotland ""before it is too late"".
Under the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs definition, an XL bully has to be 20 inches in height if it is a male or 19 inches in height if it is a female."
B5MYZYOSEA_KCVLMS5QS6GNTPI,British brothers raided Swiss museum 'to clear a debt',By Thomas Mackintosh,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67950947,"Two British brothers have admitted raiding a museum in Switzerland and making off with iconic Chinese Ming dynasty era artefacts worth millions in order to ""clear a debt"", a court heard.
Prosecutors said the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva was burgled in June 2019 by a gang of three who used tools to break through the front door.
Two 14th Century vases and a bowl were taken in the heist.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted their involvement at a court in Geneva.
The pair, from south-east London, appeared before a panel of three judges at the Palais de Justice in Geneva on Monday facing charges of theft, trespass and damage to property.
They fought extradition from the UK, but it was approved by the Home Secretary in 2022.
Patrick Monney, the president of the court, rejected a last-minute application for the trial to be heard in private. He added that the court was aware of the facts of the case from reports by the Swiss Prosecutors Office and Geneva Police and explained the purpose of the hearing was to ""ask additional questions"".
The court heard that the two brothers travelled to Hong Kong shortly after the raid to sell one of the stolen items to an auction house for Â£80,000.
Father-of-one Louis Ahearne told the court he came to Geneva days before the raid to carry out reconnaissance.
The 34-year-old to confirmed he went to ""film the museum"" and ""took part in the burglary"".
He also admitted giving his passport to the auction house in Hong Kong.
""I was in debt,"" he told the court. ""I was paid to be a front man to clear a debt. In the [CCTV] video I am the third person [going into the museum] with no crowbar and no sledgehammer.""
Throughout the hearing, the brothers insisted they didn't want to name the third person involved.
Stewart Ahearne, 45, told the court he has five children and worked as a tradesman in England. He also admitted to using his name to hire the Renault Captur car, used in the heist, from Avis at Geneva Airport.
He told the court he ""took full responsibility"" for his actions, but denied being involved in any pre-planning of the heist in Geneva.
""I went into the museum. I stole some stuff. Any organisation, anything to do with the artwork I didn't know nothing,"" he said.
He added that he was ""used as a pawn like in a game of chess"" during the heist: ""I was asked to come to Switzerland to do some driving. The story, the scenario changed with the third person. He is not someone you can say no to. He is not a very nice person. My role was I was used.
""I got a phone call telling me my brother was in debt and that I was needed to bring back some stuff. Alarm bells started ringing. My instinct as an older brother was to protect my brother.""
The court heard the three came to Geneva in February 2019. Louis Ahearne said this was for ""tourist"" purposes, but Stewart Ahearne said he ""put two and two together"" after the burglary.
""It was so the third person could do some scouting,"" he added.
He broke down when answering questions about his life in Champ-Dollon prison, saying he spends his time in a cell by himself for 23 hours a day.
The hearing continues.

N61A1ZSRKD_0RVD4N5PI9KA4M2,Georgia: Stalin Icon removed from Tbilisi church,By Rayhan Demytrie in Tbilisi & Robert Greenall in London,2 days ago,20240118,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68020286,"An icon depicting Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin meeting a Russian Orthodox saint has been removed from Georgia's main cathedral.
The Georgian Church said the painting had been taken away to be ""amended"" as there was ""insufficient evidence"" the two had ever met.
The painting has caused a public outcry and was recently splashed with blue paint in a protest by an activist.
Church leaders and the ruling party have condemned the action.
But the Patriarchate of Georgia said in a statement last week that icons had to portray ""real stories"" and that the depiction of Stalin had to be changed.
""The donors of the icon are called upon to make the appropriate changes to the image themselves; otherwise, we will do it ourselves,"" it said.
Many Georgians have criticised the Church for accepting the icon, as Stalin - who was born in Georgia and as a young man trained to be a priest - carried out a massive purge of clergy during his rule.
The icon, which was placed in the Holy Trinity Cathedral in the capital Tbilisi, depicts scenes from the life of St Matrona of Moscow, a 20th Century Russian visionary and healer who was canonised in the 1990s.
In one, the Russian Orthodox saint can be seen blessing Stalin.
It was donated to the church several months ago by anti-Western nationalist party Alliance of Patriots, which is suspected of having links to the Kremlin.
But the icon only came to prominence this month, after an opposition former politician Giorgi Kandelaki highlighted its presence. It has been courting controversy ever since.
Activist Nata Peradze published a video of her throwing eggs filled with paint at the icon and said she was protesting against what she saw as the glorification of a tyrant.
""I felt that I had to do something, I am not going to talk about Stalin's Terror, everyone knows about it, but my family on both sides suffered and relatives disappeared,"" she told the BBC.
Ultra-conservative pro-Russian group Alt-Info, which was behind homophobic attacks which turned into violence against journalists in 2021, has organised protests outside Ms Peradze's house and outside parliament.
She says she has received death threats, and has now gone into hiding. Her house is under police guard.
The scandal surrounding the icon has awoken a national debate about the Soviet dictator's legacy.
The ruling Georgian Dream party condemned the defacement of the icon but has not commented on the national debate about the role of Stalin.
The Soviet Past Research Laboratory (Sovlab), which aims to explore and analyse Georgia's totalitarian past, says that the rehabilitation of the Soviet dictator has accelerated in Putin's Russia and that Moscow has used it as information warfare agenda to influence the Georgian public.
Sovlab has tracked the emergence of 12 new statues to Stalin across Georgia in the past decade.
Stalin was born Iosif Dzhugashvili in the town of Gori, in the east of Georgia, in 1878. A key figure in the Russian revolution which brought the Bolsheviks to power, he ruled the USSR from 1924 until his death in 1953.
Millions died as Stalin imposed iron discipline and state terror to root out ""enemies of the people"" and build a communist state.
Many people in the small South Caucasian country reject the legacy of the Soviet Union, but some still view Stalin with some pride because of his humble beginnings there.
Visiting Tbilisi on 16 January for the film dramatisation of his book, the Young Stalin, British author Simon Sebag Montefiore said it was surprising to see the dictator's image in the cathedral.
""Stalin studied in the seminary and was a believer by his own account until his late teens. He was the star choir boy,"" he said.
""But nonetheless, he turned very much against the Church, embraced secular life, rejected God and embraced Bolshevism and Marxism.""
""His essential belief was that society can be improved by mass killings of people.""

PEA62KIZBL_B5XUSS8D63GJ6W0,Two British brothers 'should be banned from Switzerland' for museum heist,By Thomas Mackintosh,5 days ago,20240116,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67988451,"Prosecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.
At a court in Geneva on Monday, Stewart and Louis Ahearne confessed to being part of a gang which burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
On top of the ban, prosecutor Marco Rossier said the court should jail the brothers for four years.
They will be sentenced on Tuesday.
Mr Rossier told the court the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
He said Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car out in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup, has never been recovered.
Around 3.5m Swiss francs (Â£3.2m) worth of damage was caused to the Museum of Far Eastern Art which is based in a listed townhouse in Geneva's old town.
On Monday, Louis Ahearne said he carried out the burglary in order to ""clear a debt"" and Stewart Ahearne said he took ""full responsibility"" explaining he wanted to ""protect"" his younger brother.
Mr Rossier said the prosecution doubted the brothers' version of events as the third person was not in the court and is currently the subject of extradition proceedings to Japan.
The court also heard from Loris Bertoliatti, representing the Museum of Far Eastern Art, who said damage caused by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar cost the institution millions.
""They are a professional gang,"" he said. ""They were determined to sell the items. The victim is the museum. Lots of people were shocked by what happened.""
Stewart Ahearne's partner Nicola Barry was called as a witness on Monday and described the father-of-five as a ""kind, loving and nice person"" - adding his employer has committed to giving him a job when he is freed.
The brothers' mother, Suzanne Ahearne, said Louis Ahearne is a ""compassionate and empathetic"" person who had an ""unhappy childhood"".
She told the court since his extradition from the UK, he has been writing to his nine-year-old son from prison in Switzerland trying to ""give the guidance he never got"" from his father.
The Ahearnes' defence barristers will also provide mitigation before the president of the court Patrick Monney delivers his judgement.
The hearing continues.

RIISLN6RWM_6XBEF2BNO4Y91CQ,Namibia criticises German support for Israel over ICJ genocide case,By Danai Nesta Kupemba,7 days ago,20240114,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67974067,"Namibia has condemned former colonial ruler Germany for rejecting a case at the UN's top court accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.
Germany has offered to intervene on Israel's behalf in the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
President Hage Geingob urged Germany to ""reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence"".
In 2021 Berlin acknowledged committing genocide in Namibia.
German colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908. Historians consider this to be the 20th Century's first genocide.
President Geingob said Germany could not ""morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia"" and at the same time support Israel.
""The German Government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil,"" he added.
On Friday the German government said the accusation of genocide against Israel was completely unfounded and amounted to a ""political instrumentalisation"" of the UN genocide convention.
""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the government sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention,"" it said.
It said Hamas - which attacked Israel on 7 October, triggering the current war - aimed to destroy Israel, which was acting in self defence.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage on 7 October.
Since then Israel has killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly children and women, in its retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN and humanitarian organisations have warned of the risk of famine in Gaza as well as the spread of disease among displaced people and have urged that more aid be allowed into the territory.
The scale of the Israeli response prompted South Africa to ask the ICJ to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Pretoria's case included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"" and its legal team was scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.

SEZQOMWRWB_QCSH1Q3M8BQE98E,Pakistan-Iran diplomatic ties restored after missile and drone strikes,By Thomas Mackintosh,1 day ago,20240119,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68033426,"Pakistan and Iran have restored diplomatic ties according to the caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar's office.
It comes after both countries exchanged drone and missile strikes on militant bases on each other's territory.
As a result of the tit-for-tat attacks Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.
Both ambassadors are now expected to return to their posts following talks.
Iran said Thursday's strikes killed nine people in a border village on its territory, including four children. Pakistan said an Iranian attack on Tuesday killed two children.
There has been no immediate comment from Iran on the talks.
Earlier on Friday, Pakistan expressed its willingness to work with Iran on ""all issues"" following a call between their foreign ministers.
""Foreign Minister Jilani expressed Pakistan's readiness to work with Iran on all issues based on spirit of mutual trust and cooperation,"" the Pakistan foreign ministry said.
""They also agreed to de-escalate the situation. The return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed.""
The reciprocal attacks came as tensions in the Middle East are high with several overlapping crises.
Israel is fighting the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and exchanging fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are targeting US forces, and the US and UK have struck the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been attacking shipping.
On Thursday, Pakistan's foreign ministry said its strikes around the Iranian city of Saravan had come in light of ""credible intelligence of impending large-scale terrorist activities"".
The ministry added it ""fully respects"" Iran's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"".
Pakistan's army said the ""precision strikes"" were conducted with drones, rockets and long-range missiles and targeted the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front.
Both groups are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan, a remote region in south-western Pakistan.

SICP2HB0BS_1VJULSQCMXH2BNQ,Bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticide has emergency approval again,By Malcolm Prior,2 days ago,20240118,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68025634,"The UK government has given emergency approval for the use of a pesticide banned because of the harm it can cause bees, for the fourth year in a row.
Permission to use the neonicotinoid on sugar beet seeds has been needed despite a vow by the industry to find an alternative by the end of 2023.
The Wildlife Trusts said the decision was a ""deathblow"" for wildlife.
The government said it was a ""necessary and proportionate measure"" to tackle a damaging crop virus spread by aphids.
It added that the product - which has been banned since 2018 - can only be used if an independent, scientifically-verified level of threat posed by the disease, Virus Yellows, is met in March.
That threshold will be a 65% infection across the national sugar beet crop.
The NFU said the Virus Yellows disease had already caused sugar beet crop losses of up to 80% in recent years and threatened an industry with more than 9,500 jobs.
Sugar-beet farmer Michael Sly, who has land across north Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire and is the chair of the NFU's sugar board, said he was ""relieved"" the derogation had been granted.
He said farmers would ""ensure safe and responsible use of the treatment"" if the pesticide had to be used.
""The homegrown sugar industry is working hard to find viable, long-term solutions to this disease,"" he added.
Environmental and wildlife campaigners warned that the neonicotinoid - a seed treatment called thiamethoxam - disrupts bees' ability to navigate and reproduce.
Barnaby Coupe, land use policy manager at The Wildlife Trusts, said the decision to authorise its use was ""a deathblow for wildlife, a backwards step in evidence-based decision making, and a betrayal of farmers who are producing food sustainably"".
Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of environmental and rural campaign groups, said the decision ""flies in the face of ecological sense"".
Back in 2020, British Sugar - which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - had told the government that in three years it would have developed alternatives to the seed treatment.
Dan Green, the company's agriculture director, told the BBC that research was continuing and included ""research into how the industry can benefit from gene editing"".
The company hopes Virus Yellows resistant crops will be available commercially by 2026.
Farming Minister Mark Spencer said his decision had been based on robust scientific assessment with the risk evaluated ""very carefully"".
""We recognise the damaging impact that an outbreak of beet yellow virus could have on farmer livelihoods. We therefore regard issuing an emergency authorisation as a necessary and proportionate measure,"" he added.

VFDFW5FZ5Z_IEQ7XWXL395QRDB,Fifth arrest over Dublin restaurant deaths,_,12 January 2024,20240112,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgr33757e35o,"Two people have died as a result of the incident at Browne's Steakhouse on Main Street in Blanchardstown on Sunday 24 December

XVER5VHG5D_BBK7K0T2A17JR4E,FM calls for UK parliament recall over Yemen air strikes,_,12 January,20240112,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67956866,"Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the UK parliament to be recalled over the air strikes in Yemen.
The UK and US strikes against Houthi rebel sites have been described by Rishi Sunak as ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect the global shipping in the Red Sea.
The targeted strikes on military facilities took place overnight.
Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action.
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let there be no equivocation that the SNP align ourselves with the UN security resolution, which is essentially calling for the Houthi rebels to stop their attacks in the Red Sea.
""But of course the UK's record on military intervention, particularly in the Middle East, is not a good one.
""Before action was taken, the correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament, who have given serious detail about any proposed military action.""
He added: ""There are significant questions around the action taken. What is the end goal? What will be deemed as a success?""
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the strikes against the Iranian-backed group, who he accuses of threatening UK ships, was in ""self-defence"".
In response, Houthi officials have warned that the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"".
The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year.
The Houthis control much of Yemen and say they are supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel.
More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said.
Mr Sunak accused the Houthi rebels of threatening UK and international ships and causing major disruption to the trade route.
""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week, "" the prime minister said.
""This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade.""
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones.
Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"".
The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel.
Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, has confirmed her sister-in-law and her four children had escaped Gaza.
Her brother is a doctor at Al-Nassar Hospital. He is still in the territory with other relatives.
Ms El-Nakla's parents returned to Scotland in November after being trapped in Gaza for four weeks when the war with Israel broke out during a family visit.
In a statement she said: ""I'm pleased that my sister-in-law, Doaa, and their four children have escaped from Gaza, and are now safe.
""However, my brother Mohamed remains there along with my 93-year-old grandmother and many wider family members.""
Ms El Nakla, who is a Dundee councillor, said families in Gaza were ""still suffering after the loss of entirely innocent men, women and children"".
She urged the UK government to launch a resettlement scheme for Palestinians, similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa.
She added: ""I will continue to raise my voice to stop the killing and suffering of the innocent people of Gaza, and call for an immediate and urgent ceasefire.""
A UK government spokesperson said: ""Over 300 British nationals and their dependants have so far left Gaza, and we are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave.
""We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing as required to provide consular assistance.
""Any dependants of British citizens who need a visa can apply for one.
More than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
During the initial Hamas attacks on Israel some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage."
ZUGIDH0ICM_PXAD5KXUXYWDYUN,US and UK strikes target Houthi rebels in Yemen,_,12 January,20240112,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67954161,"US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen.
US officials say warship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles and fighter jets hit 16 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold.
The strikes are in response to repeated attacks by the Iran-backed group on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The Houthis, who back Hamas, said at least five of their number were killed.
The group claims to be targeting ships linked to Israel - saying the attacks are in response to Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip - and have also launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel.
The Houthi targets in Yemen early on Friday included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots, US officials told the Associated Press news agency.
US President Joe Biden, quoted by Reuters news agency, said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes against Houthi targets with support from countries including Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" Mr Biden said.
He added that he ""will not hesitate"" to order further military action if necessary.
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in response that there was ""absolutely no justification"" for the attacks and that the group would continue to target Israeli ships.
Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - both Houthi allies - have also condemned the strikes.
These are the first such actions by the US military in the Red Sea since the Houthi drone and missile attacks on shipping began in November.
The Houthis, who control a large part of Yemen, have been targeting merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones - putting lives at risk, threatening the global economy and destabilising the region.
Four RAF Typhoon jets flying from Akrotiri in Cyprus also conducted air strikes on two Houthi targets in Yemen using Paveway bombs, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the strikes in a statement on Friday morning, calling them ""limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"".
Mr Sunak denounced the ""reckless actions"" of the Houthi militia, who he said had carried out a series of ""dangerous and destabilising attacks"" against commercial shipping in the Red Sea despite repeated warnings from the international community.
He added that the UK would ""always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade"".
On 9 January, HMS Diamond, along with US warships, successfully repelled the largest attack from the Houthis in the Red Sea to date. On the same day, the Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel - the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.
