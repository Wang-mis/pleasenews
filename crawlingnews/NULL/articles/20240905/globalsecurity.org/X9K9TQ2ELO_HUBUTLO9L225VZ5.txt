TAMPA, Fla. -- U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces and Iraqi Security Forces conducted a partnered raid in Western Iraq in the early hours of Aug. 29, resulting in the death of 15 ISIS operatives.  The ISIS element was armed with numerous weapons, grenades, and explosive "suicide" belts.  There is no indication of civilian casualties.
This operation targeted ISIS leaders to disrupt and degrade ISIS' ability to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against Iraqi civilians, as well as U.S. citizens, allies, and partners throughout the region and beyond.
Iraqi Security Forces continue to further exploit the locations raided.
ISIS remains a threat to the region, our allies, as well as our homeland.  U.S. CENTCOM alongside our coalition and Iraqi partners, will continue to aggressively pursue these terrorists.
We will provide more information as it becomes available.
