Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu continues his lies to manipulate public opinion in order to cover up his crimes in Gaza and to prevent ceasefire negotiations from reaching a conclusion.
Netanyahu's latest allegations against the Arab Republic of Egypt for maintaining the Israeli military presence in the Philadelphi corridor are unacceptable.
We support the Arab Republic of Egypt's mediation efforts to end the war in Gaza and provide a helping hand to millions of our Palestinian brothers and sisters.
