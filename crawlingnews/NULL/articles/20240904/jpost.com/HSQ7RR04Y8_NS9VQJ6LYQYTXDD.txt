"Our government is cynically exploiting our collective trauma to violently advance its project of cementing Israel's control over the entire land," Yuli Novak, CEO of left-wing Israeli activist group B'Tselem, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday.In the 9717th UN Security Council meeting, coming 11 months into the war, representatives of multiple countries, including Israel and Palestine, spoke on the subject of "The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question." This included Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, and a video message from Novak.  According to Novak, the Israeli government "does not want to return the hostages in a deal, but to continue the war, indefinitely." She referred to the government as "criminal," "apartheid," and "cruel," saying that they were exploiting the events of October 7 to carry out their agenda.  "Since Israel was founded, its guiding logic has been to promote Jewish supremacy over the entire territory under its control," she told the Council.

These included Amit Soussana's testimony of experiencing sexual and physical abuse, Maya Regev's statement that "every woman held by Hamas has been sexually abused," and Agam Goldsteim-Almog's recent words about being a "slave bride" for Hamas.""We hear many voices saying that we halt our efforts, lay down our weapons, and question why we continue to fight Hamas in Gaza," Danon added."Many of you have forgotten why we are in Gaza, but we have not."Danon told the Council that the "disconnection [of many representatives] allows some of you to behave as if October 7 never happened.""Today, I am here to remind you and the world that we will never forget them, we will never abandon them, [hostages] who are being tortured by monsters."Hamas and only Hamas is to blame, says DanonDanon said that if the Council members "truly cared for the Palestinian people, and truly wanted an end to this war which Hamas started, [they] would officially draft and pass a resolution designating Hamas a terrorist organization, and condemning Hamas for its hostage-taking.""Israel is committed to bringing every one of these hostages home. It is our top priority. But make no mistake; the roadblock to their release is not Israel; it is Hamas and only Hamas. Danon claimed that for the Council members, "it is far easier to condemn a democratic government that to confront the reality of dealing with terrorists" given the terrorists do not sit at this table to defend their actions.He concluded by calling on the Council to "direct its energy where it is most needed: issue a clear and unequivocal condemnation of the barbaric terrorist organization which continues to hold innocent lives.""Now is the time for action."
