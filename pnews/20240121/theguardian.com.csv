05CDST2LFU_GJZE0KO3EB4NBN8,"Amid class prejudice and sensitivities over race, Rochdale’s abused girls were failed",Kenan Malik,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/amid-class-prejudice-and-sensitivities-over-race-rochdales-abused-girls-were-failed,"‘Child 44” was raped by many men over a long period of time, eventually forced to have an abortion, aged 13. None of her abusers was charged with rape against her; many were not even interviewed. After the termination, the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) seized possession of the foetus without her knowledge, let alone consent, leaving it forgotten in a freezer until spotted during “a routine property review”.
“Child 37” was 13. She told the police that she had been “in the park with another child and met four Asian men”, two of whom had raped her. Because she was reluctant to undergo a medical or give a video interview, the police recorded the crime as requiring “no further action”.
Two distressing stories out of dozens from a report on grooming gangs in Rochdale published last week. It is the latest in a series of excoriating accounts of official attitudes to child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Rotherham, Telford, Oxford and many other towns, each one as tormenting to read as the next.
The Rochdale report details again the way the council and police ignored shocking crimes and left children “at the mercy of their abusers”. Of the 74 children in council files thought likely to have been sexually exploited, just three had been “appropriately protected by the statutory agencies”. Many more were not in the files. The report found at least “96 individuals who potentially pose a risk to children”, though the true figure was likely to be much higher. Many had not even been interviewed by police.
At the heart of such official failure is the contempt with which police, social workers and council officers viewed victims. There is a scene in the first episode of Three Girls, the viscerally harrowing 2017 BBC drama about sex trafficking in Rochdale, in which Sara Rowbotham (played by Maxine Peake), who led the NHS crisis intervention team, confronts a social worker. It was Rowbotham who, together with former police officer Maggie Oliver, helped expose the scandal.
In the TV drama, based on real events, Rowbotham informs social services that one of the trafficked girls, Holly, is pregnant. The social worker tells Holly’s parents their daughter is a “prostitute”. “Me and you,” a furious Rowbotham responds when she finds out, “we’re looking at the same thing; but where I see kids being turned inside out by abusers, you see only slags who bring it on themselves”.
The view of abused girls as “prostitutes” was commonplace. “Police weren’t arsed with us”, another of the girls, called Amber in the drama, later told Julie Bindel in an Observer interview. “They weren’t bothered… when you’re from a shit home. They don’t give a fuck when you’re not from a wealthy background.”
Amber’s story sums up the scorn of officialdom for those whom they regarded as loose, working-class girls. Aged 14 when first targeted by the grooming gang, she described to the police how she was plied with alcohol before being “passed around” groups of men. She identified more than 20 abusers, providing names, addresses, telephone numbers and car registrations. Her information helped initiate Operation Span, a belated, though half-hearted, drive against grooming gangs launched in 2010.
Yet no one was charged with offences against Amber. So disdainful were the police and lawyers of what one social worker called her “lifestyle choice” they imagined no jury would believe her. Shockingly, Amber was, in 2009, herself arrested for “soliciting” because, under duress from the gang, she had brought along some of her friends. It was two years before the CPS agreed not to treat her as a suspect.
Then, astonishingly, in 2011, Amber, having provided the information that led to nine men appearing in court on rape and trafficking charges, was named in the indictment as a co-conspirator in child sexual exploitation. It came as a complete surprise, the CPS having deliberately withheld information from her. It is difficult to describe this as anything but cowardice and betrayal. The lead prosecutor claimed in court that Amber had played “an active role in helping… these defendants sexually exploit the other girls”. National newspapers demonised her as the “Honey Monster”, a “pimp” and a “bully”. She was denounced on social media as a “paedo” and her address identified, leading to bomb threats.
The misogyny and contempt for working-class families displayed by the authorities was not unique to Rochdale. Reviews of CSE failures in Oxfordshire, Telford and elsewhere, highlight how deeply embedded was the view of an abused girl as having “prostituted herself”.
Much of this has, however, often been overshadowed by another feature of many of these cases. The Rochdale rapists and traffickers were all of Pakistani or Afghan heritage, the victims white teenage girls, a pattern seen in many high-profile cases. Far-right groups have seized on this to portray gang-based CSE as a “Muslim” phenomenon created by mass immigration, sentiments echoed by some mainstream commentators and politicians. Last week, Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine linked the Rochdale cases with Iranian terror and the Hamas 7 October massacres.
The exploitation of these cases by the far right has made many liberals fearful of addressing the issue. In 2012, the writer Daniel Trilling observed how, “in seeking to prevent the growth of racism”, Rochdale officials had “tried to police debate”. A senior council officer told youth worker Mohammed Shafiq, who was trying to raise awareness within Muslim communities, that he was “doing the work of the BNP”. A 2022 report into CSE failures in Telford suggested that “nervousness about race” may have “led to a reluctance to act”.
There is nothing antiracist in burying facts or in failing to act against rapists because of “racial sensitivities”. The facts, though, are far from clear. Some academics suggest that “Muslims, particularly Pakistanis, dominate… prosecutions”. Many disagree. A 2020 Home Office report, surveying the research, observed that “robust data is scarce” and researchers vary in their conclusions but most studies accept that “group-based CSE offenders are most commonly white”. “This is not a race issue”, wrote a “furious” Angela Sinfield, mother of an abused girl, in response to the far right trying to “hijack” the case. She even stood against the BNP in a local election to challenge that narrative. Those attempting to politicise the debate by turning grooming gangs into an issue of race or religion care little for the victims of sexual exploitation but seek to exploit pain to promote bigotry.
Terrible crimes were ignored in Rochdale and elsewhere, the callousness and contempt of officials betraying the courage and resilience of thousands of girls and young women. Discussions of gang-based CSE are suffused with prejudices about women, about the working class, about Muslims. Without confronting all these prejudices, it is difficult to confront any.

Pesutto on Monday told reporters the Coalition had discussed the issue internally and with stakeholders “on an ongoing basis for many months” before deciding to change its position.
“We felt that the time to make an announcement was now,” he said.
Pesutto said he did not believe treaty would “work” and that he had “concerns around secrecy” and divisiveness.
“There are clearly risks around how our community will feel more divided,” he said.
Pesutto said he had been “very concerned” to see “how traumatic the debate around the [Indigenous voice to parliament referendum] was for many Victorians”.
“I don’t want Victorians to have to go through that again,” he said.

Earlier on Monday, the Coalition spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, Nationals leader Peter Walsh, told ABC Radio Melbourne the party had reached its new policy position last spring.
He also said the Coalition’s change in position was partly due to recent reports on the state’s cultural heritage laws. He said the process of getting an approved cultural heritage management plan by traditional owner groups was taking too long and impacting housing developments.
“We’re for protecting cultural heritage. We don’t believe the legislation is delivering for all Victorians,” Walsh said.
“What is treaty? That’s the great unknown that people don’t know. Lots of people would say ‘How can you have a treaty with yourself?’ Because we are all Australians.”
The premier, Jacinta Allan, said the opposition was using cultural heritage concerns to “crab walk away” from the treaty process and accused Pesutto of keeping the position change a secret for months.
“If there’s a change in the direction you’re taking, you should be upfront with the Victorian community and once that decision has been made, explain that decision,” she said.
“Not cloak it in this secrecy that we’ve seen for months and months.”
In 2022, the opposition backed a bill to establish an independent authority to oversee the state’s treaty negotiations. At the time, Walsh told parliament it was a “myth” that only the Labor party supported a treaty with the state’s First Nations people.
Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, he said “things have changed”.

Victoria’s First People’s Assembly said the Coalition’s decision was “disappointing, but not surprising”.
“What will the announcement mean? Not much really,” it said in a statement.
“Of course, we would have liked to have kept Treaty above party politics and our door will remain open to politicians of all persuasions, but there is a clear path to Treaty ahead of us.”
Rueben Berg, the co-chair of the assembly, told the ABC he first heard about the opposition’s policy change via media reports on Walsh’s Sky News interview.
Berg said the state’s cultural heritage legislation was “not a perfect system” but argued traditional owner groups had not been resourced properly to undertake their decision-making role under the legislation.
He said the treaty process could help boost the resources of traditional owner groups.
The Coalition joins several political parties to walk back support for treaty after the defeat of the referendum for a federal Indigenous voice.
In Queensland, the Liberal National party withdrew bipartisan support for a treaty process and the New South Wales Labor government said it was assessing its next steps.
But unlike other states, Victoria’s treaty process is already under way – negotiations are on track to begin this year. Allan told Guardian Australia in December that legislation would have to pass parliament once a treaty – or several treaties – was agreed to.
The Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, said it was now incumbent on the government to work with the minor party and other progressive crossbenchers to deliver a treaty.
“I’m really confident that there’s support in this parliament to deliver the treaty process,” she said."
249ODL4IQ5_A9QR2NBOCDC3KFG,Post Office regulators failed the subpostmasters in the Horizon scandal,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/jan/21/post-office-regulators-failed-subpostmasters-in-horizon-scandal,"Andrew Rawnsley rightly draws a line connecting politicians of all parties as being among those culpable of allowing the Post Office to perpetrate its evil strategy (“The abuse of unaccountable power is at the wicked heart of the Post Office scandal”, Comment). Evil, because I believe what they did was so. Even today, it continues to be obdurate in its behaviour to the inquiry and all of us.
However, there was weakness in oversight that should have come from an effective, suitably empowered, regulator.
Only when we have properly funded regulators adequately armed with statutory powers of action and punishment will we go some way towards avoiding these scandals occurring in the future. The Post Office regulation appears to have been weakened over time rather than beefed up.
Government seems to have an aversion to regulators that are effective. They are used as a sop to reassure us when outsourcing services from its balance sheet. But equally, it doesn’t like the firefight when a scandal emerges. It can’t have it both ways, yet it never seems to learn that simple fact. Nor do we.David ClaridgeOxted, Surrey
It is not just overtly political drama but all drama that has the power to evoke empathy, to invite critical thinking and to provoke action. All the arts have that power. (“‘The timing was impeccable’: why it took a TV series to bring the Post Office scandal to light”, Focus)
That is why it is no surprise that there has been a calculated effort on the part of this government, as well as the preceding several, to undermine artistic endeavour in the UK. The constant devastating removal of funding for the arts is directly linked to their desire to diminish the empathy and critical thinking skills of the electorate.
When you see what a drama like Mr Bates vs The Post Office can achieve, it is clear that, from their perspective, they are right to make the attempt. And we must resist.Alison Bomber, Royal Shakespeare Company Associate ArtistBavorov, Czech Republic
Kim Darroch says the UK and US, in their actions in the Red Sea, are “standing up for the postwar world order. International law shall prevail” (“Whoever rules the waves rules the world... The Red Sea crisis will show us if that’s true”, Comment).
Sadly, the crisis arises because for the last 75 years they have failed to do just that. This betrayal has been exacerbated since 1967. The US and UK have prevented international law being complied with in relation to the right of Palestinians for their own state. In recent months, they have failed to address the collective punishment being meted out in Gaza and the West Bank.
The US even vetoed a UN security council resolution seeking to uphold international law. Unless and until a Palestinian state has been created from the present chaos, there will be no peace in the Middle East, and that cannot happen until the US ends support for Israel until it abides by international law.Rev David HaslamEvesham, Worcestershire
Some families may fail some children some, perhaps even all, of the time (“Yes, parents have the right to educate their children at home. But children have rights too”, Comment). However, all schools fail some children all of the time, not to mention the many children who underachieve.
When the best outcomes for all children who attend school, state or private, are guaranteed, then let’s talk about compulsory schooling, restrictions on home education, state intervention and oversight. While schools of all descriptions are failing children not suited to a mass-learning, test-oriented environment, or those with non-mainstream interests, while violence is rife in schools and there are huge teacher shortages, it is not the right time.Gina PurrmannBlairgowrie, Perth and Kinross, Scotland
The story about the chances postwar free education gave to working-class aspiring actors like Peter Capaldi (“Peter Capaldi says posh actors are smooth, confident and tedious”, Magazine) is also relevant in other spheres of life.
I left school at 16 with two O-levels, but in my late 20s, while working as a milkman, took A-level English at night school (free); which inspired me in my 30s, while working as a carpenter and with a wife, two children and a mortgage, to study in the evenings for a science degree with the Open University (heavily subsidised) and later a teaching degree (free, plus a £5,000-a-year bursary).
I spent the rest of my working life as a teacher. Whether carpentry’s loss was education’s gain is moot, but it meant I could fulfil my potential, something denied today to thousands of young people from working-class families.John FrenchBrockweir, Chepstow, Monmouthshire
Yvonne Roberts rightly says that Shere Hite should be remembered (“Women’s sex lives were a mystery to men. Then along came Shere Hite”, Comment).
Her approach of eliciting nuanced, complicated, sometimes contradictory, responses demonstrated the intricacy of the human condition, especially for underrepresented social categories, including women, minorities, class and race. In this, Hite paved the way for other ways of knowing.Bríd ConnollyMaynooth, Co Kildare, Ireland
Stuart Clark is right, governments are lying to us – but not about aliens. (“It only takes one to be real and it changes humanity for ever’: what if we’ve been lied to about UFOs?”, New Review.) Of course UFOs are real. They are apparent phenomena that we can’t explain.
Our galaxy must be teeming with life among its billions of star systems but, as Douglas Adams said: “Space is big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.” No sensible extraterrestrial is going to brave the huge distances of interstellar space. They would be dead before they got even a fraction of the distance to the nearest inhabited star system.Howard LaneLondon SE27

2WHX4DQMBJ_4UZXZPVIQBMZCYL,National Archives censor files showing late queen concealed relative’s wealth,Rob Evans,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/21/national-archives-censor-files-showing-late-queen-concealed-relatives-wealth,"Staff at Britain’s National Archives have censored documents that show how the late Queen Elizabeth II concealed details of a relative’s wealth from the public.
They recently withdrew the papers, removed parts of them and then placed them back in the public domain.
However, the Guardian has established that the suppressed portions contain a request from the late queen to keep secret the will of one of her relatives.
The serial concealment of the wills of the Windsor family has become a contentious issue for the monarchy.
For more than a century, the Windsors have been able to keep secret the contents of wills belonging to 33 members of their family. They obtained a special carve-out from a law that ordinarily requires the wills of British citizens to be made public.
This exemption has enabled the royal family to prevent the public from finding out what types of assets – such as property and jewels – have been acquired by the Windsors and how these were then distributed to, for example, relatives, friends or staff.
The censored documents contain a direct request from the late queen to keep secret one of these wills more than five decades ago. Buckingham Palace declined to say whether she had requested other wills to be hidden from the public.
The Windsors have for decades steadfastly shielded the scale of their wealth from the public. The family do not disclose how rich they are. Last year, the Guardian estimated that King Charles III had a personal fortune of £1.8bn.
One of the ways they have kept details of their wealth secret was by exploiting an obscure legal procedure to obtain court orders to keep wills of family members secret after they died. This has been used even for remote members of their family. In 1987, the will of a Danish prince was closed; Prince George Valdemar Carl Axel was only distantly connected to the Windsors as a second cousin to the Queen’s late husband, Philip.
Since 1911, the Windsors’ personal lawyers have obtained the orders from high court judges in secret hearings. Lawyers for Prince Philip, the queen mother and Princess Margaret have successfully applied to keep their wills confidential since 2002.
However the secrecy of this practice has been challenged recently amid controversy that the arcane procedure gave the royal family a right that is not granted to other British citizens. There has also been criticism that the wills were being kept secret in order to cover up how much money the Windsors had accumulated from public funds.
Two years ago, staff at the National Archives in Kew, south-west London, the official repository that holds government documents dating back more than 1,000 years, removed a file that chronicled official discussions about the royal wills between 1957 and 1970. The file had been opened to the public in 2018.
When the file was returned to the public domain last year, parts of two documents, and a letter, had been withheld. The Guardian has been able to establish what was censored because it photographed the complete file in 2021.
One of the documents was a report written by a senior judicial official, Robert Bayne-Powell, in 1970. The censors have removed a paragraph that said: “I learn that her majesty requested the solicitors for the executors to apply to seal up the will of the Princess Royal, Countess of Harewood. I suggest that any royal will should be sealed up if the sovereign so requests.”
The Countess of Harewood – an aunt of the queen and daughter of George V – died in 1965, having accumulated wealth worth £5.6m in today’s money.
In the second act of censorship, staff at the archives removed from the file a letter dated June 1970 in which a Whitehall official recorded a conversation with Lord Tryon, the courtier in charge of the Queen’s finances.
Tryon had told the official: “The Buckingham Palace lawyers consider that except in special circumstances (for example a will containing something which should not be made public) ‘fringe members’ of the royal family need not have their wills sealed. This should only be for HRHs.”
The passage is significant because it indicates that even royal courtiers were unsure whether minor members of the royal family should be afforded the perk of having their wills kept secret.
Other official documents that have been published have shown that behind the scenes senior government officials privately believed the practice was questionable, calling the legal basis for the court orders “rather slender” and “somewhat haphazard”.
In the third instance of censorship, the National Archives removed a seemingly innocuous paragraph from an official memo in 1970 that recorded the fact that Lord Tryon and Michael Adeane, the Queen’s private secretary, had discussed with a Whitehall official whether the will of a junior member of the royal family should be closed.
The National Archives said that the documents had been removed, in consultation with the Ministry of Justice, because they contained information relating to communications with the monarch. Such information was kept secret under a section of the Freedom of Information Act, they said."
3MNPMODK9Y_VPKPPATFTCOZV6J,"Ukrainian shelling of Donetsk shopping area kills dozens, local officials say",Sam Jones,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/ukrainian-shelling-donetsk-shopping-area,"At least 25 people have been killed after Ukrainian forces shelled a busy suburban shopping area in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, according to local officials.
Alexei Kulemzin, the city’s Russian-installed mayor, said Ukrainian artillery had fired on a bustling district where shops and a market are located. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-appointed head of the Donetsk region, said emergency services were working at the scene, adding that a further 20 people, including two children, had been injured in the strike on the suburb of Tekstilshchik.
Pushilin said the area had been hit by 155mm and 152mm calibre shells fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west. Local authorities have declared Monday a day of mourning.
Reuters photographs and video taken at the scene showed people crying, some of whom said they had lost relatives, and bodies lying in the snow near one of the city’s markets.
Shattered shopfronts and broken glass could be seen in videos shared by Russian state media, along with what appeared to be bodies lying on the ground nearby.
A local resident called Tatiana said she had heard an incoming projectile overhead, and had hidden under her market stall. “I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,” she told a local media outlet.
“Where is there anything military here? It’s just a market,” another resident told the same outlet. “This is one of the strongest blows in recent times.”
Russia’s foreign ministry denounced the strike, saying “security threats and acts of terrorism should not be committed from the territory of Ukraine”. In a statement, it added: “These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means.”
Ukraine has not commented on the event and the claims could not be independently verified.
Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia claimed to have annexed in 2022 in a move condemned as illegal by most countries at the UN general assembly. Moscow does not fully control any of the four regions.
Elsewhere, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia’s Ust-Luga port after two explosions on Sunday, regional officials said. Local media reported that Ukrainian drones had attacked the port, causing a gas tank to explode.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of Russia’s Kingisepp district, where the port is located, said there had been no casualties but that the area had been placed on high alert.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia’s second largest natural gas producer, Novatek, 100 miles south-west of St Petersburg. In a press statement to the Russian media outlet RBC, the company said the fire was the result of an “external influence”. It also said it had paused operations at the port.
The Fontanka news outlet reported that two drones had been detected flying towards St Petersburg on Sunday morning, but that they were redirected towards Kingisepp.

The Russian defence ministry did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Smolensk region, and that two more had been shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed that a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St Petersburg on Thursday.
News of the attacks came as Ukraine’s military played down Russia’s capture of the small village of Krokhmalne in Kharkiv region as a “temporary phenomenon”.
“We simply don’t report on the repulse of 100-200 metres, and for Russian propagandists, any victory must be presented to explain why they lost 7,055 soldiers at the front in the Khortytsia zone of responsibility in January alone,” the Ukrainian ground forces command spokesperson, Volodymyr Fityo, told the Ukrainian digital broadcasting station Hromadske on Sunday.
Fityo said the frontlines were shifting daily and that Ukrainian troops had been moved to prepared reserve positions to hold the defence and prevent Russia from advancing further.
The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces claimed on Sunday that Russia had lost 376,030 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. The number, which has not been independently verified, includes 760 casualties in the past day.
The figures, which cover the period from the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022 to 21 January 2024, also include details such as the number of weapons, vehicles and defence systems Ukraine believes Russia has lost.
According to the release, this includes 6,181 tanks, 11,466 armoured fighting vehicles, 11,862 vehicles and fuel tanks, 8,875 artillery systems and 968 multiple-launch rocket systems.

3XCY8Y3DQD_TQE7640AGQ92A4P,Thousands brave Sydney heatwave conditions to demand ceasefire in Gaza in week 15 of protests,Emily Wind,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/21/thousands-brave-sydney-heatwave-conditions-to-demand-ceasefire-in-gaza-in-week-15-of-protests,"Widad Waqqad, 20, has been attending demonstrations for Palestine since she was a young girl. This Sunday was no different as she joined hundreds of others in Sydney’s Hyde Park despite the 34C heat.
Sunday marked the 15th pro-Palestine rally in Sydney since 7 October, with thousands gathering in demonstrations across the country demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. When Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, it killed about 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Since then, more than 24,000 Palestinians have been killed, including thousands of children, in Israeli bombardments.

Widad and her mother, Abeer, are Palestinian and have family living in the West Bank, including Abeer’s sister. Abeer said it was “tragic [and] heartbreaking” to see what was happening, although she was thankful her family were safe.
“What’s going on there is wrong, regardless of who it is, so even if we weren’t Palestinian we would still be supporting this cause,” Widad said.
Sunday’s rally in Sydney was moved from its usual location to a more shaded area but the heatwave conditions did not stop people from attending, with many donning Palestinian keffiyehs and raising signs and flags to show their support.
One of the rally’s organisers, Damian Ridgwell, called on the Australian government to “unconditionally come out and demand Israel cease the killing”.
“If you want the killing to end, demand the killers to stop their bombing,” he said. “It is totally inadequate to make out as if this is a conflict between two equal sides … Stop calling it self-defence, it is a genocide that is happening in Gaza.”
Organisers took aim at the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, for her visit to Israel, where she met the foreign minister, Israel Katz, and the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, among others.
Wong has backed steps towards a ceasefire but said this could not be “one-sided”. She reportedly told Katz that the Australian people had “strong concerns about the civilian death toll and the dire humanitarian situation” and wanted “a just and enduring peace that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security”.
The Palestinian activist Assala Sayara described Wong’s visit to the region as “tokenistic” and only serving the interests of politicians, rather than affected communities.
Sayara said organisers were “not stopping” and planned to continue their protests as the new year begins.

“We are in pain, but we cannot sit with that pain,” she said. “We will channel this pain and use it for our strength to mobilise, to campaign, to name and shame and to continue to chant for a liberated Palestine.
“The occupation isn’t only within the borders of Palestine, the effect of the occupation goes beyond those borders and we see it through the families that have siblings or parents or relatives in Gaza or the whole of Palestine, we see it in the pain of them wanting to go back home but because of the Israeli occupation they’re [not able to].”
Protesters at Sunday’s rally also called for the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to support South Africa’s case against Israel at the international court of justice. South Africa has brought a case to the ICJ accusing Israel of committing genocide in its military response to the 7 October Hamas attack.
Albanese has previously suggested court cases will not help achieve peace between Israel and Palestine, and said Australia did not “intend to be a participant in the process” brought by South Africa. He said the Australian government would instead focus on “a political solution” based on “a pathway to security and peace and prosperity in the region”.
Nick Teane, who attended Sunday’s rally and lives in Albanese’s seat of Grayndler, said if he could say one thing to Albanese it would be: “Stand up for your principles.”
“He was one of the prime movers for the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine and he can’t bring himself to say to America, ‘Stop it.’ He hasn’t got the courage,” he said.
“I’m very angry,” he said. “I’m middle class, I’m well-off and lucky and I’ve had a great life … but I can’t stand seeing things getting worse and worse and worse.
“On the one hand we support Ukraine against the Russian invasion but we don’t support the Palestinians against the Israeli invasion – complete double standard.”
Jackie and Neil Dand, also longtime supporters of the Palestinian cause, have travelled from Windsor to Hyde Park for the last 14 demonstrations.
Their message to the government is simple: “Listen to the people.”"
4DXUE9TSFS_XKE4DI1FZKVX08G,Hostile architecture is making our cities even less welcoming,Eva Wiseman,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/21/hostile-architecture-is-making-our-cities-even-less-welcoming,"It’s one of those things that, once you’ve seen, you can’t unsee. Once you’ve noticed the curved benches, the spikes embedded in doorways, the posts made for leaning rather than sitting, the carefully placed railings… even the planters placed in careful rows outside shops, you can no longer walk through a city without thinking about the fact that it is designed to prevent comfort.
I’ve written before about the permanent blind spot I developed in my right eye, a “persistent migraine aura” that hovers now at the centre of my computer screen; walking through public spaces where walls are decorated at waist-height with bright metal fins is a similar experience, a constant shimmering reminder of a particular pain. They call these sharp fins and benches “defensive design” or, more accurately, “hostile architecture”, where the built environment purposefully guides and restricts behaviour. It’s intended to deter homeless people from resting between its sharp or awkward edges but, increasingly, it has the added effect of making a city less comfortable for everyone else.
I find these sanitised spaces make everybody rush through them, meaning there’s less opportunity for chance encounters, for communities to form, for idle thought. Rather than making an area feel more safe, these designs impact us in mean and insidious ways, partly because few people would rather lean on a pole than sit on a chair when waiting for their bus, and because uneven surfaces make using a wheelchair or buggy much harder. But also because these grim balls and spikes are a reminder of how we are all being controlled the second we step outside and how, should we take a wrong turn one day and experience homelessness ourselves, the city would change shape.
After Suella Braverman suggested that rough sleeping was a “lifestyle choice”, cities saw police officers dispersing homeless people by throwing out their tents. This year, the Vagrancy Act (which made rough sleeping a criminal offence as a response to homelessness among soldiers following the Battle of Waterloo) celebrates its 200th birthday. The government has pledged to scrap it. But instead of getting rid of the act altogether – an acknowledgment that criminalisation is more likely to push someone further away from services that help them move off the streets, rather than resolve the causes of homelessness –, they are bringing in new measures to replace it.
These new measures are just as punitive: police can prosecute rough sleepers or anyone who appears to be homeless, if they say they’re “likely to cause” a “nuisance”. Under the new criminal justice bill, this includes “excessive smells” and using “insulting” words. Punishment includes prison and fines of up to £2,500.
In 2022, a civil liberties organisation handed out legal advice cards about the laws around Community Protection Notices (CPNs), powers often used today by police and council officers to criminalise behaviour associated with homelessness. Liberty were acting as lawyers for people restricted from things like “loitering” without an appointment, or being “in possession of any open containers or cups”, which they could potentially use to beg for money.
As if it isn’t dangerous, traumatic or humiliating enough to sleep on the street, you not only face punishment for doing so, but the architecture itself is also designed to move you on. A steel and concrete reminder that you are unwelcome here, a project in erasure. Last week, it was announced that an official count of the deaths of homeless people would no longer be published in England and Wales. The homelessness charity Crisis said this move would “only ensure this needless suffering continues out of sight”.
Walking through the city I have the growing feeling that our government is more interested in removing homeless people from view than removing homelessness itself. In the US, there’s evidence that backs this up; cities there are spending more on criminalising and displacing rough sleepers than it costs to house them. “Sweeps, incarceration, enforcement of anti-panhandling laws and hostile architecture, after all, come with a hefty price tag estimated to be more than $31,000 per person, per year,” reports Jacobin. “The annual cost of providing supportive housing, according to the same analysis, is $10,051 – or less than a third of the cost of criminalisation.”
It’s becoming more and more clear that we are welcome in public spaces only if we are moving fast and spending money. And yet, we are all one missed rent payment, one bad boyfriend, one sharp new policy away from poverty or homelessness. Last year, record numbers of people sought help in accessing homeless services, food banks and energy bill support, Citizens Advice reported, amid the “cost of living crisis”. This phrase – we use it so casually today, immunised against its real meaning, which is the extortionate price of staying alive. These spikes are a grim illustration of how public spaces are increasingly not for the public at all. While billionaires build underground bunkers, and suburban doorbell security cameras monitor every passerby’s movement, as I pass another sloping bench, this hostile architecture feels like a concrete embodiment of a society at war with itself.

5P1T5I252R_STKYUT4QDO09949,Notes on chocolate: comfort is at hand for these cruel months,Annalisa Barbieri,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/21/notes-on-chocolate-annalisa-barbieri-comfort-is-at-hand-for-these-cruel-months,"We are almost through January, which is one of the hardest months. I always think of January and February as being the offspring of Spartan parents: no mollycoddling and left on a mountainside to survive or die.
What better antidote to this than chocolate? I started with Lina Stores Cioccolato Bianco al Caffè, £8.95/100g, a white chocolate bar filled with coffee gianduia. (Lina stores used to sell the best pandoro ever made, by Brera Milano, but no longer; if anyone sees this for sale LMK.) White chocolate and coffee is satisfyingly sweet and comforting for this time of year.
I recently discovered, via a free sample handed out at a Christmas fair, Lindt’s Caramel with a Touch of Sea Salt, £1.95/100g. It’s not super dark, but at 47% cocoa it feels dark and the crunch of caramel gives it some interest. A good one if you are a dark-choc lover, but still need a bit of comfort. And, as we’ve established, that’s everyone at this time of year.
Also: Toblerone. Nothing has ever beaten the sensation of locking jaws on one of its duty free-size pieces and, although I find it almost unbearably sweet these days, I do have a bar of its Orange Twist (with ginger), £5/360g, on my desk for moments of gloom.
At the other end of the scale for the craft chocolate aficionados, I have a wonderful treat. Table’s Tanzania 72%, £6.50/70g. With a conching time of 72 hours (I love the geeky details they put on their wrappers), this is slow-melt, super smooth, highly flavoured, very low acidity tasting chocolate. It rightly won Silver at the Academy of Chocolate Awards in 2022.

5UOKCU5DH0_A1FOMT3BGJXRMJO,Jeremy Hunt claims Nigel Lawson’s mantle as he teases tax cuts,Cash Boyle,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/20/jeremy-hunt-claims-nigel-lawsons-mantle-as-he-teases-tax-cuts,"Jeremy Hunt has compared himself to former tax-cutting chancellor Nigel Lawson, as he joined Rishi Sunak in teasing further potential cuts in the spring budget.
Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the chancellor drew comparisons with the late Lawson, who was known for slashing personal taxation while serving in the Thatcher government.
Hunt said: “Just as Nigel Lawson positioned the City of London for the finance boom in the 1980s, this period of Conservative government has seen the UK positioned for the massive technological boom we’re set to see in the coming years.”
Lawson was appointed chancellor of the exchequer in 1983, delivering six budgets until his resignation in 1989. He began a tax-cutting process in 1986 that intended to cut the basic rate of income tax, initially from 30% to 29%. Two years later, the rate was cut to 25%.
Hunt’s commitment to cutting taxes has been echoed by the prime minister, who promised to “always prioritise tax cuts to put more of people’s money back in their pockets”.
Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Sunak said the government had been able to introduce a reduction in national insurance contributions because his party had run the economy in a “disciplined way”.
Hunt announced in November that the main rate of national insurance would be reduced from 12% to 10%, in a move the Treasury said represents “the largest ever cut to national insurance”.
The policy took effect from 6 January, meaning 27 million workers should soon see an uplift. While heralded as a win, personal income tax thresholds remaining frozen until 2028 leave lingering doubts as to how beneficial this policy will be.
Hunt has faced pressure to take action against this fiscal drag, but has so far declined to do so.
Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary, said: “Jeremy Hunt’s words will read hollow to the millions of people who have been left worse off after 14 years of economic failure.
“Prices are still rising in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are soaring and the average family will be £1,200 worse off under the Tories’ tax plan.
“Britain needs change and a Labour government, not five more years of Conservative failure.”"
68L3WZLKCG_93YK2CYEWFO2RE5,"Arctic zombie viruses in Siberia could spark terrifying new pandemic, scientists warn",Robin McKie,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/21/arctic-zombie-viruses-in-siberia-could-spark-terrifying-new-pandemic-scientists-warn,"Humanity is facing a bizarre new pandemic threat, scientists have warned. Ancient viruses frozen in the Arctic permafrost could one day be released by Earth’s warming climate and unleash a major disease outbreak, they say.
Strains of these Methuselah microbes – or zombie viruses as they are also known – have already been isolated by researchers who have raised fears that a new global medical emergency could be triggered – not by an illness new to science but by a disease from the distant past.
As a result, scientists have begun planning an Arctic monitoring network that would pinpoint early cases of a disease caused by ancient micro-organisms. Additionally, it would provide quarantine and expert medical treatment for infected people in a bid to contain an outbreak, and prevent infected people from leaving the region.
“At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread north,” said geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University. “By contrast, little attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far north and then travel south – and that is an oversight, I believe. There are viruses up there that have the potential to infect humans and start a new disease outbreak.”
This point was backed by virologist Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. “We don’t know what viruses are lying out there in the permafrost but I think there is a real risk that there might be one capable of triggering a disease outbreak – say of an ancient form of polio. We have to assume that something like this could happen.”
In 2014, Claverie led a team of scientists who isolated live viruses in Siberia and showed they could still infect single-cell organisms – even though they had been buried in permafrost for thousands of years. Further research, published last year, revealed the existence of several different viral strains from seven different sites in Siberia and showed these could infect cultured cells. One virus sample was 48,500 years old.
“The viruses we isolated were only able to infect amoebae and posed no risk to humans,” said Claverie. “However, that does not mean that other viruses – currently frozen in the permafrost – might not be able to trigger illnesses in humans. We have identified genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known human pathogens, for example.”
Permafrost covers a fifth of the northern hemisphere and is made up of soil that has been kept at temperatures below zero for long periods. Some layers have remained frozen for hundreds of thousands of years, scientists have discovered.
“The crucial point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark and lacks oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological material,” Claverie told the Observer last week. “You could put a yoghurt in permafrost and it might still be edible 50,000 years later.”
But the world’s permafrost is changing. The upper layers of the planet’s main reserves – in Canada, Siberia and Alaska – are melting as climate change affects the Arctic disproportionately. According to meteorologists, the region is heating up several times faster than the average rate of increase in global warming.
However, it is not melting permafrost directly that poses the most immediate risk, added Claverie. “The danger comes from another global warming impact: the disappearance of Arctic sea ice. That is allowing increases in shipping, traffic and industrial development in Siberia. Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to drive vast holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and ores.
“Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The effects could be calamitous.”

This point was stressed by Koopmans. “If you look at the history of epidemic outbreaks, one of the key drivers has been change in land use. Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been linked to the spread of urbanisation in Africa. And that is what we are about to witness in the Arctic: a complete change in land use, and that could be dangerous, as we have seen elsewhere.”
Scientists believe that permafrost – at its deepest levels – may contain viruses that are up to a million years old and so will be far older than our own species, which is thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago.
“Our immune systems may have never been in contact with some of those microbes, and that is another worry,” said Claverie. “The scenario of an unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal coming back at us, although unlikely, has become a real possibility.”
For that reason, Claverie and others are working with UArctic, the University of the Arctic – an international educational network in the polar region – on plans to establish quarantine facilities and provide medical expertise that could pinpoint early cases and treat them locally to try to contain the infection.
“We now face a tangible threat and we need to be prepared to deal with it. It is as simple as that.”"
6FKLAIIQT1_XDWQM6G48LVPYSF,Pasquarosa: From Muse to Painter review – like watching a summer sunrise,Laura Cumming,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/21/pasquarosa-from-muse-to-painter-estorick-collection-london-review-pasquarosa-marcelli,"She signed herself Pasquarosa, going by her first name only. The word appears discreetly lettered on the covers of books, on sweet boxes and franked envelopes in her paintings, as if she was trying to make it blend in. Even when there is nowhere else to put it but the conventional corner of the canvas, Pasquarosa’s signature is always delicately low-toned, so that it never drags the eye away from the joyous subjects of her art.
The Italian artist Pasquarosa Marcelli (1896-1973) painted clouds of indigo pansies and hyacinths unfurling in waxy blue curlicues, glowing orange zinnias and pink cineraria, their daisy eyes becoming one with the embroidered panel on the wall behind them. She painted striped tablecloths, red fans and ordinary white teacups as if they were the greatest pleasures on earth.
The song of her colours is carried by the exuberant vigour of her brush. To walk into this show at the Estorick Collection, in bleak midwinter, is like watching a summer sun come up.
It is almost a century since Pasquarosa’s last show in this country, at the Arlington Gallery in London’s Old Bond Street in 1929. A British critic, enchanted by her still lifes, described her as “the best-known woman painter in Italy”. But time passes, tastes change, and Pasquarosa has been so forgotten that it is unlikely many people know her name either here or in Italy. Her paintings are still cheaply available online.
It is true that her subjects are simple arrays of objects generally confined (like Morandi) to a tabletop. It is also true that her love of what she’s looking at is as wholehearted and immediate as the picture itself. But look at a painting such as Calendule, showing a dense cluster of marigolds shoved at a jaunty angle into a bright green vase. It could have been too loud, cack-handed or coarse, but instead she has held it all together by balancing the circle of marigolds between two horizontal swathes of black wall and white tablecloth.
Pasquarosa was 18 when she ventured this early work. Born into poverty in the rural commune of Anticoli Corrado in the Lazio region, she had no formal education. Her zeal to learn came from watching other people paint, first as an artist’s model in Rome from the age of 16, then as the companion of the figurative painter Nino Bertoletti. Her heroism is that she just keeps at it, year after year, training herself, until the delight of what she sees is densely and directly communicated on the canvas.
The catalogue – which offers barely a word on her art, concerning itself mainly with her life and times and all the famous men she knew, from Pirandello to De Chirico to Carlo Levi – describes Pasquarosa, early on, as illiterate. If this is true, she made the most rapid ground. Fat letters lie on bright tables in her art, like the true gifts they are, and one of Bertoletti’s portraits of his future wife shows her reading aloud to their younger son while his brother twangs noisily on a guitar. But it is such a dull painting. The better-known husband is terminally conventional by comparison with the wife.
Pasquarosa favours colour over line every time; is always more interested in the group glow of violets, say, than the delicate form of any single flower. She paints in lush dabs and dapples of high-calorie oil, the marks often the very shape of the petals described. This is ideal for heads of hydrangea, especially those strange agglomerations of multicoloured confetti that she manages to convey so well, and so counterintuitively, in oil rather than watercolour.
And even when shifting from objects to people, her benign and ingenuous method seems to call forth something equally innocent in return. The Italian painter Felice Carena, for whom she modelled, appears here on a piece of pressed cardboard as a pale face with all-seeing blue eyes, surrounded by a marvellous orange beard and hair. It is a compelling combination of knowledge and naivety.
Pasquarosa never stopped working, and had many exhibitions, even when the successive -isms of 20th-century art had put the easel still life fairly out of fashion. Her success, like her enterprise, seems to run in parallel with the struggle for women’s right to education and to the vote in Italy (not achieved until 1945).
Best of all, in this show, is Jug and Little Bird, painted at some unknown time between 1918 and 1930 (the works are not dated, and nobody seems to have recorded the progress of her art). A sturdy jug raises a bird up on its lip like a strongman lifting a beautiful acrobat high in the air on the palm of his hand. The buoyancy of aspiration is as definitive as the shapely forms. Pasquarosa loved what she saw, but always took it further. These are paintings to gladden the heart.
Pasquarosa: From Muse to Painter is at the Estorick Collection, London, until 28 April"

The Zone of Interest
Anatomy of a Fall
Past Lives
Poor Things
Priscilla
Imagine an alternative reality in which the Academy rewarded creative risks and artistic daring. Instead of the usual prestige plodders, we could see the slippery courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall or the riotously batshit Poor Things in with a real chance of winning. But my pick would be Jonathan Glazer’s chilling masterpiece, The Zone of Interest, which has haunted me since I first watched it eight months ago.
Justine Triet – Anatomy of a Fall
Jonathan Glazer – The Zone of Interest
Yorgos Lanthimos – Poor Things
Christopher Nolan – Oppenheimer
Sofia Coppola – Priscilla
Christopher Nolan is a frontrunner for his blitzkrieg approach to Oppenheimer. And why not? There’s certainly a lot of very emphatic direction going on in the film. But my choice would be to reward a directorial hand that doesn’t repeatedly punch the audience: the delicacy of Sofia Coppola’s handling of Priscilla or the unshowy smarts of Justine Triet’s gripping Anatomy of a Fall.
Andrew Scott – All of Us Strangers
Jeffrey Wright – American Fiction
Nicolas Cage – Dream Scenario
Cillian Murphy – Oppenheimer
Colman Domingo – Rustin
Comic performances tend to be undervalued by awards voters, which is why I would be thrilled to see Nicolas Cage’s hilarious, vanity-free turn in Dream Scenario in contention, or a reward for Jeffrey Wright’s impeccably crisp and acidic line readings in American Fiction. But my pick in this category is Andrew Scott, who broke my heart in practically every frame of All of Us Strangers.
Emma Stone – Poor Things
Teyana Taylor – A Thousand and One
Sandra Hüller – Anatomy of a Fall
Natalie Portman – May December
Greta Lee – Past Lives
Once again, the best actress category is a crowded field. Relative newcomers Greta Lee, a magnetic delight in Past Lives, and the superb Teyana Taylor in A Thousand and One, come up against more established names – a fabulously spiteful and synthetic Natalie Portman in May December and the magnificent Sandra Hüller. But Emma Stone takes it: her performance in Poor Things is utterly fearless.
Charles Melton – May December
Dominic Sessa – The Holdovers
Glenn Howerton – BlackBerry
Mark Ruffalo – Poor Things
Paul Mescal – All of Us Strangers
The supporting acting categories are where we make discoveries – newcomer Dominic Sessa’s star-making turn in The Holdovers announces a considerable talent – and rediscoveries: It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Glenn Howerton is almost unrecognisable in BlackBerry. My pick, though, is Riverdale actor Charles Melton, who delivers a heart-wrenching turn as a grown man scarred by childhood trauma in May December.
Da’Vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers
Sandra Hüller – The Zone of Interest
Julianne Moore – May December
Claire Foy – All of Us Strangers
Eva Green – The Three Musketeers
Both Sandra Hüller and Julianne Moore deliver their very best performances as the very worst of people, a Nazi wife and a child abuser respectively. Eva Green is irresistibly treacherous as the vampy Milady in both last year’s Three Musketeers films. But the frontrunner in this category is also my favourite: the sublime Da’Vine Joy Randolph, providing the heart and the soul of Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers.
Four Daughters
Beyond Utopia
Apolonia, Apolonia
20 Days in Mariupol
The Eternal Memory
This year, best documentary seems particularly hard to call from the pre-announced shortlist. Four Daughters, Kaouther Ben Hania’s formally daring hybrid documentary about the impact of radicalisation on a Tunisian mother and daughters, is a standout for me. But equally, I adored Madeleine Gavin’s Beyond Utopia, a propulsive real-life thriller about people fleeing from North Korea, and was fascinated by the intimate, intertwined relationship between film-maker Lea Glob and her painter subject in Apolonia, Apolonia.
Past Lives
Anatomy of a Fall
Enys Men
Poor Things
Infinity Pool
On Oscar night, it will probably be a title fight between Oppenheimer, Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon. My own favourite film, Past Lives, has a slim chance of making the 10-strong nomination list, which would be gratifying. Meanwhile, Enys Men has zero possibility of nomination (boo!), while other Brit-pic faves such as Rye Lane and How to Have Sex aren’t eligible this year.
Celine Song – Past Lives
Justine Triet – Anatomy of a Fall
Mark Jenkin – Enys Men
Christopher Nolan – Oppenheimer
Greta Gerwig – Barbie
After his triumph at the Golden Globes, Chistopher Nolan seems set for a long overdue best director Oscar. French film-maker Justine Triet deserves recognition for her Palme d’Or winner Anatomy of a Fall, but my own vote goes to Korean-Canadian feature first-timer Celine Song, whose Past Lives has the pitch-perfect confidence of a seasoned director. A star is born!
Cillian Murphy – Oppenheimer
Teo Yoo – Past Lives
Barry Keoghan – Saltburn
Jeffrey Wright – American Fiction
Andrew Scott – All of Us Strangers
Cillian Murphy is rightfully the bookies’ favourite for his extraordinarily nuanced title role in Oppenheimer – a performance captured in giant-screen closeup that turns his face into a vast landscape of complex micro-expressions. Plaudits, too, to German-South Korean star Teo Yoo for his devastatingly understated role in Past Lives, proving the maxim that great acting is all about reacting.
Lily Gladstone – Killers of the Flower Moon
Sandra Hüller – Anatomy of a Fall
Emma Stone – Poor Things
Mary Woodvine – Enys Men
Greta Lee – Past Lives
Lily Gladstone provides the beating heart of Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and she has huge support among Academy voters and international audiences. Sandra Hüller’s multilingual turn in Anatomy of a Fall is another masterclass from a peerless performer, while Emma Stone gives it her all in Poor Things. And honourable mention to Mia Goth for the year’s most out there performance in Infinity Pool.
Charles Melton – May December
Ryan Gosling – Barbie
Mark Ruffalo – Poor Things
John Magaro – Past Lives
Sterling K Brown – American Fiction
After his popular Golden Globes win, Robert Downey Jr (Oppenheimer) is in pole position to take home the trophy on Oscar night. But my vote goes to Alaska-born Charles Melton, who quietly holds his own in the company of Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman, both stellar screen actors at the top of their game, in Todd Haynes’s eerily low-key melodrama May December.
Da’Vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers
Sandra Hüller – The Zone of Interest
Penélope Cruz – Ferrari
Viola Davis – Air
Danielle Brooks – The Color Purple
Another vote for Sandra Hüller, for a very different performance in Jonathan Glazer’s icily disturbing The Zone of Interest. But it’s Golden Globe winner Da’Vine Joy Randolph who deserves Oscar success for the warmth and depth she brings to Alexander Payne’s bittersweet retro charmer The Holdovers. Also, hooray for Penélope Cruz, who really fires the engines of Ferrari.
Jerskin Fendrix – Poor Things
Mica Levi – The Zone of Interest
Daniel Pemberton – Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
Robbie Robertson – Killers of the Flower Moon
Laura Karpman – American Fiction
My most listened-to score of 2023 was Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen’s ambient accompaniment to Past Lives, reminiscent of Eiko Ishibashi’s Drive My Car soundtrack from 2021. Like Icelandic maestro Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score for A Haunting in Venice, Past Lives was eligible but not in the shortlist announced last month. Luckily, British musician Jerskin Fendrix has made the shortlist for Poor Things – his music unlocks the emotive power of Lanthimos’s strange gem.
The Zone of Interest
All of Us Strangers
Anselm
Beau Is Afraid
Showing Up
Choosing just five nominees was hard; picking a winner, however, was easy. Since Cannes, The Zone of Interest has stayed on my mind and under my skin: Jonathan Glazer’s immaculately constructed portrait of a Nazi family living on the other side of the Auschwitz wall presents the Holocaust as it hasn’t previously been filmed, vast atrocities all the more overwhelming for going unseen, hushed away behind dahlia beds.
Jonathan Glazer – The Zone of Interest
Ari Aster – Beau Is Afraid
Yorgos Lanthimos – Poor Things
Hlynur Pálmasson – Godland
Alice Rohrwacher – La Chimera
I shan’t complain when Christopher Nolan most likely wins his long-awaited Oscar: Oppenheimer represents a peak for his scientific approach to film craft and his cool fixation on destructive masculinity. But Glazer outdid him on formal exactitude and jolting historical perspective, while I also thrilled to more fanciful directorial visions last year, from Rohrwacher’s earthy magical realism to Lanthimos’s baroque Franken-fantasy to Aster’s nightmare absurdism.
Franz Rogowski – Passages
Riz Ahmed – Fingernails
Josh O’Connor – La Chimera
Thomas Schubert – Afire
Andrew Scott – All of Us Strangers
This was a banner year for queer lives on film, normalised without being shorn of complexity and pathos. For me, best actor is a virtual coin-toss between two extraordinary versions of this brief. Playing a gay man isolating himself in the past, Scott’s is an aching study in solitude, whereas Rogowski is both incandescent and infuriating as a polysexual artist who either loves too much or not all.
Sandra Hüller – Anatomy of a Fall
Julianne Moore – May December
Emma Stone – Poor Things
Tia Nomore – Earth Mama
Michelle Williams – Showing Up
The line between lead and supporting performances can be debatable. The presumed best actress frontrunner is Lily Gladstone, potent in, but frequently absent from, Killers of the Flower Moon; many assumed she’d go supporting. Julianne Moore is hardly supporting Natalie Portman in the icy duality study May December, though that’s where she’s being campaigned; I’m promoting her. But there’s no ambiguity about Sandra Hüller’s film-owning tour de force.
Jamie Bell – All of Us Strangers
Jacob Elordi – Saltburn
David Krumholtz – Oppenheimer
Daniel Henshall – The Royal Hotel
Nathan Lane – Beau Is Afraid
It can feel random which actors get singled out from ensembles. Robert Downey Jr won a Golden Globe for his fine, lizardy villain in Oppenheimer, but I would as happily give his spot to co-stars Matt Damon, Jason Clarke or the especially underrated Krumholtz. Paul Mescal won the British independent film award for All of Us Strangers, but it’s Jamie Bell’s finely etched work as a father reckoning with his emotional distance that tore me up.
Merve Dizdar – About Dry Grasses
Hong Chau – Showing Up
Kerrie Hayes – Blue Jean
Marin Ireland – Eileen
Patti LuPone – Beau Is Afraid
It’s pleasing how much more global the Academy’s choices have become of late, thanks to the expansion of its membership. Though Hollywood still dominates, non-English-language films and performances get a fairer shake than they used to. But much depends on the profile and pockets of the distributor: with little promotion, Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s peak-form moral panorama About Dry Grasses never entered the conversation, even for Dizdar’s subtly scorching, Cannes-laurelled work.
Godland
Perfect Days
The Taste of Things
Tótem
The Zone of Interest
Many might assume Palme d’Or and Golden Globe winner Anatomy of a Fall is the one to beat – but it isn’t eligible, the French Oscar selection committee having instead chosen lush epicurean romance The Taste of Things as their entry. That opens up the race. The Zone of Interest has a strong chance, though in the interests of spreading the wealth I’m rooting for an underdog in Iceland’s darkly magnificent colonial saga Godland.
Occupied City
All of Us Strangers
Barbie
Poor Things
The Zone of Interest
Even this newly adventurous, post-Parasite Academy is unlikely to vote a four-and-a-half hour Holocaust documentary as best film, yet Steve McQueen’s Occupied City really is among the year’s greatest. Like Glazer’s equally affecting The Zone of Interest, it speaks to our past and our present with an urgency that elevates it above a diverse, competitive field. But I wouldn’t be sad if Barbie won either.
Andrew Haigh – All of Us Strangers
Jonathan Glazer – The Zone of Interest
Greta Gerwig – Barbie
Yorgos Lanthimos – Poor Things
Celine Song – Past Lives
What a time to be alive and watching movies! Glazer, Lanthimos and Gerwig, all great directors, all working at the height of their powers. Meanwhile, Song’s debut is unbelievably assured, and Haigh’s decision to shoot his mystical family drama in his own childhood home demonstrates courageous vulnerability in the service of cinema. It’s that which makes All of Us Strangers my pick to win.
Leonardo DiCaprio – Killers of the Flower Moon
Jussi Vatanen – Fallen Leaves
Colman Domingo – Rustin
Jeffrey Wright – American Fiction
Cillian Murphy – Oppenheimer
Murphy’s atomic death stare would be an acceptable winner, Bradley Cooper’s onanistic Maestro performance would not. Ideally, though, I’d like to see a second Oscar for DiCaprio. He’s deployed his fading teen idol looks to killer effect here, embodying not just one rumpled Romeo character, but white America as a whole. It’s Scorsese’s most effective actor collaboration since Taxi Driver.
Emma Stone – Poor Things
Sandra Hüller – Anatomy of a Fall
Natalie Portman – May December
Lily Gladstone – Killers of the Flower Moon
Greta Lee – Past Lives
Stone should win, and probably will, for her self-created steampunk siren, a performance both technically impressive and joyously life-affirming. If not, a win for Gladstone would provide an uplifting addendum to the Academy’s fraught history of aggressively overlooking Native American achievement (see Sacheen Littlefeather in 73), especially if it helps secure a distribution deal for Gladstone’s other film of last year, Native-made Fancy Dance.
Ryan Gosling – Barbie
Paul Mescal – All of Us Strangers
Robert Downey Jr – Oppenheimer
Mark Ruffalo – Poor Things
Zoe Terakes – Talk to Me
Gosling’s performance is its own “supporting male” satire, but that may not be “Kenough”, when Robert Downey Jr is also on career-best form and non-binary Aussie actor Terakes is prompting a rethink of the category’s gender basis. Plus, who among us does not harbour a soft spot for Mark Ruffalo’s moustachioed misogynist in Poor Things? If only Terry-Thomas were still around to present the award.
Sandra Hüller – The Zone of Interest
Katherine Waterston – The End We Start From
Danielle Brooks – The Color Purple
Rosamund Pike – Saltburn
Da’Vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers
Rosamund Pike is the only awards-worthy aspect of Emerald Fennell’s overhyped pseudo class satire, but she is very very good in it, deserving an Oscar for her Britpop banter alone. Katherine Waterston is the ideal friend in a climate crisis, but doesn’t have the industry momentum. Hüller, on the other hand, could just nab it, with two inscrutably icy performances in one year.

7HGL49Y272_YOS80BQE9ARPSUM,"Jeremy Hunt, instead of blowing £10bn on tax cuts, why not spend it on boosting growth?",Will Hutton,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/jeremy-hunt-instead-of-blowing-billions-on-tax-cuts-spend-it-on-boosting-uk-growth,"Britain is unravelling in front of our eyes. No week passes without another dial on the economic, social and security dashboard flashing either amber or red. Thus last Friday we learned that after the closure of our last remaining steel blast furnaces in Port Talbot, Britain will become the only G20 country without the capacity to make virgin steel.
Meanwhile our Nato allies are increasingly concerned that Britain’s army is shrinking so fast that our military capacity is doubted. Fresh analysis from the Financial Times revealed that outrageously expensive housing means that most young adults now live at home until 34 – with all that means for family formation and the ability to adopt the full mantle of adulthood.
Yet we are told by the prime minister and chancellor not to worry. Tax cuts, the universal Tory panacea, are on the way. The “plan” is working so well that there will be not one but two fiscal events before the next election – the budget and the autumn statement – both aimed at delivering “tax cuts”. The chancellor argues that more dynamic economies in Asia or the US have lower taxation as the platform for their wealth generation, while the prime minister insists that low taxation is a moral proposition: people should choose how to spend their money, not the state. The housing market may be broken, deindustrialisation continues apace and our defence effort is enfeebled – but the national priority is tax cuts.
It is not. Self-serving American rightwing thinktanks keen to feather the nest of their plutocratic funders make a specious, ideological economic argument for tax cuts but, as the Institute for Government reported, there is scant evidence that they work. Economic dynamism comes not from low taxation but from high public investment and smart ways in which governments help high investment businesses better manage risks. Thus the US high tech sector is symbiotically linked to high US defence spending and in particular innovation spearheaded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Equally, whether in Singapore or Indonesia, the common thread across Asia is state-led investment and successful industrial policy. Of course, genuinely confiscatory tax rates force enterprise underground – but the idea that the current British tax regime is that confiscatory is bonkers. As for the moral argument for tax cuts, it ignores the case for what economists call “public goods”, ranging from health and education to libraries and museums. All are most effectively and cheaply provided collectively. That has always been true, but the better off that people become, the more they want better healthcare, education, ready access to justice, to start families when they choose, efficient public transport, to experience great art – and to feel secure. Richer societies want more public goods – not fewer.
None of this challenges the monomaniacal Tory obsession with tax cuts. The dishonesty unleashed by Brexit now suffuses its pitch to the electorate. A Brexit government cannot acknowledge that tax rates have to go up to compensate for the black hole in receipts caused by output now running annually at about £100bn lower because of Brexit and thus yielding less tax. But the omission means it becomes challenging to explain other truths – that taxes have risen because with an ageing population the demand for health and social care has soared; defence spending must be increased; public services, cut to the bone, cannot be cut further as courts crumble and local government goes bankrupt; and that for bridges, tunnels or electrification we have to invest more. Instead, the invitation is to blame welfare spending for all public spending pressure and say if that is addressed the overriding priority of cutting taxes is possible.
Yet truth will out. Britain’s real challenge is not to further disadvantage the poor but to devise its own smart ways of lifting investment. One means is to hand. The government does not need to invest and borrow on its own account, it can do it at arm’s length by offering to guarantee commercial bank loans to big investment projects like infrastructure – and pay out only rarely when and if the guarantee is called on. Britain is already experimenting with this model through the UK Infrastructure Bank’s £10bn “sovereign investment guarantee” to private banks that lend on infrastructure projects. None of the £10bn counts as public borrowing; only the much lower, separate £4.5bn risk capital the taxpayer puts up to back the guarantee. Bankers I talked to last week are enthusiastic; through the guarantee they are increasing green infrastructure lending they would not otherwise have undertaken.
But it’s all too small scale. The National Infrastructure Commission says British infrastructure spending needs to rise by at least £30bn a year. So here is the real choice. To use the potential “headroom” of £10bn for tax cuts: or to use the same money to treble the investment guarantee to £30bn and launch an infrastructure revolution. Public squalor can be redressed. Taxes don’t have to rise: we can have an investment boom and drive for net zero while they stay the same.
Equally, if tax receipts generally are at a 40-year high according to the House of Commons library (not the 70 years bandied about by anti-tax campaigners), taxes on the wealthy remain at a 40-year low. Wealth – in housing, land, pensions, art – has risen from three to seven times national income over the past 40 years. But the tax contribution of the wealthy remains stuck at 3.5% of national income – unsustainable, as both the Institute for Fiscal Studies director, Paul Johnson, and Labour MP Liam Byrne argue, the latter in his powerful book The Inequality of Wealth. Wealth owners must all contribute more to the exchequer than they currently do. Nor is it just a matter of fiscal justice; the pattern of demand that results – for underground cinemas, luxury yachts, private planes – pulls the economic structure out of kilter.
To starve the provision of public goods to succour the already gilded lives of the plutocratic rich is nonsensical. With a more balanced tax base Britain can raise public investment, repair its stricken public services and trigger the growth that will yield higher tax revenues so allowing the tax paid by the mass of ordinary taxpayers to be capped – and start to come down. Instead of Labour retreating from its £28bn green prosperity plan, as it is reported to be considering, it should start making this larger argument, of which its plan is part. The electorate knows that the country is unravelling and yearns for a credible alternative. The task is to spell out what that means – not collude with Tory tax-cutting monomania.

8019NUYNK7_6Z9TMJLFS0IBUDA,Judgement at Tokyo by Gary J Bass review – of war crimes and punishment,Neal Ascherson,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/21/judgement-at-tokyo-world-war-ii-on-trial-and-making-of-modern-asia-by-gary-j-bass-review-of-war-crimes-and-punishment,"Every lawyer, politician and historian in Europe and America remembers Nuremberg, the trial of surviving Nazi leaders after the second world war. Few remember Tokyo, the international tribunal that arraigned the surviving Japanese leadership. And yet Tokyo lasted for more than two years (1946-8), as against Nuremberg’s brisk 11 months (1945-6), produced a far taller mountain of documents and – in contrast to the German trial – found every single defendant guilty. The Tokyo judges intended to build on Nuremberg’s achievement, laying wider foundations for the code and practise of international law. But almost the only living and active memory of their efforts today is one dissenting opinion: the astonishing rejection of the tribunal itself and much of its evidence by the Indian judge, Radhabinod Pal. His views, in recklessly distorted and exaggerated versions, remain holy writ for Japan’s extreme nationalists to this day.
Pal was not the only dissenting judge. The verdicts and sentences (seven of the 28 defendants were hanged) rested on a fairly precarious majority, cobbled together by the short-tempered Australian court president, William Webb, in alliance with the “British and Commonwealth bloc” of judges. The prosecution team was headed by a blundering American alcoholic, Joseph Keenan, whose performance embarrassed everyone. (His British deputy, the “brainy” hardliner Arthur Comyns Carr, fumed at having to “act as an inebriate house attendant”). The defending advocates were an under-equipped mixture of Japanese lawyers and Americans flown in to cover their lack of English. The Soviet judge, in the usual Russian manner, treated the defenders as if they were defendants, and scolded them as propagandists for fascist imperialism. There were times when the trial seemed close to breakdown, as judges and prosecutors squabbled, and the Scottish judge, William Patrick, despaired over this “long collieshangie” (Scots dictionary: “noisy dispute, uproar, a dog-fight”). But when the British bloc proposed sacking Webb and Keenan, they collided with General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander in Japan, who “stopped the British cold”. For him, their plan was “a dastardly act to stab a man in the back”.
MacArthur was totally in charge of occupied Japan, in a way that no American had dominated occupied Germany. This was because the war had ended so differently. Nazi Germany was extinguished in battle; Japan surrendered to a negotiation proposal which – after Hiroshima and Nagasaki – became an offer it couldn’t refuse. The deal would leave a skeleton of Japanese institutions intact, above all the position of Emperor Hirohito. But war criminals would be punished. It was MacArthur who ordered the arrests and proclaimed the establishment of the International Military Tribunal. Meanwhile, as Gary Bass relates, he imposed liberal reforms including freedoms of speech and organisation, rights for women and abolition of the state Shinto cult.
As for the tribunal, MacArthur’s original hope seems to have been for a rapid American trial that would concentrate on Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and treat the US navy dead as victims of an act of murder. But President Truman was able to overrule him and widen the project into an international examination of aggressive war as a crime, and of imperial Japan’s horrific record of “crimes against humanity”. The prosecution reached back as far the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the 14-year war with China – including the vast Nanjing massacre – before moving on to the Pacific war that exploded at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.
But almost from the start, the court was plagued by doubts about its own legality. In July 1945, the victorious allies had issued the Potsdam Declaration, which Bass calls “one of the most brutal statements ever pronounced by any democratic government”. They demanded “complete disarmament, the permanent removal of expansionist Japanese leaders who had sought ‘world conquest’, and the disbanding of the empire”. Otherwise, they would inflict “the complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the devastation of the Japanese homeland”. (America’s possession of the atomic bomb was still a secret.) But was Potsdam enough to justify the court classifying the planning and launching of aggressive war as a crime? Some members of the court sought an international law precedent in the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, which grandly if vaguely outlawed war but failed to define aggression as criminal. The French judge invoked “natural law”, the “universal conscience”, as a better basis. In the end, the judges never agreed on how to describe their right to try individuals for crimes against peace or humanity. The majority simply dropped the subject and hoped for the best.
The Japanese response to the charges of aggressive war was broadly that they had fought in self-defence. The invasion of China, the accused argued, was necessary to stave off the threat of communism advancing eastwards from the Soviet Union. As Bass emphasises, the tribunal was sitting during the first Berlin confrontation of the cold war, which had not yet developed when the Nuremberg trial took place. Even more dramatically, the defenders argued that Pearl Harbor, and Japan’s simultaneous attacks on French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies and the British empire in Burma and Malaya, were also defensive. Surrounded by a tightening ring of hostile powers, Japan was being strategically and economically strangled to death; surely international law allowed a state to take military action against the threat of its own extinction. Japan, without oil resources of its own, had imported petroleum from Burma, from the Dutch empire, and above all from the US. But in July 1941, when Japanese forces moved into southern Indochina, America declared an almost total trade boycott, including an oil embargo. Tojo Hideki, the belligerent army minister who now became premier, warned: “Two years from now, we will have no petroleum for military use… ships will stop moving.” Secretly, the Japanese leadership concluded that war with America might be the only way to ensure national survival. Tension mounted until, on 26 November, Cordell Hull, President Roosevelt’s secretary of state, sent a note requiring Japan to pull out of China and Indochina – and break its tripartite treaty with Hitler and Mussolini – as the price for lifting the embargo. Some defenders called the Hull note a declaration of war, suggesting that the US wanted war but provoked Japan into taking the first action. In fact, Japan’s battle fleet had set off for Pearl Harbor on the very day that Hull’s note was delivered.
A second spurious plea claimed that the Pacific war had been a Japanese crusade to liberate Asia from European colonialism. But Bass shows that Japan’s “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” in the conquered empires was a mask for ruthless exploitation, while most of the many thousands of victims of Japanese atrocities were not white imperialists but Asian peasants. In court, accused leaders and commanders denied ordering or even knowing about these massacres and tortures. Evidence for the maltreatment of allied prisoners of war was clear – and often traceable back to Tojo’s own directives. But “for all the hideous abundance of evidence of conventional war crimes, the prosecution had more difficulty linking these deeds to the defendants”. The court fell back on “chain of command” convictions: a leader bore guilt for crimes in his area of responsibility whether he was provably aware of them or not.
Bass has written a massively long and detailed book, always lively and judgmental. He brings out not only the legal arguments, but the colour of the great tribunal itself: sharp sketches of the protagonists, of the stress on the multinational judges penned up month after month in the Imperial hotel, of Tojo Hideki among the seven shabby old men shuffling to the gallows in Sugamo prison. He shows warm sympathy for Togo Shigenori, the foreign minister, who dared to argue again and again for peace and against a war he knew Japan could not win (he died in prison). And Bass gives a balanced account of Radhabinod Pal’s “titanic” dissent. Pal alone pointed out the racism and hypocrisy implicit in the trial. Colonial empires were accusing another colonial empire of doing what they had done themselves; some of the judging powers had blatantly launched aggressive wars; why were Japanese atrocities “crimes against humanity” but not the American fire-obliteration of Tokyo and use of atomic bombs on civilians? As Bass points out, Pal lamely excused Japanese expansionism, but expressed unequivocal horror at the atrocities (his Japanese admirers today leave out those passages).
Hovering above the trial was an absence. Most people in Europe and America, and some of the judges, thought that Emperor Hirohito should be in the dock, if not on the gallows. He had presided over all the imperial conferences leading up to the war. But the surrender deal meant that he was untouchable, and MacArthur’s men instructed the lawyers to keep his role out of the proceedings. Not all of them did. The accused loyally insisted that the divine Hirohito had held no control over their decisions, until Tojo put his foot in it by saying that “no Japanese subject would go against the will of His Majesty”. In the years to come, the emperor appeared genuinely pained about the past, and yet ambiguous. When he listened to the death sentences on the radio, “the Imperial Palace only let it be known that he sighed and looked mournful”.

8FUE4BALX8_TQX3BQ1T554B7VZ,Connor Burns review – unoriginal prejudices dressed up in new clothes,Brian Logan,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/21/connor-burns-review-unoriginal-prejudices-standup-leicester-square-theatre,"‘The future of Scottish standup,” comedian Daniel Sloss has called Connor Burns, who now embarks on his first UK tour. On the basis of Vertigo, that’s not a particularly cheering forecast. It finds the Edinburgh man, aged 29, on the brink of a career breakthrough, reflecting on sexy accents, gender equality, and his journey from his working-class roots. We are discouraged from taking any of it remotely seriously, mind you, because “I’m a fucking idiot”, he says, and nothing in the show aspires to any significance whatsoever.
That’s fair enough in principle, if dispiriting when attached to the idea that anyone who likes comedy with substance is “arty-farty”. It also seeks impunity for the unlovely opinions that Burns’ jokes sometimes imply, like the one about women being rubbish at sports, or the one comparing Stephen Hawking to Henry Hoover. We’re very much in a Gervais-alike aren’t-I-shocking? realm here, where unoriginal prejudices are dressed up as sharp-eyed comedy. See Burns’ mockery of Gen Z kids with ADHD, for example, or his punchline about Madeleine McCann, which would last have felt fresh when Burns was in short trousers.
Novelty is likewise absent from his routine about cunnilingus, which reveals – no bold leap forward for standup, this – that men sometimes find the clitoris tricky to locate. At least that riff is pepped up by its goofy act-out, which finds our host receiving sexual instruction from a lesbian in a control tower. If the jokes here seldom bring new perspectives to bear, they can be well told, with neat reversals (see the gag about the deaf dog) and flashes of performing flair (as with the otherwise weak section on accents you wouldn’t wish to hear in the bedroom).
To the reheated chauvinism that Burns mainly offers, a veneer of 21st-century respectability is administered by hymns to the strong women in his life and remarks along the lines of “women are so much smarter than men”. Burns may go on to make better shows than Vertigo. In the meantime, his standup feels less like the future of comedy than a makeover applied to its tired past.

8P1ECMH957_7XYJ24SRTC6EQ2C,Starmer to defend RNLI and National Trust from ‘desperate’ Tory culture war,Kiran Stacey,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/starmer-defend-rnli-national-trust-desperate-tory-culture-war,"Keir Starmer will defend organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the National Trust on Monday, accusing the Conservatives of attacking them to stoke a “desperate” culture war.
The Labour leader will mount a forceful defence of the institutions during a speech to a civil society summit on Monday in his most outspoken response to Conservative criticisms of “woke” politics.
“The Tories seem set on sabotaging civil society to save their own skins,” Starmer will say. “They got themselves so tangled up in culture wars of their own making, that instead of working with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution – an organisation the late queen was patron of for 70 years – to find real solutions to stop the small boats, their rhetoric has helped demonise them.
“Instead of working with the National Trust so more people can learn about – and celebrate – our culture and our history, they’ve managed to demean their work. In its desperation to cling on to power, at all costs, the Tory party is trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect.”
The RNLI and National Trust have found themselves the unlikely targets of Conservative attacks in recent years, with Tory MPs accusing them of pursuing politically correct policies.
In 2019, the RNLI was criticised by Conservative backbenchers for spending money on anti-drowning charities abroad. It then came under fire in 2021 from Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who accused the institute of acting as a “taxi service for illegal immigration” because of its work helping distressed asylum seekers in the Channel.
The National Trust, Britain’s largest charity, has been embroiled in a battle over its stance towards rewilding Britain’s countryside and how to depict the links between the properties it oversees and the UK’s colonial legacy. In 2022 a group headed by a Conservative donor and including two “anti-woke” historians launched an attempt to gain control of the charity, while the Tory MP Andrew Murrison set up a parliamentary group to “scrutinise” its work.
Starmer will on Monday accuse the Conservatives of targeting the institutions to shore up the party’s weak poll position.
“Let me tell you, waging a war on the proud spirit of service in this country isn’t leadership,” he will say.
“It’s desperate. It’s divisive. It’s damaging. It comes to something when the Tories are at war with the National Trust. That’s what happens when politics of self-preservation prevail over commitment to service.”
In comments that echo David Cameron’s vision of the “big society”, he will also urge charities, community leaders and faith groups to play an active role in Britain’s public life.
“Cameron talked about the big society, but when austerity kicked in, we ended up with the poor society,” he will say.
“Now we need a new vision for a new era. A renewed social contract. A new focus on those who build the bonds that connect us, the communities that nurture us, the institutions that support families and provide a bridge between the state and the market: a society of service.”
This article was amended on 22 January 2024 to clarify text about the nature of the issues recently faced by the National Trust."
96GFHQRD46_QCNFNAPKASATOKN,Rwanda plan could fail first test in Lords as peers move to thwart Sunak’s bill,Shanti Das,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/rwanda-plan-could-fail-first-test-in-lords-as-peers-move-to-thwart-sunaks-bill,"Rishi Sunak is facing a possible defeat in the House of Lords this week over his controversial Rwanda deportation plan as peers prepare multiple bids to thwart its progress through parliament.
The first test will come on Monday when peers debate a motion laid by former Labour attorney general Peter Goldsmith, which seeks to delay the ratification of the new Rwanda treaty until the government can show the country is safe.
The international agreements committee, which is chaired by Lord Goldsmith and has four Conservative members, says that measures including an improved complaints process, training for Rwandan officials and a new asylum law guaranteeing people will not be returned to countries where they could be in danger must be in place before the treaty can be endorsed.
Any such changes would also need to be given time to “bed in” to ensure they work in practice. Once the government had supplied further evidence, it should then allow for a further debate before proceeding to ratification, Lord Goldsmith has said.
The motion will be debated by peers tomorrow, giving the prime minister a first indication of the extent of the opposition the Rwanda plan will face in the Lords. The motion is expected to receive support from Labour and the Lib Dems, as well as crossbench peers and potentially some on the “one nation” wing of the Conservative party.
In November last year, the UK supreme court ruled unanimously that the government’s Rwanda plan was unlawful, saying it breached the European convention on human rights as genuine refugees could be returned to their home countries where they might face harm. Its ruling also cited concerns about Rwanda’s poor record on human rights.
A few weeks later, the UK signed a treaty with Rwanda in which it agreed to address the safety concerns. The treaty needs to be ratified by parliament to come into effect.
The government also introduced a new bill, which is now heading into the House of Lords after a torrid passage last week through the Commons, which seeks to make clear in law that Rwanda is safe. Labour has called the entire plan a “farce” and a “gimmick”. Last week, three Conservatives frontbenchers resigned saying it was not tough enough.
Should the Goldsmith motion succeed and ministers accept it, it could delay the treaty for months and push back Rishi Sunak’s plans to start flights to Rwanda, putting him in a perilous position ahead of a general election. If ministers were to ignore it they would be required to explain why and could see it go against them in legal challenges further down the line.
In a separate bid to thwart the Rwanda plan, the Liberal Democrats are also set to launch a challenge on the Rwanda bill which will seek to kill off its passage through parliament for good. Lib Dem peers are set to table a “fatal motion” which will say that the current plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda breaches international law and will waste millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money that could be better spent on public services.
The Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: “Millions of pounds and months of squabbling later, there is still absolutely nothing to show for their failing Rwanda scheme. Our country cannot afford to waste any more time on a scheme that even senior Conservatives admit won’t work.”

To be successful, the motion would need to be backed by Labour and cross-bench peers. If passed, it would prevent the Rwanda bill receiving a second reading in the upper chamber. Fatal motions are not often successful but if it were to be, it could force the government back to the drawing board.
Initially announced in April 2022, the government’s Rwanda plan aims to send some asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda to have their claims processed there.
Anticipating further turmoil in a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, Rishi Sunak urged peers not to “frustrate” what he called “the will of the people”. “The treaty with Rwanda is signed and the legislation which deems Rwanda a safe country has been passed unamended in our elected chamber. There is now only one question: will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected house? Or will they get on board and do the right thing?” he said.
Recent polling by YouGov suggests about 77% of Conservative voters support the Rwanda plan compared with 20% of Labour voters and about 48% of Britons overall."

Cooper “can’t even get the name of the country right, talking about the Kigali government”, Coffey told the house, a hot wombat wrapped in tea towels. “We’re talking about Rwanda, a respected country that has recently been president of the Commonwealth.” Kigali is the capital of Rwanda. The Tories have sent three home secretaries there. It wasn’t the burn Coffey thought it was.
A party of dreg folk is taking us into a war in the Red Sea, under the command of a defence secretary, Grant Shapps, who pretended to be lots of nonexistent people online to promote a dodgy get-rich-quick scheme and once declared a lower insurance on ride-on lawnmowers a Brexit benefit. Perhaps Shapps’s Corinne Stockheath persona is an expert on marine warfare as well as online marketing. The war may be right. It may be wrong. But allowing Shapps to pursue it is like giving a ride-on lawnmower to a monkey, a monkey with improbably named imaginary friends. But it isn’t just that this final crumbling crop of Conservatives are idiots. Many of them are also evil.
“The law is our servant, not our master.” Which comic-book sci-fi supervillain dictator said this? Was it Darth Vader in the lost Star Wars Holiday Special (1978)? Was it Thanos, Titan’s eternal deviant warlord from the Marvel universe, or Darkseid, his tyrannical DC comics counterpart? Or was it Thulsa Doom, the demonic wizard enemy of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Iain Sinclair’s Nietzschean 1982 fantasy Conan the Barbarian? No. It was the Tory human and MP for Newark, Robert Jenrick, only last week!
Jenrick has form in finding the law an inconvenience, after his unlawful approval of the Tory donor and former Asian Babes porn magnate Richard Desmond’s billion-pound Isle of Dogs development in east London was called out in 2020. Ironically, Desmond’s popular pornographic magazine Barely Legal was significantly more legal than the approval of his housing development. I don’t know about you, but while I am sexually aroused by both legal and barely legal development approvals, development approvals that are actually illegal disgust me.
Perhaps this incident, and Jenrick’s April 2023 conviction for driving at a sickening 28mph above the speed limit, threatening slow-moving elderly Tory voters and slugs, explains his hatred of law. But even the Tories’ beloved Margaret Thatcher believed “The first duty of government is to uphold the law… [and when it doesn’t] nothing is safe – not home, not liberty, not life itself.” A government that’s above the law invokes spectres of administrations Europe has been glad to see the back of, abetted by Rishi Sunak’s attempts to cosy up to Italy’s former teenage neo-fascist activist Giorgia Meloni, with whom he shares an interest in pointing at mobile phones while laughing.
As our government fondles fascist tropes, I realise why the 2022 Finnish action film Sisu struck such a chord with me when I watched it over Christmas. It’s late 1944 in the Lapland war. The Nazis have lost control of Finland and we follow a single retreating Waffen-SS platoon, its tank commander Bruno Helldorf aware it’s game over for the Third Reich if and when he gets back to Berlin. So, while laying waste to the land behind him to render it useless for anyone hoping to reclaim it, Helldorf resolves to make off with as many local resources as he can – principally Finnish gold and Finnish women – to feather his nest for the future when the campaign he is a part of inevitably collapses. Sound familiar?
Because the Tories, and I beg forgiveness of anyone personally offended by this comparison, resemble nothing so much as Sisu’s rapidly retreating tank unit, laying waste to the health service, to theatres and art galleries, to crumbling schools, to international agreements, to our global reputation, to media impartiality, to the judicial system, to the scientific community, to the hopes and dreams of a generation of would-be musicians, to beloved and trusted cultural institutions, and to all of our rivers and beaches and wildlife, while they make off with the money they looted from PPE contracts, or the funds they lobbied government to give to their friends, or the paid positions they secured in the House of Lords. If anything, the current iteration of Conservatives makes Sisu’s rapacious cartoon fascists look like they lack ambition. Women and gold? When deliberately bankrupted councils are sold off to big business interests and run as investment zones, it will be a never-ending payday for Tory cronies.
But the thieving resource pirates of Sisu have reckoned without one thing – the retaliation of a middle-aged goldminer, Aatami, and his dog, whom everyone has underestimated, and with whom I and all the other underestimated middle-aged Liam Neeson fans identify enormously. A stupid online image criticising Keir Starmer for doing his job as a lawyer and defending clients, as the law requires him to, which the dirty tricks Tories released on Wednesday, shows they will be fighting the next election without any moral scruples, with the cooperation of the Tory press and cowed media. Where is our Aatami?
Well, luckily, we have dozens of them – Sharkey, Peter Stefanovic, Marina Purkiss, Chris Packham and all the online truth-tellers who forensically unspin the spin, all coalescing around the ferocious Finnish goldminer’s dog that is Carol Vorderman. Circulate their insights and throw a spanner in that tank. And remember, Robert Jenrick is our servant, not our master.

Trump’s 91 criminal charges across four cases did not stop him winning 98 out of 99 counties in Monday’s frigid Iowa caucuses, and interviews with his support base showed they accept his narrative of politically motivated prosecutions. He is leading opinion polls in New Hampshire and looks poised to become the Republican standard bearer.
“The court appearances are his campaign,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “He’s spending much less time than the other candidates in the key states. He’s not spending as much on TV advertising. He’s doing all kinds of things that candidates for president usually don’t do because he’s got an ace card that none of the others have.
“This has convinced not just his supporters but in a broad-based way the whole Republican party that he’s being oppressed, that Joe Biden is using the judicial system to try and put a stake in the heart of his toughest challenger for November. And they buy it.”
Trump’s recent court appearances have been voluntary, not obligatory, at a time when his Republican rivals are crisscrossing states in search of votes. Last week the 77-year-old former reality TV star showed up for a hearing in Washington DC to hear his lawyers argue that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. A day later he was in Des Moines, Iowa, for a Fox News town hall.
The duelling schedule evidently did him no harm in Iowa, where he romped to victory over the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, by nearly 30 percentage points, more than twice the biggest winning margin ever achieved by a Republican. During his speech in Des Moines, Trump nodded to his legal tribulations: “I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they’re using that for election interference.”
The following morning, he was in a Manhattan federal court – again by choice – to watch the selection of a jury that will decide whether he should pay damages for defamatory comments he made in office about the writer E Jean Carroll. Last year a jury concluded that Trump sexually abused her in a department store in 1996 and defamed her in 2022.
That evening he headed to Atkinson, New Hampshire, for a campaign rally where he boasted about his win in Iowa but told supporters: “If I didn’t get indicted all these times and if they didn’t unfairly go after me, I would have won, but it would have been much closer. I tell you, I don’t know if I would have made the trade. I might have just liked the position we’re in right now.”
Come Wednesday, it was back to New York and the Carroll case. This time Trump was animated, shaking his head at testimony he disliked, passing notes to his lawyers and speaking to them while jurors were in the room.
He was scolded by Judge Lewis Kaplan after a lawyer for Carroll complained that he was grumbling about the case so loudly that jurors could hear him. When the judge threatened to expel him, Trump retorted: “I would love it.” The judge admonished: “I know you would. You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.”
Outside the courtroom, the Republican frontrunner then held a press conference, describing the trial as “rigged” and Carroll as “a person I never knew”. He complained that Kaplan, a Bill Clinton appointee, was “a nasty judge” and a “Trump-hating guy” who was “obviously not impartial”.
Somehow he had made the case about himself rather than his victim. Maggie Haberman, author of Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America, told CNN: “He showed up for her testimony and so instead of us talking about her testimony we are talking about the fact that he was making noises, he was overheard whispering to his lawyer.”
She added: “He would have liked to have gotten thrown out because he would then claim he was a victim. It’s heads he wins, tails the other side loses.”
Trump was not in court on Thursday so he could attend his mother-in-law’s funeral in Florida. He will soon head back to New Hampshire to hold rallies ahead of Tuesday’s primary election, where he could in effect seal the Republican nomination. As endorsements from senior Republicans pour in, it seems that the party has made a collective decision to carry the legal baggage of a man who now openly brags that he has been indicted more often than Al Capone.

Charlie Sykes, editor of the Bulwark website and a former conservative radio host, said: “He’s going to have a courtroom campaign because Donald Trump relishes the idea of being the martyr. He thinks that being associated with these trials will actually help him in the polls and so far he’s not wrong. Every time he’s been indicted, he’s gone up.”
But Sykes believes that Trump’s decision to attend the trial involving E Jean Carroll could be a mistake as he pivots to general election voters. “How many Americans actually know about this case? There’s been such a firehose of indictments, hearings, charges. Now Donald Trump himself has decided that he is going to draw attention to a case that he’s already lost, that has found him liable for sexual assault.
“It’s hard for me to imagine any swing voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia or Milwaukee hearing for the first time about this case and thinking, yeah, this is the guy that I want to support for president.”
Anna Greenberg, a senior partner at polling firm GQR, also sees limitations in Trump’s gameplan. She said: “He saw that when he got indicted he got a major boost, and you saw it in the primary polls, and so he may be thinking if I engage with these trials against me and I rail and I attack, that’s going to continue to give me some kind of benefit.
“I think he already got the benefit. I don’t think there’s any additive benefit for him but I think there’s a real downside for him, which is that’s how he’s spending his time and not out on the campaign trail and doing the campaigning.”
Trump has pleaded not guilty in four state and federal criminal cases, including two claiming he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. This week his lawyers filed paperwork in another case – over his allegedly illegal retention of sensitive classified documents – arguing that intelligence agencies were politically biased against Trump.
Some observers fear that the scorched earth approach poses a far-reaching danger to civil society and American legal and political structures. Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, added: “Donald Trump is waging a concerted campaign to de-legitimize the justice system in America.
“He is trying to discredit not just prosecutors, but also judges and juries and the entire process of legal accountability and the damage is going to be long lasting and it’s going to be profound.”"
9MIBPGYV0D_QOLETV4U6CXM1CO,"Public will be at risk if Labour drops £28bn green plan, warns fire union chief",Kiran Stacey,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/public-risk-labour-drops-28bn-green-plan-fire-union-chief-matt-wrack,"The public will be put at risk if Keir Starmer drops his plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment, according to the head of the Fire Brigades Union, who warned that his members were already witnessing the effects of the climate crisis.
Matt Wrack, the FBU’s general secretary, urged the Labour leader not to scale back or delay the party’s green scheme, which he said was essential for combating a steep increase in floods, wildfires and storms.
Wrack called on Starmer to include mitigation measures such as flood defences in the plan as well as more long-term investment aimed at cutting carbon emissions. His intervention comes at the beginning of a key week for the future of the plan in which officials are to meet to debate whether it should go ahead.
Wrack said: “If Labour doesn’t spend this money, it will put our members at risk, but it will also put communities at risk, especially in areas which are at risk of wildfires or major floods. It will increase the strain on the fire service and the risk to firefighters.”
Firefighters have been dealing with rapidly rising numbers of floods and wildfires in recent years, which scientists say is a direct result of climate breakdown.
In 2018 there were 65 wildfire incidents in Britain, according to the National Fire Chiefs Council. Three years later that had more than doubled to 178. Government data shows that flooding incidents in England have increased by nearly a quarter in the last decade.
Wrack said his members were struggling to cope with the increase in extreme weather events, and that people were being put at risk as a result. Heavy rains from Storm Henk flooded about 2,000 homes earlier this year as a month’s worth of rainfell in just four days in some parts of the UK.
“We are potentially leaving people in a dangerous and vulnerable position, for example with no power in their homes or stranded on the upper floor of a house when the ground floor is flooded,” he said.
The government plans to spend just over £220m on flood defences this year, but Wrack wants Labour to use its green prosperity plan to increase that figure.
“Part of the scheme needs to be about emergency planning and preparation,” he said. “We think the fire service can play a central role in that.”
Starmer has said in recent weeks that he remains committed to the policy of spending £28bn on environmental investments by the second half of the parliament, though the figure will be limited by how much Labour can borrow while sticking to its strict fiscal rules. The party has promised to borrow only as much as it can while still being able to forecast that debt will start falling as a share of economic output in five years’ time.
The Labour leader also used a meeting with union leaders last week to reassure them of his commitment to the scheme.
However, Labour sources say Starmer and his allies are still willing to drop the policy before the election if they decide it is too much of a liability in an election campaign. The Conservatives are preparing to feature the Labour pledge heavily in their campaign material, arguing that it can be funded only by higher borrowing or more tax rises."
9UN8MWN8EM_BNCXFGQQPLWW657,Modern slavery in social care surging since visa rules eased,Robert Booth,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/21/modern-slavery-in-social-care-surging-since-visa-rules-eased,"Modern slavery is surging in social care since ministers relaxed immigration rules to fill thousands of vacancies, with a growing wave of exploitation leading to workers being ripped off or living in squalor.
Unpublished figures show at least 800 people working in care homes or people’s residences were charted as potential victims last year, more than 10 times the number recorded before the government’s visa scheme.
Some workers have reported sleeping in cold, cramped rooms or only receiving a fraction of their pay. Others have said they paid exorbitant fees to agents for visa costs worth only a fraction of the price.
The mounting scale of abuse across the UK has been described by campaigners and care groups as “shocking”, “outrageous” and “utterly shameful” – with calls for councils and the NHS to carry out tighter checks on private care firms employing migrant workers.
It comes as the government-appointed independent anti-slavery commissioner, Eleanor Lyons, said she is “deeply concerned about the risk of exploitation and modern slavery for workers in the adult social care sector, particularly those from overseas who have come to the UK on short-term visas”.
Unseen, a Bristol-based anti-slavery charity, said it recorded at least 800 potential victims of modern slavery last year, based on calls to its helpline – an increase of more than 1,100% on the 63 in 2021. The rise comes after the Home Office added care workers to the shortage occupation list in 2022.
“We have seen year-on-year rises in the number of cases indicating modern slavery – the most serious end of exploitation,” said Justine Carter, director of Unseen. “Social care is fundamental to communities. You want to know, if you need care and support, that the people giving that care are not being exploited or, even worse, are victims of modern slavery.”
Carter said people are regularly paying over £11,000 to agents and care companies to come to the UK when the actual cost of visas and flights are unlikely to be much more than £1,500. Many are finding no work or severely reduced hours and cramped and substandard accommodation. She urged commissioners in councils and the NHS to demand evidence from care operators bringing people from abroad about their pay, hours, accommodation and fees.
Jane Townson, chief executive of the Homecare Association, which represents domiciliary care providers, also said there had recently been a rise in the number of new companies registering with the CQC and that some unscrupulous providers were “scamming [foreign workers] for thousands of pounds and putting them in cockroach-infested rooms”.
“We have a moral obligation to ensure that all care workers, whether from the UK or overseas, are safe and well-treated,” she said. “As a country, we desperately need their skills and experience. Some agents and employers are providing exemplary support for sponsored workers. Others are failing to do so. Some of the stories we hear are utterly shameful and outrageous. We strongly condemn exploitation of workers and abuse of the skilled visa route.”
The CQC warned MPs last month that modern slavery was now “a feature” of the UK’s social care market.
James Bullion, its chief inspector of adult social care and integrated care, told the Commons health and social care select committee that cases of modern slavery are on track to have increased tenfold in the last three years. He said the CQC made four referrals about modern slavery in 2021-22, 37 referrals last year, and is on course to make 50 this year.
In 2021, 15 separate cases of potential modern slavery in the care system – delivering care in people’s homes and in residential care homes – were raised with Unseen, most with multiple victims. This rose to 106 in 2022 and is expected to be more than 130 when figures for 2023 are finalised.
The sharp rise follows the government decision in February 2022 to make foreign social care workers eligible for temporary visas that were previously reserved for higher-paid workers. In the following 18 months, 180,000 health and care visas were granted – a rate almost three times higher than before.
It has helped fill more than 165,000 vacancies, but has also created a wave of exploitation which is increasingly concerning trade unions, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulator and care operators.
Each of the cases Unseen counted last year crossed the threshold of one or more signs of modern slavery, including financial or physical control, debt bondage, being tied to accommodation and having passports impounded.
Many are likely to fall below the high legal thresholds for criminal prosecution for human trafficking or slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour but are nevertheless “high harm because of the amount of abuse” involved, Carter said. Victims may not want to complain as they remain in debt and fear that family members back home may be vulnerable.
Melanie Weatherby, co-chair of the Care Association Alliance, who runs homecare services in Lincolnshire, said she had recently met a group of 30 Nigerian care workers brought to the UK on the sponsored visa scheme who had ended up with no work.
“Some were scammed and for others there was no work when they got here,” she said, adding that too many sponsorship licences were issued to small companies that didn’t have enough work to offer.
Lyons, a former Downing Street adviser who took up the role of anti-slavery commissioner in December, said: “Every individual who works to provide such a valuable service in this country deserves to be paid a reasonable living wage and must be kept well informed about their employment rights. We must work together to ensure that nobody is allowed to slip through gaps in the system.”
Gavin Edwards, Unison’s head of social care, said: “Every week the union hears yet more horror stories involving migrant care workers. The increasingly hostile government rhetoric concerning overseas staff is only encouraging dodgy employers to ratchet up their exploitative behaviour.”
The number of referrals to the government’s National Referral Mechanism for people in danger or at risk of exploitation hit a record high last year for the period January to September.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “Modern slavery is a barbaric crime and we are committed to ensuring that the necessary support is available to victims of modern slavery to help them rebuild their lives. We are bringing perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice and are working with the police and operational partners to drive up prosecutions.”"

West Midlands police said officers were called to Victoria Square after the 17-year-old was found seriously injured just before 3.30pm on Saturday. He was taken to hospital but later died.
A murder investigation is under way, but no arrests have been made.
A cordon put in place around the scene has been lifted but the force said a “highly visible police presence” would remain in the area.
Ch Insp James Spencer said: “The life of a 17-year-old boy has tragically been taken away and all our thoughts are with his family and friends at this awful time.
“It’s very early stages in the investigation, but we have a team of skilled detectives who are working to identify, and arrest, whoever did this. We fully understand the shock and concern this will cause, and although it is being treated as an isolated incident, a visible police presence will remain across the city centre.”
Police said they wanted to hear from anyone who walked through the area at the time or who may have been taking pictures by The River statue near the Council House as they may have “vital information or evidence”.
The force can be contacted on 101 or online, quoting log 2619 of 20 January."
A6JKHEMV0Y_R1NZM198ZFLAGHC,Royal Navy warships crashed into each other ‘due to faulty rewiring’,Dan Sabbagh,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/21/royal-navy-warships-crashed-into-each-other-due-to-faulty-rewiring-say-sources,"Two Royal Navy warships collided in Bahrain at the end of last week because one was incorrectly rewired, meaning that it unexpectedly went into reverse when it was set to go forward, military sources have said.
The minehunter HMS Chiddingfold went backwards into HMS Bangor, which was lying at port, ripping a hole in a cabin above the waterline, in an embarrassing blunder that the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, insisted did not reflect incompetence.
Nobody was hurt in the incident and the navy said late on Friday evening it was investigating. But naval sources said on Sunday they believed the cause of the accident was a simple rewiring error in a recently inspected vessel.
“HMS Chiddingfold’s motor was wired incorrectly and full ahead gave full astern,” a navy insider said. The vessel had been recently inspected by officers at the maritime capability, trials and assessment team, they added.
Fresh video and pictures from inside HMS Bangor show sunlight clearly coming through a hole at the end of a kitchen cabin and damage to sleeping berths. Another picture of the outside of the warship shows the side ripped open and its pennant number, M109.
Previous footage, which appeared on social media on Friday evening, showed HMS Chiddingfold heading inexorably towards HMS Bangor, a crash that its crew appeared unable to prevent.
Both warships, designed to seek out and eliminate sea mines, are based in the Gulf as part of the longstanding British naval presence in the Middle East, recently strengthened in response to the crisis in the southern Red Sea.
Houthi rebels have been attacking merchant shipping travelling through the Bab el-Mandeb waterway in the southern Red Sea, prompting the US and UK to deploy warships in the area and bomb targets in Yemen in an attempt to halt the attacks.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the causes of the accident, saying its investigation was continuing, but earlier on Sunday, Shapps denied that the crash between the two warships was a product of ineptitude.
“We don’t say it’s incompetence when we see an aircraft come down. A very rare occasion just as this would be a rare occasion. It’s right to leave the investigators some time to work out exactly what’s gone wrong,” Shapps told Sky News.

A7JPYRCBMP_J4YRKPMJ1EIIYXZ,Britons urged to use Holocaust Memorial Day as moment for community cohesion,Peter Walker,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/britons-urged-use-holocaust-memorial-day-moment-community-cohesion,"A cross-party trio of politicians from Muslim and Palestinian backgrounds have jointly urged Britons to use this month’s Holocaust Memorial Day as a moment for community cohesion and not to allow differences over the war in Gaza to inflame tensions.
In a letter to the Guardian, Sayeeda Warsi, the Conservative peer and former party chair, the Labour MP Naz Shah and Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat who is the only British MP of Palestinian heritage, said Holocaust Memorial Day was “a moment to remember the systematic slaughter of 6 million Jewish people for no reason other than who they were”.
The trio wrote: “It’s undoubtedly true that the horrific violence we are seeing is heightening tensions, but the reality is this conflict is amplifying unaddressed issues of hate in our society.
“It is not concern for Jewish safety in Israel that compels someone to dump a pig’s head at a proposed mosque site, or a desire to express solidarity with the Palestinian people that makes someone scrawl swastikas on bridges. Both are motivated by hatred we can grow here at home.”
The letter, arranged in association with Brendan Cox, the widower of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox and a campaigner for community togetherness, warned that the war in Gaza, following the 7 October massacre by Hamas, “is dividing lots of communities”.
Moran has been vocal in her support for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and has spoken repeatedly about the plight of relatives trapped there. Warsi has condemned Islamophobia within her party, while Shah made a heartfelt apology in 2016 for social media comments she made about Israel that were seen as antisemitic.
They wrote: “As politicians from three different parties we come together to remind our country that the rising tide of hatred we have seen in recent months makes it more important than ever that we take this moment on 27 January to remember the inevitable outcome of indulging hatred and staying silent when others are persecuted for who they are.”
Cox told the Guardian that the letter sought to address the risk that Holocaust Memorial Day could be “misused by people who want to drive division rather than connection”.
He added: “To do this across political lines of difference is a really clear and strong statement about using this to come together rather than to divide.”
Holocaust Memorial Day is on Saturday 27 January in the UK."
AVZCD2IVTU_8Y26X03PHIRCCOI,‘You will not replace us’: a deadly attack on a Slovakian gay bar – and its link to a fast-spreading racist ideology,Jason Burke,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/slovakian-gay-bar-attack-great-replacement-conspiracy-theoryfast-spreading-racist-ideology,"The October evening was warm and sunny. At about 7pm, two young men stepped out of the Tepláreň bar on Zámocká Street in the centre of Bratislava, to sit on a concrete bench and drink lemonade. Matúš, 23, had just arrived in the Slovakian capital to study Chinese. His 26-year-old friend worked in a local clothes shop and enjoyed anime, K-pop and dance.
Standing in an alcove a few metres away was Juraj Krajčík. The 19-year-old had been loitering for about half an hour, witnesses later said. Shortly after the two patrons of the Tepláreň sat down, Krajčík stepped forward, raised a .45-calibre handgun and fired several shots at them. Then he turned and ran, gun in hand.
Within half an hour of the fatal shootings, Krajčík was on his phone. At 7.35pm, he sent a tweet: “#bratislava #hatecrime #gaybar #bratislava”. Then, 25 minutes later, another: “#bratislava feeling no regrets, isn’t that funny?”
Through the night, Krajčík moved across the city, always one step ahead of police and continually active on social media. On Twitter and message boards routinely used by rightwing extremists, he expressed disappointment that he had not carried out his plans to attack a synagogue and the residence of Slovakia’s prime minister. Then he posted an image of himself with the words “have a last selfie”.
The teenager ended up on a grassy hill in a park not far from his family home where, probably in the early morning, he shot himself. His body was found some hours later.
In Slovakia, the attack on the Tepláreň, a prominent if rare LGBTQ+ hangout, prompted shock and statements of concern. The president, Zuzana Čaputová, called on politicians to stop spreading hate.
“I’m sorry that [we were] not able to protect your loved ones,” she told a crowd of thousands at a vigil. “You belong here; you are valuable for our society.”
The Tepláreň was “a place of acceptance, of love, of happiness”, said Michaela Dénešová, the deputy head of the Inakosť initiative, which campaigns for LGBTQ+ rights in Slovakia. “They were young people. They did nothing wrong. They were just enjoying the evening with friends in a bar. That’s all. Because of their gender identity, because of their sexual orientation … Should we kill people because of that? Not at all.”
Elsewhere, the attack attracted little attention, perhaps because the death toll was comparatively low for such shootings, or because it appeared to be motivated by local factors with limited wider significance, or perhaps because it seemed to be the act of single deranged individual.
In fact, there was no evidence that Krajčík had a psychological illness or was a lone actor. Instead, it has become clear that he was a link in a chain of mutually inspired young men living thousands of miles apart, all fervent believers in a violent ideology that first gathered momentum in the US and is now spreading in Europe.
Evidence seen by the Guardian suggests Krajčík may have been helped – possibly even piloted – by an older extremist based in the US who has yet to be identified and could even now be working with a new potential attacker.
Fifteen months after the Bratislava murders, levels of rightwing extremist violence directed at minorities in Europe continue to concern authorities everywhere.
In November, police launched an international operation against rightwing terrorism in Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Lithuania, Romania and Italy. Five were arrested, suspected of recruitment, online propaganda and sharing manuals of 3D-printed weapons.
In the EU, there were 45 arrests and four attacks in 2022, according to a recent Europol report. Three more were foiled, two in France and one in Germany.
“The threat from rightwing terrorist lone actors, radicalised online, remain[s] significant,” the report noted.
Krajčík grew up in Bratislava’s affluent Kramáre district, a quiet young man who did not smoke or drink and spent weekends with his family. He attended an elite private school in the city, where he had few friends. Though known for angry outbursts, he gave no hint of any extremist views.
Some local media blamed any extremism on his father, a self-employed businessman who was a minor figure in the now defunct rightwing Vlasť (Homeland) party. It promoted a populist, nationalist, nativist vision and accused corrupt “mainstream” elites of having an agenda to weaken Slovakia by allowing its control by organisations such as Nato or the EU. Before parliamentary elections in 2020, Vlasť deployed anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, describing sexual minorities as “sick”, “decadent” or “perverted”.
But there is no suggestion that Krajčík’s family knew of his increasing radicalism or of his plans for an attack. Vlasť’s leaders were officially opposed to violence. The catalyst for Krajčík’s attack appears to have come from farther afield. When in April 2021 he signed up to Twitter, he almost immediately began to express extreme racist ideas that had little relevance to his life in Bratislava.
“American culture is centered around n [sic] … They killed hundreds of thousands of white men to free n. They listen to n music. They elect a n as president. They dress and act like n. They draw the entirety of their modern culture from n,” Krajčík claimed early on.
More locally focused invective targeting Jewish, LGBTQ+ and Roma communities followed, but a persistent transatlantic influence remained evident. It seems, however, that Krajčík had not yet formulated ideas of launching a violent attack himself. This would come later, when, once again, he was apparently inspired by events and ideas far away.
While Krajčík was tweeting, a teenager in Glossop, a market town in England’s picturesque Peak District, was uploading a series of videos and blogposts to an easily accessible online platform. Daniel Harris was a troubled loner who spent up to 14 hours a day online and whose extreme views had already led to a referral to the UK government’s Prevent programme, which aims to counter radicalisation and is now dealing with rising numbers of young men attracted by rightwing extremism.
Between February 2021 and March 2022, Harris uploaded five videos praising rightwing extremist mass murderers and calling for an armed uprising. One video focused on Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019. A viewer commented: “This video has moved me. I was on the fence – now I am committed to my race.” An 18-year-old in Conklin, New York, posted encouragement: “You are not alone my friend.”
Experts say such contacts are an integral part of the rightwing milieu. Alejandra Ruvinsky, senior analyst at CST, a charity that protects British Jews from antisemitism and related threats, said: “This is absolutely global, because it is encouraged and inspired by a network that is all online. When we are tracking these people, it is very difficult to find out where they are from. They could be anywhere in the world. So this means that an attack in Bratislava doesn’t mean there is a critical mass of neo-Nazis in Slovakia. It means there is a critical mass of neo-Nazis around the world.”
These online communities have allowed the rapid spread of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, a set of paranoid lies and delusions claiming that white people are being economically, politically and culturally overwhelmed by the demographic rise of other communities. Many also falsely believe that feminism is a tool to undermine birth rates of the “white race” and see progressive efforts to fight homophobic prejudice or restrictive laws on homosexuality as part of a similar plan.
Such falsehoods inspired the Christchurch attack as well as many of the most horrifying recent acts of white supremacist violence in the US. Far-right protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which led to the killing of a woman, chanted: “You will not replace us.” The online rants of mass murderers who have attacked synagogues, an LGBTQ+ club and other targets in the US have repeated the same slogans in various forms. One who killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in 2019 claimed his murderous rampage was “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”.

In the US and Europe, far-right politicians have made statements clearly showing the influence of this twisted thinking.
The most extreme adherents aim to use violence to speed what they believe is the inevitable collapse of supposedly “corrupt and decadent” democratic societies. Attacks that exacerbate social tensions will eventually lead to a “racial” war that will bring white supremacists a final victory, they believe.
This strategy, known as accelerationism, thrives on anonymous and almost entirely unmoderated social media such as Telegram’s Terrorgram channels and the 8chan message board where users exchange texts and videos explaining their strategy, indulge in hate-filled extremist commentary and mock those unwilling to take action themselves.
This has catastrophic impacts, experts say. “The notion of a distinction between online and the ‘real world’ has long gone,” said Meghan Conroy, a research fellow with the US-based Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.
The most recent Europol report on terrorism said: “Right-wing extremist ideologies and groups from the USA continue to represent an important influence on European right-wing extremists, especially through online communities.”
In May 2022, two months after commenting on Harris’s video that he was “not alone”, Payton Gendron drove for three hours and then shot dead 10 Black people in a racially motivated attack in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. His own manifesto used an image posted by Harris, who was arrested by British police within 48 hours of the killing.
Gendron’s attack provoked feverish excitement among rightwing extremists. In Bratislava, Krajčík felt it was “the final nail in the coffin” that “gave new inspiration, a new impulse to do what had to be done after years of procrastination”.
On 26 September 2022, Krajčík posted a thread on Twitter outlining the challenges facing anyone who was prepared to commit extreme violence to “fight for the white race”. Other tweets called for the extermination of Jews or complained about the number of immigrants in Slovakia. One called for a war in the cities against decadence and “racial enemies”.
On 10 October, he tweeted images of “heroes and role models” including Hitler, Tarrant and Gendron. At 9am on 11 October, he tweeted that he had “made [his] decision”, and a day later he posted: “It will be done.” The next evening, Krajčík took a handgun legally owned by his father from a safe in his home and headed to the Tepláreň bar.
Not long before his attack, Krajčík tweeted a link to anonymous filesharing sites where he had posted a 65-page document. This “manifesto” was similar to that uploaded by Gendron and other rightwing attackers. It outlined its author’s view of the world, the toxic influence of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory and the identity of his principal enemy. This was not the LGBTQ+ community. The manifesto’s opening line read: “It’s the jews it’s the jews its the jews.”
Extreme-right conspiracy theories often accuse Jewish people of promoting LGBTQ+ rights in order to destroy the perceived nuclear family unit and lower white birth rates, analysts said. “It’s not just Jewish communities which are victims of antisemitism. For a lot of [shooters], attacking an LGBTQ+ bar is also a means of attacking Jewish people. So the threat to one community becomes a danger to many others,” said Hannah Rose of the UK-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
Krajčík’s manifesto falsely claimed the world was run by “Zionist Occupied Government” and provided a lengthy list of “ZOG” targets that ranged from politicians, journalists and judges to Hollywood, pornography studios, “the Rothschilds” and “invasive non-Whites”. It also blamed Jews for supposedly plotting against “our people, our Race” by encouraging mass immigration of “enemy races”, supporting the civil rights movement in the US and manufacturing Covid vaccines.
Joe Mulhall, the director of research at the antifascism organisation Hope Not Hate, said such poisonous ideas inevitably led to wider violence. “One of the things that is so dangerous about conspirational antisemitism is that it can be used to justify almost any action,” he said. “Whatever the target, the core of the ideology seems to be antisemitism.”
Krajčík also left a suicide note addressed to his parents, sister and an unnamed woman or girl referred to as “Her” whom he “never had the courage to tell” of his sentiments. Seen by the Guardian, the note is conventional. He thanks his parents for everything they have done for him and tells them he will be waiting for them “on the other side, wherever that could or could not be”. The note reiterates his choice of the “path of struggle against the jewish enemies and their collaborators” and adds a more personal note describing his sorrow that he “won’t be alive long enough to see the world after the enemy has been defeated”.
Julia Kupper, a US-based forensic linguist specialising in targeted violence and terrorism attackers, who analysed the tweets, suicide note and manifesto, said: “There are explicit references [in the manifesto] that demonstrate an almost unprecedented understanding of the accelerationist scene and concepts compared to previous manifestos authored by similar attackers, and it appears unlikely that [Krajčík] would have gained that level of familiarity in such a short time.”
Kupper ran a check against an extensive archive of manifestos to rule out systematic cutting and pasting as she sought to resolve the mismatch between the “author profile” of a 19-year-old Slovak who had never lived abroad and the language used in what he had supposedly written. Kupper focused on stylistic inconsistencies such as varying date formats or spellings, and the repeated use of idioms or vocabulary that seemed to suggest an author who was possibly in his 40s or 50s and based in the US.
“We suspect there was a second author who took on a ‘command and control’ role from around May 2022, but we don’t know who this was or where at this point in time,” Kupper said.
Slovakian officials who have studied local extremism on- and offline confirmed the stylistic mismatch and said the idea of a second author was “very plausible”.
Experts at the Accelerationism Research Consortium, which brings together leading experts studying the activities, behaviours and ideologies, describe “a distinct global and transnational security threat to democratic societies that defies conventional counter-terrorism mechanisms and programs”.
Until now, the sordid and angry world where such ideas thrive has been largely chaotic and unstructured, on- and offline. If a more experienced activist did influence Krajčík directly, a new form of militant rightwing activism may be emerging.
“This would be an evolution of the Terrorgram community away from just incitement towards something much more organised in terms of instigating and preparing violence,” Kupper said. “And this is frightening.”"
BIFCTZEE3V_4DO1K0CJOR47CQ8,Biden abortion ad marks campaign shift to emphasize reproductive rights,Edward Helmore,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/biden-abortion-ad-campaign,"The Biden re-election campaign rolled out a new campaign ad on Sunday, signaling a shift in emphasis to reproductive rights that the White House hopes will carry and define Democrats through the 2024 election cycle.
The campaign ad, titled Forced, is designed to tie Donald Trump directly to the abortion issue almost 18 months after his nominees to the supreme court helped to overturn a constitutional right to abortion enshrined in Roe v Wade, which would have turned 51 this week.
Dr Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother of three tells the camera her story about traveling out of her state to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition, calling her situation “every woman’s worst nightmare”.
In Texas, she said, her choice “was completely taken away and that’s because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v Wade”.
The launch of the ad comes as anti-abortion activists descended on Washington DC this weekend. One event, the National Pro-Life Summit, activists came to celebrate anti-abortion activism in the US. At another, the March for Life, marchers called for advocacy against abortion rights.
Vice-President Kamala Harris is now being placed to the forefront of the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights, a position Biden has said he is not “big on” because of his Catholic faith, though he believes the landmark 1973 decision “got it right”.
On Monday, Harris will embark on a nationwide tour to focus attention on the administration’s efforts to protect the right of women to choose. Her tour will start in Wisconsin, where abortion rights propelled a Democratic victory in a key state supreme court election.
A statement from Harris’s office said the vice-president will “highlight the harm caused by extreme abortion bans and share stories of those who have been impacted in Wisconsin and across the country”.
“She will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care,” the statement added.
Democrats this year are hoping to emphasize that a second Trump presidency would establish new personal health restrictions.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager, said in a statement to The Hill.
On Sunday, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, told CBS Face the Nation that “it would be good” if Biden talked about abortion more than he does. “I know that one tenet of his belief system is that women and only women with their families and healthcare professionals are the one who know what decision is right for them.”
Asked if the president needs to take up that message more forcefully, Whitmer said: “I don’t think it would hurt. I think people want to know that this is president that is fighting … but maybe to use more blunt language would be helpful.”"
C3QTRMO0B1_9MF4KHFFHM8O5IV,"Labor’s sexual harassment changes could clog courts with ‘unmeritorious’ claims, Law Council warns",Sarah Basford Canales,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/22/labor-sexual-harassment-law-changes-law-council-of-australia-court-clogged-fears,"The Law Council of Australia has warned that proposed changes removing cost barriers for applicants in sexual harassment and discrimination cases could result in “arbitrary and unintended consequences” such as clogging the courts with “unmeritorious” claims.
Before a parliamentary inquiry hearing into the bill next Wednesday, the peak legal body said in its submission it was concerned Labor’s bill too heavily tilted the balance towards those accusing sexual harassment and placed the burden of financial risk on those being accused.
The landmark Respect at Work report found cost orders – where one party pays their own and the other’s legal bill if unsuccessful in court – were often a disincentive for those wishing to pursue sexual harassment matters.
Under the federal government’s proposed cost protection amendments, introduced in November, applicants would be protected from those costs even if their case against a respondent is unsuccessful.
The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the changes would “remove a significant barrier for those seeking justice through federal court proceedings for unlawful discrimination matter”.
While the Law Council said it was “sympathetic” to arguments for an asymmetrical costs model, noting applicants were often in more vulnerable positions than the accused respondents, it did not agree it was the appropriate model.

“The Law Council is concerned that the costs protection bill tilts the balance overly in favour of the applicant and moves the financial risk and disincentive for unmeritorious claims to the respondents,” the submission said.
“Notwithstanding the bill’s provisions regarding vexatious or unreasonable proceedings, this may result in large numbers of applicants bringing unmeritorious and protracted litigation without sufficient incentives to ensure efficiency within the justice system.”
Grata Fund’s executive director and founder, Isabelle Reinecke, told Guardian Australia the peak legal body’s position “just misunderstands the way that the discrimination system works”.
Reinecke said the proposal had a number of safeguards to prevent every claim landing in court, such as having the Australian Human Right Commission agree the claim is reasonably arguable.
While there would likely be an increase in the number of cases taken to court, Reinecke said many victim-survivors would end up with a better result, rather than a “dodgy settlement” as a result of power imbalances in negotiating rooms.
“Essentially, there’s no point at all in sex discrimination laws if you can’t enforce them, which is what we’ve currently got happening right now,” Reinecke said.
The Law Council’s submission added cost orders were only one part of a “large, complex picture”.
“Stronger roles for relevant non-court institutions, increased availability of legal aid and judicial education are also important in this regard,” the submission said.
“It will also be important to monitor the combined effect of the many recent reforms that have followed the Respect@Work report, in terms of whether their objective of eliminating workplace sexual harassment is met over time.”

The asymmetrical costs, or “equal access”, model put forward by the Attorney General’s Department was decided on after public consultation in early 2023.
Cost protection was a recommendation of the 2020 Respect at Work report. The report recommended a “hard cost neutrality” model be introduced, which would result in each party bearing their own legal costs, except in cases where a party acted vexatiously or unreasonably.
The Australian Human Rights Commission, in its submission, said it believed that model would be “a more balanced approach”.
The commission said it also had concerns about the bill’s unintended consequences, including reducing the incentive for settling out of court and affecting the balance of fairness for smaller sized respondents.
It recommended the bill be amended to require a review be undertaken within three years of the changes commencing.
Kieran Pender, a lawyer who was part of a research team who created a report on the history of damages and costs in sexual harassment litigation in Australia, and which helped to inform the department’s chosen model, described the bill as a “welcome step forward”.
In his submission, Pender said the asymmetrical model was necessary to address the “power imbalances and resource disparities” many who experience sexual harassment encounter.
“When a complainant brings a complaint, and it ultimately proceeds to litigation, they are not just vindicating a private legal right – discrimination complainants are acting in the public interest,” his submission said.
“The spectre of costs risks means that unlawful anti-discrimination is going unchecked, and complainants are not able to pursue justice – for themselves, and for all of us.”"
CRNDAA4G1N_E86IOG4AQ1DOF4T,‘Tortuguita vive’: campaigners across US hail anti-Cop City activist killed by police,Timothy Pratt,_,20230121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/atlanta-cop-city-tortuguita-anniversary,"At a gathering on Thursday, the mother of an activist killed by police had a clear message on the first anniversary of their death: “I have news for you. Manuel is alive. Tortuguita vive!”
It was a message of celebration for the life of Manuel Paez Terán, also known as “Tortuguita”, that was being made in Atlanta and more than 30 cities across the US, a sign of the activist’s enduring effect on several movements, observers said.
Police killed Tortuguita on 18 January of last year while the activist was sleeping in a forested public park south-east of Atlanta, in protest against the building of a police and fire department training center nearby known as “Cop City”. It was the first such incident in US history.
On Thursday, there were vigils, panels, film screenings, church services and altars built under trees at sunset, in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Minneapolis, Tucson and other cities. Many of the events were billed as “Day of the Forest Defender”.
Paez Terán’s mother, Belkis Terán, came from Panama to speak at two ceremonies in Atlanta. “I know there are more people celebrating in many places. We are celebrating his life,” she said.
Atlanta mourners repeatedly referred to those who could not be there due to the chilling effect of felony Rico, or conspiracy, charges leveled against 61 people in connection with opposition to the training center. The case is historic for the sheer number of activists accused of belonging to a criminal conspiracy. The movement is motivated by concerns about police use of force and consolidation of power, and protection of forests in an era of the climate crisis, among other issues.
The number and range of events dedicated to remembering Tortuguita on Thursday suggest that the activist, who was 26, has “become a symbol not only for the fight against Cop City, but in the fight against police violence in general, and for the environmental movement”, said Dan Berger, a historian of social movements.
Tortuguita was one of fewer than two dozen activists camped last year in Intrenchment Creek Park, about a mile from the city of Atlanta-owned Cop City site, as part of an attempt to defend the forest from the training center project and from plans to turn over part of the park to a private developer.
The number of “forest defenders” had been greatly reduced in the weeks before the January raid carried out by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, due in part to a previous raid in December, and to the winter weather. Georgia state troopers came upon Tortuguita’s tent and wound up shooting at least 14 bullets, leaving 57 gunshot wounds and killing Paez Terán almost instantly, according to government and private autopsies.
The state subsequently claimed that the activist fired a gun, and concluded in early October that the Georgia state troopers who killed Tortuguita were not at fault. The troopers were not wearing body cameras, but officers from other agencies who were nearby did record sounds and images. Only some of those videos have been released, and the Georgia bureau of investigation refuses to release the others and the rest of their investigative file, claiming the file must remain closed while the Rico case proceeds.
Meanwhile, the movement against Cop City has continued, now in its fourth year, and has included such efforts as gathering more than 100,000 signatures on a petition to let Atlanta voters decide if they want at least $67m in taxpayer funds spent on the project. The city has refrained from counting and validating the signatures due to an ongoing court case. Historic numbers of residents have attended Atlanta city council meetings in opposition to the project, with one drawing nearly a thousand. There have also been ongoing acts of vandalism against construction equipment and companies linked to the training center.
On Thursday morning at Park Ave Baptist church, the Rev Keyanna Jones, one of several Black preachers involved in the movement, began events in Atlanta by reminding mourners “we come here with heavy hearts – but we have hope, because the person we are here to honor had hope”.
A message was read from Victor Puertas, an Indigenous, Peruvian-born activist now facing Rico charges who is being held in Stewart detention center, an immigration prison in Georgia. “I just want to say Tortuguita is alive,” the statement read.
Another was read from a defendant who wrote that she was “more than a thousand miles away, unable to return to Georgia – one of many defendants isolated from the community by court order”. Still, she continued, “[e]ven though many of us can’t be here today to grieve, we still carry Tortuguita with us, in our hearts”.
A woman who had driven about 90 miles from Macon stood up to tell the 60 or so gathered: “Everyone here is so brave.” She spoke about her granddaughter, who was inspired by Tortuguita to became a street medic, something the activist had done. The woman’s granddaughter is now also one of one of the 61 indicted; her bond conditions also prohibited her from attending the event.
Later, around sunset, a larger crowd assembled around a pair of pine trees in a park near the forest where Tortuguita was killed. Mourners placed photos, candles, flowers and drawings at the base of the large trunks, an altar for the moment.
A musician named Matt Rivers sang an anthem he had written with the chorus: “For every tree that’s felled, there’s a cop that’s going to hell / For every martyr slain so grows the flame.”
In lower Manhattan’s historic Tompkins Square Park, mourners made their altar at the foot an elm tree, “a survivor and endangered species around which many movements have gathered”, wrote one person online.
People in Atlanta recalled how Paez Terán served as a self-appointed ambassador to the forest, welcoming many who showed up there throughout 2022, as word of the ongoing protest spread. Tortuguita, who used they as a pronoun, transmitted optimism and joy. Once, a fellow forest defender remembered, Tortuguita came upon a tree that police had knocked down to destroy a tree house. “Now I have materials to build another tree house,” they said.
Other US environmental activists have been killed before, noted Will Potter, the author of Green Is the New Red, a book about the federal government’s legal campaigns against animal rights and environmental groups such as Earth First! and the Animal Liberation Front, in the 1990s and 2000s.
He mentioned David Nathan “Gypsy” Chain, part of Earth First!, who died in 1998 after a logger felled a tree on him. In the case of Tortuguita, he said, the difference has been the “media exposure, helping create a sustained momentum and organizing around Cop City to memorialize Tortuguita – to remember what they stood for, and what’s at stake, really”.
Belkis Terán spoke several times on Thursday of another aspect of Tortuguita’s legacy she hopes to create – the “Tortuguita Healing Center”, a place for “forest defenders” worldwide she plans on building in Panama, where she lives. She recently received a $30,000 donation toward buying the forested land where the center will be located.
“This would be unprecedented” in the environmental movement, Potter said. “We have seen over and over the toll defending forests takes on activists due to state repression, and this could make a big difference”.
At the end of the Atlanta vigil, a statement was read from Vienna, Tortuguita’s girlfriend. She wrote how complex Tortuguita was, both angry and silly, social and withdrawn – and how “the state wishes to vilify Tort, making them into the monster of a violent extremist that justifies their assassination and shows ‘proof’ of our anti-state tendencies.”
“Tort was my second love after the forest itself,” she continued. “They were everything and nothing that has been said.”"
CYIEH8VIF6_595HSE7ZG0MSIKL,From therapy to qigong: survivors of the Monterey Park mass shooting are still searching for healing,Claire Wang,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/asian-american-mental-health-care-monterey-park-california-shootings,"For the past 50 years, Shally Ung hadn’t spent much time thinking about the carnage she’d seen growing up in her native Cambodia. But those scenes of bombs raining down on Phnom Penh came roaring back on Lunar New Year last year, when a gunman opened fire at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park and killed 11 people. Ung’s dance partner for nearly two decades, Andy Kao, was shot in the chest and died beside her under a table.
The 21 January 2023 attack was the worst mass shooting in Los Angeles county history, hitting the heart of Monterey Park’s large Asian immigrant community. Flashbacks of the horror, as well as her childhood memories, haunted her for months, said Ung, 59.
“I always thought about that moment and the past that my head almost exploded,” Ung said.
She barely slept and felt a crippling sense of terror every time a new customer walked into Arcadia Donuts, the business she owns with her husband, Francois.
In April, three months after the shooting, Ung reluctantly agreed to see a therapist at the non-profit Chinatown Service Center in Alhambra, which offered free service to shooting victims. “We know in our culture if you see a psychologist, you’re called crazy,” her husband, Francois Ung said. But she opened up to a Cantonese-speaking therapist and started talking about the root of her trauma, as both a refugee of war and a mass shooting survivor. Slowly, she began to feel less stressed, she said, and cautiously hopeful about the future. Ung has attended 16 sessions and continues to go twice a month.
Dozens of other survivors and victims’ families are still finding their own ways to heal and process their collective trauma. Social services groups came together to provide financial and mental health resources for those directly impacted by the shooting. (All but one of the victims were in the 60s and 70s, as are many of the survivors.) But experts say the well-documented cultural stigma against therapy in parts of the Asian community kept many people from accessing them.
Lloyd Gock, 67, said he struggled with nightmares and had to sleep with the lights on for months after surviving the shooting. He couldn’t focus on his clothing business, Montana Jeans, and lost around $3,000 in orders in the first quarter of the year. One day several weeks after the shooting, he attended a survivor session at the Langley Senior Center and cried in front of a therapist. “It was such a relief,” he said. “That was the first step of my healing process.”
But Gock realized that not all survivors were as receptive to conventional western therapy. To address that barrier, he created a WeChat support group with around 40 people. They communicated almost every day and met in person a half dozen times. Together, they’ve talked about what they saw that night and fought for more funding for those who didn’t suffer physical injuries but, like Gock, experienced psychological and financial loss. (In October, the city gave $3,000 to each of the three dozen eye-witness victims).
While he’s enjoyed helping others heal, Gock said he also sees the anniversary as an opportunity to close this chapter. “We need to start moving on with our lives,” he said.
Local community groups have also used the shooting as an opportunity to address the shame and lack of understanding about mental health in the Asian immigrant community. The Monterey Park Resiliency Center, which opened in October, offers survivors and community members a wide variety of stress-relief activities, such as qigong and arts and crafts workshops, in addition to more traditional talk therapy and case management services. The federally funded facility, which holds a wall memorial of 11 blue paper hearts bearing the victims’ names, currently services on average 50 to 80 people a week, said Nina Loc, the behavioral health director at Chinatown Service Center, the lead non-profit operating the center.
“Our goal is to help individuals understand mental health and how they might have been affected by a traumatic event like the shooting,” she said.
The healing-based exercises and creative workshops draw far more participants than the counselling services, Loc said, which isn’t necessarily a problem. For many Asian seniors who have long considered suffering to be a sign of weakness, she said, language may not be the most effective form of therapy. “They recognize pain more in their body, but they might not know that the pain is a response from trauma,” she said. “We want to give them the tools to make that correlation between the physical and mental body.”
The therapeutic power of physical activities is most evident in the dance workshops the center offers, Loc said. A group of survivors and former dancers at Star Ballroom worked together to design the dance programs, selecting the soundtrack and providing feedback on the curriculum. More than 200 people have signed up for the next workshop on 25 January. “Communicating how they can reframe their trauma into a positive experience is a collective way of healing,” Loc said.
Phuong Tang, a therapist with the psychotherapy group Yellow Chair Collective, said that while some survivors have reached out to talk about the trauma of the shooting, they ended up spending much of their time talking more generally about the grief and social isolation that seniors tend to feel more acutely. “I think that the dancing and the opportunities to socialize and connect with others was such a driving factor that it was hard for her to stay away from the studio,” she said, referring to a survivor she worked with.
Some survivors and longtime Monterey Park residents said they remain deeply proud of their hometown and its reputation as an early haven for immigrants from China and Taiwan. A city with a population of 60,000 that is two-thirds Asian, Monterey Park is known widely as the country’s first suburban Chinatown, and as the place that elected Judy Chu as the first Chinese American woman to US Congress.
For some in the younger generation, healing came in the form of advocacy for their elders. Fonda Quan, whose aunt My My Nhan was the first person killed in the shooting, created a fund in Nhan’s honor to support groups that work with Asian seniors and youths. Since launching last October, the fund has co-hosted a self-defense class for elders and awarded scholarships to three high school students from low-income families. “Our elders are the most precious things that our community can have,” said Quan, 33. “They’re the first ones that immigrated here, and we owe it to them to learn how to protect ourselves and them.”
Ahead of the one-year mark of the shooting, Ung is focused on preserving the memory of Andy Kao, her late dance partner and dear friend. A general contractor, Kao helped Ung and her husband build their donut shop two years ago, installing the flooring and painting the walls green. Several times a month, the three would go out to eat skewers or hot pot. Kao always footed the bill, Ung said. This Lunar New Year, the Ungs organized two donut fundraisers in Kao’s name, with proceeds going to the resiliency center’s dance workshop and victims’ families. “If we don’t talk about him,” Ung said, “no one will remember him.”"

DETRXQT4IX_KWQOMG85LKYZOIC,Child among asylum seekers returned to country of origin after being sent from Australia to Nauru,Paul Karp,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/australia-asylum-seekers-nauru-returned-home-country,"Eight of the 11 asylum seekers taken to Nauru in September – including a woman and child – have returned to their country of origin.
In October Guardian Australia revealed the transfer, the first by Australia to the regional processing centre in nine years, which occurred just months after the last asylum seekers were removed from the Pacific nation.
The transfer resulted in renewed scrutiny of boat arrivals since Labor’s May 2022 election, which have included a further nine boats taken back to their country of origin.
Answers to questions on notice and the November 2023 Operation Sovereign Borders update confirm that a further 12 people who were found on the Western Australian coast in November have been sent to Nauru.
In the answers to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, the home affairs department confirmed the September arrivals had been transferred to Nauru “by air, after transiting briefly through Australia, on 7 September 2023”.
This was done “in line with long standing policy under [Operation Sovereign Borders]” after health, identity and screening assessment processes.
“The Department conducts entry screening to ensure it does not refoule asylum seekers with legitimate protection claims, in breach of Australia’s international obligations.”

As at 3 November, eight of the 11 people who the department describes as “unauthorised maritime arrivals” had voluntarily returned home – but the answers refused to say where or give further details about the cohort.
There were no minors on Nauru on 3 November, after the child in the cohort returned home. The remaining three people were being held in regional processing centre 1 and “will remain in Nauru until their migration status is resolved or they otherwise depart”, the department said.
Ogy Simic, the director of advocacy at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the organisation was “deeply concerned by the complete lack of transparency and information provided to the Australian public” about the cohorts transferred to Nauru in September and November.
Simic said the answers give “no information” about where the eight asylum seekers returned to “and what process was followed”.
“It was also incredibly distressing to find out that the initial group transferred to Nauru included a child. The government’s refusal to answer questions about the activity on Nauru flies in the face of its own calls for greater transparency when in opposition.”
The Greens senator Nick McKim has also criticised the lack of transparency.
The Nauru processing centre costs at least $350m a year to run, although expenditure has fallen since more than 1,000 asylum seekers were kept on the island at a time.
Reports had linked reduced spending on the regional processing centre to Nauru’s decision to sever ties with Taiwan and recognise a one-China policy.

The Australian government denied there had been any change to the regional processing arrangements. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said “the idea that we’ve been effective in reducing the costs of offshore detention is a good thing for Australian taxpayers”.
The department revealed there had been 250 people from nine maritime people-smuggling ventures between Labor’s election in May 2022 and 31 August 2023, all of whom had been “safely returned” to their country of origin or departure, Sri Lanka or Indonesia. It said 238 were subject to “on-water/enhanced screening assessment”.
In the five years to August 2023 there were 17 deaths in Australia’s onshore immigration detention facilities, including two in the 2022-23 financial year.
The answers reveal that the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, has issued 89 residence determinations, allowing people in onshore detention to be released into community detention.
Answers to the Liberal senator Paul Scarr reveal that 27 people had their visas cancelled for offences including sexual offences, assault and fraud.
The home affairs department noted a “residence determination is still a form of immigration detention”.
“While the detainees have freedom of movement within the community, they are required to reside at a specified address and abide by the associated conditions, including reporting and behavioural requirements,” it said.
In addition to the number of people-smuggling ventures to Australia, Labor has come under scrutiny over its legislative response to the high court’s NZYQ decision, in which it held that indefinite detention is unlawful where it is not possible to deport the unlawful non-citizen.
Before the November 2023 decision, the Albanese government was quietly releasing low-risk detainees in an attempt to clear what the department had conceded was an “intractable” caseload of people in detention.
Guardian Australia contacted the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, for comment."
DQFNKFQSSX_428IWXS1EAC9J09,The big picture: Ernst Scheidegger’s back-bending ballerinas,Tim Adams,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/21/the-big-picture-ernst-scheidegger-magnum-1950s,"This picture of young dancers was taken in the mid-1950s by the Swiss photographer Ernst Scheidegger at the Parisian ballet school established by Madame Rousanne Sarkissian. At the time, Scheidegger was an associate of the Magnum agency, working as a photojournalist in France and beyond. Scheidegger had been introduced to the agency by his mentor and fellow countryman Werner Bischof three years earlier. At around the time this picture was made, however, double tragedy ended this part of Scheidegger’s career. In May 1954, Bischof died in a car crash while on assignment in the Peruvian Andes; nine days later, Magnum founder Robert Capa was also killed when he stepped on a landmine in Vietnam. Capa had taken the place of Scheidegger in Vietnam, on commission for Life magazine, after Scheidegger’s visa application had not come through.
The double shock of those events prompted Scheidegger to abruptly leave Paris and photojournalism to take up a position as a lecturer at a visual design school in Ulm in southern Germany. Though he returned to photography throughout his life – including his long series of portraits of his close friend artist Alberto Giacometti – Scheidegger thereafter, until his death in 2016, also worked as a film-maker and an editor, publisher and painter.
He rarely spoke about the deaths of Bischof and Capa, and he archived the pictures he had taken in the early 50s, alongside an unopened box of prints containing work gifted by his former Magnum friends and colleagues. As part of the celebrations in Switzerland to mark the centenary of Scheidegger’s birth, an exhibition – Eye to Eye – presents some of this archived work from the 1950s beside the celebrated later portraits of artists.

DWRGBVPAIK_PADW72IUE5VJ1ST,What Will Survive of Us by Howard Jacobson review – drama that is all in the dialogue,John Self,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/21/what-will-survive-of-us-by-howard-jacobson-review-drama-that-is-all-in-the-dialogue,"When the writer Alan Coren was asked by his friend Jeffrey Archer to provide a quote for his new book, which Coren didn’t much like, he came up with the following: “Fans of Jeffrey Archer will not be disappointed.” It’s a joke, but it’s funny because it’s true. There are writers whose readers, once initiated, will follow them anywhere, their distinctive vision and style acting as a wall that keeps fans in the fold just as surely as it repels those with no appetite for it.
Howard Jacobson is one of those writers. For four decades his novels have covered territories of subject matter, from a washed-up academic (Coming from Behind, 1983) to a coming-of-age story with added ping-pong (The Mighty Walzer, 1999) to Jewishness and death (his 2010 Booker winner, The Finkler Question). But what unites them is the propulsive energy of his prose, which is entirely devoid of secondhand sentences. He is a man made of words.
The style drives the books on even when the plot meanders (and the plot almost always meanders): the first 50 pages of The Making of Henry (2004) were so fluent and funny that it was another 100 before I realised it wasn’t really going anywhere. It was too late: I was in Jacobson’s world and there wasn’t – still isn’t – any escape from that.
Below the surface subject matter, certain themes dominate: desire and sexual love, with their humiliations, reversals and conflicts, usually delivered by a middle-aged male character who’s equal parts comic, despairing and randy. It’s there in No More Mr Nice Guy (1998, and the only novel ever to make me cry with laughter), in Who’s Sorry Now? (2002, featuring wife-swapping) and in The Act of Love (2008) with its premise – peculiar to anyone who hasn’t considered these things as much as Jacobson evidently has – that “no man has ever loved a woman and not imagined her in the arms of someone else”.
So it’s no surprise to see him return to the battlefield with his 17th novel, What Will Survive of Us (“is love”, to complete the line from Larkin that gives the book its title). It’s about an adulterous affair in which fortysomethings Lily (married to Hal) and Sam (husband to Selena) meet and – to quote the novel’s opening word – “Kerpow!” Sam is a playwright with “louche, lazy eyes and hair a journalist had described as enraged”, Lily a documentary maker: work brings them together, but what keeps them together is… well, the entire book is an explanation of that.
Sam writes plays about “famously troubled men”, but in Jacobson’s world, all men are troubled, and although the novel switches between Sam’s and Lily’s viewpoints, he always seems most at home in a man’s head. Here, men are predictable – “the nervous schoolboy never leaves the grown man altogether. He is every man’s secret” – and women more rational. “If we don’t cut these lying swines a bit of slack,” Lily’s friend tells her, “we’ll die lonely.”
The book proceeds like this, wandering from aphorism to snappy dialogue and back again, and it’s such fun to read that only occasionally does the reader look up and think, where are we again? The sense arrives, as it has before, that plotting is either beneath or beyond Jacobson: one chapter is much like the next. But there are developments: time moves on, Sam and Lily age, their relationship finds surprising new modes. One moment he asks her to slap him during sex, like a reverse Marianne and Connell in Normal People; the next they’re frequenting fetish clubs, places “for weary London taxi drivers to show off their wives’ piercings”.
And there’s a frisson underneath: if Lily does get free of Hal, if Sam leaves Selena (“the scent of war has entered their negotiations”), “what will fill the hours they used to put into dodging and lying?” So there are elements that could give rise to dramatic set pieces, but as ever with Jacobson, the action is internal and the drama is all in the dialogue. There are brilliant exchanges on male friendship, on not having children, which flow with brightly lit truth. So, yes, it’s another novel about love and sex, about men and women, from the leading specialist in his field, but which by its end has matured into something more subtle and melancholy than expected. In the best possible way, fans of Howard Jacobson will not be disappointed.

DX3WS8NP95_CLU56OATW9PONO7,Kate Moss and I are turning 50 – and it has inspired me to make a new start,Emma Beddington,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/kate-moss-and-i-are-turning-50-and-it-has-inspired-me-to-make-a-new-start,"Thoughts and prayers, please, for those of us born in 1974, as the global news event that is Kate Moss turning 50 continues. Given the blanket coverage, I probably don’t need to tell you much about it, but just in case you’re a high court judge, here are the bullet-point basics. Moss went to a “spiritual retreat” on Mustique, then private-jetted to Paris for a party at which she wore an incredible vintage sheer lace dress. Guests included Venus Williams and Stella McCartney, but the lack of gawping paparazzi pics suggests it was mainly her friends in attendance; the whole thing seemed high on glamour and low on scandal, as befits a 50-year-old style icon with absolutely nothing left to prove.
It’s not my turn for months yet, but it’s pretty clear that my 50th will be less catsuit, more crying into my crisps. It could be a tricky year, self-esteem-wise, as my peers – Leonardo DiCaprio, Victoria Beckham, Robbie Williams, Penélope Cruz, Chloë Sevigny – hit their half-century. Do you remember how at the start of secondary school, kids in your class looked wildly different ages, anything from eight to 28, depending on genetics and gender? Well, 50 seems to be the same: some of us (me) look as if they’ve been excavated from a Valley of the Kings antechamber after multiple graverobbings; Moss, despite the decades of cigs and partying, looks better than ever.
I know it’s stupid to compare myself, a civilian, with same-aged celebrities. It’s no better than comparing myself with other Sagittarians or people called Emma. But it also comes naturally – we start doing it with people our age at school (if you didn’t, what kind of well-adjusted weirdo were you?) and some of us just never stop, the second-guessing of our own choices, the gnawing unease and dissatisfaction at our own comparative failings – job, shape, home – becoming an ingrained habit. The famous ones just make it very easy for us, by being so publicly successful (and able to pull off a sheer dress).
I also know there are people who don’t do this: unbothered, moisturised, in their lanes. My best friend didn’t even know her celebrity twins; I had to make her Google them (“Heath Ledger, good start. Pete Doherty? Jesus Christ.”). I can’t imagine having a solid enough sense of self not to compare myself with other people: there must be so much time and mental energy to spare. What do you do with it – read Proust? Grasp global geopolitics? Make a positive contribution to the world?
In some ways, letting others make me feel bad has been a positive force in my life, I think: without the galvanising sense of inadequacy they gave me, I would just be a puddle on the floor. Maybe a contented puddle? I’ll never know. But I do know that approaching 50, it’s time to try to let go of the thief of joy.
It’s not like most of my twins lead utterly idyllic lives, anyway. You only need to watch the Robbie Williams Netflix documentary to know he has been made (or kept) awfully fragile by fame and God knows what void at the heart of Leonardo DiCaprio makes him date women he could have fathered (when I talked to some sixth-formers last year, their bracing contempt for his dating choices was a pure delight). Moss can’t even have a birthday party without a million news outlets being weird about it, and ghouls like me commenting on it.
I hope it’s not too late to change – Moss has taken up wild swimming, moonbathing and meditation now, after all. To spur myself on, I tried imagining my birthday described like hers. “A downbeat Beddington cut a casual figure, sporting a worn Millets fleece as she browsed the aisles of her local Boots alone, before plumping for a tube of Canesten and packet of sweet chilli Snack A Jacks. At a nearby bus stop, the morose freelancer tucked into the rice-based snack, shared a remark with a passing pigeon then consulted her phone, perhaps hoping to read birthday wishes from absent friends.” The horror. Maybe there really is nothing to envy?

E9APPQIMKM_IMK3OEM83JNXB7P,The west’s complete contempt for the lives of Palestinians will not be forgotten,Owen Jones,_,20230121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/palestinian-lives-gaza-politics-media,"What is the value of a Palestinian life? For those retaining delusions not already buried in the rubble of Gaza alongside entire families – like the Zorobs, the Kashtans, the Attalahs – Joe Biden offered a definitive answer last week. In a statement marking 100 days since the current horror began, he rightly showed empathy for the plight of hostages – whose abduction by Hamas represents a grave war crime – and their traumatised families. Yet there was not a single mention of Palestinians.
That politicians and media outlets alike have not bothered to disguise their contempt for Palestinian life will prove consequential. Indeed, this phenomenon is not new, and those repercussions are now violently felt. If the world’s powerful nations had not so brazenly shrugged off three-quarters of a million Palestinians being driven from their homes 76 years ago, accompanied by an estimated 15,000 suffering violent deaths, the seeds of today’s bitter harvest would not have been planted. Political and media elites started as they meant to go on. How many know that last year, before the indefensible atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October, 234 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank alone, more than three dozen of them children? Life is cheap, they say. It is apparently meaningless if you are Palestinian.
If even some worth had been attached to Palestinian life then decades of occupation, siege, illegal colonisation, apartheid, violent repression and mass slaughter might never have happened. Oppressing others becomes difficult to sustain when their humanity is accepted.
Even some resigned to western indifference towards Palestinian life may have expected that, after such murderous carnage, the dam would eventually break. Surely 10,000 children suffering violent deaths, or the 10 kids having one or both legs amputated each day, often without anaesthetic, would stir powerful emotions. Surely 5,500 pregnant women giving birth each month – many having caesareans without anaesthetic – or newborns dying of hypothermia and diarrhoea would trigger unstoppable revulsion. Surely projections that, within a year, a quarter of Gaza’s population could die because of Israel’s destruction of the healthcare system alone, would lead to overpowering demands for something, anything, to end this obscenity. Surely endless stories of aid workers, journalists or medics being slaughtered along with multiple relatives – or even their entire family – because of an Israeli missile would eventually trigger an overwhelming chorus in western society: this is deranged, a despicable madness, it must stop?
This has not happened, and this is why the consequences will be severe.
The devaluing of Palestinian life is not a supposition, it is a statistical fact. According to a new study of coverage in major US newspapers, for every Israeli death Israelis are mentioned eight times – or at a rate 16 times more per death than that of Palestinians. An analysis of BBC coverage by data specialists Dana Najjar and Jan Lietava found a similarly devastating disparity, and that humanising terms such as “mother” or “husband” were used far less often to describe Palestinians, while emotive terms such as “massacre” or “slaughter’” were almost only ever applied to the Israeli victims of Hamas’ atrocities.
All this will have a profound impact. For a start, forget about any future western claims about human rights and international law. Much of the world already regarded such self-righteousness with contempt, as simply the latest ruse to advance the strategic interests of countries that became rich at the expense of the rest of the globe: centuries of often genocidal colonisation bred lasting cynicism, as did more recent bloodbaths such as the Iraq war, or active support for pliable tyrannies across multiple continents. After the west armed and backed Israel as it imposed mass death on Gaza through bombs, bullets, hunger, thirst and the destruction of medical facilities, nobody other than the terminally gullible will listen to such claims ever again.
But it’s not just other countries that western political and media elites should be panicking about. They face moral collapse at home, too. Younger generations in countries such as the US and Britain have grown up taking racism far more seriously than those before them, and polling shows they are far more sympathetic to Palestinians than older citizens are. They are avid users of social media, where they witness footage of the seemingly endless atrocities in Gaza, and Israeli soldiers gleefully serving up war crimes as fodder for public amusement. Irish lawyer Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, while laying out South Africa’s case against Israel in the international court of justice, described this as “the first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real time in the desperate, so far vain hope that the world might do something.” For younger generations exposed to numerous video clips of screaming mothers clutching the lifeless corpses of their newborns, this whole episode has proven instructive.
What do these young people then make of media coverage, or the statements of politicians, that don’t seem to treat Palestinian life as having any worth at all? What conclusions are being drawn about the growing minority populations of western countries whose media and political elites are making so little effort to disguise their contempt for Palestinian life as it is extinguished on such a biblical scale?
So yes, we have seen how the refusal to treat Palestinians as human beings made today’s nightmare inevitable. We can see how the moral claims used to justify western global dominance are permanently shredded. But little thought has been given to how political and media elites in western nations have torched their moral authority, leaving it to fester alongside thousands of unidentified Palestinian corpses buried under the rubble. A turning point, to be sure, with consequences that will only be understood when it is much too late.

E9O62PI5XE_IO2617XARFHYN0H,‘Gaslit by doctors’: UK women with endometriosis told it is ‘all in their head’,Hannah Fearn,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/21/gaslit-by-doctors-uk-women-with-endometriosis-told-it-is-all-in-their-head,"Women with endometriosis who have endured years of excruciating pain are being “fobbed off” by doctors and told their symptoms are “all in their head”, leading them to give up seeking NHS treatment, new research has found.
A study carried out by academics at Manchester Metropolitan University found women with the disease felt “gaslit” by doctors due to their lack of understanding of the condition.
The paper, due to be published in the Journal of Health Communication later this month, also found that treatment was subject to a postcode lottery. Patients in rural areas reported travelling for hours to access a specialist with full training in the complex gynaecological condition.
Endometriosis is a painful condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows around other organs inside the abdomen. It affects 1.5 million women in the UK. The study looked at the experiences of treatment and diagnosis of 33 patients and revealed how doctors’ lack of understanding of the symptoms meant women often spent years in pain before their condition was diagnosed. During this period participants were told they were exaggerating their symptoms, or their pain was dismissed as psychological.
As one 27-year-old participant reported: “I feel a lot of mistrust towards the healthcare system in general, simply because I have been told that the pain was in my head, that I must have a low pain threshold or that I was in pain because I was fat.”
Patients also reported that doctors lacked the medical training to offer support for suspected endometriosis, or to refer patients for the correct tests and procedures. Participants said they felt angry, fearful, anxious, frustrated and powerless, with many choosing not to seek further care because of the way they had been treated. The study concluded that “a lack of confidence to challenge medical experts meant that participants were likely to accept the medical discourse and avoid seeking help in future”.
When patients received diagnosis, those living outside cities found it very difficult to access care. One participant had to make a journey of 52 miles to attend the clinic of their nearest gynaecological specialist.
Dr Jasmine Hearn, senior lecturer in health psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University and lead author of the paper, said: “The biggest challenge is the disbelief, the dismissal and the sense of shame and embarrassment. Women are expected to tolerate much higher pain levels than men in general, so when women go [to the GP] with extreme pain, they are at that point of desperation and need to be taken seriously.”
The study exposed a need for change in the way women’s pain was treated and investigated by doctors, Dr Hearn added.
Tracey Morgan, 45, a veterinary nurse from Shrewsbury, said it took almost seven years for GPs to take her endometriosis symptoms seriously. “I was being told I had irritable bowel syndrome and cystitis, and in terms of period pain I was told ‘suck it up buttercup, every woman goes through that’,” she explains. “I got to the stage where I was having more and more time off work and I was really struggling. I was becoming unreliable and that wasn’t me at all.”
Eventually, when a friend was diagnosed with similar symptoms, Morgan went back to a female GP and insisted on a referral to a specialist. “She said: ‘You’re wasting your time, you’re wasting my time and if I refer you, then you’re wasting their time, but I’m going to refer you so that you just stop.’” Morgan’s referral led to a diagnosis of endometriosis including adhesions connecting her bowel and ovaries, and she has since had multiple surgeries to treat the condition.
There is currently no cure for endometriosis and treatment is designed to manage the symptoms, often by keyhole surgery to remove or destroy excess tissue. These procedures may give months or years of pain relief, but the problem often recurs. In the most severe cases, a full hysterectomy may be recommended, but even that may not fully resolve the condition.
The new paper concluded that doctors needed better training and to change the way they handle reports of symptoms that suggest possible endometriosis.
Charlotte McArdle, deputy chief nursing officer for patient safety and improvement at NHS England, said: “The NHS takes endometriosis extremely seriously and it is essential that staff support women experiencing cyclical pain, as well as the [associated] psychological effects.
“The health service is committed to meeting women’s individual healthcare needs and is rolling out dedicated pelvic health clinics – bringing together specialist healthcare staff – to provide further support for women living with endometriosis.”"
G1H7TZPV25_HPX94WCTZ8Y458Y,Glorious Exploits by Ferdia Lennon review – uproarious am-dram in ancient Sicily,Killian Fox,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/21/glorious-exploits-by-ferdia-lennon-review-uproarious-am-dram-in-ancient-sicily,"This immensely likable debut novel from Irish writer Ferdia Lennon opens in Syracuse, south-east Sicily, in 412BC. The city has lately defeated a military expedition from Athens and thousands of surviving invaders have been thrown into nearby quarries to rot. No Syracusans lament their fate until two locals visit one day with an idea to cast the prisoners in a play by Euripides.
The two men are Gelon, a melancholy theatre obsessive, and his wisecracking friend Lampo, who narrates the novel in a distinctly un-Sicilian voice. “Would you be knowing any passages?” he demands of a near-dead Athenian, seeking an actor to play Jason in Medea. Soon the pair are sneaking down daily to rehearse their ragtag troupe for a double bill to which the whole town is invited.
It’s an uproarious premise, but Irish accents aside, the scenario isn’t quite as far-fetched as it might appear. There are accounts in Plutarch of Athenian prisoners in Sicily trading lines of Euripides in return for food and drink or even freedom. The novel is raucously funny – Lampo is a brilliant comic creation – but Lennon, a classics graduate, blends the laughs with tragedy of the blackest pitch.
The writing is beautifully controlled. The eyes of a vengeful Syracusan, hollowed out by grief, become “a black sea under an eclipse”. Gelon’s breath, in one dismal scene, “makes weird shapes in the air like grey flowers are bursting from his lips and wilting on the wind”.
Lampo does atrocious things in a bid to be helpful. Scrabbling for money to buy costumes, he proposes robbing an old man with no legs. Later, marvelling that strangers gave up their lives to save his, he wonders if he’d have done the same. “Not at all,” he decides. But his experience in the quarries, collaborating with enemies to shed light on human suffering through theatre, does unlock selfless impulses he never knew he had.
Lennon stops well short of suggesting that stories have the power to heal the world, but – just sometimes – they can make a difference to individual lives. As Lampo puts it in a moment of fleeting optimism: “I’m pouring water in the desert, hoping flowers grow.”

G7O5A8TXO7_6I6K72ILN7HJQVT,Egypt backs Somalia in dispute over Ethiopia-Somaliland deal,Faisal Ali,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/egypt-backs-somalia-in-dispute-over-ethiopia-somaliland-deal,"The president of Egypt, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has expressed his support for Somalia in a dispute over an offer by the breakaway northern region of Somaliland to give land-locked Ethiopia access to its coast in exchange for recognition of its independence.
In his strongest statement yet on the issue at a press conference in Cairo alongside the president of Somalia, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Sisi said: “My message to Ethiopia is that trying to seize a piece of land to control it is something no one will agree to.”
He added that his country would be ready to provide “support in case of aggression against one of the Arab countries, especially when brotherly countries ask us to stand by them”, raising concerns that Cairo may become directly involved in an escalating dispute between Mogadishu and Addis Ababa.
Relations between Somalia and Ethiopia have deteriorated since early January, when Somaliland and Ethiopia announced a memorandum of understanding that bypassed the Somali government, which has not exercised control over the self-declared republic since 1991.
Officials from Somaliland have claimed that the prospective agreement would involve Ethiopia gaining a naval base along its Gulf of Aden coastline in exchange full recognition. Ethiopia has remained tight-lipped on this aspect of the deal amid growing international pressure, though several officials have hinted at their support for Somaliland’s independence.
In an interview with the Observer this month, Somaliland’s foreign minister, Essa Kayd, said that unless the region receives recognition as an independent state, “nothing is going to happen”. “Ethiopia needs sea access and we need recognition, so you can see how these needs can be dealt with,” Kayd added.
Ethiopia has been landlocked since 1993, when its own restive northern region of Eritrea declared independence, making the country reliant on neighbouring Djibouti for virtually all of its international trade.
Somalia has mobilised the support of its international partners since Ethiopia and Somaliland announced the deal on New Year’s Day. Egypt, which has seen its own ties with Ethiopia deteriorate over a dam that Ethiopia has built on the Blue Nile, has been vocal in its opposition to the memorandum.
Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said on Wednesday that Ethiopia was “a source of instability” in the region and called on it to respect Somalia’s territorial integrity.
The Somali government has rejected calls for mediation between it and Ethiopia over the deal until Addis Ababa renounces the pact and reverses course on the memorandum, which Somali officials have called an attempt to “annex” its territory.
In my address at NAM, I emphasized that the continuous reckless and irresponsible rhetoric emanating from the officials  of Ethiopia constitutes a dangerous violation of Somalia’s sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, demonstrating an absolute disregard for the cardinal… pic.twitter.com/YLd27Cs0nM
The Somali president raised the issue at a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, a 120-member bloc of countries, telling delegates in Uganda that the agreement between Somaliland and Ethiopia allowed the latter to “annex a corridor to establish a naval base on our coastline” and calling the deal a “clear violation of Somalia’s sovereignty”.
Heads of state from across the region gathered in Uganda on Thursday at a meeting called by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an east African inter-governmental organisation, to tackle the fallout from the memorandum.
The prime minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, did not attend in person, but the regional body, in which Ethiopia exercises significant influence, issued a cautiously worded statement that called on all members to respect one another’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
On Wednesday, the US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, expressed concern that further tension between Somalia and Ethiopia, which Somalia has threatened might lead to war, could undermine broader efforts in the fight against al-Shabaab, an Islamist insurgency group in Somalia."
GD2CZT39ZK_7L4QMZLPKQVS7BZ,Remembering the horror of the Holocaust,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/remembering-the-horror-of-the-holocaust,"On 27 January, the UK will commemorate the UK’s annual Holocaust Memorial Day. We do so at a time when the fabric of our diverse society feels increasingly fragile. Since October the UK has witnessed unprecedented increases in anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate crimes. Much is made of the role of the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza as a driver of this hatred: British Muslims being held falsely accountable for the killings of Israeli civilians by Hamas, and British Jews for civilians killed by Israeli military action in Gaza.
It’s undoubtedly true that the horrific violence we are seeing is heightening tensions, but the reality is this conflict is amplifying unaddressed issues of hate in our society. It is not concern for Jewish safety in Israel that compels someone to dump a pig’s head at a proposed mosque site, or a desire to express solidarity with the Palestinian people that makes someone scrawl swastikas on bridges. Both are motivated by hatred we can grow here at home.
Holocaust Memorial Day is a moment to remember the systematic slaughter of 6 million Jewish people for no reason other than who they were. The day is also when we remember the genocides of Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica and Darfur, and remind us all of where dehumanisation, prejudice and hatred can lead. As we remember these genocides, we need to ensure we learn their lessons and be ready to act to prevent adding any more to that awful list.
As politicians from three different parties, we come together to remind our country that the rising tide of hatred we have seen in recent months makes it more important than ever that we take this moment on 27 January to remember the inevitable outcome of indulging hatred and staying silent when others are persecuted for who they are.Sayeeda Warsi, Naz Shah MP and Layla Moran MP"
HGTGTTU06T_AWWRYE1BW1BBCQG,"UN chief decries ‘unacceptable’ scale of Gaza deaths as 25,000 reported killed",Jason Burke,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/gaza-death-toll-25000-un-antonio-guterres,"Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed 25,000 Palestinians, the health ministry in the territory has announced, as the UN chief described the scale of civilian killings as “heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable”.
Most of the casualties were women and children, the ministry said, and thousands more bodies were likely to remain uncounted under rubble across Gaza.
Speaking at a global summit in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, denounced Israel’s three-month assault.
“Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary general,” Guterres said at the opening of the G77+China, a coalition of 135 developing countries.
“This is heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable. The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region.”
Israel has ignored international outrage at the toll exacted on Gaza by its offensive, which was launched in response to Hamas’s attack into southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians in their homes and at a music festival. Hamas also seized about 250 hostages, of whom 132 remain in Gaza, though at least 27 are believed to have been killed.
Israeli forces are advancing into southern parts of Gaza crowded with those who have fled combat elsewhere. At least a million displaced people are believed to have sought refuge in the small town of Rafah on the border with Egypt, where they are living in makeshift camps, UN-run shelters and private apartments.
Thick plumes of smoke billowed above the main southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday morning as the Israeli army said it had “eliminated a number of terrorists” there.
There were also reports of renewed fighting in the north, which Israeli troops are struggling to clear of Hamas militants who use an extensive tunnel network to launch surprise attacks.
At least 178 bodies had been brought to Gaza’s hospitals in the past 24 hours, along with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Ashraf al-Qidra, a health ministry spokesperson.
The Hamas government’s media office said the dead and injured “could not be transferred to hospitals because of the continued artillery shelling on ... Khan Younis and the Tal al-Hawa area in Gaza City and the north”.
In a briefing on Saturday evening, the Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said troops had found a tunnel in Khan Younis where some hostages had previously been kept.
Among the evidence of their presence were paintings, including by a five-year-old captive, he said.
About 20 hostages had been held there at different times, he said, “in difficult conditions without daylight ... with little oxygen and terrible humidity”.
Soldiers entered the booby-trapped tunnel and fought a battle with militants in which “the terrorists were eliminated”, Hagari said.
Over the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.
Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged to pursue the offensive in Gaza until “total victory”, but commentators in Israel have questioned the conduct of the war, arguing that the offensive’s goals are unrealistic and accusing the Israeli prime minister of indecision.
On Saturday, Netanyahu again rejected Joe Biden’s call for a Palestinian state after the war. His office said that in talks on Friday with the US president, Netanyahu “reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.
Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, said Netanyahu’s refusal was “disappointing” but not a “surprise”. “I don’t think we get to a solution unless there’s a two-state solution,” he told the BBC.
In a small concession to Washington, Israel announced on Sunday it had agreed a plan for frozen Palestinian tax funds to be held by a third-party country.
Netanyahu is under growing domestic pressure to secure the return of the hostages and account for the security failings surrounding the October attack.
Thousands of people protested across Israel on Saturday evening to demand the release of the hostages and early elections to oust Netanyahu.
Avi Lulu Shamriz, the father of Alon Shamriz, a hostage mistakenly killed by Israeli troops earlier in the war, said Netanyahu’s strategy was wrong. “The way we’re going, all the hostages are going to die. It’s not too late to free them,” he said.
Humanitarian officials have repeatedly called for more aid to enter Gaza as disease and famine loom.
Diplomatic efforts have sought to secure more deliveries and a truce similar to the week-long cessation of hostilities in November during which Hamas released dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Guterres said Netanyahu’s refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians was totally unacceptable, and that denying Palestinians the right to statehood “would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security”.
In the restive occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said it had demolished two houses in Hebron belonging to two Palestinian gunmen who carried out an attack on a road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in November.
Rising tensions and violence across the Middle East have stoked fears of a wider conflagration involving Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
The biggest fear is of a new conflict on Israel’s northern border, where clashes that began in October have intensified in recent weeks. Analysts say both Israel and Hezbollah are carefully calibrating their use of violence, but that there had been a significant increase, with a far greater risk of inadvertent escalation leading to war.
Two Hezbollah fighters were killed on Sunday when an Israeli drone hit their vehicle in southern Lebanon, security sources said. It was the latest strike in an area where Israel has targeted dozens of Hezbollah fighters. Israel’a military said it did not comment on foreign reports.
Earlier, residents and security officials said a drone killed two people and injured at least four others near the village of Kafra, five miles from the border.
Hezbollah has said its campaign of cross-border strikes has aided Palestinians by stretching Israeli forces and driving tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes.It has come at a cost, with about 140 Hezbollah fighters and at least 25 Lebanese civilians killed, as well as at least nine Israeli soldiers and a civilian.
Underlining the instability in the region, Iranian media said an Israeli strike on Damascus on Saturday had killed the Revolutionary Guards’ spy chief in Syria and four other Guards members."
HRGGTC03K4_T16M5CPR6324FM8,Jamie Dimon thinks Trump was ‘kind of right’ about a lot of things. What?,Robert Reich,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-defends-trump,"On Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum’s confab in Davos, Switzerland, Jamie Dimon – chair and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest and most profitable bank in the United States, and one of the most influential CEOs in the world – heaped praise on Donald Trump’s policies while president.
“Take a step back, be honest,” Dimon said. Trump “was kind of right about Nato, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China. He wasn’t wrong about some of these critical issues.”
What?
Mr Dimon, take a step back, be honest.
Kind of right about Nato? Trump wanted the US to withdraw from Nato – and may get his way if he becomes president again. This would open Europe further to Putin’s aggression.
Kind of right on immigration? Even the conservative Cato Institute found that Trump reduced legal immigration but not illegal immigration. Trump refused to grant legal status to children of immigrants born in the United States or who grew up in the US. He banned Muslims from the US, and when the Muslim ban was found to be unconstitutional, banned people from Muslim countries. He fueled the flames of nativism by describing poorer nations as “shitholes” and has used terms redolent of Nazism to describe foreigners as “poisoning the blood” of Americans.
Grew the economy quite well? In fact, under Trump the economy lost 2.9m jobs. Even before the pandemic, job growth was slower than it has been under Biden. The unemployment rate increased by 1.6 percentage points to 6.3%. The international trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce went up. The US trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was the highest since 2008 and increased 40.5% from 2016. The number of Americans lacking health insurance rose by 3 million. The federal debt held by the public went up, from $14.4tn to $21.6tn.
Tax reform worked? Trump’s tax cut conferred most of its benefits on big corporations and the rich, while enlarging the budget deficit. Giant banks and financial services companies got huge gains based on the new, lower corporate rate (21%), as well as the more preferable tax treatment of pass-through companies.
If not for the Trump cuts – along with the Bush tax cuts and their extensions – federal revenues would keep pace with federal spending indefinitely, and the ratio of the debt to the national economy would be declining.
Instead, these tax cuts have added $10tn to the debt since their enactment and are responsible for 57% of the increase in the debt ratio since 2001, and more than 90% of the increase in the debt ratio if the one-time costs of bills responding to Covid-19 and the Great Recession are excluded. Eventually, the tax cuts are projected to grow to more than 100% of the increase.
Right about China? As the Brookings Institution found, Trump’s China policy only made China less restrained in pursuit of its ambitions. Confrontation has intensified, areas of cooperation have vanished, and the capacity of both countries to solve problems or manage competing interests has atrophied.
Oh, and then there are the pesky matters of Trump’s seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, facing 91 criminal indictments, causing the US to be more divided than at any time since the Civil War, lying every time he opens his mouth, and planning to use the justice department for “vengeance” against his political enemies if elected again.
Why is Jamie Dimon – the most influential CEO in America – spouting these talking points in favor of Trump?
Because he thinks Trump has a good chance of becoming president, and Dimon wants to be in his good graces.

Asked which candidate would be better for his business, Dimon said: “I have to be prepared for both. I will be prepared for both. We will deal with both.”
Dimon knows that his support for Nikki Haley irked Trump.
“Highly overrated Globalist Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMORGAN, is quietly pushing another non-MAGA person, Nikki Haley, for President,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social in late November. “I’ve never been a big Jamie Dimon fan, but had to live with this guy when he came begging to the White House. I guess I don’t have to live with him anymore, and that’s a really good thing.”
So now, Dimon – like Republican lawmakers across the US, like too many other leaders of American institutions – feels it necessary to cave into the integrity-crushing intimidation of a Trump administration, and lick Trump’s backside.
And when Dimon does this, you can bet many other CEOs and financial leaders will now follow his example.
At a time in American history when the most influential leaders of the US need to stand up loudly and clearly for the rule of law, for democracy, for decency, and against Donald Trump, Dimon is leading the charge in the opposite direction.
This is how fascism takes root and spreads.

HSHKJDRI9Y_AWFOC274GAD214H,‘Work needs rest and rest takes work’: fatigue specialist Vincent Deary on coping with life,Genevieve Fox,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/21/work-needs-rest-and-rest-takes-work-fatigue-specialist-vincent-deary-on-coping-with-life,"Vincent Deary, psychologist, fatigue specialist and author, has been telling me what an “anxious creature” he is. He barely slept last night. The hotel room was unfamiliar and noisy. Worse, the prospect of an interview and of meeting someone new made his arrhythmic heart race.
It’s racing now as we sit together in a London hotel. We’re here to discuss his new book, How We Break: Navigating the Wear and Tear of Living, an exploration of our varying responses to the corrosive pressures of daily life, especially work, and an assertion of the vital necessity of rest, recovery and the lost art of convalescence. The book is the second in a trilogy by Deary, a professor of psychology at Northumbria University and a clinical fatigue specialist at the Cresta Fatigue Clinic, a role from which he has just retired. The NHS clinic, which is closing later this year, is unique in the UK for taking a multi-disciplinary approach to disabling fatigue. Deary goes on to share something else with me: he dreads the intimacy of dinner parties and hates surprises, before adding that his partner of 10 years recently threw a surprise party for his 60th birthday – and he loved it. Proof, it seems, that people can change.
Well yes and no. Deary believes we can make changes, if circumstances allow, and we can adapt, but we can’t fundamentally change the self we were born with. First, there’s our genetic makeup. Then, he says, there’s our constitution, which is encoded with memories of previous generations and sometimes by intergenerational trauma; the body remembers, it keeps score. Deary offers himself up as a good example of this, and there are three other case histories in the book, including that of his late mother.
When he hit 40, long since amicably divorced, Deary left his job as an NHS therapist, sold up in London, moved back to Scotland, and corralled material for the first book. Five years later, he became a single parent when his 16-year-old daughter came to live with him. The finished book cowered in a drawer, Deary lacking the confidence to seek publication. How to Live, the first book in the trilogy, was finally published when he was 50. Now he was an author, too, an acclaimed one. Lots of changes there then.
But who he is, fundamentally, has not changed, he says. “I still have social anxiety.” What he has managed to change is his relationship with this anxiety: “I recognise that it is part of me, that it’s going to show up, so I now literally bring it along with me as a companion. And that’s OK. It might mean I am hyper and talk a lot, but that can be quite useful.”
For Deary, arriving at this place of self-acceptance and self-love has been a project, it’s been work and that’s also OK, because we each have to work on the self we are born with in order to survive, or thrive. Some, like Deary, won’t be a good fit for their environment, which means “some of us are harder work for ourselves than others”. We “tremble” as we encounter the turbulence of life, including the changes we have to navigate but, again, some of us tremble more than others. In turn, holding steady in the face of change, what’s known as the allostatic load, becomes too much, “There’s no wriggle room and we break,” as Deary himself did while writing his new book.
As part of his work on himself, Deary has traced the reach and roots of his anxiety, as he does for his patients in the fatigue clinic. Early on, he “meets” an effeminate child growing up in a working-class culture on the west coast of Scotland and sees what “a misfit” he was. He ran with the “rejects and the freaks”.
“I was visibly different from my peers,” he tells me, “very gentle, soft-spoken. I was little and timorous by nature. That’s not necessarily great in a working-class comprehensive in the 70s in Scotland. There was bullying. I was called either snobby or poofy. I was neither.” He had a big nose and was called Concorde. “My body remembers the early threats; I am still easily frightened.”
So was his mother. Gentle and open-minded, she had a punitive upbringing and, like her son, had an “anxious constitution”. Deary was an “unexpected pregnancy,” he writes, his mother already dealing with a large family and the wear and tear of poverty and a difficult marriage. “I was born alarmed,” he writes. But home was good. “I had quite an exceptional mother,” he says, “and an exceptional home life. We were enculturated into art, literature, theatre very early on and so that marked us out as different. I did not come from a typical west coast Scottish family.”
He shares his story in the book, not “to say I had a really difficult time, but because I wanted people to find resonance – I wanted them to see that when you don’t fit in, you’re given back to yourself as work because you need to learn to manage that not fitting. You need to learn to manage the difficult feelings coming out of that and you need to learn to manage yourself.”
Key to that self-management is not only understanding and self-love, but rest. Deary has a mantra: work needs rest and rest takes work. We need to take time out to rest in order to heal from extreme exhaustion, chronic illness, or unexpected life events, what Deary terms “biographical disruption”. We also need to take a rest from work and free ourselves from an “audit culture” that pushes us, sometimes to breaking point. But first, we need to learn how to rest. “It’s a skill,” he says, one that nowadays has to be acquired.
“One of the things I noticed in the fatigue clinic is that tired people can often do the things they need to do, but a lot of them really struggle with switching off. We often associate our worth and our value in terms of productivity and output. Both within academia and the NHS there are whole mini-industries dedicated to evaluating your productivity and your output, often telling you that you could do better and, actually, could you do better with less, please. It’s very easy to buy into that narrative that your work equals your productivity. So, for people who are exhausted and can’t be productive, it’s very easy to go, I don’t deserve to rest, I am worthless, I have done nothing to earn this.

“But we need to allow ourselves to rest, to nap, to enjoy, to deliberately switch on to joy and nourishment and the stuff that actually fills the tank. I wrote this book to understand myself, but also because, in the last few years, I saw friends, family, colleagues, society, to an extent, just become overwhelmed, or exhausted, or hopeless or joyless. Ordinary people going through ordinary suffering. Some of them crossed the clinical line into physical or mental health systems, but most of them were just struggling to get on with life. Often the first casualty of stress is joy. Deliberately leaning into that joy and finding out the stuff that restores you is really key to recovery.”
Some GPs have started handing out joy as a “social prescription”. But how do we identify what brings us joy? “The clue is in our everyday language: ‘That really lifted my spirits,’ or ‘I got a lot out of that.’ It’s the stuff that cheers us up or energises us.” A meal with loved ones is often high up on the list. Deary’s academic research looks at the challenges faced by head and neck cancer survivors. “It’s not the food they miss,” he says, “it’s the sharing. They were mourning the connection. It’s what we call commensality: that social magic which comes when you’re sharing food. Our research with food and head and neck cancer and other conditions highlighted that pleasure is a necessity; being deprived of it is literally depressing and demoralising.”
One day, halfway through writing How We Break, Deary discovered this for himself. He woke up “in a state of exhaustion. I had no real ability to get out of bed. When I finally took myself for a walk, I was wiped out the next day. I was in a state of hopeless exhaustion. My mood went down as well. I was completely disengaged from life. It was a very difficult time.”
To recover he did “what I help people in the fatigue clinic do, which is, gradually get back into things at my own pace and do a combination of physical and emotional rehab. Incremental engagement with life. I think that is what true convalescence is. It’s not just rest and it’s not just activity, it’s that mixture of both: it’s acknowledging that there is a deep need for rest and recovery. It’s like Thomas Mann’s Magic Mountain where they are all sitting about in the sanatorium: there’s the beauty, there’s the connection, there’s the food. There’s the joy” – even in an interview. “A joyful encounter!” was Deary’s verdict, glad that he came, proud of himself and proof that a little self-love goes a long way to ease the wear and tear of life.

JFFBJNHXCE_0WU41XF5GK06E8V,Gaza activist tells of beating and abuse in Israeli detention,Aseel Mousa,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/gaza-activist-tells-of-beating-and-abuse-in-israeli-detention,"The Gaza-based human rights activist Ayman Lubbad has not seen his wife and three children for more than a month, since he was ordered to strip to his underwear in the street outside his home, then driven away with other Palestinian men for a week of abuse and detention.
He was tortured and humiliated, he said, giving one of various accounts of recent Israeli abuse of Palestinians in detention; at least six have died, and one autopsy report showed serious injuries, Haaretz newspaper reported.
Hundreds of Gaza residents detained in Israel’s military campaign have faced torture methods including electric shocks, cigarette and lighter burns, stress positions and deprivation of sleep, food and toilet facilities, investigations by Reuters and +972 magazine found.
The Israel Defense Forces have said all allegations of improper conduct in detention facilities are thoroughly investigated, and that suspects strip-searched for security reasons during arrest should be allowed to dress again before being taken into custody.
When Lubbad was released without charge, it was in Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza Strip, while his family are still at their home in northern Beit Lahia.
The Israeli military separate them, Palestinians are not allowed to move north through the strip and his family don’t want to risk the dangerous journey south through an active war zone, he told the Guardian in an interview.
They were separated on 7 December, when an Israeli military announcement made over a loudspeaker ordered everyone in the area to evacuate their homes. Women and elderly people were sent to the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital. Men were ordered to undress to their underwear in the street.
Photos of dozens of the nearly naked men kneeling in the cold and mud of a ruined street on a December morning prompted outrage around the world. The US said the photos were “deeply disturbing”, and the International Committee of the Red Cross said detainees must be treated with humanity and dignity.
Lubbad, who works at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, recognised himself in some of the photos. Other civilian detainees identified by friends, family and employers included a young teenager, a man in his 70s and a well-known journalist.
As the men waited some soldiers opened fire, injuring a young man’s hand, while others humiliated their captives and destroyed homes, Lubbad said.
“The Israeli soldiers photographed us inappropriately and compelled some of the detained boys to dance. They set fire to the homes of the Muqayd, Mahdi, Kahlot and Sorour families in front of us while we were seated in the street,” he said in a statement about his captivity.
Two hours later Lubbad was taken just north of Gaza to the beach near Zikim kibbutz, then transported “handcuffed and blindfolded” to an army camp that Israeli soldiers told prisoners was in Ofakim, a city farther inland.
There the Gaza residents were herded into shelters surrounded by barbed wire, between 500 and 700 men overlooked by two elevated guard posts for Israeli soldiers. The men had to kneel, their eyes covered, from 5am until midnight.
“Any attempt to change your position or remove the blindfold resulted in punishment, including standing with hands raised above the head for about three hours and beatings,” Lubbad said.
There were interrogations with an investigator who mocked his work, saying: “I’ll teach you your rights well in prison.”
Five days after he was ordered from his home, he was transferred again. He said he was beaten in the ribs during the move, and was in such severe pain that he was unable to sleep for two nights.
Other prisoners told him the new facility was in Jabal Mukaber neighbourhood in Jerusalem. He was taken at midday on his first day there for a 10-hour interrogation. The man started the interview by telling Lubbad that he was mentally ill and not taking medication.
He demanded information about Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and when Lubbad said he was a civilian activist who didn’t know about the armed groups, the man grew increasingly angry and said Gaza residents would be treated like dogs.
“The investigator threatened me and cursed me with obscene words while hitting me in the face. He placed a blindfold over my eyes and went to drink tea or have lunch,” Lubbad said.
“On his return, he would ask me the same questions about Hamas and I would answer that I did not know any details and that my social relationships were very limited.”
Towards the end of the interview, he was blindfolded and taken to sit outside in the freezing night, where he could hear others being beaten. He was then attacked himself, he said. “After I could not bear the extreme cold, some soldiers came and beat me and told me ‘every dog has its day’,” which he took as a death threat.
Asked about Lubbad’s claims, an IDF spokesperson said “any allegations of improper conduct in the [detention] facility are thoroughly investigated” and that Israeli law and military regulations “do not permit taking the punitive actions described”.
The detention centre mostly held hundreds of Gaza residents who had been working in Israel when Hamas attacked on 7 October. Late on Wednesday night there was a roll call, and soldiers appeared with handcuffs and boxes holding the prisoners’ possessions.
“Civilian buses appeared, so we knew that they would release us,” he said. The men were handcuffed together for the drive, and reached the Kerem Shalom crossing around midnight, when they were told to cross back into Gaza on foot.
“I had nothing in my possession except my ID card,” Lubbad said. He contacted his wife and children to tell them he had been released and was back in Gaza, and went to look for somewhere to shelter in Rafah.
The intensity of the war in Gaza left little time even for relief that he had survived detention. It was soon overshadowed by a new tragedy. An hour after he crossed back into Gaza, an Israeli airstrike killed his brother."
JZF7I30X5C_Y3XXQ3BGOHEA6DC,‘All faiths and none’: London peace march aims to ease Gaza tensions,Jon Ungoed-Thomas,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/all-faiths-and-none-london-peace-march-aims-to-ease-gaza-tensions,"A multi-faith peace march is due to be held in London on Sunday, aimed at easing the bitterness and tension over the Israel-Gaza war.
The midday march from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square and back is one of a series of events due to be held in the next few days and weeks in solidarity with people affected by conflict in Israel and Palestine. Gatherings are also planned in Birmingham and Oxford.
Together for Humanity, supported by a coalition of charities, community organisations and faith groups, is coordinating the events. The peace march in London is organised by Quakers in Britain and Plum Village UK, a Buddhist community.
“This is about people of all faiths and none having the space to mourn all civilians affected by the conflict,” said Brendan Cox, co-founder of Together for Humanity. “It’s a chance to stand against antisemitism and anti-Muslim hate, and to show those who seek to divide us that the vast majority of people in this country don’t discriminate when it comes to compassion.”
There will also be a gathering, organised by charity The Oxford Foundation at Oxford town hall on Sunday, to remember those who have lost their lives in the conflict in Israel and Palestine, and in others around the world.
Magen Inon, a teacher living in London whose parents Yakov and Bilha were killed by Hamas in the 7 October attack, is backing the events. “Since the murder of my parents, my family and I have felt immense pain,” he said. “This pain has been compounded by those who have sought to further division and spread hate here in the UK and elsewhere.
“I’m calling everyone who believes all people deserve basic human rights to come together and we will be in a better position to find to solution to the conflict. Either both sides win, or everybody loses.”
In a peace vigil outside Downing Street in December, Inon shared a platform with Hamze Awawde, a Palestinian peace activist who lives in Ramallah in the West Bank. Inon said at the vigil that people needed to recognise the suffering and loss of lives on both sides and to “set aside fear and hate and to be hopeful that a better future is possible.”
Awawde said: “We can and must stand opposed to hatred – both Islamophobia and antisemitism – and mourn the loss of all innocent lives in this terrible conflict – Palestinians and Israelis, Muslims and Jews.
“Seeing people of different faiths and backgrounds come together, not simply in spite of their differences, but because of them, fills me with a deep hope that we can work towards a lasting peace.”"
L0CFUQ0E8W_VOFZ3043NKHSMA1,Questions raised over British Steel’s finances,Kalyeena Makortoff,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/21/questions-raised-over-british-steels-finances,"British Steel’s financial footing has been thrown into question after auditors warned of “material uncertainty” over the struggling manufacturer’s ability to operate without a fresh cash injection from its Chinese owner.
The auditors at Moore Kingston Smith also unexpectedly resigned just days after the company released delayed its financial filings for 2021. The auditor had been appointed only a year earlier.
The problems at the UK’s second largest steelmaker could threaten a large number of the jobs of its 4,500-strong workforce, compounding the pain for Britain’s steel industry, which is already grappling with Tata Steel’s planned shutdown of two blast furnaces at Port Talbot. The decision by the Indian-owned firm will result in up to 2,800 job losses, and has been condemned as a “devastating blow” by the Community union.
In an earnings report released more than a year after they were due at Companies House, the auditor warned that British Steel “need further funding from its ultimate parent company”, Jingye, which rescued the firm from collapse in March 2020.
While the company’s directors said they were confident that they would have enough funding for the following 12 months – effectively to the end of 2022 – auditors said there was “material uncertainty” over its ability to continue operating without another cash injection.
The Scunthorpe-based company reported a loss of £51m for 2021, having reported a £268m profit a year earlier, due in part to a sudden surge in energy costs in October, which the company said had a “significantly adverse impact on product margins”.
Auditors also signalled that they were unable to “satisfy ourselves” over the existence of £45.8m worth of stock, despite trying to verify it through “alternative means”.
Filings at Companies House now indicate that Moore Kingston Smith has resigned from its role, just days after the release of the report, and a year after its predecessor, Mazars, quit due to disagreements over fees.

L33M4TYGMR_S2W31A6N0V66DPV,A Real Pain review – Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin lead pat buddy dramedy,Adrian Horton,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/21/a-real-pain-review-jesse-eisenberg-kieran-culkin,"Over a nearly two-decade acting career, Jesse Eisenberg has established an energy so distinct you could describe the characters and the movies around them by his name – wordy, wry, brimming with nerves and discomfort. He can deliver a scathing deadpan, as in The Social Network, or a rapid-fire spit of anxieties, most recently in Fleishman Is in Trouble. He’s a natural fit for a certain type of small-stakes, character-driven indie dramedy, as was his first feature as a writer-director, last year’s When You Finish Saving the World, about fractured, lonely, sardonic family of three; its humorous, wincing journey of social awkwardness, as the New Yorker bluntly put it, “very Jesse Eisenberg”.
For better or for worse, his second feature, A Real Pain, is even more Jesse Eisenberg – in part because he plays a talky and tightly wound character – but with a mistier eye and sweeter heart than its forbearer. (The film counts Emma Stone and her husband, the SNL writer Dave McCary, as producers.) Still, it’s a dramedy of discontents: we meet Eisenberg’s David Kaplan, a New Yorker who sells digital ads for a living, making a series of anxious phone calls to cousin Benji (Kieran Culkin), an impishly charming idler, in his trademark nervous patter. They’re bound for Poland to visit the homeland of their grandmother, owing to her final wishes and, in their own way, nagging guilt over the weight of historical trauma. Their grandma Dory was one of the lucky ones, a Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust and built a new life.
A Real Pain is, on one level, a philosophical inquiry into how to contextualize, scale or feel the universal, galling experience of human pain; how to weigh one’s individual problems in the face of great tragedy (like, say, David’s medicated OCD, compared to the Holocaust); what to do with a legacy of suffering and survival. And it is more straightforwardly a combustion of performance styles: Culkin and Eisenberg play extremely to their types. Both actors have made careers out of playing characters who seem like they want to crawl out of their skin, just running at different temperatures – Eisenberg is cold, clammy, cutting; Culkin, hot-blooded, twitchy and chaotic. Like Roman Roy, Culkin’s character on Succession, Benji is a foul-mouthed man-child with little impulse control or filter. Unlike him, he is actually interested in other people and has better class politics (“money is like fucking heroin for boring people”, he says in one of many outbursts nearly causing David an aneurysm).
Benji is clearly in emotional pain, with a vague backstory of doing nothing much for years until recent turmoil. (He was closer to their grandmother, a “bygone realist” I wish I knew more about.) Though Culkin plays him with scene-stealing, live-wire intensity, he remains a Movie Character, more Peter Pan foil than adult. He can be wearisome, yet easily endears himself to the Kaplans’ fellow group tourists in Poland, each drawn by a personal connection to Jewishness or trauma. Flinty LA divorcee Marcia’s (Jennifer Grey) grandparents also fled the Holocaust; older couple Mark (Daniel Oreskes) and Diane (Liza Sadovy) have Polish Jewish ancestry; Eloge (Kurt Egyiawan) escaped the Rwandan genocide and converted to Judaism in Canada. Will Sharpe demonstrates sharp comedic timing – he got the biggest laugh out of a lightly funny movie – and brings palpable vulnerability to James, the Oxford-credentialed, non-Jewish tour guide just trying to do his best at a strange job.
Filmed on location in Poland, including at the Majdanek concentration camp, A Real Pain has an alluring, unforced sense of place; Eisenberg and the cinematographer Michal Dymek capture Warsaw, Lublin and the Polish countryside with a curious eye, and not always glamorously. Returning to such a haunted, hallowed place also means plenty of graffiti, Communist brutalism, nondescript hotel rooms and trains.
But the rich cityscapes and Eisenberg’s keen visual instinct for emotional claustrophobia fade behind the intensity of its movie rhythm. David needs to get out of his own head and Benji craves something all-caps REAL; cue symbolic moment, thematic discussion, a character-revealing response undercut by something quirky, bathetic or humbling, repeat. A Real Pain is occasionally insightful on the subject of suffering, sometimes funny, a bit endearing, a little pretentious, often dry. In other words, very of a type.

L8RJ4PW7OP_UJWD4TGHS4KETH1,Newspapers stolen after a story about rape charges at Colorado police chief’s house,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/colorado-town-newspapers-stolen,"Nearly all the copies of a small-town Colorado newspaper were stolen from newspaper racks on the same day the Ouray County Plaindealer published a story about charges being filed over rapes alleged to have occurred at an underage drinking party at the police chief’s house while the chief was asleep, the owner and publisher said on Friday.
Mike Wiggins vowed to get to the bottom of it, posting Thursday on X, formerly Twitter: “If you hoped to silence or intimidate us, you failed miserably. We’ll find out who did this. And another press run is imminent.”
The newspaper posted the story on social media and removed its website paywall so people could read about the felony sexual assault charges filed against three men, including a relative of the police chief, for actions that allegedly occurred at a May 2023 party in Ouray where drugs and alcohol were used, according to court records.
The suspects were ages 17, 18 and 19 at the time, and the person who reported the rapes was 17, records said.
By Thursday evening, someone had returned a garbage bag full of newspapers to the Plaindealer and supporters had donated about $2,000 to the paper, something Wiggins called “extremely heartening and humbling”.
Wiggins believed the person who returned the newspapers was the person who took them and that only one person was involved in the theft. Wiggins declined to identify the person, but he reported the information to police. Officers also had surveillance video of some of the thefts, he said.
Police identified a suspect who will be cited for the theft, the Ouray county sheriff’s office said in a statement posted on social media on Friday.
“The suspect is not a member or relative of local law enforcement and not associated with the defendants in the recent reported sexual assault,” the statement said, adding that the Colorado bureau of investigation is investigating the sexual assault.
About 250 newspapers filled the racks on Friday morning in Ouray county, a mountainous area in south-western Colorado that is home to about 5,000 people.
“If somebody was going to try to make it so the public couldn’t read this story, we were going to make sure to counteract that,” Wiggins said.
The Ouray County Plaindealer is published on Thursdays and delivered to racks late on Wednesdays. Subscribers receive the paper in the mail.
The rack price for the weekly newspaper is $1, so someone spent $12 opening racks and removing all the newspapers. They missed one newspaper rack at a coffee shop, so about 200 papers were stolen, said Wiggins, who added he was glad the racks themselves weren’t damaged.
The newspaper plans to have a story in next Thursday’s edition about the theft of the papers and possibly a column explaining why they took it so seriously and reprinted the paper, Wiggins said.
“It’s strange to be writing about ourselves,” said Wiggins, who has owned and published the paper for nearly five years with his wife, Erin McIntyre. “We work very hard to make sure we are not the story.”"
LDOHRA8ZU9_VUFTGKF966J53R1,Wind warnings as 99mph Storm Isha hits UK,Tom Ambrose,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/21/uk-warned-of-power-cuts-and-travel-disruption-as-storm-isha-hits,"Storm warnings have been issued across parts of Britain as Storm Isha takes hold, with potentially life-threatening gusts and travel disruption expected into Monday.
A “tornado watch” zone was in place for Northern Ireland, as well as parts of Scotland and northern England, but expired late on Sunday.
The Met Office issued two amber wind alerts and a red warning for parts of northern Scotland until the early hours of Monday, while rail, sea and air travellers faced disruption, with closures, cancellations and delays on a number of services.
In Belfast, a person was struck by falling debris after scaffolding became dislodged and was treated at the scene by emergency services.
The Met Office said 99mph wind gusts were recorded in Brizlee Wood, Northumberland, along with90mph winds in Capel Curig in north Wales late on Sunday.
It urged people to check the weather and advice from their local councils, as it warned of power cuts, flying debris, travel disruption and dangerous conditions near the coast, including high waves.
The Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna told the PA news agency earlier: “There is a potential that we could see the odd isolated tornado largely tied in with the squally cold front mainly in western parts of the UK on Sunday evening.
“They can cause some significant damage, but often on a very localised scale. They often don’t tend to last very long.”
The body that represents Britain’s energy networks warned of risks to homes and vital infrastructure. The Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “We’re expecting widespread gales to affect the UK. Amber warnings are in place for large parts of the country.
“There’s the potential for danger to life and damaging winds potentially leading to some power cuts in places. Some large waves around coastal regions could bring some debris on to roads and trees could come down.
“We have a wind warning in place across the whole of the UK. It’s pretty unusual for the whole of the country to be under a blanket wind warning.”
Agencies across Cumbria declared themselves on standby for a major incident, with Sellafield nuclear site closing as a precaution on Sunday.
The Met Office has said “everybody” will be affected by the storm. Two 12-hour amber wind warnings remain in place from 6pm on Sunday until Monday morning. One stretches across central, eastern and western England and all of Wales, missing only London and parts of the south-east. The other covers all of Scotland and northern England and Northern Ireland.
ScotRail ceased rail services early on Sunday and confirmed there would be no Monday morning rush-hour services. Network Rail said it had “taken the decision to close the network to all freight and passenger trains from 22.00 [on Sunday night] until Monday morning”.
East Midlands Railway said delays and alterations to its services were “likely”, while no LNER trains will run north of Newcastle until midday.
Air traffic control restrictions are in place, leading to some flight cancellations and midair diversions. A flight travelling from Sharm El Sheikh to Glasgow airport declared an emergency due to Storm Isha. A spokesperson for Glasgow Airport said the TUI flight was “diverted to Manchester due to current weather conditions”.
Nats, the UK’s national air traffic control services, told the PA news agency: “Due to adverse weather conditions across the UK, temporary air traffic restrictions are in place. Restrictions of this sort are only ever applied to maintain safety.

“Our teams are working closely with airports and airlines to minimise disruption. Passengers should check the status of their flight with their airline.”
British Airways said: “Like other airlines, we have had to make schedule adjustments due to the adverse weather conditions across the UK and Europe caused by Storm Isha. We’ve apologised to our customers for the disruption to their travel plans and our teams are working hard to get them on their way as quickly as possible.”
Heavy downpours battered some places, with 26 flood warnings in place in England and 27 in Scotland.
National Highways issued amber severe weather alerts in the north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east of England, as well as the east and west Midlands, from 6pm on Sunday until the early hours of Monday, and advised motorists to plan around disruption. There was a particularly high risk that taller vehicles and other vulnerable vehicles such as caravans and motorbikes could be blown over, it said.
The cold Arctic air that has given the UK sunny skies but freezing temperatures was subsiding, the Met Office said, and being replaced by an Atlantic influence that would bring a return to milder conditions, but also bring wet and windy weather across the UK.
The storm would move away on Monday morning, developing into very strong winds in the far south-east of England, and the risk of 70-80mph gusts in the early hours.
Petagna said: “Storm Isha will bring a disruptive spell of weather to the UK with strong winds across the whole country. Heavy rain will cause additional hazards, particularly in the west. A number of severe weather warnings for rain have also been issued. Keep up to date with the Met Office warnings and pay close attention to guidance from your local authority.”
A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents Britain’s energy network operators, urged people to check in with those who might need extra help, and to share information with friends and family.
The Met Office said the high winds would gradually ease through the day on Monday, while overnight into Tuesday would be calmer for most of the country, with lighter winds and fewer showers in the north.
But it warned that low pressure would bring further wet and windy weather from the west on Tuesday morning, which would spread eastwards across the UK.
Later in the week, conditions are expected to ease in the south, with temperatures expected to remain mild for the time of year. Any wet and windy weather is predicted to be confined largely to the north-west of the UK."
LPREP4M5R9_0ZWHYWIQTWQITP1,"Deaths unexplained, lives devastated: here’s another national tragedy hidden in plain sight",John Harris,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/mental-health-trust-deaths,"Just over a week ago, I got a message from a grassroots group in the east of England. “Can you investigate this?” it said. “We’re hitting similar brick walls to the Post Office campaign.”
There was a link to a local ITV report, broadcast two weeks before Christmas. When I watched it, I was dumbfounded, but also aware that it was about a set of very familiar British themes: threadbare public services, a managerial class that seems to constantly resist accountability, thousands of people whose lives have been ruined – and things that should have long since broken into the national conversation but have so far been largely ignored. In this case, what has happened has been doggedly and brilliantly covered in the Eastern Daily Press, and on local broadcast news – but its coverage in national outlets has tended to be muted and sporadic.
What I was sent by the Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk and Suffolk was about their calls for a criminal investigation into an apparent scandal that decisively surfaced over the summer, centred on the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS foundation trust (or NSFT), which sees to mental health provision across those two very large English counties. It is centred on the “unexpected” deaths of 8,440 people between April 2019 and October 2022, all of whom were either under the care of the trust, or had been up to six months before they died. The story of the failures that led to that statistic date back at least a decade; the campaign says it amounts to nothing less than “the largest deaths crisis in the history of the NHS”.
The figure of 8,440 was the key finding of a report by the accounting and consultancy firm Grant Thornton – commissioned by the trust, ironically enough, to respond to anxious claims by campaigners, disputed by the trust, that there had been 1,000 unexpected deaths over nine years. There are no consistent national statistics for such deaths, and no universal definition of “unexpected”: in Norfolk and Suffolk, a death will be recorded as such if the person concerned was not identified by NHS staff as critically or terminally ill; the term includes deaths from natural causes as well as suicide, homicide, abuse and neglect. The period in question includes the worst of the pandemic, although the trust’s own annual deaths figures did not reach a peak until 2022-23. But the numbers still seem jaw-dropping: they represent an average of about 45 deaths a week.
To put that in some kind of perspective, earlier reports about the trust’s deaths record had raised the alarm about a similar number of people dying every month. And the Grant Thornton report included another key revelation: the fact that the trust’s record-keeping was so chaotic that in about three-quarters of cases, it did not know the specifics of how or why the people concerned had died. After its publication, moreover, there were more revelations about the trust, and its culture and practices. A report on Newsnight said that Grant Thornton’s text had been edited “to remove criticism” of the trust’s leadership, which an official response put down to “fact-checking”. A few months later, the BBC revealed that the NSFT had recently spent £850,000 on help from a PR firm.
The trust is on to its ninth chief executive in 10 years, and has been put in special measures four times; the run of policy decisions that sit behind this story date back to a “radical redesign” in 2013 that led to cuts in staff and bed numbers, and huge controversy. But clearly, what needs to be in the foreground of this story are the people who have died, and the loved ones they left behind. Many of them were the apparent casualties of sudden gaps and delays in care – and early discharges – that often happened amid fragmented systems in which one “team” did not seem to know what other parts of the system were doing.
Last Tuesday, for example, I spoke to a bereaved father whose son had been under the care of the trust – or what passed for it – and whose death was one of those highlighted in the report, but has yet to reach an inquest. In his teens, he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. At 18, he had been transferred from the part of the trust that deals with children and young people to adult services – and for a year and a half, he was never under the consistent care of a psychiatrist.
In the midst of repeated suicide attempts, his family asked for a formal review of his treatment at least six times, but their requests were “constantly denied”. Eventually, his GP issued him with a prescription for medication used to treat cluster headaches. “No one in the mental health team picked up that he’d been given [this] prescription,” his father told me. “If it had been picked up, it would have gone straight back to the GP: ‘That’s inappropriate. You can’t do that.’” Amazingly, an identical prescription was issued only a matter of weeks later. His son overdosed on the tablets he was given, and died.
I then spoke to Sheila Preston, an unbelievably resilient campaigner who spent nine years on the trust’s board of governors, and is about to return to that role. She lost her son Leo to a heroin overdose in November 2016: his death, she says, is part of a story of failure that long predates the outrage over the recent report. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia 18 years before, and got used to regular visits from a mental health nurse, which suddenly stopped: two months later, when he was living in a rented flat his mother says had been “cuckooed” by people involved in the local drug trade, he was dead. NSFT insists that at his inquest, the coroner “made no criticism of the trust”, but his mother has a very different view. “I’m angry,” she told me. “I can never get over my anger.”
I got the same sense of unbearable fury from Nick Fulcher, whose mother-in-law, Peggy Copeman, died in December 2019: another death that took its place among the 8,440. She had a past diagnosis of schizophrenia; because of a shortage of hospital places, when her mental health seemed to suddenly worsen, the trust decided – despite the fact that she was 81, and clearly frail – to move her from a care home in Norfolk to a privately run hospital nearly 300 miles away in Somerset. Fulcher’s wife, he said, was told Peggy would be leaving at 10.30am, and set off with the intention of saying goodbye and checking everything was in order – but when she arrived at the care home, the private “ambulance” booked for her mother had already left.
Peggy had not been physically examined before the six-and-half-hour drive (the trust says such checks were “refused”), a failing that was repeated three days later, when she was suddenly ordered to be moved back to Norfolk. She had a fatal heart attack, and died on a lay-by on the M11. Her family was notified of her death four hours after it happened; her inquest subsequently concluded that she hadn’t received “prompt medical attention”, and the transport firm concerned was barred from working in the NHS. The trust insists it is “deeply sorry for the distress caused to Peggy’s family” and says it has made “several improvements” since her death. “She wasn’t fit to come back,” Fulcher told me. “She was treated absolutely disgustingly.”
Whatever the official pledges of improvement, one of the people who insists that the trust’s deepest failings are ongoing is Natalie McLellan, who lost her daughter, Rebecca, last November. Rebecca was a trainee paramedic based in Ipswich, who her mother says lived for her job. She had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and the trust had assigned her a “care coordinator”. But he eventually went on leave – and for three weeks in the summer of 2023, Rebecca was left without care or help, despite a long history of depressive episodes and her experiences of serious suicidal urges.
Natalie read me Rebecca’s own account of what had happened: she repeatedly phoned the trust and was assured someone would contact her, but the calls never came. When she turned up in person at her local clinic, she was turned away, and told that if she did not leave, the police would be called. These experiences, Natalie said, came to define her daughter’s understanding that if she went into any kind of crisis, it would be met with neglect and indifference. In mid-November last year, staff at the trust said her only option was to switch her medication to lithium, a drug her mother says she was “terrified” of. Three days later, she took her own life.
The trust now talks about “fast-paced and widespread change”. It says that although “increasing demand and gaps in the NHS workforce are continuing to impact waiting times for services across the country”, it has “processes in place” for covering staff absences, and that “we continuously take steps to reduce unexpected deaths”. It says it has taken “improvement actions” on its record-keeping, and has “more to do, especially with regards to processing and reporting mortality data”. But these are the kind of stories that people in Norfolk and Suffolk characterise as the constituent parts of a vast institutional tragedy. They have a handful of central demands: investigation by the police, a public inquiry, and the breakup and refounding of a trust that they think is broken beyond repair.
After I had spoken to people who had been bereaved, one campaigner told me the trust’s habitual response to bad news was to “deny, deflect, distract and delay”. But they also had another fear, rooted in the fact that the reporting of “unexpected” deaths across the NHS is so patchy. Most of us know how bad the national crisis in mental health provision is, and that the need for care is constantly on the increase. But what gaps does that leave, and who falls into them?
“We think the numbers of deaths in Norfolk and Suffolk are relatively high,” this campaigner told me. There was then an uneasy pause. “But because the national system is so chaotic and inconsistent, nobody can tell.” I instantly knew what they meant: that there could be many more of these catastrophes – hiding, as British scandals often do, in plain sight.

M47AYOIC5S_82ZP4WXDNR1BYZM,"‘Absolutely amazing’: 1,800-year-old shattered Roman arm guard is reconstructed from 100 pieces",Dalya Alberge,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/21/absolutely-amazing-1800-year-old-shattered-roman-arm-guard-is-reconstructed-from-100-pieces,"A spectacular brass guard that would have protected the sword arm of a high-ranking Roman soldier some 1,800 years ago has been reconstructed from more than 100 fragments found at Trimontium, the Roman fort complex in Scotland.
The extraordinary jigsaw puzzle has been pieced together by National Museums Scotland (NMS) in Edinburgh, and the arm-guard will now be lent to the British Museum’s forthcoming exhibition on life in the Roman army.
Made in the second century – with brass strips overlapping like an armadillo’s scales – it is one of only three known from the whole Roman Empire, and the most intact.
While most arm-guards were made of iron, which was more functional, brass would have looked golden on the wearer’s arm, marking out a soldier’s rank on the battlefield.
Dr Fraser Hunter, the NMS’s principal curator of prehistory and Roman archaeology, told the Observer: “It’s absolutely amazing. You get the sense of the protection this person had – and also the prestige. It would have gleamed gold and would have looked absolutely spectacular when he was wearing it.”
It was discovered in 1906 by James Curle, a lawyer and antiquary, at the site of the Trimontium fort in Newstead, near Melrose in the Scottish Borders. He thought it was a guard for the chest and shoulders, but he could not find any parallels. It was identified as an arm-guard in the 1990s but only now has it been put back together.
Hunter said that, as they began to work on some of the fragments, he realised that they had “the complete thing”: “The British Museum exhibition has really been the prompt to give us the time and the resources to bring all the bits together.”
This is most likely a critical piece of a legionary’s kit, he believes: “We know that there [were] legionaries in the garrison at the time. Because of the glamour of it – and brass was an expensive metal then – it’s probably a high-ranking centurion.”
He added that the scaled design would have deflected any blow, while underneath padding took most of the power: “Your right arm was completely protected.”
He added that, in about AD180, the Romans faced upheavals and unrest in Scotland: “There’s a literary reference to barbarians cutting down a general and his troops.”
While all the fragments have been in NMS’s collection for more than a century, one part had been on display for 25 years and another section was on loan to the Trimontium Museum. Fragments from it had lain in storage.
Bethan Bryan, the NMS’s artefact conservator, said that the jigsaw puzzle had been “an extreme challenge and a labour of love”.

It took about three weeks to complete and sometimes seemed impossible because some of the fragments are tiny. “Staring at the same things for three weeks takes a toll on your eyes and your brain,” said Bryan. Yet every last piece found its place.
The metal is in a good state of preservation, but patterns in the corrosion offer clues to where the leather and the padding were attached. Fragments of the original leather still survive.
The arm-guard appears to have been left behind when the Romans abandoned Trimontium . Before that, some 2,000 people would have lived there and in the settlement around it.
The arm-guard had been kept in the headquarters of the site’s latest fort. Hunter explained: “It’s where the commanding officer would brief his own officers. But it’s also, it seems, where repairs were being done – a workshop for military equipment. When the building was abandoned, any equipment that was deemed surplus to requirements, they just dumped.”"
MF91SUBLW0_SSG5F1D48OY1410,"Cellist at Prince Harry’s wedding says Proms should drop Rule, Britannia!",Charlie Moloney,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/21/sheku-kanneh-mason-cellist-proms-should-drop-rule-britannia,"A British cellist who played at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has said Rule, Britannia! “makes people feel uncomfortable” and should not be sung at the Last Night of the Proms.
Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who became the first black person to win the BBC Young Musician award in 2016, performed as a soloist at the final concert of the annual two-month orchestral event last year – but said he did not stay to hear Rule, Britannia! being sung at the end of the night.
The patriotic song ignited controversy in 2020 when the Sunday Times reported that the BBC was discussing ditching Rule, Britannia! at that year’s Proms.
While many embraced the opportunity to discuss alternatives with more universal appeal, traditionalists expressed dismay at what was perceived to be an attack on British culture.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Kanneh-Mason said he did not think the song should be included in Last Night of the Proms, and that “so much wonderful music” could replace it.
“I think maybe some people don’t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel, even if it makes [the people singing it] feel good,” he said. “I think that’s somehow a big misunderstanding about it.”
Kanneh-Mason suggested the song could be replaced with British folk music: “There is so much wonderful British music. The wealth of folk music from this country is astonishing.
“There is so much that is worth celebrating and having as part of a big celebration at the end of a wonderful music festival.”
Responding to Kanneh-Mason’s comments, a BBC spokesperson said: “The Proms are built on longstanding traditions that were established by co-founder Sir Henry Wood, and which are loved by people around the world.
“One of these traditions is the last night festivities. Other traditions include promoting new music, accessibility and opening up the world of classical music to as many people as possible.”
Kanneh-Mason, who was born and raised in Nottingham, appeared alongside his siblings on the ITV variety show Britain’s Got Talent in 2015.
His album Inspiration, which was reported in February 2018 to have been “the biggest-selling British debut of the year to date”, reached No 1 on the UK classical albums chart."
N074SOZRGP_T4YOQ51H668V103,Can the super-rich tell us how to save the planet? Gen Z certainly think so,Martha Gill,_,20240114,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/can-the-super-rich-tell-us-how-to-save-the-planet-gen-z-certainly-thinks-so,"There’s just something about corporate chieftains meeting at a ski resort to save the world that seems to get people’s backs up.
It could be the jargon – among the buzzwords at last year’s Davos conference was “mattering”, which I’m afraid is a noun. Or it could be the confident attitude of some of the delegates. “It’s pretty extraordinary that we, a select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives, are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet … it’s so, almost extraterrestrial, to think about,” the former US secretary of state John Kerry told the conference last year.
In any case, critics often struggle to buy the idea that climate change can be best solved by the owners of private jets, poverty by the beneficiaries of corporate tax loopholes, and gender equality by a gathering still dominated by men. In fact, the World Economic Forum – among its mission statements is “improving the state of the world” – has long been a byword for hypocrisy and empty virtue signalling: a place where the rich can flatter themselves they are making a difference. “I have a feeling,” the American author Anand Giridharadas has written, “that girls in Africa are tired of being empowered by men in Davos”.
This consensus – at least among progressive types – has been comfortably established, so it’s unsettling to feel it may be shifting. This year Davos found some unlikely champions. A YouGov and Salesforce survey revealed generation Z to be in favour of the conference. About 60% of those polled were “hopeful” about its ability to make the world a better place, when it comes to issues such as climate change.
What has made young people suddenly develop faith in posturing business leaders? Or is it that they’ll now take hope where they can get it? I wonder if this hint that opinion may be changing is tracking another shift. Until about a decade ago it was taken for granted that Davos’s values – globalism, progressivism, decarbonisation – were shared by much of the western world. But they are going out of fashion. To the generation that came of age in the era of populist nationalism, a burgeoning anti-green agenda and with Trump as US president, the Davos agenda, even when mouthed by an out-of-touch elite, may strike some as oddly refreshing.
After all, the forums in which these sorts of ideas are welcome are shrinking. Certainly, the scepticism about Davos on the right has spread. Last week the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, launched a blistering attack on the progressive assumptions that underlie the conference, with a speech that condemned social justice “and parasites who live off the state”. “International organisations”, he said, had been infected with “collectivism”, “radical feminism” and a “cruel … environmental agenda”. Rishi Sunak, at present trying to style himself as a nationalist, shunned the event, as did business figures on the right such as Elon Musk, who preferred to mock it from the sidelines.
There are of course better ways to improve the state of the world than a cosmocrat corporate event. But gen Z may be on to something – perhaps after all you can defend Davos from a progressive standpoint. Leftwing objections to Davos and its pretensions to solve world poverty and climate destruction are made not on the basis of the values themselves but on the idea that they are pursued ineffectively, and by the wrong sort of people. Really, progressives have two complaints: that the conference is useless, and that it is hypocritical. Let’s take these in turn.
First, it’s not true that Davos does no good at all – particularly when it comes, for example, to high-stakes diplomacy. It was at Davos that representatives of East and West Germany met to discuss reunification, and where Nelson Mandela and the then South African president, FW de Klerk, made their first joint appearance together on the international stage – an arguably important step towards ending apartheid. It was at Davos that Bill and Melinda Gates pledged $100m to tackle Aids, where Nicolas Negroponte launched his “one laptop per child campaign”, and from Davos that the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization was launched, an enterprise that has helped vaccinate 760 million children. It’s not enough, but there is pressure to do better, and often from inside the conference itself.
More could be done, of course. But the real criticism of Davos – what seems most to stick in the throat of critics – is the hypocrisy of the thing: that globetrotting millionaires have the audacity, despite various corporate sins, to want to dabble in high-profile philanthropy and woke ideas. This comes from the same quarters, I think, as critics of “woke capitalism”. How dare these people, whom we hold to be bad, try to associate themselves with views we hold to be good? They must be forced to preach what they practice, the better to make a contrast with our own righteousness.
This seems to me an unhelpful sort of moral purism. If Davos were shut down tomorrow, would its various “thought leaders” go home and pour their energies into private good works – paying more taxes, swearing off private jets, donating to charity? I doubt it. It is irritating to watch someone virtue signal, but the upside is that this can occasionally result in virtuous acts. The social pressure created by Davos, annoying as it is, can be a force for good.
There’s an argument against this, which is that by mouthing pieties at Davos, amoral capitalists can cover their arses. On the contrary, I think it lays them open to attack. Hypocrites, with their anxious need to please the crowd, are far easier to skewer than balls-out defenders of the status quo. Davos is the best platform from which to make a speech calling out billionaires for tax avoidance – the historian Rutger Bregman went viral for doing so in 2019. Oxfam’s report on economic inequality is released to coincide with Davos – and that context helps it dominate headlines. And this year, more than 250 millionaires and billionaires sent an open letter to political leaders at Davos, asking them to please tax them more. Social pressure from peers is a powerful force. Sometimes it can be a force for good.

The final report from the Australian review is not yet published, but the interim report stressed the importance of lifelong learning, calling for the university system “to be better at providing a more flexible and adaptive approach to learning”. Any review of British universities needs to address the particular crisis in adult education and lifelong learning.
Reviewing Britain’s growth crisis in 2022, the Economist pointed out that in Britain “adult education has gone to seed”. Recent reviews of UK higher education have called for funding to be made available for lifelong learning. Instead, the lifelong learning entitlement is based on loans and debt.
Lifelong learning is vital for the economy, and also for society – there will be no levelling up or building back better without it. Adult education also contributes to personal wellbeing. And to tackle the great challenges we face, such as the climate crisis, requires an engaged debate and an ability to bring about change across communities, workplaces and societies.
All this requires a government strategy for lifelong learning. A review of higher education could be the launchpad.Prof Jonathan MichieChair, Universities Association for Lifelong Learning

NM9A8C55GW_JF96VWFRG8VTFR0,"‘David Bromley runs this town’: are there hidden depths to the popular, divisive Australian artist?",Walter Marsh,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/david-bromley-artist-australia-documentary-light-after-dark-docplay,"“Bromleys are only good for holiday houses and children’s bedrooms,” Yuge Bromley tells the camera eight minutes into a new documentary about her husband, the artist David Bromley. She’s quoting a critic, of course – before scoffing that these are “two of my favourite places – the funnest places in the world!”
It’s one of a string of common criticisms of Bromley’s work that open a new documentary, Bromley: Light After Dark. They range from backhanded compliments (“Peter Pan of the art world”) and faint praise (“likable”) to withering dismissal (“purely decorative” and “mass-produced”). As opening sequences go, it’s quite a choice, and an acknowledgment that the Sheffield-born, Adelaide-raised and Victoria-based painter, sculptor and entrepreneur is as divisive as he is popular.
If you don’t think you’ve seen a Bromley: yes, you absolutely have. His work often riffs on a handful of motifs – innocent young children, topless women, butterflies, lighthouses, and occasionally some skulls – rendered in a colourful style that’s nostalgic, kitsch and shabby chic. Since his rise in the 1990s, Bromley’s mainstream ubiquity – from murals to mugs to the walls of Australia’s negative gearing class – has made him low-hanging fruit for art critics and TikTokers (“I swear David Bromley runs this town,” says one creator quoted in the film).
But his popularity persists and it’s hard not to trace the public appetite for crowd-pleasing, if occasionally empty, nostalgia and spectacle picked up by younger artists including Rone to Bromley’s influence.
The film-maker Sean McDonald spent more than five years following Bromley and his family, and the result goes some way to unpacking his art’s appeal, while also trying to make sense of the man who makes – or at least signs – the paintings.

McDonald warmly documents the tension between formula and chaos that seems to define life and work at the family’s rural base in Daylesford, Victoria. Interviews with David, Yuge, a range of critics and celebrities including David Wenham, Julia Stone and Chris Cheney, play over B-Roll of anonymous studio assistants painting away at recognisable Bromleys, as their sun-bleached leader shuffles through, preparing canvases by puncturing spray cans, distressing paintings with a steamroller, and laughing and swearing with glee.
On the oft-repeated charge of “soulless” mass-production, the film tries a few angles. At times, he is defended as part of an unabashedly commercial pop art lineage from Andy Warhol to Ken Done. At others, he’s praised as a freewheeling maverick who would make his art even if no one was buying it.
Shots of Yuge sifting through transparent sheets featuring page after page of David’s most recognisable designs shed more light on the art-by-overhead-projector process. Bromley himself admits to embracing the commercial pressures that shape his output: “Some days I do go in and paint kids over the fence, and I paint the nudes and stuff. I mean, doing my greatest hits.”
But as the film progresses, it evolves into a more nuanced portrait of mental health and art – and one that largely resists falling into familiar “troubled artist” tropes. As McDonald peers back into David’s early years, his preoccupation with Enid Blyton-esque youths peering over fences or having Boy’s Own adventures makes a little more sense when he explains the “schizophrenic happenings” that arrived around the time his voice broke. Later the premature death of his beloved older brother adds further poignancy to his endless exploration of an imagined youth.
We learn how art provided a pragmatic way to manage the anxieties that led to two suicide attempts a decade apart. Buoyed by praise of his early paintings, he latched on to the form, and while his restless, almost compulsive creation made him a rising star in the art world, it soon led him to abandon it.

Here Bromley’s enormous output is reframed as both a survival strategy and an almost democratising rebuke of his earlier brush with commercial art establishments, who sought to limit his output to control supply and demand.
Between the famous fans, the brood of paint-speckled kids and the mini-empire of galleries, shops and studios, a lesser documentary might suggest the life we’re seeing is Bromley’s happily ever after. But life doesn’t work that way. As David and Yuge take on the massive task of turning the old Castlemaine prison into a museum – a stressor if ever there was one – we are privy to moments of tension and frustration. For Bromley, “the puzzle in my head” is something that has to be pieced together one day at a time.
“Forty-six days of doing the juggle and still some days I get the knockout punch,” he tells the camera after a rough day.
But unlike his younger self, daunted by the seemingly endless expanse of life and pain that lay ahead, this older David understands better that nothing is for ever.
Bromley: Light After Dark isn’t going to change anyone’s minds about Bromley’s art. But at the very least it might inspire some interesting conversations next time you visit a rich friend’s beach house.

O47V351BKG_R8A2QDNA738QI7W,Three things with Yasmine Ghoniem: ‘It’s very important to have a good pair of tweezers’,Katie Cunningham,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/22/three-things-with-yasmine-ghoniem-its-very-important-to-have-a-good-pair-of-tweezers,"Yasmine Ghoniem has just stepped into her debut television role as co-host of ABC’s Grand Designs Transformations. Alongside Anthony Burke, the series sends her around the country to meet Australia’s boldest and most inspired home renovators.
It may be Ghoniem’s first gig on the small screen but it’s the latest in a career as one of Australia’s most awarded interior designers. The Sydneysider credits her love of design to her upbringing. Raised between Kuwait, Dubai and Saudi Arabia, surrounded by “very non-eventful desertscapes”, her bedroom became her world – and she grew obsessed with how the objects in her space would make her feel.
Today Ghoniem still believes in the power of belongings. Her most prized possession is a collection of records handed down by her parents. Here she tells us why she would make a mad dash for that vinyl stash in a fire and shares the stories behind other important items.
My parents’ record collection. They had great taste in music – that’s actually how they fell in love. My mum is Australian and my dad is Egyptian but they met when they were living in Libya. They were neighbours, Dad asked Mum to come over for a video night and that was that. But music was a big part of them connecting.
They’ve got Pink Floyd, Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Hot Chocolate – a wide selection of music from the 1960s to 80s – about 1,000 records all up, in mint condition. They labelled each record with their name, so there’s beautiful little handwriting at the tops. And they still have the stickers from where they bought the record and how much it cost.
The records were originally in our family home. Then, when all the kids left, my parents downsized, and they went into storage. My dad now lives in Cairo and he was super upset that nobody else in the family wanted the record collection, so he spent a lot of money to ship them to me in Sydney.
A pair of tweezers I bought in Vietnam when I was 27. Being Arabic, I have lots of hair, so it’s very important to have a really good pair of tweezers! They’ve never lost their sharpness.
If it was anything else, I would have lost them by now. But because I love them so much, they live in a special drawer in the bathroom. If they’re ever not there, I freak out.
I studied at the Savannah College of Art Design in Georgia, in the US, where I spent four years creating a massive portfolio. It was a big black folder with hundreds of pieces of art that I’d created.
I left the States relatively quickly and left the portfolio behind with my ex-partner in Portland in 2008. It’s since disappeared. I’m so sad to have lost these works because that’s how I fell in love with what I now do – design – and maybe would have explained some of the threads that I continue to find in my work. Now I’ll never have that beginning point to know where it all came from."

Putin also thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for his invitation to visit as he met North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui who visited Russia last week, KCNA said citing a foreign ministry official.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy fears that if Donald Trump returns to the White House next year he could make unilateral concessions to Russia that override Ukraine’s interests and branded the former US president’s claims he could stop the war in 24 hours as “very dangerous”.
Zelenskiy has also spoken of putting together “new bilateral agreements” that will “reanimate” the system of international law. He added that new military packages will be delivered “in the coming weeks and months”.
Slovak prime minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that Ukraine was under the absolute control of the United States. The populist politician, who is against military aid to the war-torn country and opposes sanctions against Russia, also reiterated his opposition to Ukraine’s bid to join Nato. “Ukraine is not an independent and sovereign country,” Fico told public broadcaster RTVS. “Ukraine is under the total influence and control of the United States.” Slovakia is a member of both Nato and the European Union. Despite Fico’s criticism, it was only Hungary that vetoed the €50bn of aid that other EU members had voted to give Kyiv last December.
The UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported that Ukraine maintains a presence on the left bank of the Dnipro River and has continued to repel Russian attacks despite “logistical concerns”.
Russian lawmakers have prepared a bill allowing for the confiscation of money and property from people who spread “deliberately false information” about the country’s armed forces, a senior member of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin said on Saturday, Reuters has reported.
Russia has lost 375,270 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces claimed on Saturday. The number, which has not been independently verified, includes 750 casualties over the past day.
Russian troops have reinstalled mines along the perimeter of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which it occupies in the occupied Zaporizhzhia oblast, the International Atomic Energy Agency has said.
The wife of a Russian soldier delivered an emotional appeal for his return from Ukraine on Saturday at the election headquarters of Putin – it was a defiant gesture by Maria Andreyeva in a country where open criticism of the war is banned.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has referenced a quote from Winston Churchill in an interview with Le Figaro. Discussing the war in Ukraine, he said: “Give us the tools and we will finish the job.”
Romanian protesters have ended their blockade at the Porubne-Siret crossing along the Romanian-Ukrainian border the Kyiv Independent reported, citing the border guard service. Romanian farmers and truck drivers had been protesting against high business costs.
Russian forces launched seven Shahed-136/131 attack drones against Ukraine, four of which were shot down by Ukraine’s air defences, according to an update from the general staff.
Russia has accused Ukraine of being behind a drone strike that sparked a huge inferno at an oil depot in western Russia on Friday, the latest in a series of escalating cross-border attacks. Russian officials and news reports said four oil reservoirs with a total capacity of 6,000 cubic metres (1.6m gallons) were set on fire at the oil refinery after the drone reached Klintsy, a city of 70,000 people located about 60km (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border."
O930COW52P_B1V17A8S9C6O52Z,Dew point and sticky sweat: why humidity is so uncomfortable,Rafqa Touma,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/21/dew-point-and-sticky-sweat-why-humidity-is-so-uncomfortable,"Sydney has been sweating through oppressive mugginess for days after hitting Singapore-high levels of humidity earlier this month.
Feeling hot and feeling humid are different beasts. The latter, defined by sticky sweat and shortness of breath, is unbearable. But why?
Here is everything you need to know.
Very simply, humidity is water that has evaporated into the air.
How humid it is can be observed by what is known as the “dew point” temperature – that is the temperature that is cold enough to make water condense, according to Prof Steven Sherwood from the University of NSW Climate Change Research Centre.
The more moisture in the atmosphere – or the more humid it is – the higher that dew point will be.
Alongside the dew point, relative humidity tells you how close the air is to saturation – that is, when the air holds as much water vapour as it can for a given temperature.
Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air – so the relative humidity falls if the temperature rises but the amount of moisture in the air stays the same. The Bureau of Meteorology says that “because of its direct relationship to fluctuating temperature”, relative humidity “doesn’t provide suitable guidance on how much moisture there is at a specific location”.
Keeping that in mind, relative humidity has been falling in Australia because the land is warming faster than the ocean, Sherwood says.
But that doesn’t mean we are seeing less vapour in the air. In fact, we are seeing more. Sea surface temperatures in the Coral and Tasman seas are up to 3C above average and winds over warming ocean waters bring higher humidity to our shores.
So even though relative humidity is reducing, there is still more moisture and we feel like it is more humid.

All this can be confusing, but the bureau’s “feels like” – or “apparent” temperature can help – which takes into account wind and humidity and is listed in the “observations” section for the relevant location in Australia.
It’s for this reason that “meteorologists prefer to use dew point when analysing atmospheric moisture and inferring what the conditions may feel like”, according to BoM. This is represented by the “feels like” temperature.
Humidity makes it harder for you to stay cool.
Humans lose heat through heat transfer pathways that are driven by temperature differences between the skin and the surrounding environment, according to Prof Ollie Jay, the director of the University of Sydney Heat and Health Research Incubator.
When it gets warm, those temperature differences become small – and the only other way we can lose heat is through producing sweat.
But it isn’t sweat that cools us down, it is when sweat evaporates. Humidity in the air determines the driving force for that evaporation, Jay says.

“If you have high humidity, you have to lose all this heat by evaporation of sweat, but not enough sweat can evaporate from the skin’s surface.”
Your skin’s temperature will increase as a result – and that is what we perceive as being hot.
“If you can’t evaporate that sweat to keep cool, then it induces discomfort,” Jay says.
When it is humid, any activity can stimulate the feeling of being hot. “You will suddenly start sweating a lot and feeling very hot because high humidity is preventing your body’s air conditioning system from working,” Sherwood explains.
“The hotter it gets and the harder you are working, the more important humidity becomes to how you feel, compared to temperature.”
Rising humidity is a threat from climate change that “hasn’t been appreciated by the public”, Sherwood says.
“There’s no question that ocean temperatures are breaking records all over the world and they have been pretty steadily for decades … This is probably the clearest sign of climate change,” he says.
As a result, the chances of getting really muggy weather in Australia have increased substantially, compared with what the chances would have been before, Sherwood says.
How this will affect our health is “the thing we should be most worried about”, according to Jay.
“The climate is warming, is going to have more absolute humidity, more water vapour and [it will be] increasingly more difficult to keep cool physiologically,” he says.
“That induces a strain on your body. How much work your heart has to do, how dehydrated you become, how hot your core temperature gets – all of these different things that are a result of this stress increase our risk of a negative health event.”"
OBOTJ8H0VF_Z785YBDCQVYIOQB,Exiled Rwandan who survived murder attempt condemns UK deportation plan,Conrad Landin,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/21/exiled-rwandan-survived-condemns-uk-deportation-plan-frank-ntwali,"A Rwandan opposition politician who narrowly survived an assassination attempt has condemned the UK’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Kigali.
Frank Ntwali, chair of the exiled Rwanda National Congress (RNC) movement, said the country was unsafe and that Rishi Sunak’s persistence with the policy was “quite bizarre”.
His criticisms come after the prime minister urged the House of Lords to pass the Rwanda deportation bill so that flights can take off for the central African state. The policy is seen as crucial to a Conservative fightback as the party trails in the polls to Labour.
In 2012 Ntwali was stabbed a number of times near Johannesburg’s OR Tambo international airport. He was flagged down by men driving what appeared to be a police car. After the attack, they left without taking his wallet.
At the time, Ntwali was due to testify at a South African court in the trial of several men accused of trying to murder his brother-in-law Kayumba Nyamwasa, a rival of Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame. Four men were later convicted over the attempt on Nyamwasa’s life.
Ntwali and Nyamwasa are two of several Rwandan dissidents who human rights activists say have been attacked in South Africa. The RNC South Africa coordinator, Seif Bamporiki, was shot dead in Cape Town in 2021 and the former Rwandan intelligence chief Patrick Karegeya was found dead in a Johannesburg hotel room on New Year’s Day in 2014.
“To see the government of the UK trying to go against its own institutions and send people who seek protection to a country that is unsafe – it really troubles my mind,” Ntwali said. “It should be stopped.”
Now a practising advocate in South Africa, Ntwali left his home country as a government-sponsored law student more than two decades ago. But when the country was developing its post-civil war constitution in the early 2000s, he publicly criticised the power of the partly appointed upper house over the elected chamber of deputies.
He was labelled an “enemy of the state” by Kagame’s government, he said, and forced to leave the country.
Ntwali said that if the deportation plan goes ahead, the UK should be held responsible for the fates of any asylum seekers who are deported to Rwanda, and would “absolutely” have blood on its hands in the event of any deaths.
“The British government knows what Rwanda is, but it goes ahead to surrender these people to go to a country that is going to allow rendition,” he said. “[If there are] any consequences, the British government [will have] played a direct role in the death, or incarceration, or disappearance of all these people.”
The RNC was founded by former members of Kagame’s Rwandan Patriotic Front, which took power in 1994 after Rwanda was racked by genocide and civil war. It has been described as a terrorist group by Kagame.
Ntwali’s stabbing in 2012 was included in a Human Rights Watch report on Rwandan political dissidents who have faced attacks abroad. The campaigning organisation said of the cases it listed: “Human Rights Watch has documented these cases or received reliable information indicating that the victims are likely to have been targeted because of their criticisms of the Rwandan government, the RPF or President Paul Kagame.”
Rwandan dissidents living in the UK have received police warnings about assassination attempts by the African country’s agents, the Guardian has previously disclosed.
Jonathan Musonera, another political opponent of Kagame, lives in Greater London with his family under close protection after receiving a Metropolitan police warning of an assassination attempt. He said Sunak’s claim that Rwanda was safe was “unbelievable”.
Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, an opposition politician who spent eight years in a Rwandan jail after what human rights groups called a flawed trial, wrote this week that those who express opinions contrary to the Rwandan government suffer reprisals.
“This was the case for 12 Congolese refugees who were shot by Rwandan police in 2018 as they demonstrated against a cut in food rations. Sixty-five of the demonstrators were arrested and charged with spreading false information or harmful propaganda with the intent of creating a hostile international opinion of the Rwandan government.
“Dissenting voices, activists, independent journalists and YouTubers who do not toe the government line have also been mysteriously killed, disappeared or arrested. I know this because I experienced it first hand,” she wrote on the website Progressive Britain.
The Rwandan government has been approached for comment."
OEVKFDOL1M_LHPAUKQPTKB72SZ,The Guardian view on medicine shortages: a global issue for which Britain needs a plan,Editorial,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-medicine-shortages-a-global-issue-for-which-britain-needs-a-plan,"For anyone who relies on medication to treat a health condition, a shortage will be unwelcome. In some cases, for example cough and cold remedies, this will be a worrying inconvenience. But in others, such as HRT, diabetes drugs, antibiotics and antipsychotics, there are serious implications for health and wellbeing. In extreme circumstances the lack of a drug could pose a threat to life. Most recently the alarm has been raised in relation to riluzole, a medicine used by sufferers from motor neurone disease to delay ventilator dependence and prolong life.
Worryingly, the Motor Neurone Disease Association claims that concerns raised with the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, and her department, have not been properly dealt with. Riluzole’s manufacturer, Glenmark, has pointed to competing demands for limited stock of its active ingredient. That sufferers of such serious illnesses are facing these problems is obviously concerning. With around 100 medicines on a shortages list, the government appears under‑prepared and slow to act.
The UK is not alone in facing drug supply-chain challenges. This is a global issue, which has been rising up the agenda of EU states and the US as well. Rich western countries, along with much of the rest of the world, are heavily reliant on the pharmaceuticals manufacturing capacity of India and China for sufficient quantities of generic, off-patent drugs. During the pandemic the risks of this model became obvious when countries were forced to compete for vaccines, and India placed export restrictions on many items, including paracetamol.
Both the EU and US have responded with significant moves towards reshoring. France is building a paracetamol factory large enough to meet half of all European demand. Belgium has made the issue a theme of its EU presidency. Rules about state aid look set to be altered, and pharmaceuticals recategorised as a strategic industry like semiconductors. While European manufacturing will make supplies more secure, it is also expected to make drugs more expensive and reduce carbon emissions and other environmental damage associated with them.
Teams in the Department of Health and NHS England, and equivalent bodies in the devolved administrations, play a crucial role in overseeing the UK’s medicine supply. Thanks to stockpiling and other measures, departure from the single market did not lead to chaos. But Brexit has increased pressures. The fall in the value of the pound has made the UK a less attractive market. There is a balance to be struck between putting downward pressure on prices – which the NHS has historically been good at as a big purchaser – and incentivising suppliers. Current shortages suggest that the current system isn’t working well.
As well as day-to-day management, the UK needs a strategy. This should involve working with, rather than against, the EU on reshoring production in Europe. It should include plans for spikes in demand such as that seen for HRT, following a campaign around menopause symptoms and a shift in prescribing patterns. Shortages such as that affecting the type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic after it began to be prescribed for weight loss, should be anticipated even if they cannot be avoided. Poll after poll shows how much the public cares about healthcare. Workforce shortages and lack of investment are the biggest issues, but access to medicines is vital, too."
OH6EHR522R_IS8HR6Y3LDQGZ94,"After the voice defeat, we can never again allow politics to suspend the cause of Indigenous justice",_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/after-the-voice-defeat-we-can-never-again-allow-politics-to-suspend-the-cause-of-indigenous-justice,"In the lead-up to the voice referendum there was widespread consensus that Australia needed to do more to improve the lives of First Nations peoples but there was significant disagreement about how to go about this.
Australians rejected the proposal for a voice to parliament embedded in the constitution. Monday marks 100 days since that unsuccessful referendum. By now we expected those who campaigned against the constitutional reform would have stepped up with their proposals about how to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. Alas, there has been only a deafening silence.
The new year is a time to reignite conversations about what reconciliation with Indigenous Australians is going to look like in the short and long term. There is understandable concern that we are going backwards, with Noel Person commenting that we are now in a worse state than before the 14 October referendum. It is time for allies – the 40% of Australians who voted yes – to rebuild momentum and respect for the rights of First Nations peoples.
Constitutional reform through the voice proposal was never the only initiative being pursued to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians, although in 2023 it was certainly the most high-profile. There are other options. The four that appear to have the most support are: 1. negotiating treaties, 2. pursuing truth-telling, 3. legislating for Indigenous voices to parliament and 4. developing a national action plan to realise the rights set out in the UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples.
Before the referendum, progress towards treaties with First Nations peoples was being made in several states and territories. Victoria is the most advanced, with the well-developed work of the First Nations Assembly, the Yoorrook Justice Commission and the treaty advancement process, which includes legislative structures for the treaty authority, a self-determination fund, a treaty negotiation framework and a dispute resolution process.
Queensland passed the Path to Treaty Act 2023 with bipartisan support but, after the referendum, the Liberal National party announced that if it were elected it would repeal that legislation. With the Queensland election due in October, it is time for Queenslanders to advocate for the continuation of this process.
Although New South Wales has the largest population of First Nations people it is the only state not to have begun a treaty process. The NSW Labor government was committed to treaty negotiations at the state level but since the referendum has announced it is reviewing its position. It would be another blow to Indigenous peoples if this process was halted before it had even begun.
The Uluru statement from the heart calls for truth-telling, whereby Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have the opportunity to record evidence about past actions and share their culture, heritage and history with the broader community. The Recognising the Power of Community Truth-Telling report highlighted how: “Truth-telling is not just about Australia’s violent colonial history but also about the timeless history of First Nations connections to and care for this continent and the vast contributions our people have made to Australia’s economic development, culture, and defence.”
The retiring senator Pat Dodson and other Indigenous politicians have called for truth-telling to be prioritised after a major survey found 80.5% of Australians would back such a process, despite the failure of the referendum.
Before the referendum, the South Australian government was well along the path of establishing a legislative state-based voice process. The attorney general, Kyam Maher, has said the referendum outcome does not change that policy, and a South Australian voice to parliament is “absolutely going ahead”.
The Indigenous leaders Thomas Mayo and Pat Turner have similarly called on the federal government to legislate a voice to parliament. Although a legislated voice could easily be dismantled by subsequent governments, it would at least enable Indigenous input into government decisions that impact Aboriginal people.
A decade ago the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples recommended that governments develop national action plans for the implementation of the United Nations declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples, setting out legislative, policy and other approaches to implementing this seminal international instrument. Australia has yet to develop an action plan and this should now be a priority for the federal government.
Assoc Prof Hannah McGlade, an expert member of the UN permanent forum on Indigenous issues, has called for Australia to respect the declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples and to be held to account for its compliance, both at home and in international forums.
The late great Indigenous leader Yunupingu once commented that he had witnessed Bob Hawke shed tears over his failure to realise the 1988 Barunga statement which called for recognition of the rights of Aboriginal people. Yunupingu generously observed that Hawke had “genuine tears from a genuine man who tried leadership and was caught out by politics”. With the defeat of the referendum we must not allow politics to again suspend the cause of Indigenous justice.
There has been a distinct loss of energy and depletion of public interest post-referendum, and with the sting of the failed referendum still in the minds of all politicians and allies, it is understandable there is nervousness about how to move forward. But the failure of the referendum is not a licence to walk away from addressing Indigenous disadvantage, and work must continue to provide Indigenous peoples with meaningful roles and decision-making power in matters that uniquely affect them.

OLR4FEC32F_WKLN8EWBGUDWKLC,The abortion activists who say bringing back Roe is not enough,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/abortion-activists-future-roe-v-wade,"Since the devastating loss of Roe v Wade, the abortion rights movement has seen historic levels of support for its cause, particularly through major victories on state ballot initiatives, with more expected this November. But as advocates move to re-enshrine the right to abortion at the state level, a struggle has emerged over whether to reproduce Roe’s legal framework – or go further.
Roe v Wade, which was decided 51 years ago on Monday, protected the right to abortion until fetal viability – the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus – which is widely accepted to be at roughly 24 weeks. A number of ballot campaigns slated for November seek to bring back that standard – but a group of advocates is banding together to declare that the broader movement is engaging in harmful compromises when it could instead use the momentum to push for “clean” policies that don’t draw a strict limit to abortion access.
“There is an enormous amount of pressure being put on leaders across states to run ballots whether they are good or bad,” said Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, vice-president of communications at the National Institute for Reproductive Health (NIRH), an advocacy group that is leading an effort to push the abortion rights movement to go beyond the Roe framework.
The group has joined forces with several other organizations to create an entity called the Learning and Accountability Project (LAP), that fights for what they call “clean” measures. The coalition plans to conduct polling and research to fight for expansive policies, such as ensuring insurance coverage for abortions, and allowing minors to obtain abortions without parental consent. They also plan to create education campaigns about the problem with viability.
Pamela Merritt, executive director of Medical Students for Choice, said this was an opportunity to avoid past mistakes. “We don’t have to recreate [Roe],” she said. “We don’t have to do this.”
The supreme court enshrined viability as a legal compromise in Roe to balance the rights of pregnant women against the state’s interest in potential life. But the viability line, advocates say, left behind people who need later abortions and set the stage for Roe’s downfall: anti-abortion activists argued it was an arbitrary standard in the case that overturned the seminal decision.
The project also includes the Society of Family Planning, Medical Students for Choice, Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights (Color), the advocacy group Patient Forward; DuPont Clinic; and the abortion provider Dr Colleen McNicholas.
Restrictions on reproductive healthcare have never been evidence-based, said Dr Jenni Villavicencio, interim director of public affairs and advocacy for the Society for Family Planning and a later abortion provider. “Having the government and politicians who are not scientific experts come in and tell us how to provide essential healthcare is inappropriate and doesn’t work,” she said.
Local affiliates of Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are championing ballot measures with viability limits in states including Arizona, Florida and Nevada, while groups such as the Fairness Project and other consultants are involved behind the scenes on polling and ballot language. Often, advocates behind such measures argue that viability limits are necessary to win, and these campaigns have been increasingly folded into Democratic electoral strategy. But members of the NIRH coalition are alarmed about the potential damage of inserting Roe’s compromise into state constitutions.
People need abortions later in pregnancy for various reasons, including new medical diagnoses, delays in care caused by abortion restrictions and clinic closures, financial barriers such as a lack of paid time off or childcare, and simply discovering their pregnancies late.
Sarah Standiford, national campaigns director for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said ballot measures were just one tool they plan to use to restore access in the years to come. Decisions around such measures are state-specific, she said, and groups must balance the competing needs of writing language that protects abortion access and also withstands legal challenges and wins a majority of voters. “That may ultimately necessarily advance a policy that is far short of the ideal,” she said.
Aurea Bolaños Perea, strategic communications director for Color, said the reproductive rights movement had only progressed because groups like hers had pressured decision-makers to challenge the status quo.
As a Black woman in the movement, Merritt said she could not support proposals that trade away vulnerable people’s access and affect future providers’ training. “‘Some rather than none’ has always screwed over people who look like me,” she said, citing the 19th amendment, which formally granted American women the right to vote, but in practice kept that right out of reach for Black women. “It is classic, second-wave feminist analysis that has historically hurt people who are marginalized,” she said of viability ballot campaigns.
For abortion providers, the issue isn’t theoretical. “When I think about who’s going to be harmed, I see specific patients. I see faces. I see the teddy bear and the 10-year-old and the tears of her mom,” said McNicholas, an all-trimester provider.
Framing restrictions as a political necessity reflected the movement’s internalized stigma around later abortion, said Erika Christensen, co-founder of Patient Forward, which works to ensure access throughout pregnancy. Christensen, who had to travel out of state in 2016 for a third-trimester abortion after discovering a fatal fetal anomaly, said the push for viability was an especially flawed strategy in red and purple states like Arizona, where she lives, because it leaves the door open for hostile legislatures to pass bans criminalizing abortion later in pregnancy. “The stakes are higher in the so-called ‘red’ states. It’s where so many people are suffering already,” she said. “Why are you codifying the circumstances of the suffering into our constitution?”
LAP also believes current ballot campaigns are doubling down on harmful anti-abortion stigma by conceding that banning later abortion is “reasonable”, rather than framing abortion as a fundamental right, Merritt said. And they argue that permanently enshrining limits in state constitutions could deny people abortions and increase the risk of criminalization for abortions and miscarriages later in pregnancy.
As a tax-exempt non-profit, the coalition cannot oppose or endorse ballot measures, but they hope voters can make informed choices. “We have to be transparent and honest to pro-abortion supporters in these campaigns. So if it’s not perfect, we need to own that,” Lee-Gilmore said.
“Every single right I have in this country as a Black woman – every single one – I have because people did not accept ‘this is as good as it gets,’” Merritt said. “I simply will not accept reproductive rights activists acting like we need to throw in the towel.”"

A Victorian man is alleged to have fleeced wannabe property market investors of $8.7m by claiming to be a developer who offers to help people demolish their homes and build townhouses in their place.
When they hand over the money, their developments are then bought out by other investors without any work taking place and the man flees. The sums stolen range from $20,000 to $2.1m.

Fifteen victims, mostly from Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, have come forward since the allegations were first reported in 2011.
Detectives believe the man is now targeting single women in Malvern East by trying to convince them to invest in his construction projects.
The allegations come as police urge Australians to be vigilant in the lead-up to Valentine’s Day, with some scammers seeking to exploit those who find themselves lonely or isolated.
The Australian federal police are specifically warning about a highly manipulative scam known as “pig butchering”. The scam requires a significant investment of time to gain the trust of a victim before encouraging them to invest in the share market, cryptocurrency or foreign currency exchanges.
The victims are led to believe they are trading on legitimate platforms but the money is actually siphoned into an account owned by offenders who create fake platforms that look identical to an established site.
The AFP said Australians had lost up to $4,500 every hour to romance scammers in 2022 and up to $3,800 in 2023.
The acting assistant commissioner cybercrime command, Chris Goldsmid, said the AFP had seized how-to manuals for those seeking to operate the scam and are making them available to the public to inform the community about how the schemes work.
Goldsmid said multicultural communities and women were particularly vulnerable to the scheme, which “does not target individuals with the false hope of a relationship” but cold-contacts someone, initiating “a conversation looking for friendship”.
“Scammers usually say the accidental messages are because of ‘fate’ or ‘divine will’,” he said.
“Over the course of months or years, the scammer will flaunt a lavish lifestyle and leave a trail of comments about their wealth, such as bragging about the value in their cryptocurrency wallets.
“Once victims ask how they are making their money, victims are directed to a complete replica of an investment site that shows the growth of an investment.
Goldsmid said when the victim finally tried to cash out, or had no more money left to give, the scammer would make one last effort by claiming that taxes need to be paid before the money can be released, or suggesting the victim travel to a “luxurious resort” for a meeting that can be arranged if they forward additional money.
Because these scams manipulate the victim’s trust, often those who have been caught out are too embarrassed to come forward.
“My message is don’t be embarrassed,” Goldsmid said. ‘“Alert your authorities, and think about telling your friends, family or community what happened. The more others know about these unscrupulous scammers the harder it will be for them to target others.”"
PCIUQXK3JL_H7QWG2YNDQ6VAJZ,The human cost of blocking injunctions on Rwanda,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/21/the-human-cost-of-blocking-injunctions-on-rwanda,"In a story about the Rwanda bill, you refer to Rishi Sunak toughening up his rhetoric on “pyjama injunctions” (Sunak faces Tory meltdown as deputy chairs back Rwanda bill rebellionReport, 15 January), meaning interim measures issued by the European court of human rights in exceptional circumstances. We should be careful about buying into this characterisation, as it trivialises the court’s urgent and legally binding injunctions, which are issued – sometimes out of hours – to avert an imminent risk of irreparable harm, such as death or torture.
Both the Illegal Migration Act 2023 and the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill give ministers discretion to disregard interim measures in cases relating to the removal of a person from the UK. Rightwing Tory MPs would like to go further and block interim measures entirely.
Doing so would risk irreparable harm to individuals seeking safety from torture and death in other countries. And not only that. If the UK cherrypicks which of the court’s measures it will abide by, this could encourage other, less rights-respecting states to follow suit.
In the same month (June 2022) that the court issued an injunction against the UK, preventing a person from being removed to Rwanda until UK courts had finally decided their case, two others were issued against Russia – to ensure that British prisoners of war who had fought with the Ukrainian army were not executed in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. The men were later released.
Interim measures against the UK are rare: on average about two per year. Does the UK government really want to undermine this vital and longstanding mechanism for protection of human rights across 46 European states for the sake of achieving the theatre of a plane taking off to Rwanda? Dr Alice Donald and Prof Philip Leach School of law, Middlesex University, London
The Rwanda soap opera continues with Polly Toynbee taking a very different view of the government’s aim (Sunak is praying for the Lords to block the Rwanda bill – so he can blame the left, 18 January). At some point in the future, historians will look back in bafflement at this government’s bizarre obsession with sending small numbers of alleged illegal immigrants at huge expense to a relatively small African country from which it is receiving its citizens fleeing from persecution.
Having spent 25 years working on pro-democracy projects across the world, including many in Africa and Asia, the idea that the Rwanda programme will act as a deterrent to those risking their lives to cross the Channel demonstrates a complete lack of awareness of the lives of these desperate individuals. They are certainly not in a position to read the Guardian or listen to Radio 4, or even to weigh up the odds of survival.Michael MeadowcroftFormer MP for Leeds West
So Sunak’s Rwanda plan is “the will of the British people”. I rather doubt it, but if he had any bottle he’d test it by calling a general election now. The fact that he hasn’t speaks volumes. Jol Miskin Sheffield

Q55A2QHK70_5JV19MP892BJSY2,Dingoes pay the ultimate price on K’gari but some believe people are the real menace,Andrew Messenger,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/21/dingoes-pay-the-ultimate-price-on-kgari-but-some-believe-people-are-the-real-menace,"Before they put down one of the wongari of K’gari they held a smoking ceremony. The execution is considered sorry business.
That’s because they are so significant in Aboriginal culture that the animals, also known as dingoes, are considered part of the family.
Darren Blake, fire coordinator at the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation, has been involved in the humane destruction of a few animals in more than a decade as a K’gari ranger. He says it is a solemn occasion.
“We only do a smoking ceremony when it’s human intervention,” Blake said
“So when he or she goes up Sky Country … we smoke them to send their spirit up [and] to feel more relaxed and not angry.
“Because if we don’t do it they’ll be still wandering around in their spirit form and probably enter another wongari.”
Blake said they often even talk to the animal to prepare them for where they are going and to let them know it’s not their fault.
“They’re in our songlines and our storylines. They’re our totem as well. They’re very important to the Butchulla people.”
Tuesday’s ceremony was the fourth time in six months that the authorities killed one of the wongari of K’gari – also known as Fraser Island, about six hours north of Brisbane. All four had attacked people – tourists to one of Queensland’s most popular natural getaways.
The 200 or so wongari living on K’gari are among the most genetically pure dingoes in the world and every player in the management of the island wants to avoid destroying them.
Between 2020 and 2023 there were no animals put down at all, after the implementation of a new safety and management strategy by the state government.
But despite the safety crackdown, K’gari dingo attacks continue to be frequent. Environmental groups and the local Aboriginal corporation say it’s time for a new approach: a cap on people.
Peter Shooter, past president of the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation and a member of the K’gari world heritage advisory committee, said the death of even a handful of dingoes would have an effect on the shallow gene pool on the isolated island.
He said a genetic study by Southern Cross and Johannesburg universities revealed a lack of genetic diversity was “a potential risk for the population”.
“There is no immediate risk. But in the long term it is always a risk when you get populations down to the sizes the wongari on K’gari are.”
A spokesperson for Queensland’s environment department said the latest dingo to be destroyed had attacked two children and a man in three separate incidents, all in the Hook Point barge landing area, one of the busiest spots on the island.
They said euthanasia was a last resort, but “due to the escalation of the animal’s behaviour” the decision was made to euthanise the dingo. The Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation, the island’s native title holders, do not support euthanasia.
It’s not a new story. According to the department, there have been six dingo-related incidents on K’gari since 10 December, half of them involving children.
But it is people who are perceived as the real menace on K’gari by those who care for the land.
Rangers have already issued two fines in 2024 for leaving food out for dingoes. This is an offence because feeding is among the leading causes of “habituation”, which is the process by which an animal, even a naturally shy one like a wongari, becomes comfortable being around people.
Feeding is a particular problem because the animals learn to associate humans with an easy meal rather than as a threat. The dingoes have no natural predators, so people are the major risk to their life, Shooter says.
The solution: keeping people away from animals.
The government has tried everything: fencing human areas, signs warning of the fatal consequences of habituation for both human and animal, stepped-up patrols and more.
But Shooter says he’s seen a steady deterioration in people’s behaviour after the Covid period.
Tour groups tend to be well behaved but independent travellers sometimes outright ignore the rules, he says.
“Getting selfies, getting as close as possible,” he says. “They are cute animals, the little fellas particularly, they’re gorgeous. It is kind of human nature to want to get as close as possible to them and cuddle them because that’s what we do with our pets.
“These things are not pets. You wouldn’t you wouldn’t want to cuddle a lion cub … not out in their natural range.”
Shooter and the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation are among many groups who believe it’s time to strengthen restrictions on tourists.
That might mean a process of banning the worst-behaved individuals from the island, or simple population caps at peak periods, such as those on Lord Howe Island, Antarctica and Machu Picchu.
John Green, a project coordinator at the Aboriginal corporation, has also worked as a ranger on K’gari for more than a decade.
“Capping the numbers for the peak periods would be an idea, because then the resources required to educate and have these opportunities happen is minimised,” he says.
“The sheer numbers do make it harder to be everywhere.”
He says such a cap could be balanced by more visitors outside the peak periods, with tourists spread over the quieter months rather than concentrated during the school holidays.
“That’s where these wongaris don’t get a chance … purely from the sheer numbers in those peak periods.”
Shooter points out that the idea may not be popular among everyone.
The Fraser Coast region gets more than half a million tourists a year, almost all domestic and many of them bound for K’gari. It’s a large and important industry.
But Shooters says as a result of the number of visitors the island’s “social fabric has changed”.
“We have caused it to change,” Shooter says. “It’s most unfair to think, well, the response to that is for, us who caused the change, to decide we will just kill the animals. That’s totally unacceptable.”
The immediate solution is more money.
In a statement, the department said it was investing an additional $2m this year plus $3m annually to expand safety messaging further and to support 13 new positions dedicated to dingo conservation and management.
The Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation is hoping to hire as many as four wongari rangers to deal solely with the animals, adding to seven or eight existing rangers.
Green says their role would be as much about managing people as the environment – keeping an eye on both groups, which is easier if there are fewer people.
“Our purpose would be to try to focus on the ones that are heading down that road [of habituation] and give them a chance to stay away from the visitors,” he says.
Shooter says it is humans who are the problem – even though animals pay the ultimate price. He says inevitably there will be more smoking ceremonies in the future as more wongari are euthanised.
“It’s not going to go away on its own. It will only go away by a change in human behaviour.”

QZFOCF4S10_M0OVMT0QHQBXQRU,"Ian Bailey, suspect in one of Ireland’s most notorious murders, dies aged 66",Rory Carroll,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/ian-bailey-suspect-in-one-of-irelands-most-notorious-murders-dies-aged-66,"Ian Bailey, an English former journalist who was the prime suspect in one of Ireland’s most notorious murders, has died near his home in Bantry, County Cork, at the age of 66. He suffered a heart attack on Sunday.
Bailey had lived in the public eye for almost three decades as the main suspect in the 1996 murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, a French filmmaker who was battered to death near her holiday home in West Cork.
Police arrested Bailey twice but prosecutors did not charge him, citing insufficient evidence, leaving the crime unresolved and Bailey as an enigmatic protagonist in a cottage industry of true crime books, documentaries and podcasts.
French extradition attempts and a European arrest warrant deterred Bailey – who protested his innocence - from leaving Ireland, where he was a polarising figure. Many were convinced of his guilt, while others considered him a victim of injustice.
“He suffered a deep and grievous wrong at the hands of the Irish state,” said Frank Buttimer, a solicitor who represented Bailey. “It shaped his life for the past 27 years. It took any form of normal existence away from him. He became extraordinary because of what happened to him.”
Bailey had been unwell with a heart condition and had a heart attack on a street in Bantry on Sunday afternoon, prompting unsuccessful resuscitation attempts and a declaration of death at Bantry hospital, said Buttimer. “Time caught up with him in the end.”
Bailey separated from his partner two years ago and was unable to visit his only relative, a sister in Britain, for fear of arrest, said the solicitor. “I imagine his death was sad and somewhat lonely. He died a prisoner in Ireland.”
For Toscan du Plantier’s family, the death extinguished hope of extraditing Bailey to France, where a court sentenced him in absentia in 2019 to 25 years for the murder, and of ever finding justice from the police investigation. “We fear the cold case review team may not conclude its work,” the victim’s uncle, Jean Pierre Gazeau, told the Irish Times.
Bailey grew up in Gloucestershire and worked as a freelance journalist in the 1980s, filing stories for the Sunday Times, before moving to West Cork, a haven for bohemian expatriates, where he dabbled as a poet and labourer.
Toscan du Plantier, a 39-year-old film producer and mother, was attacked outside her holiday home on 23 December 1996. Bailey, who lived nearby, filed scoops about the case to newspapers, only to become the story himself when he was arrested. Detectives said he had opportunity, scratch marks and a record of domestic violence, but there was no forensic evidence and a witness who said she saw him that night retracted her testimony.
Bailey sued newspapers for libel and the Irish state for wrongful arrest, alleging that the police tried to frame him, but he lost the actions, leaving him in limbo and struggling to make a living selling pizzas and writing poetry.
He collaborated in the podcast series West Cork, which spawned a Netflix series, and Murder at the Cottage, a Sky documentary series made by Jim Sheridan.
Bailey told the Guardian in 2019 that he “stayed sane” through poetry, carpentry, meditation and singing, and that he was happy to stay in Ireland. “Hopefully I’ll be leaving in a coffin rather than on a plane in handcuffs,” he said."
RL88FD043C_7TKMPNEKSLTQBYT,Israel’s plans for Gaza’s future will only keep the flame of Hamas resistance burning,Ahmad Samih Khalidi,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/israels-plans-for-gazas-future-will-only-keep-the-flame-of-hamas-resistance-burning,"In late 1935, a small band of irregulars led by a Syrian-born Islamist cleric launched a guerrilla campaign against the British mandatory government that had the establishment of a Jewish “national home” in what was then predominantly Arab Palestine, as part of its purview. The campaign was swiftly suppressed by British forces, and its leader, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, was killed as were the majority of his men.
But Qassam’s readiness to take up arms and die in the service of the Palestinian cause made a deep and lasting impression on Palestinian society, and his “martyrdom” became a symbol of sacrifice that has continued to resonate throughout the past 90 years, eventually providing both inspiration and a name to Hamas’s armed wing in the late 1980s. The fact that Qassam failed was essentially irrelevant. More important was his embodiment of the spirit of dogged and selfless resistance to foreign domination despite the imbalance of power and the unlikely prospects of success. Qassam also set the Palestinian national movement down the path of “armed struggle” that was eventually adopted by Yasser Arafat’s “mainstream” Fatah movement from the late 1950s onwards but whose role has diminished since the 1993 Oslo accord with Israel.
The past 30 years have witnessed an accelerating competition between Hamas’s claim to embody national resistance to Israeli rule, and Fatah’s collapse into discord, corruption and collusion under the banner of the Palestinian Authority’s “security cooperation” with the Israeli occupation. This race culminated in Hamas’s 7 October assault that was designed as much to shock and terrorise Israel as it was to discredit Fatah/ Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority and consolidate Hamas’s position as the primary inheritor and embodiment of the Palestinian national movement and its liberationist cause.
Israel’s post 7/10 resort to massive force, dropping an unprecedented total of about 30,000 bombs by mid-December 2023 (equivalent to two Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs), has so far failed to eradicate the military force established by Hamas amid the torrent of bloodshed, 25,000 Palestinian dead and the 62,000 wounded, and the mass displacement of 1.9 million Palestinian civilians in Gaza (85% of the population), easily exceeding the toll of the ethnic cleansing that accompanied Israel’s establishment in 1948.
The issue of how and when the war will end remains shrouded in the fog of Israel’s opaque intentions and the US’s increasingly desperate diplomatic manoeuvrings, hoping for a clear Israeli victory over Hamas, while fearing the worst consequences of a regional conflagration as evident from the slow spread of hostilities from Bab-el-Mandeb to Irbil. US hopes of leveraging the moment into a redesigned Middle East living in peace and harmony must not only contend with the sheer contagion of the current conflict but with the political capital needed, especially in an electoral year, to shift Israel away from its current semi-consensual refusal to countenance any substantial change in the status quo of occupation, settlement and domination.
Meanwhile, as “day after” scenarios pile up, ranging from the utopian vision of a region speeding towards peace and stability thanks to an as yet invisible “pathway to Palestinian statehood” dreamed up by US secretary of state Antony Blinken, to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant’s fantasy of an Arab/international consortium taking over the Gaza Strip on Israel’s behalf, to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise that there will no Palestinian state and that the war will continue at least into 2025: in all these, one thing is missing: Hamas’s likely survival and its potentially growing influence both despite and because of the enormous damage inflicted on the movement itself and the people of the Gaza Strip.
Hamas’s brutal tactics in its 7 October assault have been washed out of Palestinian political consciousness by the subsequent indiscriminate and mass erasure of Palestinian civilian lives, and the US/west’s complicity in supporting, arming and allowing this onslaught to continue under the guise of Israel’s right to self-defence with no evident expiry date attached. Rather than crush Hamas, its most likely effect will be to remythologise the notion of resistance and sow the seed for future iterations that may be inspired by Hamas but have no necessary connection to its history, ideology or organisational structure.
With Israeli leaders openly talking of pursuing the war against Hamas and its leaders across national boundaries, another potentially dangerous turn could take the form of Hamas’s transformation from a national-religious movement focused on the conflict in the land of Israel/Palestine into a more global movement ready to take the war to arenas that Hamas has hitherto avoided.
With regard to re-establishing a viable political authority in the Gaza Strip and reconstituting a Palestinian representative body that is capable of taking and sustaining decisions whether relating to a future political horizon with Israel or any legitimate governance and reconstruction process, the real issue is how to incorporate Hamas and its associated “spirit of resistance” into a new Palestinian authority, rather than how to quash or excise it. Within or associated with such an authority, Hamas could be part of the solution; outside, it would remain both a spoiler and an opposite pole of attraction.
Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have made it clear that they will seek to impose a strict and indefinite Israeli-determined security regime over the Gaza Strip for the foreseeable future; in other words, to reinstitute what amounts to a long-term occupation. This, in turn, will not only keep the flame of Hamas alive and galvanise Hamas-inspired resistance but will ensure that Israel’s “right of self-defence” will only produce the very insecurity that Israel and its allies claim to be addressing. If the past 55 years of occupation have taught us anything, it is that this cannot be the path to a genuine and lasting peace. It took Israel and the US approximately 35 years to talk to what was then seen as the terrorist PLO, just as it took years for the ANC and IRA to be recognised as partners to a resolution. All those threatened or rightfully concerned about what may happen next, simply cannot afford the price of waiting that long.

SJM35VEQJV_RGPJEO106QE1TWN,The Guardian view on school reform: southern discomfort about the class divide,Editorial,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/the-guardian-view-on-school-reform-southern-discomfort-about-the-class-divide,"One of the great hushed truths of the state school system is that its pupils are decided by house prices. That well-regarded comprehensive may charge no fees but its intake will be still be selected by parental income, as families pay exorbitantly for a home in the catchment area. As any estate agent knows, a school judged outstanding by Ofsted will push up neighbouring property prices. This is a cruel system that drives families who can afford it to uproot themselves, makes many of those who cannot feel inadequate, and produces and intensifies social segregation.
Few would dispute this account. Not the government, which has published papers on the link between house prices and schools, nor academics or analysts: just last week the Sutton Trust published findings showing that 155 comprehensives, supposedly open to all, are more socially selective than a typical grammar. In Scotland, home addresses are assigned one secondary school so that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, social segregation there is even more marked.
Rarely does any of this feature in the discussion around raising school standards. Ministers and policy experts talk about Sats, school curricula, inspections – rather than bringing down the invisible barriers that go up for children as early as five. Which is why Brighton and Hove is worth watching. On Monday, its Labour-led council will vote to change secondary school admissions. Councillors propose to make local authority secondaries give priority to children on free school meals over pupils from the catchment area. Observers believe that Brighton and Hove will be the first council ever to do this. The move is an attempt to reduce inequality within a highly unequal city, to mix up school populations, and to give pupils access to sought‑after schools. For a city that prides itself on being progressive and inclusive, this is a big step towards living those values.
A remarkable aspect of this policy is how far it has been driven by a local grassroots campaign. Class Divide is led by independent residents rather than party politicians and is particularly informed by the experience of those living in Whitehawk and other eastern suburbs, only a few miles from the plusher parts of north and central Brighton yet often forgotten. In a series of podcasts released last year, campaigners documented how the schools gap affects locals’ lives: attend a great school and the world may open up; go to a troubled one and you can be left without a launchpad. While fighting in last year’s local elections, Jacob Taylor noted that on the doorstep Class Divide’s campaign kept coming up. Mr Taylor is now one of the councillors behind this new policy.
However good a student’s time within the classroom, it does not solve the problems they face outside. Changing schools’ entry criteria is only a small part of tackling inequality, and there will need to be support for the pupils who travel across the class divide, as well as plans for schools that lose students and the funding that goes with them. But for an underfunded local council it is a meaningful step. It is also not without political risk in a city that has tried and failed with admissions reform before. Still, this is a welcome move against one of the big scourges of our time. Sir Keir Starmer and his shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson could take some lessons from the south coast."
SNP8S18528_U175QGAK77NH5C4,Disgraced NSW detective Roger ‘The Dodger’ Rogerson dies aged 83,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/disgraced-nsw-detective-roger-the-dodger-rogerson-dies-in-jail-aged-83,"The disgraced former New South Wales police officer Roger Rogerson has died in hospital aged 83.
Known as “The Dodger”, the controversial and charismatic tough cop turned killer was moved from Long Bay prison to Sydney’s Prince of Wales hospital last Thursday where he was receiving end-of-life care.
He was pronounced dead at approximately 11.15pm on Sunday.
Both hero and villain during his 28-year police career, Rogerson was at one time the NSW force’s most decorated officer, with a stellar career catching criminals and a formidable reputation for bravery.
That was before his close connections to Sydney’s most notorious crooks were exposed, eventually destroying his reputation, career and freedom.

At the end, Rogerson was serving a life sentence for the execution-style 2014 murder of drug dealer Jamie Gao, over which he always maintained his innocence.
Rogerson and co-accused fellow former detective Glen McNamara were jailed for life in 2016 after murdering Gao at a Sydney storage unit in May 2014, after which they attempted to dump his body at sea.
Both of the men ran cut-throat defences at trial, arguing the other had shot Gao.
The pair was also jailed for stealing 2.78kg of methamphetamine with a street value of up to $19m from the 20-year-old university student.
In March, the high court rejected an appeal by Rogerson to have his murder conviction overturned, stamping out any hope the rogue detective had of ever being released.
At the height of his public recognition, Rogerson received the coveted Peter Mitchell award for outstanding police work in 1980 but within six years his career would spectacularly unravel.
In 1986, Rogerson was dismissed from the police force for depositing $110,000 in bank accounts under a false name.

Earlier that decade, in 1981, he had been found responsible for the fatal shooting of another young drug dealer, Warren Lanfranchi, but controversially was deemed to have acted in the line of duty.
Lanfranchi’s girlfriend, sex worker Sallie-Anne Huckstepp, said Rogerson murdered him over a drug-related dispute involving corrupt police.
Huckstepp was later found drowned and her murder remains unsolved.
Rogerson was also implicated in the attempted execution of NSW undercover operative Michael Drury after the similarly decorated drug squad detective declined to accept a bribe in exchange for evidence tampering in a heroin trafficking trial.
Drury was shot twice through his kitchen window on Sydney’s north shore. Rogerson was charged and eventually acquitted of the attack in 1989.
Richard Roxburgh portrayed Rogerson in the highly acclaimed 1995 mini-series Blue Murder and its 2017 sequel Blue Murder: Killer Cop."
SSR909HDUY_6N2V67N5RQM0FG6,Art of the attack ad: six memorable angles the Conservatives have tried,Michael Savage,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/focus/2024/jan/21/art-of-the-attack-ad-six-memorable-angles-the-conservatives-have-tried,"From the devastating to the downright desperate, the Conservatives have a rich – if chequered – history of devising political attack advertisements designed to see off Labour.
At their best, they have the power to tap into the nation’s doubts about the party, most obviously preying on suspicions that it will tax and spend the moment it seizes the levers of power. They have also attempted to take aim at the perceived flaws of the Labour leader – whether it was concerns over Jeremy Corbyn’s views on national security or Ed Miliband’s willingness to stand up to the SNP should he become prime minister.
With Labour still retaining a stubbornly large poll lead in an election year, the Tories are now engaged in an increasingly desperate race to find an attack on Keir Starmer and his party that might stick. While Boris Johnson’s depiction of Starmer as “Captain Hindsight” during the peak of the Covid crisis gained some traction, the Tories have since veered from depicting Starmer as ruthless and unprincipled to being a lefty lawyer committed to human rights.
Here, we document the party’s most and least successful attempts to land one on their opponents.
Building on prime minister Harold Macmillan’s 1957 declaration that the UK had “never had it so good”, the Tories carried the message into their election campaign. The country agreed and gave the party a historic third general election victory in a row, increasing its majority from 60 to 100 seats.
Widely regarded as the epitome of the successful attack ad, Saatchi & Saatchi’s “Labour isn’t working” poster used in Margaret Thatcher’s victorious 1979 campaign managed to highlight the nation’s concerns in one image of a winding dole queue. The simple idea also spoke to Thatcher’s iconoclastic approach to taking a different path. Attack ads had well and truly arrived.
Another Saatchi ad that highlighted concerns felt by voters over the prospect of installing Neil Kinnock into No 10 in 1992. Kinnock had taken Labour back towards the centre after it had drifted to the left under Michael Foot -, yet suspicions remained over its economic plans. The defeat fuelled a future New Labour’s obsession with having credible spending plans.
The image of Tony Blair with demon eyes has come to symbolise the attack ad gone wrong. It was published with the Tories desperate to dent a huge Labour lead and tried to paint New Labour as being old Labour in disguise. The problem was that voters disagreed – as shown by Labour’s 179-strong majority in 1997.
With polls suggesting Labour could be the biggest party in a hung parliament after the 2015 election, a Tory party running out of ideas published an ad depicting Labour’s Ed Miliband as being in the pocket of the SNP’s Alex Salmond. The idea took off thanks to English voters’ perception of Miliband as weak.
With Labour’s poll lead still in double digits, the Tories are attacking Keir Starmer for cases he took on as a criminal barrister – with a reference to the hit television show Better Call Saul. Social media users soon pointed out that, quite apart from the fact that Starmer had prosecuted terrorists, the poster made the Labour leader look almost cool."
SZQYSSWJSZ_R93VZ48TZEIH5NV,Exhibiting Forgiveness review – André Holland powers moving father-son drama,Benjamin Lee,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/21/exhibiting-forgiveness-review-andre-holland-titus-kaphar,"Stories of estranged family members finding their way back to each other have long been a reliable Sundance staple, a stacked subgenre in itself and one that can grow a little wearying as a result. The artist turned film-maker Titus Kaphar’s debut Exhibiting Forgiveness, showing in the main dramatic competition here, may not exactly revolutionise the form but he finds an authentic and sensitive way through, distinguishing his film from the flurry of other superficially similar stories.
It’s art as therapy for Kaphar, grappling with a strained relationship with his own father, based on a recorded conversation they once had after 15 years of no contact. Working through one’s own strife as a form of autofiction can often lead to self-indulgence but Kaphar has crafted something that deserves to exist outside of his inner circle, an emotionally wrenching drama set to resonate with those who have also had to confront the complicated equation of radical forgiveness.
How much is too much to take and when does carrying so much resentment start to hurt you more? They’re questions that have been buried by the painter Tarrell (André Holland), with a sleekly curated life far from his conflicted upbringing, the light of his devoted mother (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) muddied by the dark of his abusive father, La’Ron (the theatre actor John Earl Jelks). But there’s something eating away at him, night terrors that won’t go away, and when he travels home with his wife (a radiant Andra Day) and young son to help his mother move house, the re-emergence of his father causes a difficult reckoning.
There are troubling questions that Kaphar refuses to provide pat answers for, how one comes to terms with the good things a bad parent might be partly responsible for and how you learn to silence the worst parts of them echoing in your head, if that’s ever truly possible. Flashbacks are admirably limited, mostly focused on one day where we see La’Ron cruelly instill a sense of extreme work ethic in a young Tarrell, a layer of steel he insists is vital in a world that will demand it. How much does Tarrell then credit the strength of his meteoric career to him? How much of that hardness can be justified by the upbringing his father received as a child? Kaphar allows difficult moments to linger as Tarrell voices his anxieties, worrying that he’ll never be able to find his way through this arduous emotional maze. There’s also an effectively angry throughline about the hypocrisy of religion, Tarrell fatigued at how it’s shamelessly used to imply goodness when behaviour suggests otherwise.
Holland wears all of this turbulence in his face, a rage forever simmering, rage that he knows has come directly from his father, a darker part of himself that he’s far quicker in crediting. He’s dynamite here, the kind of dream-in-every-scene showcase he’s never really been allowed on screen before, and there are enough electrifying moments, battling with his mother over her maddening enduring love for his father and a final explosion of emotion, to push Holland into both next year’s Oscar race and into a newer, long-deserved category of more prestigious leading roles. As his parents, Ellis-Taylor and Jelks are both superb, intimate arguments with them acted with such rawness, it feels like we’re watching them on stage.
As a first-time director with a background in visual art, Kaphar makes for a refreshingly restrained film-maker, keeping visual gimmickry at bay and involving his real paintings only when the film requires. He understands the importance of using one’s art as a way to untangle the knots of a troubled upbringing but avoids any form of pretentious overstatement. The work speaks for itself without him speaking for it. As a writer, Kaphar makes a few more missteps along the way, with a slight overstack of melodrama near the end, some rather crudely cartoonish art world stereotypes and some lines that are a tad ungainly (“Some things can’t be worked out on a canvas” – groan). These broad strokes only act as temporary distraction with a heart-grabbing finale that brings together all emotional threads while denying us the cliched hugged out happy ending we’ve learned to expect. Kaphar knows that forgiveness is harder than that and his film refuses to make things easy.

TRJVTU6ZL3_M9SF1N5IXVQEGIV,‘Every school should have a library’: Philip Pullman calls for new UK laws,Vanessa Thorpe,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/21/every-school-should-have-a-library-philip-pullman-calls-for-new-uk-laws,"Philip Pullman, the author of the His Dark Materials trilogy, has joined fellow celebrated British writers Michael Morpurgo and Julia Donaldson this weekend in calling on government to legislate immediately to ensure all schools in Britain have libraries.
“The school library is absolutely essential at every level of education, and it needs legal protection and status,” said Pullman. “It is too easy to think that books and reading for pleasure are not essential, whereas nothing is more certain to improve children’s ability – and desire – to read richly and well.
“It’s also been too easy for some school heads to downgrade the school library into some sort of ‘information centre’, with the focus on computers and technology rather than books.”
Earlier this month former children’s laureate Donaldson, the author of The Gruffalo and many other popular stories for youngsters, made this campaign a key element in her BBC Radio 4 Analysis programme about the reading crisis among British children. If not enforced by law, the provision of a school library, she said, should at least now become part of an Ofsted evaluation.
Data produced last year revealed a falling number of secondary schools with libraries, while 14% of primary schools indicated having no library.
Donaldson went on to point out that while British prisons are legally required to have a library, some of the next generation of schoolchildren are going without.
Her words were echoed last week by Morpurgo, another former children’s laureate and the author of War Horse. He called for a new law when he was interviewed on Radio 4 about a related campaign to encourage parents and carers to lay the groundwork by reading stories to their children at bedtime. The writer emphasised that reading was not just important for improving academic attainment, but for its own sake.
The joint plea by the celebrated authors comes as new Manchester University research is published this weekend showing that reading comics and graphic novels can be a crucial introduction to books.
One of Pullman’s series of comics, The Phoenix, was given to north Manchester schoolchildren as part of a two-year project funded by Comic Art Europe, a pilot scheme bringing together four European organisations representing different elements of the comic book sector, and commissioned by the Lakes International Comic arts festival in Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria.
The festival’s research found “the number of children who listed reading as one of their favourite leisure activities doubled in the intervention group, while it reduced in popularity among the comparison group”.
Researchers worked with year 3 and year 4 pupils at north Manchester’s Abraham Moss community school, which has a large proportion of pupils from ethnic minority backgrounds and a higher than average number of economically disadvantaged students.

Last September a National Literacy Trust report revealed that more than 56% of eight to 18-year-olds do not enjoy reading in their free time – a record low. And levels of reading enjoyment were weakest for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is despite recent evidence that an interest in books is a significant determinant of future achievements and salary levels.
“The school library is without question the most important room in the entire school, because it contains – or used to contain, or should contain – books that are not required for examination purposes,” said Pullman. “Books that no one might expect to find. Books on every subject under the sun. Books that some teachers don’t even know are there.”
Pullman said that he had kept an American poetry anthology “out of the hands of the elderly librarian at my secondary school in Harlech, north Wales, for example, because I worried that she might be damaged by Allen Ginsberg’s Howl”.
Pullman added that he visited Michael Gove when he was education secretary to make the argument for action. “He thanked me courteously and took no notice whatsoever,” Pullman said.
“But the library should be the heart, the soul, the mind, the source, the spring, the gold-bearing seam, the engine room, the treasure chamber, the priceless inheritance, the joy and the pride of the school. Every school.”"
UJ2I9MR8QW_AMKV3ZQZ24A6YSZ,Call for action on deepfakes as fears grow among MPs over election threat,Michael Savage,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/call-for-action-on-deepfakes-as-fears-grow-among-mps-over-election-threat,"Most MPs across Westminster fear the use of deepfakes and AI-generated content will undermine the integrity of the next general election, amid demands for an urgent overhaul of their regulation ahead of polling day.
Ministers are already concerned about the effect the technology has had on elections overseas, with a survey of MPs revealing that a majority believe it poses a threat to the integrity of the coming election. Some 70% fear AI will increase the spread of misinformation and disinformation.
With 2024 billed as a huge year for democracy with elections taking place around the world, senior figures from all major parties are pushing for the issue to be prioritised before the election campaign takes off in earnest. All parties are being urged to promise not to amplify material they cannot verify.
Both London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Keir Starmer have already been targeted by deepfake attempts in recent months, with invented audio clips designed to damage them. Meanwhile, security minister Tom Tugendhat has warned that deepfakes have already been attempted in the run-up to the Slovakian elections. Last week, chancellor Jeremy Hunt warned that the development of AI had to be in line with “liberal democratic values”.
A survey of MPs seen by the Observer shows that 57% of those asked said AI could negatively interfere with electoral integrity in 2024. Two-thirds (65%) said political parties and politicians should be transparent about how they are using AI tools in campaigns, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by the communications consultancy Cavendish.
The vast majority of general voters – some 78% – backed a requirement for political parties to disclose their use of AI.
The findings are included in a forthcoming report by the Demos thinktank, which calls for all parties to sign up to new standards on the use of AI and to publish their internal guidelines for using it. Researchers also call on parties to commit to not amplifying suspect material.
Robert Buckland, the former Tory justice secretary, said action was needed ahead of “the biggest year of elections in world history”. He added: “We have to make sure that the clear and present danger to democracy presented by deepfakes and AI generated misinformation is both headed off and mitigated by direct action.”
Khan told the Observer that the far right had sought to use the material against him to “raise tensions, sow hatred and turn communities against each other”. He urged ministers to heed a call from the Electoral Commission to update laws on disinformation. “This trend is only likely to get worse in the weeks and months to come in the lead-up to the London mayoral and general elections later this year,” he said.
“The danger this new and unregulated technology poses to our politics and democratic freedoms, as well as wider society, can’t be overstated.
“I also urge the tech industry, the police and the wider criminal justice system to work together and provide researchers with the data they need to identify and examine the changing risks and challenges of this harmful content.”
Peter Kyle, the shadow science and technology minister, said the technology could have “potentially devastating consequences and can further erode trust in institutions”. He added: “A Labour government would urgently introduce binding regulation of the small group of companies developing the most powerful AI models that could, if left unchecked, spread misinformation, undermine elections and help terrorists build weapons.”

Polly Curtis, chief executive at Demos, urged all parties “to come together to agree on a way forward to protect the democratic systems they hold so dear and establish responsible norms about how generative AI is used”.
In addition to the potential of fake content, some Tories have also been warning of the dangers of misrepresenting real material after an encounter with Rishi Sunak and a former NHS worker last week. Sky News tweeted a video showing the voter berating Sunak about the state of the NHS. Sunak is then shown laughing and walking off. After dozens of Labour MPs and commentators criticised Sunak, Sky News broadcast full footage of the encounter which showed the pair had walked off together before ending their encounter by shaking hands. A Downing Street source said Sunak was laughing at a comment from someone in the crowd, rather than the woman.
A Department for Science Innovation and Technology spokesperson said: “We are working to ensure we are ready to respond to threats to our democratic processes, including through our Defending Democracy Taskforce.
“The Online Safety Act will soon make social media platforms legally responsible for removing illegal mis- and disinformation and enforcing their terms of service. We have also introduced the Digital Imprints Regime, which requires certain political campaigning digital material, including AI-generated material, to have a digital imprint that makes clear to voters who is promoting the content.”"
V7V2OB9MX0_UYK9DVJB1XUZUGD,The Kitchen review – Kane Robinson shines in Daniel Kaluuya and Kibwe Tavares’s dystopian London drama,Wendy Ide,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/21/the-kitchen-kane-robinson-daniel-kaluuya-kibwe-tavares-jedaiah-bannerman-netflix,"The directorial debut of Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya unfolds in a dystopian near-future London, a city in which the division between the haves and the have-nots has deepened to such an extent that society seems to be simmering on the brink of a civil war. The flashpoint is the Kitchen, a condemned housing estate that nods to Blade Runner-style future slums and the powder-keg banlieue of Romain Gavras’s 2022 film Athena. Threatened with eviction, the residents barricade themselves against repeated assaults by armed police. Solitary Izi (Kane Robinson) lives in the Kitchen but plans to escape. Then he encounters Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman), a 12-year-old whose mother has just died and who is looking for someone to fill the space in his life.
The rich world-building is the picture’s main asset: the film looks fantastic, with its screaming neons and precipitous concrete cliff faces. The space in which the story unfolds is rather more distinctive than the story itself, which covers familiar territory and loses some energy as the film progresses. Still, Robinson and Bannerman are excellent, warily stepping around each other’s expectations and weighing up the cost of allowing themselves to care.

V85QJCWTUN_9J11PGV94GUCYS2,The Observer view on the measles outbreak: it shows why the NHS needs proper funding,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/observer-view-on-measles-outbreaks-we-must-not-let-dangerous-virus-take-hold-in-britain-again,"Britain is facing a measles outbreak that could soon spread through the nation after a surge in cases was uncovered in the West Midlands last week. More than 300 confirmed and probable cases have been reported there in the past few months and the prospect of further outbreaks looks worrying.
Measles predominantly affects children and can cause severe disease, complications and occasionally death. It is also one of the most highly contagious ailments known to medicine. A single infected person can pass on the disease to nine out of 10 of their unvaccinated close contacts.
On its own, such infectivity would not be a problem – in a properly vaccinated population. Sadly, this description no longer fits the citizenry of the UK. Measles vaccinations have slumped in Britain in recent years. Those who have been given double doses of the MMR vaccine – which provides powerful, safe protection against the virus – have dropped to well below 85% of individuals in many areas, including the West Midlands. To achieve herd immunity against measles, about 95% of the population needs to have had the vaccine, doctors have warned.
Nor is the West Midlands an isolated problem area. In London, up to 20% of children are now entering school having never been vaccinated, Prof Dame Jenny Harries – head of the UK Health Security Agency – revealed last week. As she put it: “Vaccination coverage is clearly not where we want to be.”
Harries’s analysis is an understatement, to say the least. The nation is facing the return of a very serious, occasionally lethal ailment. Yet only eight years ago it was announced that the disease had been eliminated in the UK. Its return raises urgent questions. How did this slump in vaccinations occur? And what needs to be done to restore the nation’s past resilience to the disease?
It might be tempting to pin the blame on anti-vaxxers, those misguided zealots who believe that vaccines pose a risk to health and who promote their cause vociferously on social media. Such an argument would be lazy and dangerous, however. Very few people accept the arguments of anti-vaxxers, and research has made it clear that the majority of men and women in the UK believe vaccines are safe and effective. However, many families lead complex – often chaotic – lives and sometimes fail to ensure their children are vaccinated. They need reassurances about the importance and safety of immunisation and the actions that are needed if they have let vaccine appointments slip. In fact, it is never too late to be vaccinated, but that information is not always clear.
Asking questions about vaccination is to be encouraged, but trained staff are required to provide this information, and the NHS and GPs are already under pressure and facing cuts both in funding and in staff. It is at this level that the nation has faltered.
In England, the NHS recently published a strategy to improve its vaccination services, including proposals to provide more flexible and convenient facilities where they can be administered. It was a welcome development.
Less cheering was the proposed implementation date for this improvement scheme: 2025-26. This represents a two-year gap, which completely fails to recognise the predicament facing the nation. It is incumbent upon ministers and senior health officials to bring a new sense of urgency to the strategy’s execution and provide proper resources to ensure its fulfilment. A failure to do so would put many lives at risk. As Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has put it: “The clock is ticking to get children who have missed doses vaccinated before this virus kills.”"
VPYCGNY26K_JJQ8B1CVAGXYYTN,The Holdovers review – a masterclass in melancholy with Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph,Wendy Ide,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/21/the-holdovers-review-alexander-payne-paul-giamatti-da-vine-joy-randolph,"A cantankerous, unpopular teacher, Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti); a bright, abrasive student, Angus (Dominic Sessa); and Mary (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), the school’s head cook and a recently bereaved mother, find themselves forced to spend the winter holiday together in an otherwise empty New England elite academy in Alexander Payne’s terrific, bittersweet throwback to the classic American cinema of the 1970s. It’s Payne’s finest film since Sideways (2004), and like it features a superb Giamatti performance as a stubbornly unlovable and difficult man. A Christmas movie, complete with an atmospheric dusting of snow and a selection of fussy a cappella school-choir carols, it’s about finding family where you least expect it. But don’t approach The Holdovers expecting a cosy comfort blanket of a film. There’s a bracingly astringent bleakness under its surface layer of melancholy humour; a biting, sharp edge that counters the occasional lurch towards sentimentality.
The kinship with Sideways extends beyond the casting of Giamatti. Tellingly, both Paul in The Holdovers and Miles in Sideways are defined as much by what they haven’t done – both men are burdened by albatross-like unwritten book projects – as what they have achieved in life. There is arguably no director currently working who has a better grasp of the framework of disappointment than Payne. His characters inhabit richly drawn worlds in which seemingly minor details come together in a reproachful chorus, a reminder that life could, and should, have been better. A case in point: a shot of a tube of Preparation H haemorrhoid ointment casually on display in the bathroom of Paul’s private quarters at the school tells us more than the fact that he suffers from piles – it also suggests a barren social life. Paul has long ago given up on the possibility of spontaneous visitors.
Disappointment is the driving force behind Miles’s thin-skinned wine snobbery in Sideways; disappointment, with a side order of delusion, fuels Warren Schmidt’s camper-van voyage of self-discovery in About Schmidt. And it’s this shared experience of being let down by life, as much as the fact that they’re forced to spend the Christmas break together, that connects the characters in The Holdovers, helping them to tune into the unique frequencies of each other’s pain.
Paul has more or less accepted the fact that he is disliked by students and fellow teachers alike and has built a wall of books and barbed put-downs to hide behind. For Angus, already grieving the absence of his father in his life, the last-minute retraction of a promised holiday to Saint Kitts with his mother and her new husband has wounded him deeply – a fact that he tries and fails to hide behind a fusillade of adolescent sarcasm. But Mary’s plight is the rawest, something that Randolph captures brilliantly in the weary dignity of her character’s slow, achingly deliberate movements (she’s a deserved winner of this year’s Golden Globe for best supporting actress and a frontrunner to take the Oscar).
Mary, we learn, only took the job cooking for privileged rich kids who look down on her for her race and class so that her son could attend the school. But while his graduating classmates sailed into university places, her son was forced to serve in the army and was killed in Vietnam. Now every day at work is a reminder of what she has lost, and the prospect of her first Christmas without her child is paralysing. It’s no wonder that she numbs her pain with bourbon every night.
This is Payne’s first period film – the story unfolds over the tail end of 1970 and the beginning of 1971 – and he embraces the era fully, with a retro feel to the design and look of the picture that extends to using vintage production logos in the opening credits. The very specific spirit of 70s American cinema and its idiosyncratic character-driven film-making is evident throughout, not least in writer David Hemingson’s sharp, sophisticated screenplay.
The crisp dialogue is a masterclass in capturing character voices – Paul, for example, has a seemingly bottomless well of insults for his students: they are “rancid little philistines” or “hormonal vulgarians”. Words fail him, however, when he’s confronted with kindness: he practically slams the door in the face of a co-worker who presents him with the gift of Christmas cookies. But many of the film’s most affecting moments are dialogue-free: a wrenchingly sad shot of Mary carefully folding long-treasured baby clothes, her own dreams for the future mothballed and passed on to her pregnant younger sister. It’s a profoundly poignant moment that acknowledges the weight of disappointment Mary carries, while still permitting a glimmer of hope."
W06Q4EVHTI_A2IUB5EITQQHJHD,Loot by Tania James review – imperialism through the eye of a tiger,Stephanie Merritt,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/21/loot-by-tania-james-review-imperialism-through-the-eye-of-a-tiger,"Tania James’s fiction has straddled continents since the publication of her 2009 debut, Atlas of Unknowns. In Loot, her third full-length novel, she brings this transnational perspective to the story of a real-life artefact and the fictional characters drawn into its gravitational pull.
The object in question, known as Tipu’s Tiger, is a wooden automaton commissioned in the 1790s by Tipu Sultan, ruler of the Indian kingdom of Mysore. It currently resides in the V&A and depicts a near-life-size tiger mauling the prone body of a European soldier; machinery inside causes the figures to emit a growl when a crank is turned. The circumstances of the tiger’s origin are lost to us, but – according to an authorial note – its craftsmanship suggests a melding of Indian and French expertise. From these scant details, James conjures a cast of characters whose relationships span 50 years and half the globe.
The novel begins in the palace of Srirangapatna, where are principal characters are Abbas, a 17-year-old woodcarver’s son with a precocious talent, and Lucien Du Leze, a gay, alcoholic French clockmaker unable to return home after the Revolution. Tipu orders them to collaborate on the musical tiger as a gift for his favourite son, but, like every relationship in the novel, this grand gesture of paternal affection is tainted by politics.
Though the automaton is a great success, Abbas does not have long to enjoy his new status in the palace. Before he has even finished his apprenticeship with Du Leze, the British besiege the city, the sultan is killed and Abbas – barely escaping the slaughter – is forced to flee the kingdom. Through a series of picaresque adventures he ends up in Rouen, working for Du Leze’s adopted daughter, Jehanne, his only desire “to create a thing that would outlast him, and for which he would be remembered”. Together they travel to England with a plan to recover the automaton from the widow of Lord Selwyn, the British soldier who looted it after the siege.
Despite the obvious wealth of historical research that underpins the book, from woodcarving techniques to the minutiae of life on board sailing ships, James is not aiming for photographic realism here. This is a novel about the pleasures of artifice and the skills required to imitate life; to this end, the author subtly draws attention to the artificial nature of her own creation by dropping occasional contemporary notes into her historical language. There is a reference to Tipu’s “origin story”; later, an Indian servant, asked what brought him to England, almost replies, “I am here because you were there” – a quotation attributed to the Sri Lankan writer Ambalavaner Sivanandan, who died in 2018.
James makes a virtue of her story’s artifice because the historical setting is a lens through which to examine contemporary debates about the legacy of colonialism, particularly as it relates to plundered treasures. The title is made explicit in the name of a card game Jehanne plays with the elderly and canny Lady Selwyn, but throughout the novel, objects and people are appropriated by the powerful, in a world where “race is the final ranking”. Loot is a vivid and witty reimagining of an episode of history that continues to shape the present, and the ways we think about art, identity and ownership.

W10WR653MP_5D7GBN20Q8AVKVE,Ron DeSantis drops out of Republican presidential race,Martin Pengelly,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/ron-desantis-drops-out-presidential-race,"Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor of Florida, has ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsed Donald Trump.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said in a statement posted on X. “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
DeSantis’s withdrawal in the days ahead of the New Hampshire primary follows a disappointing result in the Iowa caucus, where he finished second place but trailed Donald Trump by a large margin. In New Hampshire, his numbers were far behind former South Carolina governor Haley and Trump.
On Sunday night, Donald Trump set aside months of criticism of DeSantis and celebrated his onetime rival as his newest supporter.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Trump said. “He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.”
“He’s been a good governor and I wish him well,” Haley said at a campaign event on Sunday. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.”
DeSantis’s news was the culmination of a long, agonising decline.
As recently as spring 2023, the former navy lawyer and rightwing congressman was widely seen as the Republican most likely to stop Trump becoming the nominee for a third election running, in large part by attempting to offer harsh Trumpist policies without the attendant drama.
In November 2022, DeSantis cruised past the Democrat Charlie Crist to win a second term in Tallahassee. In his victory speech, he crowed: “We have embraced freedom. We have maintained law and order. We have protected the rights of parents. We have respected our taxpayers and we reject ‘woke’ ideology.”
Referencing Winston Churchill, a near-mythic figure on the American right, he went on: “We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the schools, we fight the woke in the corporations. We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die.”
He received a rapturous reception, supporters with an eye on 2024 chanting “two more years” and the New York Post branding him “DeFuture”, as speculation abounded that Rupert Murdoch was finally set to move on from Trump.
But despite formidable fundraising, a seemingly strong campaign structure, strong polling and a rising Republican star in his wife, Casey DeSantis, after a long run-in to a formal campaign declaration, little went right.
DeSantis’s hard-right agenda ran into trouble as he chose to take on Disney, a dominant employer in Florida, over its opposition to his “don’t say gay” policy regarding LGBTQ+ issues in schools. Generating a string of stories, scandals and lawsuits over book bans in school libraries, the subject continued to dog the campaign.
In May the launch of that campaign, a Twitter Spaces session with Elon Musk, descended into farce as the platform glitched and buckled. The event host, the donor David Sacks, claimed: “We got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.” Few observers agreed.
On the campaign trail in the months that followed, the governor came across as stilted and awkward. For a campaign focused on social media and the influencers who lurk there, the resultant string of mocking memes and threads could not have been in the plan.
Nor could a summer fiasco over bizarre campaign videos, posted to social media and featuring far-right, white supremacist, Nazi and arguably homoerotic imagery. A firing followed but the campaign’s image had taken another big blow, reports of fundraising problems appearing.
There was a scandal over an attempt to change history teaching in state schools, regarding the place of slavery in Florida’s past. There were attempts to troll Democrats on immigration, including sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-run states by bus or plane. That policy ended up in the courts as well.
As the polling gap to Trump grew, and as the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley steadily moved through the field, DeSantis sought ways to fight back.
In November he took the unexpected step of debating a Democrat other than Joe Biden. The Fox News-hosted contest with Gavin Newsom, the California governor, proved little more than a sideshow. Brandishing a map he said showed the spread of “human faeces” on the streets of San Francisco, DeSantis succeeded only in feeding more “poop map” memes.
DeSantis and Haley became more willing to attack Trump as the first vote neared, if still with the gloves kept on, even Trump’s lie about a stolen election in 2020 proving hard to simply disown. In Iowa, DeSantis picked up key nominations from the governor, Kim Reynolds, and evangelical leaders and eventually finished in second. But that still didn’t catapult his campaign into safe New Hampshire territory, and he dropped out before the numbers could prove just how far behind he might be.
Democrats celebrated the news on Sunday.
“As Democrats, we’ve been shouting from the rooftops that his strategy of waging culture wars on the backs of hardworking Floridians just to further his own ambitions was wrong for the state & would be disastrous for the nation,” said Fentrice Driskell, the lead Democrat in the Florida state legislature on Twitter/X.
Sarafina Chitika, spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: “Just like Trump, DeSantis ran a campaign pledging to ban abortion nationwide, rip away access to healthcare, and gut Social Security and Medicare, while embracing election deniers and whitewashing January 6. Whichever candidate wins the race for the Maga base will be left running on the same dangerous and unpopular anti-freedom agenda that voters will reject in November.”
For its part, the New Hampshire electorate did not seem too shaken by his last-minute announcement.
Two hours before an event he had planned in New Hampshire, there were no signs of the DeSantis campaign or his fans at The Farm Bar and Grille. A member of staff said they had found out from news reports that DeSantis wouldn’t be coming and said he had not yet pre-paid for the space.

W2P9EUSW8X_HDB8KJL1IY8ILCP,What are the risks of a nitrogen gas execution?,_,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/what-are-risks-of-nitrogen-gas-execution,"Alabama is preparing to use a new method of execution: nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Smith, who survived the state’s previous attempt to put him to death by lethal injection in 2022, is scheduled to be put to death Thursday by nitrogen hypoxia. If carried out, it would the first new method of execution since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
The state maintains that nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness quickly, but critics have likened the never-used method of execution to human experimentation.
Nitrogen hypoxia execution would cause death by forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen, depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.
No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state – along with Oklahoma and Mississippi – to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find.
Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, makes up 78% of the air inhaled by humans and is harmless when breathed with proper levels of oxygen.
The theory behind nitrogen hypoxia is that changing the composition of the air to 100% nitrogen will cause Smith to lose consciousness and then die from lack of oxygen.
Much of what is recorded in medical journals about death from nitrogen exposure comes from industrial accidents – where nitrogen leaks or mix-ups have killed workers – and suicide attempts.
After Smith is strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber, the state said in a court filing that it will place a “NIOSH-approved type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator” – a type of mask typically used in industrial settings to deliver life-preserving oxygen – over Smith’s face.
The warden will then read the death warrant and ask Smith if he has any last words before activating “the nitrogen hypoxia system” from another room. The nitrogen gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or “five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer”, according to the state protocol.
The state heavily redacted sections of the protocol related to the storage and testing of the gas system.
The Alabama attorney general’s office told a federal judge that the nitrogen gas will “cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes”.
Smith’s attorneys say the state is seeking to make him the “test subject” for a novel execution method.
They have argued that the mask the state plans to use is not air tight and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, possibly leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Experts appointed by the United Nations human rights council earlier this month cautioned that, in their view, the execution method would violate the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia can be an acceptable method of euthanasia under certain conditions for pigs but not for other mammals, because it creates an “anoxic environment that is distressing for some species”.
Not exactly. Some states previously used hydrogen cyanide gas, a lethal gas, for executions. The last prisoner to be executed in a US gas chamber was Walter LaGrand, the second of two German brothers sentenced to death for killing a bank manager in 1982 in southern Arizona. It took LaGrand 18 minutes to die in 1999.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect insurance money.
Alabama attempted to execute Smith in 2022 by lethal injection. He was strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber being prepared for lethal injection, but the state called off the lethal injection when execution team members had difficulty connecting the second of two required intravenous lines to Smith’s veins. Smith was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours, according to his lawyers, as he waited to see if the execution would go forward.
The question of whether the execution can proceed will end up before the US supreme court.
The 11th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments Friday in Smith’s request to block the execution. After the court rules, either side could appeal.
Smith has argued that the state’s proposed procedures violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He has also argued that Alabama violated his due process rights by scheduling the execution when he has pending appeals and that the face mask will interfere with his ability to pray.
In a separate case, Smith is arguing it would violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment for the state to make a second attempt to execute him after he already survived one execution attempt. Lawyers for Smith on Friday asked the US supreme court to stay the execution to consider that question.
Lethal injection is the most commonly used execution method in the United States, but death penalty states have struggled at times to obtain the needed drugs or encountered other problems in connecting intravenous lines.
If the Alabama execution goes forward, other states may seek to start to using nitrogen gas.
If the execution is blocked by the court or botched, it could halt or slow the pursuit of nitrogen gas as an alternative execution method."
WA8BVTCOXX_AQNO8T6JK8LPRX8,Labour MP stirred by disappearing Antarctic ice and her father’s legacy,Rachel Hall,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/21/labour-mp-stirred-by-disappearing-antarctic-ice-and-her-fathers-legacy,"When Anna McMorrin MP visited the Antarctic as part of a government inquiry, she stumbled upon a report in the Rothera Research Station library that her father, a polar researcher, had written in 1962.
It described the Larsen ice shelf, a beautiful stretch of thousands of miles of thick, white, crystalline snow – which has now almost completely melted away.
Her shock at witnessing the change first-hand has reinforced for her the urgency of slowing climate breakdown in Antarctica to prevent a dangerous tipping point that could disrupt ocean currents and weather systems, with catastrophic implications for humanity.
She said: “[The Larsen ice shelf] has just completely melted away and disappeared into the sea. Ice that was there for thousands of years, and it’s gone in the last few decades.
“This was an important trip, because never has there been a more important time to look at the changing Antarctic and its impact on the rest of the world, the melting of the glaciers and the impact that’s having on ocean temperatures, the currents, biodiversity, weather systems. What happens in Antarctica does not stay in Antarctica.”
McMorrin, the Labour MP for Cardiff North, flew to the Falklands just before Christmas, where she was able to hitch a ride on a British Antarctic Survey ship, a science and research vessel named after Sir David Attenborough.
On arrival she found an “incredible continent that’s been totally isolated from the rest of the world”, with unique biodiversity, 24 hours of daylight during its summer and freezing winds that blow in wild storms at a moment’s notice.
Her expedition will feed into the recently launched UK and the Antarctic environment inquiry by the environmental audit sub-committee on polar research, which will look at how British scientific research and climate policy can slow climate breakdown in the Antarctic. The inquiry will soon hold a series of evidence sessions in parliament before publishing a report later in the year.
McMorrin found the trip particularly emotional because her father, Ian McMorrin, worked for the British Antarctic Survey. During his career, he surveyed and mapped the landscape, and he even has a glacier named after him.
Yet McMorrin – herself a former environmental campaigner and climate change adviser in the Welsh government – was as moved by what she did not see as what she did: “The changes that have taken place in those 60 years – it is stark. You are seeing glaciers retreat by huge amounts, hundreds of metres.”
She believes it is important to understand the mechanisms causing this, and the impact it could have on the world’s climate, from floods in the UK to changing weather patterns that have resulted in the Earth’s hottest-ever annual temperature and lethal forest fires around the globe.
A study published last week found that Greenland’s ice cap is losing an average of 30m tonnes of ice an hour due to the climate crisis, 20% more than was previously thought.
McMorrin said: “It’s accelerating, and the worrying thing is we don’t know where that tipping point is – where we can’t reverse it. The only way forward is to ensure we have those stark cuts to carbon emissions, that we’re on this track to net zero, we don’t veer off that, we invest in renewables, we come together globally, meet our carbon commitments.”
The message she wants the general public to receive is that this doesn’t have to be about sacrifice. “It can be a good change, it can lead to more jobs, a better future for everybody, a much more pleasant place to live and more money in your pockets, because it’s an investment in our economy,” she said.
She also wants the public to understand that if they care about slowing climate breakdown, voting for Labour in the next general election is the best way to achieve this.
McMorrin said: “Labour has a plan for this. We are absolutely determined to turn our industries around and invest in decarbonising them.
“I’m not sure it’s understood by the Conservatives, they have a battle on their hands. Rishi Sunak turned back the clock on net zero last September, he slowed things down in terms of targets. That’s not someone who sees hope in the future of net zero, that’s someone who sees it as a problem.”"
WCO2XK01GM_56H7URG5DVF2LXH,British inventor seeks to take $18bn bite out of Apple in bitter patent war,Alex Lawson,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/21/british-inventor-seeks-to-take-18bn-bite-out-of-apple-in-bitter-patent-war,"As a plumbing tycoon, Patrick Racz was used to enduring a deluge. But circumstances led to a very different kind of drenching, sitting in his local park in the rain contemplating the demise of his business during the dotcom crash. “I lost everything. I had young children. I was embarrassed, upset that I’d let my family down. I couldn’t look them in the face,” he recalls.
His nadir came just before the emergence of a patent battle with Apple that would define his life. Nearly two decades on, he remains at loggerheads with the company and the US courts.
He presents an intriguing figure: a credible, established British inventor who first gained wealth and success in the 1980s, but clearly bruised and angry after years of a David v Goliath dogfight that now dominates his online reputation and leaves onlookers questioning whether Racz or Apple is in the right.
Racz was the man behind the Triflow – the world’s first three-way mixer tap. The system took a typical sink mixer and added a extra waterway and valve to supply filtered water alongside hot and cold. A “multimillion-pound” sale in 1998 locked in his gains after expanding the business to sell in 45 countries.
However, he says his second chapter turned sour as his dotcom-era venture – a filesharing and payment tech company – was usurped by Apple’s iTunes store. He claims the US corporation stole his system.
“I went through a period of deep depression,” Racz says, opening up on the emotional toll for the first time. “I’m ashamed to say I hit the bottle. I was totally lost in a haze of time and I couldn’t remember a lot.”
What gave him a “new lease of life” was patents for the tech that were first lodged in 1999 and granted nearly a decade later, teeing up a huge court battle that is still playing out as he targets $18bn in damages.
Apple is no stranger to fighting such patent disputes: a standoff with medical technology company Masimo led to sales of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches being paused in the US before Christmas. Racz has won some of his rounds in court against the company, but there is no guarantee of ultimate victory for either side. The only certainty is that the road ahead will be long, winding and costly.
Racz grew up on a strawberry farm in Jersey and spent his early career in sales. When he sold his tap business, Avilion, he pursued the digital download market, just as Napster upended the music industry with illegal filesharing.
Racz quickly filed for patents for his anti-piracy alternative Smartflash, and accompanying systems to allow payments and secure downloads. He lined up deals with retailers and manufacturers, including Gemplus, a French sim card company. Pop star Britney Spears signed up as a brand ambassador.
But in the fallout from 9/11 and the dotcom crash, Spears and Gemplus pulled out, and Racz says in court that Gemplus – also a partner to Apple – then claimed the product as its own.
His blood boiled as he saw late Apple boss Steve Jobs “soak up the praise” for a series of products marrying hardware and software in the way Racz claims he first devised, starting with iTunes in 2003. After receiving patent approval in 2008, he scored an unlikely victory – landing $533m in damages in 2015 after suing Apple in Texas. It was one of the biggest jury awards to a private inventor, Racz says.
But the court’s decision was later unwound: first hurt by a ruling by the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board that his patents were invalid, and then losing as Apple appealed in the commercial courts. He has since lost his own appeals, but has vowed to fight on. He has faced a sizeable backlash online among Apple supporters in recent years, which even included death threats, emailed by unknown individuals.
“Those things start to sting – when you’re told that your kids should be burned at the stake and that you should be beheaded for what you’re doing. My kid was being bullied – with kids saying: ‘Your dad say he invented this, he didn’t he stole it, Apple invented it. Your dad’s a liar,’” Racz says over coffee in London. Tall, burly and with a short crop of dark hair, he is visibly still riled as he retells his story.
Racz’s latest tussle is with the US Patent Office, which he is suing for refusal to disclose uncensored emails and documents related to his intellectual property. He is attempting to prove that panels of judges were intentionally stacked with ex-lawyers and close supporters of Apple. Racz argues the company has used its “wealth and power” to influence the US patent system.
Approached for comment, Apple pointed to a previous statement, issued in 2015, which said: “Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no US presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented.
“We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.”
Gemplus did not respond to a request for comment.
Away from his legal pursuits, he is a backer of Regent Sounds, a musical instrument shop in central London’s Denmark Street once used by the Rolling Stones as a studio and which engaged in its own tussle with the landlord behind the huge development by media venture Outernet.
His main mission remains telling his story. He’s written Smartflash, an autobiography, and says he has interest from publishers. His friend Simon Morris, the ex-global chief creative officer at Amazon and the man behind Amazon Prime Video, has signed up to sell the rights to a documentary about Racz’s life and is pitching the project to studios.
Meanwhile, Racz remains focused on his legal campaign, which is backed by private investors who would share in any winnings. “They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger – it’s made me even more determined.”"
X4J9W70HPD_GKY203DLNQJJX0T,‘War hurts our hearts’: silent multi-faith peace walk held in London,Emine Sinmaz,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/war-silent-multi-faith-peace-walk-london-israel-gaza,"Without flags, placards or chants, hundreds of people joined a silent multi-faith peace walk in London on Sunday in response to the Israel-Gaza war.
Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus and Buddhists walked side-by-side from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square and back in solidarity with people affected by the conflict in the Middle East.
“War hurts our hearts,” said Rabbi Alexandra Wright, the president of Liberal Judaism and senior rabbi of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, as faith leaders read prayers on the steps of Trafalgar Square before setting off on a one-mile walk alongside non-religious people.
“We pray for those who are still held hostage and for their release from captivity, and for the thousands in Israel and Gaza, who have been displaced from their homes ...
“We pray for peace in the region, for the safe passage of humanitarian aid to all those who need it, for the wisdom and moral courage of world leaders, and for civility here in the UK, and across the west, among those who may find themselves on opposite sides of this conflict.”
She added that the war was “geographically far from us, but … felt even here, like the ground ruptures of an earthquake”.
Her words were echoed by Rehena Harilall, from Plum Village UK, a Buddhist group that organised the walk alongside Quakers in Britain, who warned against the “retaliatory violence” taking place in the UK, where antisemitism and Islamophobia have reportedly grown since the 7 October attacks in Israel.
She said: “Today’s event emerged as a result of the escalating violence in over 30 wars and armed conflicts around the world, exemplified by what is happening between Israel and Palestine; the rising destruction of human life, displacement, hostage taking, unjust detentions [and] the growing retaliatory violence and demonisation of others taking place right here with the rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia.”
Imam Asim Hafiz, an Islamic religious adviser to the Ministry of Defence, also addressed the crowd, saying collective prayer and reflection were needed to establish peace.
Representatives from the Sikh, Quaker, Buddhist, Bahá’í, Jain and Zoroastrian faiths also read prayers during the event coordinated by Together for Humanity and supported by a coalition of charities and community organisations. Gatherings are also planned in Birmingham and Oxford as part of a series of events promoting peace over the next few days.
Laura Marks, who co-founded Nisa-Nashim, a Jewish and Muslim women’s network and one of the organisations involved in the event, was among the hundreds listening in the square.
“The idea behind the movement is to bring unity to a very, very fractured world,” she said.
“The faith communities are particularly fractured in light of the Israel-Gaza conflict so there’s not enough voices saying ‘we need peace, we need harmony’.
“Particularly in Britain, we need to be working together, with antisemitism and Islamophobia spiking at incredible levels, it’s time to get people to come together and keep the conflict off our streets.”
As the diverse group including children and elderly people embarked on the walk, many carried signs saying: “Peace is every step: walking together in silence for non-violence, reconciliation and peace.” The group wore knitted white flowers symbolising peace and included those who were not religious.
Hella Ehlers, 79, from London, said she was agnostic and had joined the walk due to the “dangerous situation” in the world.
“I think it’s time for reflection and I’m sick and tired of the divisive discussions that are going on. What we need to focus on is the human tragedy; it’s not about pro-Israel or pro-Palestine,” she said.
Myles Brown and Nouri, 34-year-olds from London, said they were not religious but wanted to see people come together and find common ground.
Nouri, who did want to give his surname, added: “I came to show ongoing support for peace in Palestine and because of the idea of hate marches pushed by Suella Braverman. It was so easy to see by being in the crowd that people are rarely marching for hate.
“And, secondly, it’s so easy to forget after the really big marches of a few months ago the nature of the conflict, so it’s continuing to come out and show that people here care.”"
XFB862QDDZ_S6GN2VVKEXX7XBN,Sarah Ferguson diagnosed with malignant melanoma,Tom Ambrose,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/21/sarah-ferguson-diagnosed-malignant-melanoma,"The Duchess of York has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of skin cancer months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
A spokesperson for Sarah Ferguson, 64, said medics had removed a mole on her body, which tested as a malignant melanoma, during treatment for her cancer. Doctors are now working to establish whether it was caught early.
“Following her diagnosis with an early form of breast cancer this summer, Sarah, Duchess of York, has now been diagnosed with malignant melanoma,” the spokesperson said. “Her dermatologist asked that several moles were removed and analysed at the same time as the duchess was undergoing reconstructive surgery following her mastectomy, and one of these has been identified as cancerous.”
The spokesperson added that the diagnosis was “distressing” but that she remains in “high spirits”. “She is undergoing further investigations to ensure that this has been caught in the early stages,” they said. “Clearly, another diagnosis so soon after treatment for breast cancer has been distressing, but the duchess remains in good spirits.
“The duchess wants to thank the entire medical team which has supported her, particularly her dermatologist, whose vigilance ensured the illness was detected when it was. She believes her experience underlines the importance of checking the size, shape, colour and texture and emergence of new moles that can be a sign of melanoma.”
Ferguson had surgery last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer and was treated at the private King Edward VII’s hospital in London, which has treated members of the royal family for decades.
The duchess is a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust and spoke at a Breast Cancer Foundation gala in 2019. She visited a clinic in Poland in 2021 to address the issue of women recovering after mastectomies.
The news comes days after King Charles was due to attend hospital for treatment of an enlarged prostate, according to Buckingham Palace.
“In common with thousands of men each year, the king has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate,” the palace said. “His Majesty’s condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure. The king’s public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.”
It is understood that the king was keen to share the details of his diagnosis to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked in line with public health advice. Buckingham Palace is believed to have made the king’s condition public as he had a series of meetings and events that were being postponed on his doctor’s advice.
On the same day, it was announced that his daughter-in-law, the Princess of Wales, was recovering in hospital after undergoing successful planned abdominal surgery, and would remain in hospital for between 10 and 14 days. All her public engagements until Easter have been cancelled."
XM5MUBZFUP_JBV8RDTIOYRR2TW,Igor Levit review – this was a recital where everything was just right,Clive Paget,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/21/igor-levit-review-wigmore-hall-london-brahms-piano,"It is a mark of Igor Levit’s standing that he can sell out the Wigmore Hall weeks in advance with an all-Brahms programme. In the event, some fractious pre-concert jostling for returns seemed almost justified: this was an outstanding evening’s pianism.
When Brahms embarked on a remarkable year of composition in 1892, he was 59 – not especially old – and yet an almost unrelieved melancholy pervades the four sets of late piano pieces, which suggests either an irreparably broken heart or an awareness of his own mortality. (And, in fact, he only had five years to live.) It makes a traversal of these often inward-looking works a special challenge.
Levit does brooding well, his sombre frame drooping over the coffin-black piano in a self-effacing act of concentrated communion. He also does variety. His commanding technique, muscular yet flexible, suited the mood swings of the E-flat Rhapsody that concludes the Four Klavierstücke Op 119, or the hurly-burly of the capriccios that flank the Seven Fantasien Op 116. Mostly though, this was a supremely poetic performance, Levit moving body and soul to convey the spirit of these deeply personal utterances.
Take the mournful sarabande, with its Hungarian inflections underpinning the A minor Intermezzo of Op 116. Levit extracted every drop of beauty over four minutes of unruffled introspection. Here, as throughout, his sense of rubato was bold yet always appropriate. The first of the Three Intermezzi Op 117 – a folkish lullaby with a hint of a Scotch snap – was another jewel. Levit’s touch was deepest velvet, rendering the music peaceful yet simultaneously painful in an infinitely sad sort of a way. Shorn of intrusive theatricality, there was something intensely private about the music-making here. It felt a privilege to eavesdrop.
This was a recital where everything was just right, every phrase considered, every sonority given its proper weight and colour. Equally impressive was how Levit stitched these sometimes disparate pieces together to communicate a convincing architectural whole. When artistic director John Gilhooly came on stage at the end to award him the prestigious Wigmore Medal, rarely can it have felt better deserved."
YAFKOZB8ER_U4E0Z2MEY5JO3LE,Cameron to be asked to clarify claim he took no decision over Israel arms sales,Patrick Wintour,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/david-cameron-clarify-claim-decision-israel-arms-sales,"The chair of the foreign affairs select committee is writing to the foreign secretary, David Cameron, asking him to clarify his claim that he had not taken any formal decision to allow arms sales to Israel to continue amid the Gaza crisis.
Written evidence presented by the UK Department for Business and Trade shows the foreign secretary on 8 December recommended arms sales licences be allowed to continue when presented with three options: stopping arms sales, pausing them, or allowing them to continue.
Foreign Office officials, in papers sent by the foreign secretary, had expressed serious concerns about aspects of the Israeli assault against Hamas. They also said the Foreign Office did not agree with Israeli claims that it did not have a legal duty to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, but only to allow others to provide aid, and that this permission could be conditional.
The business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on 18 December concurred with Lord Cameron’s recommendation that Israel was not in breach of international humanitarian law (IHL) and the arms exports could continue.
At an evidence session on 9 January, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Alicia Kearns, along with other committee members, repeatedly pressed Cameron on whether arms export licences should be stopped on grounds that IHL was being breached by Israel.
The Italian foreign minister at the weekend confirmed Italy blocked all arms exports to Israel as soon as the attacks in Gaza started.
Although Cameron admitted to committee members that he had worries about aspects of the Israeli military campaign, and that advice had been given to him on a rolling basis by officials, he did not disclose – despite twice being asked by the committee chair – whether a formal review took place.
Cameron also said he acted only on the advice of officials, not suggesting he himself made a ministerial decision when faced with options. He said: “My job is not to make a legal adjudication. I am not a lawyer.”
He also initially refused to tell MPs when asked if he had ever received advice saying Israel was in breach of IHL. He later added: “The legal advice I have received is consistent with the fact that we have not changed our export procedures.”
Kearns, a Conservative MP, is writing to the Foreign Office to seek clarification of the decision-making process and to ask whether any of the evidence given needs revision.
The Foreign Office’s internal discussions were revealed in a business department court affidavit including partial extracts from aspects of Foreign Office official papers sent to ministers.
These were presented to the high court in a claim for a judicial review of the continuance of arms sales that has been lodged by Global Legal Action Network, an NGO. To fend off the case, the department is required to show the courts its decision-making process was fair and rational.
The papers show the Export Control Joint Unit launched “a change in circumstances review” in view of Israel’s military campaign inside Gaza, and a parallel review took place in the Ministry of Defence that concluded on 27 November.
The Foreign Office papers said: “Given the paucity of information, the scale and intensity of the conflict, the death toll, the unusual civilian population density coupled with their inability to evacuate and the concomitance mounting effects of the conflict on civilians, [the government’s] current inability to come to a clear assessment on Israel’s record of compliance with IHL poses significant policy risks.”
The Foreign Office then sought and received written assurances from the Israeli embassy, but still wrote to Cameron on 8 December saying it was for him to decide if there was a commitment to comply with IHL.
The paper set out the options and said “that the availability of each of the options turned on the foreign secretary’s assessment of whether there is a clear risk that items would be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of IHL”.
On 12 December, the court document says Cameron “decided that he was satisfied that there was good evidence to support a judgment that Israel is committed to comply with IHL. On the basis of that assessment in particular, the foreign secretary decided to recommend option 1 to the secretary of state for business and trade.”
During his evidence session, the foreign secretary admitted internal discussions had taken place.
He said: “What I have to do is act on the advice that I am given. That advice is based on what we believe is happening, so we ask a whole series of questions of the Israeli government about individual actions that are brought to our attention.
“We receive advice on that, consider that advice, and then pass it on to the department of trade for them to make the decision on arms exports.”"
YNOSFUOKPR_A84TM1HFYJUQWVU,Australia being ‘left behind’ as federal research and development funding sinks to 30-year low,Josh Butler,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/australia-being-left-behind-as-federal-research-and-development-funding-sinks-to-30-year-low,"Australian science has been “left behind” as federal funding for research and development sinks to a 30-year low, a leading technology organisation has warned, with concerns that the shortfall is leaving the nation open to economic shocks and shortages of critical items like vaccines.
Department of Industry, Science and Resources officials confirmed that direct government spending on R&D in 2022-23 was only 0.49% of GDP, “the lowest in the last 30 years”.
Dr Katherine Woodthorpe, the president of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, said federal research funding had been on a “steady decline” for more than a decade under the Coalition, and called on the Albanese government to “align its actions with its commitments” on science, saying further research could help address the cost of living.
“This not only represents a decline in funding, but a missed opportunity for economic growth and technological advancement,” Woodthorpe said. “We see this as a crucial moment for the government to step up and reverse this decline.”

The Morrison government delivered its 2022-23 budget in March 2022, with the Albanese government releasing its updated 2022-23 budget in October that year, after the May election.
The Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering had raised alarm at the research funding in 2022-23 being less than half a per cent of Australia’s GDP. Asked by the Greens senator David Shoebridge about the R&D spending figures in a June budget estimates hearing, industry department officials admitted that funding was down from 2021-22.
In a written response to questions taken on notice, the department confirmed the Australian Academy of Science’s figures that 0.49% of GDP spent on R&D in the 2022-23 financial year was the lowest in the last 30 years, and added that figures for the 2023-24 were still being finalised.
Woodthorpe pointed out that nations like South Korea and Germany spent closer to 3% of GDP on R&D.
“This makes us more vulnerable to economic shocks and more reliant on other countries for essential goods, like vaccines,” she said. “Australia cannot rely on other countries to do our research for us. We need Australians conducting research in Australian conditions to solve Australian problems.
“Australia is being left behind. Australia is already the least complex economy in the developed world and productivity is stagnant.”
Woodthorpe said government funding alone wouldn’t solve the problem. She said the authorities should be looking to create more attractive policy settings and incentives to encourage private investment.
She pointed to a 2022 report from the CSIRO, the chief federal science body, that every dollar invested in R&D returned $3.50 to the wider economy, and that there was a 10% average annual return on investments.
In the report, the CSIRO said attracting investment in Australia “remains a challenge”, citing Bureau of Statistics figures that Australia’s business expenditure on R&D was half the OECD average and that government expenditure in 2022 was at its lowest since 2005.
“Research is the bedrock of future innovations – without adequate funding in fundamental research, Australia risks missing out on breakthroughs like advanced digital technologies and next-generation medical treatments,” Woodthorpe said.
“The cost of living challenges Australia faces today can be alleviated through strategic R&D investments, which are key to long-term economic stability and growth.”
Government sources claimed the funding drop had occurred under the Coalition, and that Labor was looking to address the trend, pointing to R&D benefits they said would flow from policies including the $15bn national reconstruction fund, the $50m Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub, and the $392m industry growth program.
A spokesperson for the science and industry minister, Ed Husic, said the Albanese government was focused on “lifting overall R&D expenditure across all sectors, including government”.
“The government recognises the importance of research and development in powering industry and creating secure long jobs,” they said.
The government also noted that direct federal cash was only one aspect of R&D funding, and that the government was also seeking to foster private investment through tax incentives.
Shoebridge, the Greens’ spokesperson on science, said the government could do more. “Despite all the photo opportunities about STEM and R&D, the funding is steadily being pulled from essential research,” he said. “It’s not good enough to leave this to the private sector and hope for the best, especially when the most recent data on private R&D also shows us going backwards.
“We urgently need publicly funded scientists doing essential research for overall public benefit and a nice social media strategy doesn’t make that happen – funding does.”"
YQIXPBL05U_W77FEVTS633AFJZ,New Hampshire Republican primary: when to expect results and what they can tell us,Joan E Greve,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/new-hampshire-republican-primary-trump-haley-desantis,"New Hampshire voters are headed to the polls on Tuesday. After Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the Iowa caucus last week, his top rival for the Republican nomination – the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley – hopes to make a splash in the critical primary state.
But the Republican primary is not the only contest being held in New Hampshire on Tuesday. New Hampshire Democrats are moving forward with their own primary, one with a major asterisk: Joe Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot as the Democratic National Committee has said that the New Hampshire primary is “meaningless” after party officials moved to make South Carolina the first voting state.
Here is everything you need to know about the New Hampshire primary:
Polls will start closing at 7pm ET, and results will begin coming in shortly after that. In 2020, the first results were reported at roughly 7.30pm ET, but Democratic ballots may take longer to tabulate this year because of the expected large number of write-in votes.
Historically, the Manchester and Concord areas have reported results faster, while northern New Hampshire has been slower to count ballots. The Guardian will have several reporters on the ground in New Hampshire on Tuesday, and our live blog will share results and analysis as polls close, so stay tuned.
New Hampshire will hold the first primary election of the 2024 election cycle, while Iowa held the first caucuses of the Republican nominating contest. In a caucus, each voter is required to appear in person at a specific precinct location to cast a ballot, as the Guardian’s Martin Pengelly explained earlier this month.
A primary is much more straightforward, with polling locations across the state open for a set number of hours to allow voters to cast their ballots. Because of the relative ease of voting and the option for undeclared voters to participate in either party’s primary, New Hampshire generally sees higher turnout than Iowa.
In 2020, roughly 176,000 Iowans participated in the Democratic caucuses, while nearly 300,000 New Hampshire voters participated in the Democratic primary. The turnout gap is particularly notable considering Iowa’s population is more than twice the size of New Hampshire’s.
Two dozen candidates filed the necessary paperwork to appear on the Republican primary ballot in New Hampshire, but the overwhelming majority of votes are expected to be cast for Haley and Trump.
DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, just two days before the primary, after it was clear the downward trajectory of his campaign could not be revived in New Hampshire. He joined other candidates who had ended their presidential bids.
After their disappointing performances in Iowa, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson both dropped out of the Republican primary. Their names will still appear on the ballot, as will the names of other former candidates like the former vice-president Mike Pence and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott.
Yes, but it’s complicated. The Democratic National Committee voted last year to designate South Carolina as the party’s first primary state, while New Hampshire would have the opportunity to vote second.
The decision outraged New Hampshire Democrats, who insist they will not go along with the national party’s plan to rob them of their “first-in-the-nation” status. As a result, the New Hampshire Democratic party decided to hold its primary the same day as the Republican primary, in defiance of the DNC’s decision.
The DNC has criticized the New Hampshire primary as a sham, calling on the state party to “educate the public” that the contest “is a non-binding presidential preference event and is meaningless”. The New Hampshire attorney general, Republican John Formella, in turn sent a cease-and-desist letter to the DNC to compel the organization to stop making “false, deceptive and misleading” claims about the primary.
Because of the standoff, Biden’s name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, although many Democrats still plan to vote for him as a write-in candidate. Other long-shot candidates, including Minnesota congresswoman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson, will appear on the ballot and hope to capitalize on New Hampshire Democrats’ frustration with the change in the voting calendar.
Voters who are registered as a Democrat or a Republican may only vote in their party’s primary, but undeclared voters may choose to participate in either primary. There are already indications that Democrats and independents in New Hampshire plan to participate in the more competitive Republican primary, as thousands of voters changed their registration leading up to the deadline in October.
The presence of independent and Democratic voters in the Republican primary could dramatically affect the results. Haley in particular hopes that she can sway enough of those voters to chip away at Trump’s advantage with more hard-right Republicans.
Polls show that Trump remains well ahead of Haley in New Hampshire, although Haley has significantly narrowed the former president’s lead in recent weeks. According to the FiveThirtyEight average of New Hampshire polls, Trump is about 13 points ahead of Haley, but he was leading by 25 points last month.

Even though she finished third in Iowa, Haley had presumptively made the argument that the primary was “a two-person race” between her and Trump because of DeSantis’s low polling numbers in New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary late next month. After DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, Haley faces a new opportunity to consolidate the support of non-Trump voters and overtake the former president. But as the results of the Iowa caucuses showed, there may not be enough non-Trump voters left in the Republican party for Haley to pull off an upset.
Haley is looking to pick off some of DeSantis’s supporters to boost her performance in New Hampshire, but it seems more likely that those voters will migrate toward Trump’s camp, particularly after DeSantis endorsed the former president on Sunday. Like Trump, DeSantis has embraced the “Make America great again” philosophy, while Haley has called for a “new generational conservative leader” for the Republican party.
Given the political similarities between DeSantis and Trump, most of DeSantis’ supporters appear ready to back the former president. A CNN-University of New Hampshire poll conducted last week showed that 62% of likely Republican primary voters who named DeSantis as their preferred candidate said that Trump would be their second choice, compared towith 30% who said the same of Haley.
New Hampshire is generally whiter, older and wealthier than the rest of the nation. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, 90.5% of New Hampshire’s voting-age residents identify as only white, compared with 67.1% of all American adults who identify as such. Only 1.1% of New Hampshire residents over 18 identify as Black and 3.1% identify as Hispanic, while 12.3% of all American adults identify as Black and 14% identify as Hispanic.
New Hampshire also has a higher share of citizens over the age of 65, with 25% of its adult residents in that age bracket compared with 23.2% of all American adults. The median age of all New Hampshire residents is 43.3, which is older than the 39.0 median age for all Americans.
In terms of household wealth, 7.2% of New Hampshire adults report an income that falls below the poverty level, compared with 11.1% of all Americans whose incomes fall below that level. And while 94.1% of New Hampshire’s adult residents have at least a high school degree, 91.3% of all Americans over 18 can say the same.
Because of the demographics of New Hampshire, a number of critics have challenged the state’s early voting status. In its move to push the New Hampshire primary to a later date, the Democratic National Committee cited the racial diversity of other early states like South Carolina and Nevada to justify their prioritization in the voting calendar.
“This calendar looks like the Democratic Party, and it reflects the diversity of America,” the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, said last year."
YWXXFR882I_BLVY012JCGH7KJ4,Why New Hampshire could be the last chance for Republicans to beat Trump,Adam Gabbatt,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-primary-donald-trump,"Brightly dressed in a red-and-white starry jacket, Melinda Tourangeau was waiting eagerly at Grill 603, a casual diner in small-town New Hampshire, for a US presidential candidate not named Donald Trump.
Tourangeau, 57, who lives in Milford, was “reluctantly forced to vote for Trump” in 2016 and 2020, she said. “I had to leave my morals at the door.”
But this time she is supporting Nikki Haley. “She has gone all over the state to meet people, and when she meets you, and when you meet her, you feel raised, you feel like you’re a better person after you’ve met her. And her platform is brilliant – clear, concise, cogent – and she intends to do everything she says. She’s the right candidate.”
Whether this is a minority view, or indicative of tectonic plates shifting among Republicans in New Hampshire, will be put to the test in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary election. It comes one week after Trump’s record victory over Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and Haley, an ex-US ambassador to the UN, in the Iowa caucuses.
For half the century, no candidate who won both Iowa and New Hampshire has failed to secure their party’s presidential nomination. Victory for Trump here would probably seal the deal and set up a rematch with Democrat Joe Biden in November.
But if Iowa played to Trump’s strengths among evangelical Christians and rural conservatives, New Hampshire is a different proposition. Its voters pride themselves on an independent streak – the state motto is “Live free or die” – and are generally wealthier, more educated and less religious. Both states are about 90% white.
Voters who are registered without a party affiliation make up about 40% of the electorate in New Hampshire and are eligible to cast a Republican primary ballot, which makes them more moderate than in Iowa. New voters can also register at the polls on Tuesday.
For Trump, whose authoritarian language, criminal charges and brash populism play less well among college-educated voters, this represents something of an away game. Even in the Iowa suburbs last week, he won only a third of the votes.
Haley has a more “Republican classic” image – less extreme on issues such as abortion, more hawkish on foreign policy – and has been barnstorming New Hampshire for months. Although her third place finish in Iowa blunted her momentum, and some opinion polls still show Trump well ahead in New Hampshire, others put Haley running neck and neck.
That makes Tuesday a make-or-break moment. EJ Dionne, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said at a panel discussion organised by the thinktank: “There is a road for her but it’s rocky, it’s rutted, it’s narrow and it runs along the edge of a cliff. She has to win New Hampshire, I believe, to have any chance of going on. I don’t think running Trump close in New Hampshire will really cut it any more, especially after running third in Iowa.”
Trump apparently senses the danger and has stepped up his attacks on Haley. At a rally in Concord on Friday, he told supporters: “All you need to know about Nikki Haley is that every corrupt and sinister group we’ve been fighting for the past seven years is on her side … Nikki Haley is backed by the deep state and the military-industrial complex. She’s never seen a war she doesn’t like.”
He has also resorted to his default tactic of using race and ethnicity as a political cudgel. In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump repeatedly referred to Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, as “Nimbra”. She was born as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa but has always gone by her middle name.
Asked about Trump’s false claim that her heritage disqualifies her from running from president, Haley told reporters: “I’ll let people decide what he means by his attacks. What we know is, look, he’s clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums, if he’s spending millions of dollars on TV. He’s insecure, he knows that something’s wrong.”
She has also been returning fire by making a case that, while Trump was the right choice for president in 2016, he is now too old and chaos follows him wherever he goes. She is seeking to thread a needle, appealing to independents as the more acceptable face of the Republican party while not entirely alienating Trump’s “Make America great again” base.
Such calculations have led her into trouble. Last month, when she was asked by a New Hampshire voter about the reason for the civil war, she did not mention slavery in her answer. Last week, in an interview on Fox News, she claimed: “We’ve never been a racist country.”
But even if Haley does pull off a stunning upset, she would then head into less favourable territory next month in Nevada and her home state of South Carolina. It is also difficult for any candidate to compete with the attention-grabbing spectacle of Trump, facing 91 charges across four cases, showing up in courtrooms even as he runs for president.
Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, predicts that he will win the New Hampshire primary. “There are some people who are hoping and praying and wishing that Nikki Haley can overtake him, which would be interesting, but again, fleeting in her success because she will go to South Carolina and lose by 30 points in her own home state. I cannot think of any example in political history where losing in your own home state by double digits has been a momentum booster.”

She added: “Some are looking at New Hampshire and thinking, well, depending on how Trump does, this could be indicative of his weakness in the general election. Perhaps. But there is a certain desire by the political media for a story and the horse race, and they’re looking for anything to write other than the inevitability of Trump, because once that happens, then people may tune out because they’re bored.”
DeSantis got about 21% of the vote in Iowa, 30 points behind Trump’s narrow majority and two points ahead of Haley. He had spent little time in New Hampshire, aware that his mini-Trump persona and joyless campaign were unlikely to gain traction with either the Maga base or independents. On Sunday, he abandoned his campaign entirely and gave his support to Trump, with an eye on another run in 2028.
Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster, told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute thinktank in Washington last week: “His appeal overlaps so much with Donald Trump. Even though he and Donald Trump have sparred a little bit throughout this race, it hasn’t got super nasty. And all of the polling I see, Nikki Haley’s favourables are not great-great but Ron DeSantis’s are still pretty great-great among Republican voters.
“Even though I don’t see a path for him – he’s going to get single digits in New Hampshire and go to South Carolina, I don’t know where this all ends – I do think I can see why he wants to stay in and be relevant as long as he can, because he does have a shot at being able to say: ‘I’m the second place guy if there is an in-case-of-emergency-break-glass situation.’”
Meanwhile Democrats are also holding a primary on Tuesday but Biden is skipping it because the state defies new Democratic rules he advocates. The president will not be on the ballot alongside nearly two dozen candidates but his allies in the state have mounted a campaign to get voters to write in his name. The result will have no bearing on the Democratic nomination but could deal Biden a symbolic blow.
Another tradition missing from the final week in New Hampshire is debates. Haley, angling to frame the primary as a battle between Trump and herself, had suggested that she would debate only if he was on stage. But the former president has skipped every debate so far and paid no price. Two televised debates for the final New Hampshire sprint were duly cancelled.
Indeed, Trump is already campaigning as if he were already in a general election against Biden, focusing his invective on border security and rising prices. At a rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire, this week he told supporters: “Our country is dying … And I stand before you today as the only candidate who is up to the task of saving America.” He promised to “make our country rich as hell again”.
There are also ominous signs of the Republican party coalescing around him, just as it did in 2016. Primary rivals Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota; Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur; and Tim Scott, a senator for South Carolina, all endorsed Trump after dropping out of the race. A constellation of senators, representatives, governors, and former White House and cabinet officials have done likewise, lending his nomination a sense of inevitability.
Back in Milford, despite all the criminal charges and his past conduct towards women, Tourangeau admitted that she would still vote for Trump if he is the Republican nominee come November, not least because of her retirement savings plan.
“I will have the sickest feeling in my stomach as I begrudgingly walk to the polls with my head down, and I will cast a vote for him,” she said. “But it’s only because my 401k will be bursting.”"
ZBFAGBKYHV_9W6O0BJBITNP7NK,Zelenskiy says he expects several new western defence packages soon,_,_,20231222,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/20/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskiy-aid-support,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that he expected a number of new western defence packages for Ukraine to be signed this and next month.
“We are preparing new agreements with partners – strong bilateral agreements,” the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address.
“January and February should bring corresponding results. There are already specific dates when new and strong documents can be expected.”
After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv’s western allies united in providing unprecedented military and other aid to help Zelenskiy defend his country.
But with the war now dragging on towards its third year, little change along the front line in the past 12 months and growing opposition to more aid in the United States, funds and equipment in recent months have been slow coming in.
Zelenskiy did not name the countries with which he hoped to finalise agreements. He has spent weeks on an international diplomatic frenzy trying to secure more political and military support.
He has often repeated that Russia’s increased winter airstrikes and Moscow’s slow but gruelling offensive in Ukraine’s east have underlined the need for more reinforcement of Kyiv’s air and ground defences.
This month, Britain, one of Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, said it would increase its support for Ukraine in the next financial year to £2.5bn ($3.19bn).
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday he would head to Ukraine in February to finalise a bilateral security guarantee deal under which Paris would deliver more sophisticated weaponry, including long-range cruise missiles."
ZLBVLPQ0W7_TPUHOOLW3BI5W3V,‘Angel or antichrist’: Russia grapples with Lenin’s legacy 100 years after death,Andrew Roth,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/angel-or-antichrist-russia-grapples-with-lenins-legacy-100-years-after-death,"Sunday’s centenary of the death of Vladimir Lenin, one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century, will largely go uncelebrated in his home country of Russia this weekend, where the revolutionary leader stands accused of laying a “timebomb” underneath Russia and Ukraine that has exploded in the past decade.
There will be no parades or stirring speeches in Red Square. The obvious reason is that one of Lenin’s most strident critics is Vladimir Putin, who appears far more enamoured with the empire that Lenin’s revolutionaries overthrew.
Often portrayed in official Soviet culture as a grandfatherly, nurturing figure who ushered in the revolution of 1917, Lenin’s legacy is being repainted in darker hues, despite some pleas for the issue to be put to rest, both rhetorically and corporeally.
“In my opinion, the 100th anniversary of Lenin’s death creates an opportunity to try to move away from the endless passionate and meaningless bickering around the dilemma: is he an angel from heaven or a monstrous antichrist, the embodiment of absolute world evil?” said Vladimir Lukin, a Russian senator who formerly served as a human rights commissioner. But, he added: “Whether it will be used is another question.”
Putin appears to be unable to do either. He cannot stop talking about Lenin, nor is he ready to bury his body, which is embalmed in his Red Square mausoleum (the cost of preserving the waxy corpse was £140,000 a year in 2016). A third of Russians believe that the body of Lenin should be laid to rest as quickly as possible, according to a new survey by the VTsIOM pollster, but the question is viewed as so inflammatory that Lenin remains on public display, perhaps for another century to come.
“I believe we should be very careful here, so as not to take any steps that would divide our society. We need to unite it,” Putin told pro-Kremlin activists in 2016 on whether to bury Lenin. Rumoured plans to remove his body in 2024 were abandoned.
Once the lodestar of international revolutionary movements, Lenin’s influence has waned in the century since his death as his role in creating conditions for the brutal Communist dictatorship that emerged from the 1917 Russian revolution became ever more stark.
“I’m still undecided about Lenin’s heritage and his inheritance in the sense of what it means today,” said Christopher Read, a professor of history at Warwick University, who has written a biography of Lenin as well as the new Lenin Lives?, a review of his life and ideas. On the one hand, he said, the Chinese and other ruling Communist parties still trace their heritage back to Leninism. “But the idea that there’s a Leninist toolkit that radicals could reach into is probably inapplicable these days,” he added.
His international appeal in the west was strongest directly after the revolution until the events of 1956, when the brutality of his successor, Joseph Stalin, was denounced by the then Soviet Communist party leader, Nikita Khrushchev.
“What attracted people to Leninism was basically his anti-imperialism – the Soviet Union for better or worse was the most solid starting point for any anti-imperialist movement at that time,” said Read. “That’s why so many intellectuals, certainly mistakenly, had the idea that somehow Stalin’s Russia in the 1930s was the great new civilisation.”
Lenin’s influence on modern politics may be most keenly felt in China, where his vision of the party-state led by an ideological vanguard has become a political reality. Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist party, studied Marxist theory and ideological education at Tsinghua University from the late 1990s when he was a senior official in Fujian province. When he assumed power in 2012, he soon gave a speech to party officials in which he called on them to “practise core socialist values”, including Marxism-Leninism.
Not so in Russia, where Lenin has been roundly denounced and recast as a villain by Putin. In speeches dating back to 2016, Putin has blamed Lenin for appeasing nationalists and drawing faultlines into the Soviet system, creating national republics that would later have the right to secede from the Soviet Union. “What was this if not a timebomb?” he asked.
Lenin’s recognition that Ukrainians and Russians should live in different states, as well as his insistence that the industrial Donbas region remain in the Ukrainian republic, helped to bring Ukraine back into the fold after declaring independence in 1918, noted Serhii Plokhy , a professor of history at Harvard University. “But the price he paid for doing so seems excessive to present-day Russian opinion makers.”
In Ukraine, the countless city squares and statues named for Lenin before 2014 were seen as a relic of Russian colonialism, and the country in 2015 launched a broad campaign of decommunisation, taking down thousands of monuments and renaming tens of thousands of streets and squares, and sometimes whole towns and villages.
The ubiquitous statues of Lenin were a particular target - more than 1,300 were removed by 2016. When crowds in the city of Kharkiv managed to pull down a statue of Lenin, the tallest in the world at 8.5 metres, the regional government was forced to backdate an order for its removal after believing the crowds could not topple the statue. They were proven wrong.
Putin, announcing the most important decision of his presidency, the launch of the full-scale war in Ukraine, mentioned Lenin 11 times, as he angrily accused him of appeasing nationalists and of creating “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine”, which includes lands Russia has now occupied in the east and south.
“You want decommunisation?” Putin said angrily in a speech just days before he launched the invasion. “Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunisation would mean for Ukraine.”
Yet even for some among the pro-Kremlin conservatives fighting in Ukraine, there is a nostalgia for Lenin as a powerful historical figure.
“The centenary of Lenin’s passing is being hushed up because he remains extremely pertinent, because Lenin is here, Lenin is alive, Lenin is at the forefront of a new world reconstruction,” wrote Zakhar Prilepin, a pro-Kremlin writer and paramilitary leader. “Every thinking Russian is proud that we had Lenin, that we have Lenin.”"
ZR1X55P8OR_AICUAXK0TA96PPR,"Israel’s actions in Gaza are not genocide, says UK’s chief rabbi",Alexandra Topping,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/israel-actions-gaza-not-genocide-uk-chief-rabbi-sir-ephraim-mirvis,"The chief rabbi has said using the word “genocide” to describe Israel’s actions in Gaza is an “increasingly frequent, disingenuous misappropriation of the term”.
Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the use of the term was a “moral inversion, which undermines the memory of the worst crimes in human history” and was designed to “tear open the still gaping wound of the Holocaust”.
Earlier this month the UN international court of justice in The Hague heard that Israel had shown “chilling” and “incontrovertible” intent to commit genocide in Gaza. South Africa, which has brought the case, alleged “grave violence and genocidal acts” by the country. Israel has described the case as baseless, and accused South Africa of presenting a “profoundly distorted” view of hostilities, “barely distinguishable” from that of Hamas.
Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mirvis, who was born and educated in South Africa, argued that Israel was not intent on “the purposeful annihilation of a people as an objective in and of itself”, but was risking its soldiers in ground operations and securing humanitarian corridors.
He added: “It should be obvious that if Israel’s objectives were genocidal, it could have used its military strength to level Gaza in a matter of days.”
Before commemorations of Holocaust Memorial Day next Saturday, the chief rabbi said the use of “genocide” to describe Israel’s action was an affront to victims and the survivors of genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur and the Holocaust.
“It is a term deployed not only to eradicate any notion that Israel has a responsibility to protect its citizens, but also to tear open the still gaping wound of the Holocaust, knowing that it will inflict more pain than any other accusation,” wrote Mirvis. “It is a moral inversion, which undermines the memory of the worst crimes in human history.”
A total of 25,000 people, about 1% of Gaza’s population, have been killed and tens of thousands of buildings have been destroyed since the 7 October attacks by Hamas and other militants. The Hamas-led attacks killed about 1,200 people and 240 were taken hostage, while evidence has emerged pointing to the systematic use of rape and sexual violence in the attacks.
Last month Human Rights Watch said the Israeli government was using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the Gaza Strip; Amnesty International has pointed to airstrikes on a Greek Orthodox church sheltering 18 civilians and attacks on homes in Nuseirat refugee camp that killed 28 civilians as examples of mass killing.
On Sunday the Scottish first minister, Humza Yousaf, whose mother-in-law and father-in-law were trapped in the Middle East region for several weeks while visiting family, accused political leaders of viewing Palestinian blood as “cheap” as he criticised a lack of support for citizens in Gaza.

Mirvis argued that the war “would end tomorrow if Hamas released Israel’s hostages and laid down its weapons”, which should “preclude any allegation of genocide”.
He added that “no decent person could be unmoved by the tragic suffering of innocent Palestinians” calling a debate about minimising suffering “vital”. But he argued that “if there is indeed a genocidal force in this conflict, it must surely be Hamas”, writing: “It is the leaders of Hamas who have made it clear that they will repeat their atrocities ‘again and again’ and whose founding charter makes it clear that killing Jews is among its very reasons for existing.”
He concluded by calling for more “sober and honest” discourse around the conflict, adding: “The destructive and manufactured hyperbole, which reaches its nadir with the accusation of genocide, can only harm the cause of peace.”"

The small regional town of Paraburdoo, roughly 1,500km north of Perth, was forecast to hit 48C on Sunday after reportedly reaching 47.9C on Saturday. Bureau of Meteorology measurements showed temperatures had reached 45.8C as of noon on Sunday.
The BoM’s Dean Narramore said WA’s Pilbara region was looking at severe-to-extreme heatwave conditions, with temperatures of 48C to 49C expected.
“We could even see 50C around the Pilbara, but whether that hits one of our official observation stations, is not certain,” he said.
Those conditions mean large parts of the mainland are going to be subject to low-intensity heatwave conditions, Narramore said.
The hottest Australian temperature ever recorded was 50.7C in the Pilbara town of Onslow on 13 January 2023.
On the east coast, Sydney sweltered through its hottest day of the year with temperatures in several areas climbing above 37C and Holsworthy airbase reaching 38.5C as of 3pm.
Sydney was initially forecast to reach 40C in parts of the western suburbs before a cool change from the south was expected to lower temperatures heading into Monday.

As a result of the delay, first reported by the Times, the Home Office has resorted to paying for boats from the private sector.
A “procurement pipeline” document published on the department’s website shows that it has tendered a contract for “charter of vessel(s) to support small boats operations in the Dover Straits”.
The contract is due to run from 1 April this year until 31 March 2025, but the service provider is listed as “not set”.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “All commercial contracts are in line with government procurement rules which are designed to ensure the best value for taxpayers. We closely monitor contractor performance, including financial results.”
Rishi Sunak unveiled plans to replace Border Force vessels in 2021 when he was chancellor, promising new cutters to improve the safety of Britain’s borders. He said the current fleet would be retired and that 11 new vessels would come into service.
In a Treasury statement at the time, Sunak said: “Protecting our borders and making it easier for us all to travel to and from our great nation is at the heart of our ambitions as a government.”
The delays in procuring new vessels could damage Border Force’s ability to monitor the Channel and to rescue asylum seekers crossing from France in small boats who get into trouble."
