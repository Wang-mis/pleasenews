Last month, a New York jury found Jonathan Majors guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend, British choreographer Grace Jabbari.
In his first interview since his conviction, the Marvel actor says he was ""shocked"" by the verdict and plans to appeal the decision."
QRNNKHWMZ9-1,Turkey detains 34 on suspicion of spying for Israel,By Paul Kirby,2 January,20240102,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67861377,"Turkey says it has seized 34 people who are alleged to have been involved in spying and planning abductions for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.
Officials said 57 addresses were raided in Istanbul and elsewhere and they were still searching for 12 more suspects.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, but relations between the two countries have declined dramatically during Israel's war with Hamas.
Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya shared video of Operation Mole taking place.
He said authorities had moved in after they had decided that Israeli intelligence was seeking to carry out ""tactical tasks such as reconnaissance, pursuit, assault, and kidnapping against foreign nationals residing in our country"".
Although he made no reference to Hamas, Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued a warning last month to Israel that it would be ""doomed to pay a heavy price"" if it tried to assassinate members of Hamas on Turkish soil.
Unlike the UK, US and EU, Turkey does not categorise Hamas as a terrorist organisation and for years has maintained ties with its leadership, hosting some of its members on Turkish soil.
President Erdogan has even described Hamas militants as ""liberators who protect their land"".
In November, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant made clear that they would target Hamas chiefs wherever they were.
An undated recording was broadcast in Israel days later in which the head of Shin Bet domestic security, Ronen Bar, was heard saying the cabinet had set the agency the goal of eliminating Hamas.
""We will do this everywhere, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar. It will take a few years but we will be there to do it,"" he was quoted as saying.
The death of Hamas's deputy political leader in Lebanon, Saleh al-Arouri, in an explosion in Beirut on Tuesday was immediately blamed on Israel by Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.
Video of some of the Turkish raids posted by the interior minister showed police bursting into people's flats, handcuffing suspects and putting them into police cars.
However, this is not the first time Turkish officials have highlighted operations targeting purported Mossad agents.
In 2022, dozens of people were arrested on suspicion of spying on Palestinian citizens. Then last July, Turkey's MIT intelligence agency named seven suspects it said had confessed to working for Mossad.
Turkish popular and political opinion is broadly behind the Palestinians and a big anti-Israel rally took place in the heart of Istanbul on Monday.

9OO59MSFRK-2,Walt Disney - how Ireland shaped an American icon,Amy Murray,2 January 2024,20240102,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p4x6644q5o,"Walt Disney turned to Irish stories as inspiration for his film Darby O'Gill and the Little People
At a glance
Walt Disney was an all-American icon, but how much do you know about his Irish roots?
Disney 100 historian Paula Sigman-Lowery  tells BBC News NI about how his ancestors spent centuries in County Kilkenny before emigrating to north America
Traces of his family can still be found in Ireland with County Cork's own 'Disney Castle'
The title of Walt Disney's definitive biography describes him as An American Original but how much do you know about his Irish roots?
The Disney name was quite common on the island of Ireland in and around the 1600s to the 1800s.
Before Walt, some relatively well-known Disneys carried the name in Ireland, including a dean of Armagh Cathedral.
In fact, remnants of Disneys from the past can still be found in some graveyards in Northern Ireland, such as St Mark's Parish Church in Armagh.
While no known link to the American icon has been found in Armagh, just three hours drive away in Kilkenny there is a rich family history dating to the early 1600s.
Travel a little further and you can even find Ireland's own Disney Castle.
An old headstone in the graveyard of St Mark's Parish Church bares the name Disney
""The Disney family history starts in France, with a little detour into England and then landing in Ireland,"" explained Paula Sigman-Lowery, a historian who has spent her career looking into the history of the company and the life of its namesake.
Her work has culminated in Disney100: The Exhibition, a celebration of the centenary of the Walt Disney Company.
The D'Isgny name was anglicised to Disney when the family moved to England in the 11th century.
In the 1600s Walt Disney's direct ancestors moved on to settle in Ireland, where they remained for two centuries.
Mrs Sigman-Lowery said the Disney family had a relatively comfortable life in Ireland, judging by the earliest records connected to them.
Paula Sigman-Lowery is one of the names behind Disney100: The Exhibition in London
A lease document for 122 acres of land from July 1792 paints a picture that sounds as if it was taken directly from one of Disney's classic films.
""They were described as including a large and roomy house called Sweethill and a freshwater spring,"" she said.
""This was in a 'highly improved' area of County Kilkenny.""
The winds changed for some members of the Disney family in 1834.
Walt Disney's paternal grandparents, Mary Richardson and Kepple Elias Disney, emigrated to North America as children with their families.
Their eldest son Elias Disney, would go on to father Walt and Roy, the co-founders of the Walt Disney Company.
Both boys grew up hearing tales of the old country.
""Although Walt was born in Chicago, fully American, he was very close to his Irish roots,"" said Paula Sigman-Lowery.
""[Walt] loved hearing literature and fairy stories read to him by his mother when he was a child, and the Irish stories really, really resonated with him.""
He would revisit those stories later in life.
During the 1940s and 1950s, he made a number trips to the Republic of Ireland with his family while conducting research for the film Darby O'Gill and the Little People.
Walt celebrated the premiere of Darby O'Gill and the Little People in Dublin
In 1959, while in Dublin for the premiere of the movie, he and his wife took a little bit of Ireland back to the United States with them.
""[They] bought each other traditional Claddagh rings to represent their love for each other,"" said Mrs Sigman-Lowery.
The ring features a heart to represent love, a crown for loyalty and two clasped hands to depict friendship.
""He wore the Claddagh ring for the rest of his life.""

Walt Disney would go on to make more Irish-inspired movies, such as The Fighting Prince of Donegal, based on the life of Red Hugh O'Donnell.
The last live-action movie he produced, The Happiest Millionaire, opens with a young Irishman who has just arrived in America.
He sings a song called I'll Always Be Irish, a melody which Mrs Sigman-Lowery said Disney was very fond of.
""That story of someone coming over to America, a land of opportunity, from the old country and becoming successful - it was very personal story to Walter, even though he was born in America,"" she said.
""This is the story of his family.""
Ireland's Disney Castle was bought by Roy E Disney in 1989
In 1989 Ireland would get its own Disney castle.
That was when Roy E Disney bought Coolmain Castle in County Cork.
The former senior executive of the Disney Company, who was also Walt Disney's nephew, took great interest in his family's history.
He travelled to Ireland on numerous occasions to track down his ancestors, some of which he found in Clonmesh graveyard in Ballyloo, County Carlow.
The 18th century mansion was also used often for family holidays.
Road signs in Ballyloo, County Carlow, point tourists to Clonmesh graveyard where Walt Disney's ancestors are buried
Kilkenny historian and tour guide Frank Kavanagh remembered Roy E Disney's trips.
""He came to Ireland quite regularly,"" he said.
""He always took part in the yacht races down there. But we're Irish - we don't make a big deal of these things.
""We just said: 'Ah yeah, we know Mr Disney. He's a nice guy.'""
Roy E Disney was a senior executive for the Walt Disney Company, which was co-founded by his father Roy Disney
Mr Kavanagh said that despite their French origins, the Disney family were Irish through and through.
""You could just say they came from France and forget everything in between but the whole family as they are today started out in Kilkenny,"" he continued.
""They went from being lords in the 14th Century, to failed invaders in England, through the various tortures that went on, becoming Irish immigrants.
""It's a story in itself. It's everything that you'd expect from the Disney family - creative magic."""
U93DDYXNPZ-3,What is behind Turkey's staunch support for Hamas in Gaza?,By Ece Goksedef,2 January,20240102,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67861266,"On the first day of the year, tens of thousands of Turks poured on to the streets of Istanbul, chanting ""Murderer Israel, get out of Palestine"".
It was not the first massive pro-Palestinian rally in Turkey since the start of Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.
But Monday's mass protest followed incendiary remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Since he first came to power more than 20 years ago, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas.
But even by Mr Erdogan's standards, the rhetoric was extreme. What Israel's prime minister was doing in Gaza, he said, ""is not any less than what Hitler did"".
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying ""Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us"".
Mr Erdogan has made comparisons with Nazi Germany in the past, but the current war of words has put into sharp focus just how bitter Turkish-Israeli relations have become, just months after a significant upturn.
In the latest broadside against Israel, Turkey announced on Tuesday that it had detained 33 people suspected of working for Israeli intelligence service Mossad in raids across eight provinces.
The operation, carried out with Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, followed reports that Israel intended to hunt down members of Hamas abroad, including in Turkey.
Turkey has stepped up support for Gaza since 7 October, for example bringing dozens of patients from Gaza to Turkey for treatment. Turkey's health minister himself accompanied the casualties en route from Egypt.
When Hamas attacked Israel, Mr Erdogan used relatively measured language, urging both sides to remain calm. But as Israel's military response intensified, his rhetoric became increasingly fierce, calling Hamas ""freedom fighters"" and Israel's actions ""genocide"".
This hostility to Israel plays to President Erdogan's support base in Turkey, says Helin Sari Ertem, Associate Professor of International Relations at Istanbul Medeniyet University.
""Palestine has long been a cause for Turkey and the Turkish people, covering almost all political tendencies,"" she says. ""Consequently, it is not possible for Turkish governments to consider the Palestine-Israeli conflict only as a foreign policy issue; as it definitely is a game-changer in domestic politics.""
In the second half of the 20th Century, Israel and Turkey enjoyed close economic and strategic relationships. Turkey was also the first country in the region to formally recognise Israel after it was founded.
But it was not long after Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to office in 2002 that relations with Israel deteriorated while those with Hamas improved. In 2006, then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal visited Turkey following an invitation from Mr Erdogan. Hamas had by then been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US and the EU, amongst others.
The first diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey played out before a world audience when in 2009, Mr Erdogan stormed out of a meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos after a clash with Israel's then-President Shimon Peres over Israeli air strikes in Gaza.
The Turkish leader vowed to never go back to Davos - and he has not returned since.
But just a year later tensions reached breaking point when a ship, the Mavi Marmara, sailed from Istanbul to Gaza leading a flotilla of boats carrying volunteers and humanitarian aid to challenge Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.
When the Mavi Marmara refused to halt, Israeli commandos raided it in international waters and 10 Turkish citizens on board were killed in ensuing clashes. The incident led Turkey to suspend diplomatic relations with Israel for several years.
According to Ms Sari Ertem, Turkey's pivot away from Israel and towards the Palestinians is due to the conservative and pro-Islamic grassroots of Mr Erdogan's AKP party.
While Mr Erdogan's support for the Palestinians is sincere, she says it also aimed at calming down the conservative-nationalist political groups, which did not see sufficient reaction from the AKP in the first days of the war.
The head of the main opposition Republican People's Party in Turkey, Ozgur Ozel, called on the international community to act for Gaza, and the leader of the second biggest opposition party, Meral Aksener, has branded the Israeli prime minister a ""terrorist"".
However, this support for Hamas has come at a cost for Turkey.
Turkey's frayed relationship with Israel was restored only last year and then, within months of both countries reappointing their ambassadors, the war erupted. Turkey recalled its ambassador, and Israel's envoy returned out of security concerns.
Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based geopolitical risk consultancy, says President Erdogan is unlikely to change path.
""He has his domestic supporters and constituents, and he can't ignore such pressure coming from within Turkey and his base,"" Mr Cafiero argues.
He also says the president cannot ignore his desire to be considered as a strong Muslim leader.
""Erdogan is a respected head of state throughout the wider Islamic world, and he has regional and international supporters, too.""
Despite the rupture between the two countries, Ms SarÄ± Ertem believes it will not be too damaging.
""The anti-Israeli discourse, which becomes very much visible especially at times of serious civilian casualties caused by Israel on the Palestinian side, rarely disrupts the traditional Turkish foreign policy approach, which favours a balancing act,"" she says.
""It has always continued its relations with Israel at least economically, if not politically. Turkish-Israeli relations have proved to be quite resilient despite all the ups and downs during history.""
Correction 4 January 2024: This article has been amended to make clear that the Mavi Mamara boat was leading a flotilla of boats carrying aid, rather than carrying aid itself."
G382GLD5BJ-4,Ukraine war: US says Russia using North Korea ballistic missiles,_,5 days ago,20240104,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67888793,"Russia has used ballistic missiles and launchers supplied by North Korea in its war on Ukraine, the US has said.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called it a ""significant and concerning escalation"" relating to Pyongyang's support for Russia.
He said the US would raise the matter at the UN Security Council and impose additional sanctions on those working to facilitate arms transfers.
Moscow has denied any such collaboration.
Hours after the White House made the accusations, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for missile launch vehicle production to be expanded in the country.
The North Korean leader visited Russia to discuss potential military co-operation in September.
The US has previously accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons, but this is the first time US intelligence has shared details about ballistic missiles - self-guided rockets that can reach targets 900km (500 miles) away.
It is unclear what North Korea will get in return for providing the weapons to Russia. Some Western countries have raised concerns over the potential transfer of weapons or military technologies to Pyongyang.
In 2017, a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank suggested that North Korea was able to quickly develop new missiles by obtaining a Soviet RD-250 rocket engine from illicit channels operating in Russia or Ukraine. Ukraine denied the allegation and said Russia was to blame.
But that year, North Korea was able to rapidly expand its missile arsenal, introducing two new systems: the medium-range Hwasong-12 and the intercontinental Hwasong-14.
Speaking during a White House press briefing on Thursday, Mr Kirby said Russia's procurement of ballistic missiles from North Korea was a direct violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions.
""We will demand that Russia be held accountable for yet again violating its international obligations,"" he said.
He also said the US believed Russia was planning on purchasing close-range missiles from Iran, but that it had not done so yet.
The UK said it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's use of ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea in Ukraine.
""North Korea is subject to a robust sanctions regime, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,"" a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.
In his briefing, Mr Kirby also urged US Congress to approve extra US funding for Ukraine ""without delay"".
""The most effective response to Russia's horrific violence against the Ukrainian people is to continue to provide Ukraine with vital air defence capabilities and other types of military equipment,"" he said.
""Iran and the DPRK [North Korea] are standing with Russia. Ukrainians deserve to know that the American people and this government will continue to stand with them.""
The last US military aid package to Ukraine, worth some $250m (Â£195m), was approved by the White House on 27 December.
Talks on further funding have stalled in Congress because of a lack of support among Republicans, who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal.
Ukraine has warned that its war effort and the country's public finances are at risk if further Western aid does not come soon.

PV3Z0JKSU2-5,FDA approves Florida's request to import cheaper drugs from Canada,By Brandon Livesay,5 days ago,20240105,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67884838,"The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Florida's request to import prescription drugs from Canada to rein in drug prices in the state.
Medicines in Canada can be nearly half the price of US counterparts and some drugs cost almost $400 a pill in Florida.
The FDA's decision could open the door for other states to follow suit.
The major policy shift overrides decades of opposition from the US pharmaceutical industry.
The industry's major lobbying group has already indicated it will try to intervene.
Florida estimates the programme, which allows the import of certain prescription drugs used to treat conditions such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and mental illness, will save state taxpayers up to $150m (Â£118m) a year.
The sky-high costs of prescription drugs have been an ongoing political issue in the US, where prices are among the highest in the world.
According to a report by the OECD group of industrialised nations, the US spends more than double the average amount spent by other member countries on prescription medicines per capita.
For example, where the UK paid approximately Â£246 ($314) per head in 2023, the US paid $1,139.
In a statement announcing the FDA's authorisation, Commissioner Robert Califf said the administration would continue to work with states and Indian tribes on these  proposals.
""These proposals must demonstrate the programmes would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" he said.
Florida's approval does come with requirements, including how the drugs are labelled and ensuring they meet FDA specifications and standards.
The state's health care administration will need to submit quarterly reports to the FDA that outlines cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
There will also be restrictions on who can access the imported drugs.
The FDA's decision comes after President Joe Biden's executive order in 2021 - which directed federal agencies to work with states on lowering costs through importation plans.
An online statement published on Thursday from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America President and CEO Stephen J Ubl said the FDA's decision was ""reckless"".
He said his organisation would consider ""all options for preventing this policy from harming patients"".
It is not known how Canada's healthcare system will react to Florida's plan, but it could stoke fears of drug shortages for its own citizens.
Canada banned the export of some prescription medicines in 2020 to prevent a shortage in the country after then-US President Donald Trump proposed a plan to import drugs from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans.

Watch: 'Trip from hell': On board flight during mid-air blow out
Alaska Airlines says it has returned some of its grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 jets to service after one of its planes lost a section of fuselage mid-flight.
The airline apologised to those affected, saying an inspection found ""no concerning findings"".
On Friday one of its planes had to make an emergency landing in the US state of Oregon after an outer section of the plane fell off.
The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely in Portland.
Boeing said it was aware of the incident and was ""working to gather more information"".
The UK Civil Aviation Authority told the BBC it was ""monitoring the situation very closely"".
Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: ""There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped.
""They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it.""
Diego Murillo said the gap was ""as wide as a refrigerator"".
Fellow passenger Elizabeth Lee added: ""Part of the plane was missing and the wind was just extremely loud. but everyone was in their seats and had their belt on.""
Jessica Montoia described the flight as a ""trip from hell"" adding a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind.

Listen: Alaska flight's distress call to air traffic control
Announcing the initial grounding of 65 planes, Alaska Airlines' CEO Ben Minicucci said: ""Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections.""
A later statement said that more than a quarter of those plans had been inspected and would return to service as there were no issues found.
The flight to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data.
Images sent to news outlets show the night sky visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen.
Other pictures show the seat closest to the affected section, a window seat that passengers said was unoccupied, leaning forward without its cushion.
""My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,"" Mr Minicucci said. ""I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants.""
In an audio clip, the pilot can be heard talking to air traffic control requesting a diversion.
""We are an emergency,"" she said. ""We are depressurised, we do need to return back.""
According to photographs, the affected area was in the back third of the plane, behind the wing and engines.
The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators, but not by Alaska.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 ""returned safely... after the crew reported a pressurisation issue"".
Boeing said a ""technical team stands ready to support the investigation"".
Flydubai told the BBC that its three Boeing 737 Max 9 had a ""different configuration with mid-aft cabin exits"" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks.
""We will follow any guidance issued by Boeing once more information is available,"" a spokeswoman added.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident.
The Boeing 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues.
The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board.
Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had a ""very good safety record"".
""While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,"" he told BBC News.
""But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet""
More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory, Reuters news agency reported.
About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows.
Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.

SR7RHKX6KU-7,Flights cancelled as regulator grounds Boeing 737 Max 9s over blowout,By Thomas Mackintosh,3 days ago,20240107,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67905336,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'Trip from hell': On board flight during mid-air blow out
Thousands of passengers face flight cancellations after major US airlines grounded dozens of Boeing jets after a mid-flight blowout over Oregon.
The US aviation regulator said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9s must be grounded for checks after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday.
Alaska said flight disruptions are expected to last into next week. United Airlines has grounded 79 planes.
Disruptions are likely to primarily affect flights in the US.
It follows regulator the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordering ""immediate inspections"" of 737 Max 9s worldwide.
Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is following the FAA approach, but flight disruptions on the continent are expected to be minimal.
EASA said it believes no European airlines operate Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order.
One of the world's largest intercontinental airports, London Heathrow, said there was no impact on flights.
The bulk of the affected planes are owned by US airlines. United Airlines has grounded all 79 of its Max 9 planes.
Alaska said it cancelled 160 flights on Saturday, affecting about 23,000 passengers.
Other airlines which also fly the planes have temporarily taken them out of service.
Boeing said it welcomed the FAA's decision, adding its teams were in close contact with the regulator.
During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data.
Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off.
Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen.
One passenger said the gap was ""as wide as a refrigerator"" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing.

Listen: Alaska flight's distress call to air traffic control
The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously.
""My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,"" Alaska's CEO Ben Minicucci said after the firm volunteered to ground 65 of its 737 Max 9 planes.
""I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants,"" he added.
Alaska later said that, as of Saturday afternoon, it had cancelled 160 flights.
The airline said on Saturday that 18 of its Max 9 planes - about a quarter - had received ""in-depth inspections as part of heavy maintenance checks"" and were returned to service, but following the FAA's orders these have since been ""pulled from service"".
""We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service,"" Alaska said in a statement.
It added: ""The aircraft involved in flight 1282 was delivered to us on 31 October. The part of the aircraft involved in this event is called a plug door - a specific panel of the fuselage near the rear of the aircraft.""
The rear mid-cabin exit door is used in dense seating configurations on some Max 9 planes to meet evacuation requirements, but is ""plugged"" on other planes, including the Alaska flight.
United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 737 Max 9 planes.
Removing some of its aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement.
Turkish Airlines has grounded five of its 737 Max 9s.
Flydubai said its three 737 Max 9s were not affected as they had a ""different configuration"" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks.
British regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said there are no registered Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in the UK and therefore the impact would be ""minimal"".
""We have written to all non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask for confirmation that inspections have been undertaken prior to any operation into UK airspace,"" a CAA spokesman said.
In the US, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has taken charge of the Alaska investigation and its chair confirmed no passenger had been sat next to the affected section.
""We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,"" Jennifer Homendy said.
Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door, which they believe fell to the ground in the community of Cedar Hills, about 11 km (seven miles) west of central Portland.
Boeing's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues.

I950WQOKXX-8,Palestinians must be able to stay in Gaza - Blinken,By George Wright,3 days ago,20240107,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67907336,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow.
Mr Blinken condemned statements by some Israeli ministers, who called for the resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere.
The US official was in Qatar on his latest Middle East tour.
His comments followed reports that up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
Footage from Jabalia showed bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children.
A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it ""acted against a military target in the strike"" and that it was ""not aware of the number of casualties mentioned"".
""In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,"" they said, adding that the IDF ""follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"".
More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis.
Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October.
Some 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage in the Hamas raids.
More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has reported at least 113 deaths over 24 hours of Israeli bombardment.
""Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,"" Mr Blinken said on Sunday. ""They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza.""
Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"".
And National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right politician, this week issued a call ""to encourage the migration of Gaza residents"" as a ""solution"" to the crisis.
The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.
Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Health officials said even medical facilities including hospitals are now unsafe.
Three international medical aid groups announced they were pulling out of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza after Israel issued evacuation orders.
A representative of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that they were ""hugely concerned by this development"".
""What it means is that a hospital that was already over-crowded and overloaded and well beyond its capacity is now without absolutely critical reinforcement to support it as it deals with an ever-increasing number of casualties,"" said Gemma Connell.
The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that more than 600 patients and health workers were forced to leave the hospital, according to its director.
""Their locations are not currently known,"" said Mr Tedros in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Mr Blinken's latest trip to the Middle East comes amid rising tensions in the region, with concerns that the war in Gaza could spread.
Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official, was assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement in Lebanon, described Arouri's assassination as a ""flagrant Israeli aggression"" that would not go unpunished.
Hezbollah then fired rockets into Israel on Saturday as a ""preliminary response"" to the killing of Arouri.
""This is a moment of profound tension in the region. This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Mr Blinken said.
Qatar's PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al -Thani said that the killing of Arouri had affected ""the complicated process"".
Mr Blinken also said that the death of journalist Hamza al-Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza., was ""an unimaginable tragedy"".
He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war.
Mr Blinken arrived in Qatar following stops in Jordan, Turkey and Greece. He went on to Abu Dhabi late Sunday, and on Monday is due to travel to Saudi Arabia.

XGR28KI7GV-9,China sanctions five US defence firms over Taiwan arms sales,By Peter Hoskins,3 days ago,20240108,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67909120,"China has announced sanctions on five Western defence firms over the latest round of US arms sales to Taiwan.
The announcement comes as Taiwan prepares to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 13 January.
US weapons sales to Taiwan are a frequent source of tension between Beijing and Washington.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, a claim Taiwan's government rejects.
Last month, the US State Department approved a $300m (Â£236m) sale of equipment to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that the sanctions were ""In response to these gravely wrong actions taken by the US"".
It also said the recent arms sales ""seriouslyâharm China's sovereignty and security interests,âundermine theâpeace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"".
The companies being sanctioned were named as BAE Systems Land and Armament, Alliant Techsystems Operation, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions.
China will freeze the assets of the companies and ban people and organisations in China from engaging them, the Foreign Ministry said.
The BBC has contacted the US embassy in Beijing for comment.
Beijing has ramped up its pressure on Taiwan ahead of the elections that could redefine the island's relationship with China.
In his annual New Year's Eve address, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his claim that Taiwan would ""surely be reunified"" with China.
He also struck a stronger tone than last year's message, when he spoke about Taiwan being part of the ""same family"".
China sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. Taiwan considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.

6VLSYT8T1B-10,Ethiopia-Somaliland deal makes waves in Horn of Africa,By Damian Zane,2 days ago,20240108,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67911057,"The defence minister of the self-declared republic of Somaliland has become the latest casualty of the row over a controversial agreement that is causing ructions in the Horn of Africa.
Abdiqani Mohamoud Ateye resigned saying that cabinet ministers should have been consulted over a deal that Somaliland struck with Ethiopia that could see it leasing part of its coastline to its landlocked neighbour.
Somalia - which considers Somaliland to be part of its territory - reacted angrily to the 1 January deal, calling it an act of aggression.
Both the US and the African Union have backed the territorial integrity of Somalia and urged all parties to cool tensions.
The exact wording of the deal signed by the leaders of Ethiopia and Somaliland has not been made public, which is a problem as there are differing versions of what the two sides agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
An MoU is a statement of intent rather than a legally binding agreement but what seems clear is that Somaliland is ready to grant Ethiopia access to the sea for commercial traffic through a port, although it is not clear which port that would be.
There is also a military aspect. Somaliland has said it could lease a section of the coast to Ethiopia's navy, a detail which has been confirmed by Addis Ababa.
In return, Somaliland will get a share in Ethiopia Airlines, the country's successful national carrier.
But where things get sticky is whether Ethiopia said it would recognise Somaliland as an independent state - something which no other country has done in the 30 years since the former British protectorate said it was leaving Somalia.
On the day of the signing, Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi said the agreement included a section stating that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland as an independent country at some point in the future.
Ethiopia has not confirmed this. Instead, in its attempt to clarify what was in the MoU, the government on 3 January said the deal included ""provisionsâ¦ to make an in-depth assessment towards taking a position regarding the efforts of Somaliland to gain recognition"".
For Somalia, Somaliland is an integral part of its territory. Any suggestion that it could make a deal with another country or that bits of it could be leased without the approval of Mogadishu is highly problematic.
The day after the MoU was signed, Somalia described the deal as an act of ""aggression"" that was an ""impediment toâ¦ peace and stability"". It also recalled its ambassador from Addis Ababa.
On Sunday, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud stepped up the rhetoric saying: ""We will defend our country, we will defend it by all means necessary and seek the support of any ally willing to help us.""
He also called on youths ""to prepare for the defence of our country"".
Last week there were protests in Mogadishu against the deal with tens of thousands turning up to express their opposition.
Somaliland, a former British protectorate, declared itself independent from Somalia in 1991 and has all the trappings of a country, including a working political system, regular elections, a police force and its own currency.
Over the decades it has also escaped much of the chaos and violence that have hit Somalia.
But its independence has not been recognised by any country.
If, as Somaliland said, Ethiopia has agreed to recognise it at some point, it would have a profound impact on the Horn of Africa region.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last year described access to the sea as an existential issue.
Ethiopia lost its ports when Eritrea seceded in the early 1990s. With more than 100 million people, it is the most populous landlocked country in the world.
Mr Abiy's statement raised fears that Ethiopia could try to achieve its goal by force.
It has described the deal with Somaliland as historic, and emphasised that its intentions are peaceful.
""The position announced by the government is strongly rooted in a desire to not engage in war with anyone,"" Ethiopia's communications office said.
But in an oblique reference to the controversy, Mr Abiy said on X on Sunday that ""if we expect things to happen in ways that we are used to or know or can predict, [opportunities] may pass us"".
He added that some sometimes ""out of the box"" thinking was needed to achieve goals.
On 3 January, African Union commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat called for calm and mutual respect ""to de-escalate the simmering tension"" between Ethiopia and Somalia.
US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller also said that his country was concerned by reports that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland's independence.
""We join other partners in expressing our serious concern as well about the resulting spike in tensions in the Horn of Africa,"" he added in a press briefing.
Turkey, which plays a significant role in Somalia, stated its ""commitment to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of Somalia.
And Egypt has also pledged support for Somalia. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi told his Somali counterpart that Egypt stood by Somalia and supported ""its security and stability"".

IVDQAJY8RV-11,Ousman Sonko: Gambian ex-minister goes on trial in Switzerland for murder,By Imogen Foulkes,2 days ago,20240108,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67901064,"A Gambian former interior minister has gone on trial in Switzerland, charged with crimes against humanity.
Ousman Sonko fled there in 2016, shortly before Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, accused of heading a repressive regime, lost power.
Mr Sonko, 54, was arrested after non-governmental organisations presented evidence of his alleged involvement in killings, rape and torture.
But his lawyer said that he was not responsible for what happened.
Philippe Currat is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that The Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, which was ""never... under [his] authority"" was behind the alleged crimes.
Switzerland is trying the case under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows countries to prosecute people on their territory, even though the events may have taken place elsewhere.
Mr Sonko is the highest-ranking government official ever to be prosecuted under this principle in Europe.
Human rights groups believe the trial, taking place in the southern Swiss city of Bellinzona, could be a warning to repressive governments everywhere that the arm of the law can be very long indeed.
Switzerland's charge sheet against Mr Sonko is extensive.
It includes the participation in, or ordering of, killings, torture and rape - all targeting political opponents. These could constitute crimes against humanity under Swiss law.
Swiss investigators travelled to The Gambia and interviewed dozens of alleged victims and witnesses - nine will be in court to testify.
From 1996 until 2016, The Gambia was ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, whose time in office, according to Human Rights Watch, was characterised by ""widespread abuses, including forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings"".
Mr Sonko was Mr Jammeh's right-hand man, his role as interior minister putting him in charge of the security services, including, allegedly, a sinister paramilitary group known as ""the Junglers"".
But in 2016, shortly before Mr Jammeh himself lost power, Mr Sonko fled to Switzerland, where he claimed asylum.
Within months he was arrested, after an NGO, Trial International, gave the Swiss authorities details of abuses he was allegedly involved in.
After six trips to The Gambia and 40 interviews with complainants, the Swiss attorney general drew up the charge sheet.
This is only the second time that Switzerland has ever tried someone under universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity.
The first case, in June 2023, saw former Liberian militia leader Alieu Kosiah sentenced to 20 years for crimes including rape, murder, and cannibalism.
Other countries are also bringing cases against former members of Mr Jammeh's regime.
In October, Germany handed a life sentence for crimes against humanity to Bai Lowe, a one-time member of ""the Junglers"".
Later this year, a court in the US state of Colorado will begin the trial of an alleged former member of the same group.
Although The Gambia has created its own transitional justice process to address abuses committed under Mr Jammeh's rule, human rights groups say its work has so far been very slow.
Even in the Swiss trial against Mr Sonko, one of the plaintiffs who had been scheduled to testify died before the case came to court.
But for those who do testify, ""being invited before a court of law, to tell their stories, is a way for them to heal. And if the federal court does reach a guilty verdict, it will be an enormous relief for them. They will get the answers they have been waiting for for many years,"" Trial International's Benoit Meystre said.
The court case is expected to last a month with a verdict coming in March.
