Ukraine will get more drones donated to their frontline, and more air defense to protect the Ukrainian population and important infrastructure from Russian attacks.
- Ukraine has an urgent need for more military equipment to protect itself against the Russian war of aggression. Together with other countries, Norway will do what we can to contribute, says Minister of Defense BjÃ¸rn Arild Gram (Sp).
Norway contributed NOK 570 million to this donation. The acquisition is made through the British-led International Fund for Ukraine.
The donation is a collaboration between Great Britain, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Norway.
