Former Iranian acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani has become a member of Iran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations.
In a decree on Saturday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei appointed Bagheri Kani as a member of the council.

The Strategic Council on Foreign Relations was established in 2006 as per a decree by Ayatollah Khamenei. According to its website, it is a leading think tank and advisory body to the Leader to engage and assume a role in major policymaking, open up new horizons in the realm of foreign relations, benefit from the elite, and develop indicators with the aim of realizing objectives of the Iran Outlook Plan.
Kamal Kharrazi, a former foreign minister, is the head of the council.
