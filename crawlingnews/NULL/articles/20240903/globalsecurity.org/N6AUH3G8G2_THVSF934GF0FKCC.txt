From 3 to 6 September, participants of the Interaction 2024 command post exercise involving the CSTO Collective Rapid Reaction Forces, the Search 2024 special drills, and the Echelon 2024 drills regroup and head to the Kyrgyz Republic.
According to the plan, the CSTO Troops (Collective Forces) set off from the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Tajikistan to the area of the drills.
One of the priorities determined by the Republic of Kazakhstan chairing the CSTO in 2024 is to improve prompt deployment of the Troops (Collective Forces) including unimpeded transit of national contingents.
The drills, which consolidate training of different components of the CSTO Troops (Collective Forces), take place on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic:
-  the Interaction 2024 command post exercise involving the CSTO Collective Rapid Reaction Forces is to practise preparing and conducting a joint operation to resolve the armed conflict;
- the Search 2024 special drills are focused on issues of organising and conducting reconnaissance in the interests of the CSTO Collective Rapid Reaction Forces;
- the Echelon 2024 special drills are aimed at practising the issues of combat service support.
