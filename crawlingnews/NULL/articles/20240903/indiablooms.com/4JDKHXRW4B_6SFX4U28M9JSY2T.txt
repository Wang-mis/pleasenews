The pact on semiconductors comes even as India has been strengthening its collaboration in the semiconductor sector with global partners, including the US, Taiwan, the EU, and others, reported WION news channel.
Modi will visit Singapore on Sept 4-5 at the invitation of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
The leaders will review the progress of Indiaâ€“Singapore Strategic Partnership and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.
