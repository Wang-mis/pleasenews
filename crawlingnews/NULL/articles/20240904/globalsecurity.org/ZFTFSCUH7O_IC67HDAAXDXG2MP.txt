The Iranian foreign minister has warned that the continuation of Israel's crimes against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is causing a "dangerous crisis" in West Asia.
In an X post on Monday, Abbas Araqchi said Israel's Western supporters bear responsibility for their failure to end "criminal provocations" by the occupying regime in the region.
"By persisting in Gaza genocide and now dispatching its killing machine to West Bank, Israel's pushing region to brink of dangerous crisis," he said.
"If Bibi's Western enablers fail to curb these criminal provocations, they'll share responsibility for consequencesâand be held accountable," he added, referring to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Israel launched a genocidal war on the besieged Gaza on October 7, 2023 after the Hamas resistance group carried out a surprise operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.
So far, however, the Tel Aviv regime has failed to achieve any of its declared objectives in the Gaza Strip despite killing at least 40,786 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring 94,224 others.
During the same period, the Israeli military has also conducted bloody raids in the occupied West Bank and killed 670 Palestinians.
On August 28, the Israeli army launched a massive West Bank assault, deploying hundreds of troops and conducting airstrikes on the cities of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the occupying regime.
