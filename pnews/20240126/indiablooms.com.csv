Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate in the much-awaited consecration or pran pratishtha ceremony of the Ram Temple in the north Indian city of Ayodhya on Monday, a mega religious event which is seen by many as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's attempt to launch its campaign ahead of the national polls.
From celebrities to politicians and seers, Ayodhya is currently overwhelmed by people from far and wide places who hope to witness a watershed religious event that will mark the course of the nation in the coming months. Many of them arrived in private jets for the ceremony.

A majority of Hindus claimed that the site was the birthplace of Lord Ram before Muslim Mughals razed a temple at the spot to build the Babri Masjid.
In a landmark verdict in 2019, the Supreme Court handed over the land to the Hindu community and ordered to allot a separate plot to Muslims.
The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.
It also witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict."

Promotion of Comprehensive Political Dialogue
For more than 30 years, Uzbekistan and China have been continuously strengthening political mutual trust and developing bilateral relations based on the principles of equality, friendship, good-neighborliness, mutual support, mutual benefit, respect and consideration of each other's interests.
With the election of Shavkat Mirziyoyev as President of Uzbekistan, Uzbek-Chinese interaction has entered a trajectory of more dynamic development. This is facilitated by both regular political dialogue at the highest level and the existing friendly and trusting relations between the leaders of the two countries.
Thanks to the political will and efforts of the heads of state,in September 2022, bilateral relations were raised to the level of “comprehensive strategic partnership in a new era,” which reflects the similarity of their views and geopolitical priorities, the mutual desire to take cooperation to a higher level and fill it with new content.
Since 2017, 3 telephone conversations and 8 meetings have taken place. Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Uzbekistan in 2022. In turn, the leader of Uzbekistan visited China 5 times (in 2017, 2019, 2022, 2023).
As a result of mutual state visits over the past two years, about 60 documents have been signed, agreements have been reached on the implementation of trade contracts and investment agreements worth more than 40 billion dollars.
Active dialogue supported at the intergovernmental, interparliamentary, and interdepartmental levels also plays a key role in deepening multifaceted interaction.
Since 2011, meetings of the Uzbek-Chinese Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee, which includes 7 specialized subcommittees, have been held. An agreement has been reached in 2022 on the creation of a subcommittee on poverty reduction.
Since 2017, the Inter-Parliamentary Group on Cooperation between the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the National People's Congress has been operating, which helps to intensify mutual visits of parliamentary delegations and conduct joint events to exchange experience in the field of rule-making. In addition, political consultations are held on a regular basis at the level of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
In November 2023, the first Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministers of the two countries was launched in Beijing, which became a new mechanism for the implementation of agreements reached at the highest level.
At the same time, interregional exchanges have been noticeably intensified. Last year, delegations from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces visited Uzbekistan. As a result of the visits, more than 100 investment contracts and agreements worth a total of $3.5 billion were signed. A number of agreements on establishing partnership relations between cities and regions of Uzbekistan and cities and provinces of China have also been signed.
Over the years of cooperation, a solid legal framework of over 285 documents has been created, covering virtually all areas of interstate relations. To date, the Program for the Development of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in a New Era for 2023-2027, as well as the Program for the Development of Trade, Economic and Investment Cooperation between China and Uzbekistan for 2022-2026 are being implemented.
In addition to the bilateral agenda, China and Uzbekistan have significantly enhanced coordination within regional and international organizations such as the UN, SCO, CICA, BRICS Plus and others. The two sides provide each other with mutual support, demonstrating proximity and similarity of positions on the most pressing global and regional issues.
Beijing has supported a number of resolutions initiated by Uzbekistan at the UN in recent years. Tashkent, in turn, highly appreciates and supports the initiatives promoted by China on global development, global security and global civilization, which are of key importance for the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring peace and security, and strengthening inter-civilizational dialogue.
To date, the Central Asia-China format at the level of heads of state has become a new platform for China's interaction with Central Asian countries. As a result of the first face-to-face summit of the heads of state of Central Asia and China, held in May 2023, the Xi'an Declaration was signed, which established the institutional basis for deepening cooperation in the new format.
The interaction of the parties within the framework of China's flagship project ""Belt and Road"" is of no small importance for the intensification of bilateral cooperation. The leader of our state has already participated three times in the work of the international ""Belt and Road"" forums held in 2017, 2019 and 2023.
As rightly characterized by our President, speaking at the jubilee third forum dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the initiative: ""over the years, the ambitious idea to revitalize the Great Silk Road has gained many supporters and turned into a sought-after, inclusive and open platform of interaction"".
At the same time, Uzbekistan's priority areas of cooperation within the framework of this initiative are:
1) implementation of transport and logistics projects that increase transit potential and can provide our state with the shortest possible access to world markets;
2) realization of investment projects in the sphere of high technologies, providing for the creation of integrated industrial technoparks, scientific and innovation clusters, free and special economic zones for the production of competitive and knowledge-intensive products;
3) adaptation to climate change and intensification of cooperation within the framework of the ""Green Silk Road"", providing for the development of renewable energy sources, water-saving technologies, ""smart"" agriculture, etc.;
4) development of cultural and humanitarian ties by using the huge tourism potential of our republic, as well as strengthening cooperation in education, science, culture and health care.
Expansion of mutually beneficial economic and investment cooperation
The central place in bilateral relations is given to trade, economic and investment cooperation, which in recent years has demonstrated positive dynamics and stable growth.
China has become a leading trade partner and a major investor in Uzbekistan's economy. According to the results of 2022, the volume of mutual trade amounted to about 9 billion dollars (increased by 20% compared to 2021) and increased almost two times compared to the indicator of 2017.
In January-November 2023, bilateral trade turnover increased by 34% and exceeded 12 billion dollars. In the total volume of Uzbekistan's foreign trade turnover, the share of China amounted to about 20%. At the same time, there is every reason to bring the trade turnover to 20 billion dollars in the next five years.
The basis of Uzbek exports to China are mineral fuels, petroleum products, copper and copper products, cotton yarn and silk, and plastics. The basis of Uzbek imports from China are machinery and equipment, vehicles, plastics, rubber, and metals. At the same time, most of the imports account for the purchase of high-tech equipment, machine tools and machines necessary to modernize the industrial sector of our country's economy.
It is pleasant to note that with the signing of a package of protocols on phytosanitary requirements in 2018, the nomenclature and volumes of agricultural and food products exported by Uzbekistan to PRC have significantly increased.
Today, Uzbekistan has received permission to export 21 types of such products (mash, dried grapes, cherries, melon, peanuts, pomegranate, sesame, apricots, honey, dried prunes, lemon, beans, dried melon, chicken feet, etc.).
For example, exports of mash and dried grapes have increased significantly in recent years. Uzbekistan's share in the total volume of Chinese imports of mash has reached 37%, and in the import of dried grapes - 50%.
Since the launch of large-scale reforms and an open foreign economic policy, Chinese investors have demonstrated a steady interest in Uzbekistan, investing heavily in the oil and gas, chemical, telecommunications, hydropower, agriculture, light industry, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and construction materials sectors.
The total volume of Chinese investments in Uzbekistan for 2017-2022 has increased five times, reaching almost 11 billion dollars. Today, we have 2,125 enterprises with Chinese capital participation, which is 15% of the total number of enterprises established with the participation of foreign capital.
A number of large projects have already been implemented with Chinese partners, such as the Kungrad soda plant, the Dehkanabad potash fertilizer plant, the Huaxin Cement Jizzakh and Farg'ona Yasin Qurilish Mollari cement plants, the Navoiazot joint-stock company complex for the production of polyvinyl chloride, caustic soda and methanol. In 2023, the largest cement plant with a capacity of 3 million tonnes per year was opened in the Samarkand region in partnership with Energy China, and a truck production plant was established in the Andijan region in partnership with the Chinese automobile company FAW.
It is important to note that Chinese investors are actively participating in the creation of joint high-tech industrial parks in our country. A successful example in this direction is the park ""Peng Sheng"", which was established in 2009 in free economic zone ""Jizzak"".
In this park, together with the Chinese company ""ZTE"" was built a line for the production of smartphones, were opened factories for the production of fittings, ceramic tiles, sanitary ware and footwear products based on domestic raw materials. Their activity has brought 40-50% of the region's income in foreign currency and created jobs for about 2,000 local people.
In the near future, it is planned to create an Uzbek-Chinese agro-industrial park, an agro-innovation park, and an Uzbek-Chinese biotechnological cluster, which will also contribute to the deepening of bilateral cooperation in the production of high-tech products and the creation of new jobs.
At the same time, the countries are deepening cooperation in the production of new-generation cars based on electric and hybrid engines. In 2023, relevant agreements were signed with the Chinese companies EXEED and BYD Auto Industry.
In addition, agreements have also been signed on the joint development of technologies and the installation of chargers for electric vehicles. According to the plans, by 2033 70 centralized and 50 thousand decentralized electric filling stations will be built in all regions of our country.
In the context of the global trend towards a transition to ""green"" development, the implementation of joint projects on the widespread introduction of renewable energy sources (solar, wind and hydroelectric power plants) is an important area of Uzbek-Chinese cooperation.
China is the undisputed global leader in the introduction of renewable energy sources (RES). By the end of 2023, the total installed capacity of green energy in the country's energy balance reached 49.6%. Chinese manufacturers of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries hold about 70% of the global market share.
Strengthening Uzbek-Chinese interaction in the field of RES implementation will undoubtedly contribute to improving energy security and environmental sustainability of our republic. It will also contribute to a more effective implementation of the ""Program on Transition to a Green Economy and Ensuring Green Growth in the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2030"", according to which it is planned to increase the RES capacity in the total energy balance of the country up to 30%.
Chinese companies are already implementing a number of projects for the construction of solar and wind power plants in the Kashkadarya, Bukhara and Andijan regions. Moreover, in May 2023, new agreements were reached on the construction of 11 solar and wind power plants with a total capacity of 4.8 GW at a cost of 4.4 billion dollars. In addition, the Chinese side is actively involved in the preparation of feasibility studies for hydropower construction projects in the Namangan and Tashkent regions.
Another promising area of Uzbek-Chinese partnership is digital development. In the last decade, China has made a great leap in the field of digital innovations, taking the lead in the development of 5G, blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence and e-commerce technologies.
Thanks to the development of e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Taobao, AliExpress, China has become a global leader in e-commerce with a total transaction volume of 2 trillion dollars.
Given China's rich experience and success in this area, Uzbekistan is interested in technology transfer and attracting Chinese investments in the development of electronic commerce, digital platforms, creation of centers for processing and storage of big data, and others.
In recent years, the interaction between the two countries in the sphere of e-commerce development has entered a new stage of development. Thus, In September 2022, a permanent national pavilion of Uzbekistan was launched on the Alibaba platform, where more than 100 items of textile, agricultural and food products were placed. In the future, it is planned to open new industry sections and increase the number of product names to 300.
Strengthening cultural and humanitarian ties
Uzbekistan and China pay special attention to the expansion of cultural and humanitarian ties, which contribute to the full rapprochement, deepening mutual understanding and mutual enrichment of the cultures of the two peoples.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his author's article published on the eve of his state visit to Uzbekistan in September 2022, focused on the fact that the Great Silk Road testifies to friendly contacts between our peoples for more than 2000 years. The countries still keep a good memory of such pioneers and envoys of Sino-Uzbek friendship as Zhang Qian, Xuan Zang, Wu Zhu, Seyid Ajal Shamsuddin and others. Such centuries-old Chinese-Uzbek friendship, passed down from generation to generation, still serves as a solid foundation for further strengthening multifaceted cooperation.
The Uzbekistan-China Friendship Society, the China- Central Asia Friendship Society, as well as the Chinese National Cultural Center in Tashkent make a worthy contribution to strengthening mutual understanding between the two peoples.
Cooperation in the fields of education, science, tourism, healthcare, sports, and archaeology is actively developing every year, and exchanges between educational and academic institutions, youth organizations, and the media are strengthening. This is facilitated by regularly held joint conferences, symposiums, exhibitions, tourist fairs, cultural and film days, concerts and festivals.
The year 2023 was busy in terms of holding various joint cultural events. For example, in October, an exhibition of Uzbek historical heritage was organized at the Archaeological Cooperation Exhibition within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative at the Gugun Palace Museum in Beijing. In addition, Chinese Culture Days were held in Uzbekistan.
It is also necessary to emphasize the growing interest among the youth of the two countries in mutual language learning. For example, two Chinese universities have opened departments for the study of the Uzbek language, and a Center for Uzbek Language and Culture has been established. In Uzbekistan, Chinese is taught in six universities of the country.
At the same time, the basic university specializing in the training of Sinologists is the Tashkent State University of Oriental Studies, where a separate faculty of Chinese Studies has been opened in the following three areas: ""Chinese Language and Literature"", ""Politics, History and International Relations of the People's Republic of China"" and ""Chinese Economy"". The entire teaching staff of the faculty is trained and regularly improves their qualifications at prestigious universities in China.
The activities of the Confucius Institutes opened in Tashkent and Samarkand make a great contribution to the study of the Chinese language and the popularization of Chinese culture. It is important to note that China signed the first agreement on the opening of the Confucius Institute in Central Asia with Uzbekistan in 2004.
As we know, this year marks the 20th anniversary of the opening of the first Confucius institutes in the world. In this regard, the academic circles of Uzbekistan and China could consider the possibility of holding a joint scientific and practical conference in Tashkent dedicated to the legacy of Confucius.
Cooperation between the countries in the field of tourism is also developing steadily. Uzbeks and Chinese are interested in the common history of the two ancient Eastern civilizations, which were connected by Great Silk Road, rich historical and cultural heritage and unique ancient architectural monuments located on the territory of the states, which serves as the basis for the intensification of tourist exchanges.
Since 2010, Uzbekistan has been granted the status of a tourist country for group travel of Chinese citizens, and since 2021, a 10-day visa-free regime has been in effect for residents of the People's Republic of China.
In addition, a lot of work is being done to popularize the Uzbek tourism brand in the territory of the People's Republic of China. In particular, study tours to Uzbekistan have been organized for popular Chinese media and journalists, and videos about Uzbekistan are being broadcast on Chinese channels.
Thanks to the measures taken, the flow of Chinese tourists to Uzbekistan has significantly increased in recent years. At the end of last year, their number exceeded 40 thousand people.
Thanks to the measures taken, the flow of Chinese tourists to Uzbekistan has increased significantly in recent years. By the end of last year, their number exceeded 40 thousand people.
In addition, the number of flights between the countries is increasing. Currently, three airlines ""Uzbekistan Airways"", ""China Southern Airlines"" and ""Loong Air"" carry out 11 flights per week between the cities of Uzbekistan and China (Urumqi, Beijing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu).
In general, the high dynamics of development of the entire spectrum of Uzbek-Chinese relations observed today gives a clear reason to assert that this trend will grow and gain new momentum. However, despite the successes achieved, bilateral cooperation has a great untapped potential that needs to be explored and used for the benefit of the peoples of the two States.
The countries need to continue searching for new ""points of growth"" in bilateral interaction by intensifying cooperation in the following areas:
First, strengthening political dialog. Against the background of ongoing geopolitical turbulence and growing instability in the world, strengthening strategic mutual trust and dialog between the countries, both at the bilateral level and within the framework of regional and global structures, will contribute to strengthening common positions and promoting the interests of the two countries in the international arena;
Second, expansion of trade, economic and investment interaction. In particular, by strengthening industrial cooperation, balanced growth of trade turnover, attracting Chinese investments in high-tech sectors of Uzbekistan's economy for the production of high value-added products, as well as creating joint production facilities for the cultivation and processing of agricultural products;
Third, strengthening cooperation in the development of transport and logistics interconnectivity. Under current conditions, it is important for the countries to strengthen cooperation in building a multivariate system of transportation and logistics routes that will facilitate access to new export markets.
In this context, the implementation of China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan, Termez-Mazari-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar railways and other alternative routes is of particular importance;
Fourth, the intensification of cooperation on the transition to ""green"" development. Further exchange of experience and attraction of Chinese investments in the field of alternative energy development, introduction of modern resource-saving, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies in Uzbekistan will play an important role in this direction;
Fifth, deepening cultural and humanitarian ties. In particular, by expanding interaction in the spheres of culture, science, education and tourism. For example, in order to increase mutual tourist exchanges, the countries need to work out issues related to the reduction of visa restrictions, and to expand cooperation in education, it is important to accelerate the launch of double degree programs between leading universities of China and Uzbekistan.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the upcoming high-level contacts will undoubtedly contribute to bringing the bilateral interaction to a higher level, strengthen the bonds of traditional friendship and good-neighborliness, as well as identify new promising areas of multifaceted strategic partnership.

0GZDTZSKIP_T4Y8GZWGNYITLSU,Muslims’ love for Imam-e-Hind – Lord Ram -- is etched in poetry,By Dr Shujaat Ali Quadri,"22 Jan 2024, 07:35 pm",20240122,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/O/94467/muslims-love-for-imam-e-hind-lord-ram-is-etched-in-poetry.html,"Maryada Purushottam Ram served as a perfect foil for musings of principles and preet (love).
Ram Katha (telling stories of Lord Ram) has in fact been a folk tradition, especially in the Awadh region, on the lines of marsiya (elegy), etc. Odes to Ram have been written as much passion and precision as they have been written for any other religious figures.
Not only stray couplets in honour of Ram, Urdu poets have attempted the whole epic of Ramayana in Urdu poetry. In fact, Ramayana, originally in verse, has been written both in verse and prose by Urdu writers.
Delhi-based noted literary historian Rakshanda Jalil has discovered that there are over 300 Ramayanas written in Urdu, many in Urdu verse known as manzum Ramayanas.
Photo Courtesy: Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra
Urdu poetry is replete with long poems written about various incidents mentioned in the Ramayana: Ram’s separation from his parents, his love for his wife Sita, separation of Sita from him, injury to his beloved brother Lakshman and his return to Ayodhya as a triumphant prince. All have been etched in exquisite words.
Before Urdu became lingua franca of northern India, philosophers and poets used local dialects and parlance to disseminate easy-to-understand tales of Ramayana. They were written in easy idioms, but carried very the essence of the epic in a profound way.
Most notable Muslim name who wielded his pen in reverence of Hindu deities was perhaps Abdurrahim Khankhana, one of the nine jewels of Emperor Akbar’s court. In respect of his saintly qualities, he was known as Rahimdas.
Rahim was in fact saviour of popular tales of Rama as rendered by Saint Tulsidas.
Rahim and Tulsidas were companions. The Pandits were furious as Tulsidas composed Valmiki’s Sanskrit in local lingo and so when the Pandits attempted to harm him, Rahim gave Tulsidas shelter in the mosque. Tulsidas wrote about this in these couplets:
Tulsi sarnam ghulamu hai ramko, jako rache sau kahe kuch au-ooMangi ke khebo, massetko saibo, laiboko aiku, na deboko daioo (I am Tulsi, Rama’s slave; you say anything you like; I beg and eat; I sleep in the mosque; I am unconcerned.)
Rahim was an authority over Ramayana, Mahabharata, and eighteen Puranas. The Rama of Rahim is similar to Tulsi’s Rama, the protector of the poor and refugees. Through his dohas (couplets), Rahim reveals how deeply Rama’s story has inspired people as he presents small events from around the world with great skill and evidence.
Ooche kaam bade karein, tau na badai hoye, Jyun Raheemhanumant ko girdhar kahe na koye (Man doesn’t lose status by doing any minion job Like Hanumanji is not looked down upon as carrier of mountain)
One of the most popular rendering on Ram has surprisingly been written by Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the foremost poet of the subcontinent controversially termed as ultra Islamist. His Ram-e-Hind (Ram of India) sculpts image of Ram in the attributes for which he is known as Maryada Purushottam. For Iqbal, Ram is the pride of India.
Labrez hai sharaab-e haqiqat se jaam-e Hind, Sab falsafi hain khitta-e maghrib ke Ram-e Hind (The goblet of Hind is brimming with the wine of reality All the philosophers of the West are taken in by Ram of Hind)
Iqbal idolises Ram as epitome of truth or reality and thus he erects him as an ideal mix of practical ideas that even western philosophers couldn’t produce in their imaginations. For Iqbal, Ram, if he is truly discerned by people of insight, can be a lodestar of leadership.
Hai Ram ke wajood pe Hindostan ko naaz Ahl-e-Nazar samajhte hain usko Imam-e-Hind (India can always be proud of name of Ram People of insight see in him leader of India)
Iqbal was a Kashmiri Brahmin by descent. Another Kashmiri Brahmin, Pundit Braj Narayan Chakbast weaved a scene of Ramayana into a popular poem: Ramayan Ka Eik Scene. This short epic depicts the atmosphere when Ram takes leave of his parents while embarking on the cursed banvaas (separated life in jungles) for 14 years. The poem is especially a tribute to love between Ram and his mother Kaushalya.
Uska karam shareek hai to gham nahii Daamaan-e dasht daaman-e maadar se kam nahii (If one has His divine blessings one can know no sorrow The hem of wilderness is no less than a mother’s hem)
The word banvaas, spelt out in different ways as ban-vas or banwas became a catchword to capture any kind of intense separation in Urdu poetry. It also found currency in day to day parlance too and we can often hear it in our conversation.
Similarly, the incident of abduction of Sita by Raavan, known as Sitaharan, also caught poet’s eye and long poems were written just elaborate this incident through myriad prisms. Munshi Banwari Lal Shola, a north Indian poet who was disciple of Mirza Hargopal Tafta, who himself was a disciple of great Mirza Ghalib, wrote a defining poem on this particular incident: Sita Haran. The poem evokes delicate and compassionate side of Sita who out of her kind-heartedness crossed the Lakshman Rekha drawn for her security.
Bahar jo kundli se chaliin dhoka khaa gayii Raavan ke chhal mein hai maharani aa gayii (The moment she stepped out of the circle she was entrapped Hai, the queen was beguiled by the deception of Raavan)
Another poem that brings such scenes or sequences from Ramayana to life is Betal Barelwi’s masnavi on Ramayana. It is a perfect example of the composite culture (Ganga Jamuna Tehzeeb) of those days. He has used both Hindi and Urdu words in his poetry in perfect concinnity, intermingled beautifully, something like what Amir Khusaru wrote in his famous ghazal – Jehaal Miskin Makum Taghaful -- where the first line is in Persian and the second in Hindustani.
One example is when Barelwi sketches out the scene when Shravan Kumar is hit by the arrow of Raja Dashrath, father of Lord Ram. Barelvi writes in Farsi interwoven with Hindi -- describing the scene where Shravan Kumar having been badly wounded by Dashrath’s arrow and about to die, requests Dashrath to take water immediately for his blind parents who were all alone in the wilderness.
Mata pita kubool ho Shravan ki Ram Ram Paani pilau kya nki hua kaam hi tamaam Chagal se pehle bhar diya umr-e-rawan ne jam Qatil ke haath bhej raha hoon yehi paigham (Dear parents, please accept my greetings, Ram Ram how should I bring water for you, for I’m about to die This ever-flowing life has filled my goblet before time and I am forced to send you message by my murderer) Poems about small incidents taken from Ramayana are numerous and are sung and enacted in stage dramas throughout India.
While a whole corpus, from where above examples have been culled, exist eulogising ideal characteristics of heroes of the epic and denouncing the evils, there are some which calls for realist evaluation of the epic and warn against the politicisation of mythology for personal gains. It denotes those indulge in such selfish acts as shar-pasand.
There is one such poem titled just Ram. It’s been penned by Rahbar Jaunpuri. While enumerating the many good qualities including his love for peace, harmony and truth, tells us why the land of Hindustan is proud of him.
In walking the path of loyalty, Ram has become an enduring symbol of self-sacrifice just as Raavan has come to embody the shar-pasand, those who like evil.
Rasm-o-rivaaj-e Ram se aari hain shar-pasand Raavan ki nitiyon ke pujari hain shar-pasand (Those who like evil are bereft of the traditions of Ram They are the worshippers of the practices of Raavan) The tale of Ram, Imam-e-Hind, is thus ceaseless."

Our teams are unable to reach the injured people,"" said the statement.
Khan Younis has witnessed during the past few days the intensification of Israeli attacks, the fiercest since the Hamas-Israel conflict started last October.
On Oct 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip, while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians.
As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages.
Over 24,900 people have been killed so far in Gaza as a result of Israeli strikes, local authorities said.
On Nov 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on Dec 1."

A bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and KV Viswanathan issued notice to Tamil Nadu on a writ petition filed by the ED seeking to transfer the investigation of the bribery case against ED officer Ankit Tiwari from the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
The top court issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government seeking its response and directed it not to proceed with the investigation against Tiwari in the meantime.
The state agency should also share with the court all materials collected so far in the case, the Supreme Court bench directed and posted the matter to be heard after two weeks.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the ED, said that though the agency was not supporting the officer implicated in the bribery case but wanted a fair and proper investigation should be conducted.
The Solicitor General said that the state agency under the guise of investigating the case against Tiwari, raided the ED office and seized several unconnected files, which are relevant in cases against many ministers, who are under the ED's scanner.
Tamil Nadu Police is stalling the ED investigation in money laundering cases against many State officials, he alleged.
Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the State, denied the allegations.
The Bench said, “We will evolve a mechanism to address a larger issue of best practices, considering the federal nature of the country.”

On behalf of the ROC(Taiwan) Government, TECC wishes to congratulate Chairman and CEO Young Liu of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) for receiving the Padma Bhushan 2024 bestowed by the Govt.of India in recognition of his contribution to India in the field of trade and industry. pic.twitter.com/96m3vig1WR
His entrepreneurial journey started in 1988 with the founding of Young Micro Systems, a motherboard company.
Later, in 1995, he entered the field of IC design, with a specific focus on PC chipsets.
The year 1997 witnessed the creation of ITE Tech, also known as ITeX, marking the third successful venture in his illustrious career.
“I am deeply honoured to receive the Padma Bhushan from the Government of India. My heartfelt thanks to the Prime Minister, President and the wonderful people of India for this tremendous distinction. I firmly believe this is an affirmation of a collaboration that benefits India’s long-term development and supports the growth of local economies.""I will continue to inspire my team. Let’s do our part for manufacturing in India and for the betterment of society,” he said on being conferred the prestigious award.
Based in Taiwan, Foxconn holds the title of the world's largest contract manufacturer and is responsible for assembling approximately 70% of iPhones.
The company has strategically shifted its production away from China, a move prompted by disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing geopolitical tensions.
In the past year, Foxconn has made substantial investments to expand its presence in India, particularly in the southern regions.
This strategic expansion aligns with the company's broader goal of reducing reliance on Chinese manufacturing and capitalizing on the growing opportunities presented by the Indian market.
Young Liu has actively supported India's potential in the electronics manufacturing sector. In a statement last year, he expressed optimism about the future, emphasizing that ""India will be a very important country in terms of manufacturing in the future.""
This underscores the significant role India is expected to play in the global manufacturing landscape.
The Padma Bhushan award, announced on the eve of Republic Day, holds prestige as one of the highest civilian honors in India.
This year, the President approved 132 Padma awards across various fields, encompassing art, social work, public affairs, science and engineering, trade and industry, medicine, literature and education, sports, and civil service.
The awards ceremony, scheduled to take place at Rashtrapati Bhavan, signifies a significant moment to celebrate the accomplishments and contributions of individuals across diverse sectors."

South Africa asked the ICJ to order an emergency suspension of Israel's devastating military campaign in the Palestinian enclave during two days of hearings earlier this month.
Claiming that it was targeting Hamas militants rather than Palestinian civilians, Israel denied the genocide accusations, calling them ""grossly distorted"" and asserting its right to self-defense.
The central issue of whether Israel is committing genocide will not be addressed by the ICJ in its decision on Friday, the report stated.
As a sort of restraining order to keep a dispute from getting worse, the court will only consider potential emergency measures while considering the entire case, which typically takes years.
In the event that the ICJ decides to order emergency measures, it is not required to grant South Africa's requests in full.
The court cannot enforce its decisions, but they are legally enforceable and unappealed.
Background
South Africa filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice on December 29, 2023, claiming that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza during the 2023 war.
In its request for temporary measures, South Africa asked the International Court of Justice to order Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza.
The Israeli government condemned South Africa's actions as ""disgraceful"" and charged it with aiding ""the modern heirs of the Nazis"" in addition to agreeing to defend itself at the ICJ proceedings.
Israel and the United States have rejected the assertion that Israel is engaging in genocide."

The notification follows Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's statement at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit earlier in the month, where she stated that the government was actively engaged in the systematic process of enabling direct listing of stocks at GIFT IFSC (International Financial Services Centre).
On January 11, Sitharaman expressed confidence that it would happen at the earliest, underscoring that Indian companies should then be able to access global funds easily.
In late October 2023, the corporate affairs ministry had announced that specific classes of public companies could directly list on foreign stock exchanges, following Sitharaman's earlier declaration in July 2023.
Today, the corporate affairs ministry issued the Companies (Listing of Equity Shares in Permissible Jurisdictions) Rules, 2024.
""These, together, provide an overarching regulatory framework to enable public Indian companies to issue and list their shares in permitted international exchanges. As of now, the framework allows unlisted public Indian companies to list their shares on an international exchange,"" the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is ""in the process"" of issuing the operational guidelines for listed public companies.
The start of the direct listing of Indian companies' shares on GIFT City exchanges is the first phase of enabling them to list overseas.
In September 2023, at the conclusion of the 12th India-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue, the government announced that it would explore the potential for direct listings on the London Stock Exchange.
So far, Indian companies were not allowed to directly list on overseas markets, relying instead on depository receipts such as American Depository Receipts (ADRs) or Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).
According to the notification dated January 24, amending India's Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules of 2019, a public Indian company is authorised to issue shares on the specified exchanges.
However, this is subject to the condition that neither the company nor any of its promoters, promoter group, directors, or selling shareholders are prohibited from accessing the capital market.
Further, it is required that none of the promoters or directors of the company are associated as promoters or directors with another Indian company that is barred from accessing the capital market.
Among the eligibility criteria, it is specified that promoters or directors should not be categorized as wilful defaulters or fugitive economic offenders.
""This policy initiative...will reshape the Indian capital market landscape and offers Indian companies, especially start-ups and companies in the sunrise and technology sectors, an alternative avenue to access global capital beyond the domestic exchanges,"" the finance ministry said.
""This is expected to lead to better valuation of Indian companies in line with global standards of scale and performance, boost foreign investment flows, unlock growth opportunities and broaden the investor base,"" it added.
Pantomath Capital Advisors Pvt Ltd. MD Mahavir Lunawat, who is also a member of the Working Group on IFSC Direct Listing of Listed Indian Companies on IFSC Exchanges, said, ""Direct Listing at IFSC enables corporates seeking cross-country capital raising to tap cross-listings, primarily for substantial finance, which in turn can seize expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally. This has been hugely facilitated by the rapid market liberalisation and greater integration of global securities market. This decision aims to further propel the transformation of IFSC into a thriving global financial hub. This will provide access to global capital and result in wider capital formation for the Indian business enterprises.”"

Kumar has reportedly called a meeting of the legislative party at 10 am.
Large-scale transfers of district magistrates are happening in Bihar, amid reports of an impending change in government.
The Assembly won't be dissolved, and a poll won't be held, at this time. Bihar will vote next year anyway, so, understandably, neither party is in a rush. The immediate focus will be on the Lok Sabha election to be held in a few months.
Both the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) have summoned their respective MPs and MLAs to close the deal.
Kumar met Governor Rajendra Arlekar this evening, for a tea party hosted on Republic Day every year.
However, his deputy Minister Tejashwi Yadav, whose Rashtriya Janata Dal is part of the present government, was absent.
Kumar may even share the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his February 4 rally in Bettiah, said reports.
With this, the INDIA bloc will receive a major jolt as besides Kumar's u-turn politics, two key leaders Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal had announced to contest alone in the Lok Sabha polls ruling out any alliance with the Congress and saying they would go solo in Bengal and Punjab.
Significantly, the terms of Nitish Kumar's ghar wapsi are said to include a reduction in Lok Sabha seats offered to the JDU.
In 2019 the party contested 17 and won 16 seats, but will have to settle for 12-15 seats now, given its weakened position - coming off this switch - and the need to accommodate other NDA partners."

He was welcomed back to the saffron party by BJP National President JP Nadda in the presence of senior party leaders BS Yediyurappa and Karnataka party chief Vijayendra Yediyurappa at BJP headquarters.
""I am rejoining the BJP. Earlier, the party gave me a lot of responsibilities. Because of some other issues, I went to the Indian National Congress Party. After that, in the last 8 to 9 months, there has been a lot of discussion in the BJP.
Live : ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ಮಾಜಿ ಮುಖ್ಯಮಂತ್ರಿಗಳಾದ ಶ್ರೀ @JagadishShettar ಅವರು ನವದೆಹಲಿಯ ಪಕ್ಷದ ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಕಚೇರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬಿಜೆಪಿಗೆ ಸೇರ್ಪಡೆ.#JoinBJP https://t.co/mPYX112qgV
Shettar had held various high-ranking positions in the party, including six-time MLA, former Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, ex-Speaker, and party president.
""Karnataka BJP leaders and ground-level workers were egging me to rejoin the BJP. For that purpose, I responded. Our leader Yediyurappa ji, state party president Vijayendra ji, and our national leaders wanted me to rejoin BJP.
""For the last 10 years, Narendra Modi ji has done a lot of efforts to strengthen India/ and in the world, India has become a very powerful country under the leadership of Narendra Modi ji. So, to see Narendra Modji become PM once again and make India strong, for that purpose I am rejoining the BJP,"" he told reporters here.
After quitting the BJP in April 2023 after being denied a ticket for the assembly election. Despite losing in the assembly elections, Congress made him a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) in Karnataka, apparently to retain him in the party for his Lingayat background.
Lingayats are a community in India, primarily found in the state of Karnataka. They are followers of the Lingayatism or Veerashaiva-Lingayat faith, which is a Shaivite religious tradition. Lingayats trace their roots to the 12th-century philosopher and saint, Basava, who emphasised devotion to Lord Shiva and rejected caste hierarchies.
Lingayats enjoy a strong political influence and the community’s support can bolster a party’s prospects in any election in Karnataka.
According to media reports, BJP’s Karnataka defeat in the 2023 assembly polls had been anticipated by the political observers and perhaps also the loss of seats compared to the 2018 assembly polls as a direct and immediate effect of the resentment of the Lingayats, the single largest community accounting for the state’s 17 percent population.
According to reports, Lingayat support could affect at least 85 seats in the 224-seat Karnataka assembly.
Shettar’s return is definitely a positive signal for BJP, after earning the community’s ire for denying tickets to Jagdish Shettar and Laxman Savad, after prominent Lingayat leader BS Yediyurappa stepped down as the Chief Minister.
Last November, BJP also made Yediyurappa's son Vijayendra Yediyurappa as the State BJP President.
""Through an email, I have informed the Karnataka Congress President and requested him to accept his resignation from the primary membership of the Congress. I have also emailed my resignation as MLC to Legislature Council Chairman Basavaraj Horatti. I will be meeting them personally to hand over the resignation,"" Shettar said.

The data also reveals that the British and Russian buyers secured the second and third positions, respectively, marking a shift from the 2022 scenario, where Russians, British, and Indians held the top three spots in the local property market.
According to reports, Indian investors pumped approximately US$ 335 million into the Dubai real estate sector in the first six months of 2023.
Interestingly, another report released by JLL has revealed that economic resilience and robust demand propelled the UAE’s real estate performance in 2023.
On the other hand, Dubai-based real estate brokerage company W Capital announced that Dubai real estate annual sales are heading to record a new record number, with value exceeding 400 billion dirhams during the current year for the first time, based on data from the Dubai Land Department (DLD).
“The value of real estate sales since January 2023 has risen to more than Dhs393, the highest number recorded in the market’s history. There were more than 127,000 deals, and with a week before the end of the year, it is expected to exceed 400 billion dirhams,” W Capital CEO Walid Al Zarooni is quoted to have said.
Analysts suggest that these unprecedented sales embody the strength of growth in the luxury real estate category, in which Dubai holds the global lead, and in the medium-sized real estate sector and commercial and hospitality units.
Due to its proximity to India and a substantial Indian diaspora of more than 3.5 million residents in Dubai, the city has been widely regarded as a second home for many Indians for a considerable period.
The Golden Visa in the UAE is a renewable 10-year residence permit available to investors, entrepreneurs, and other professionals, offering them a long-term stay option in the country. Purchasing property is the most straightforward method for both investment and obtaining a Golden Visa.
It is essential to highlight that Dubai also lacks a capital gains tax, making real estate investment appealing. The ease of conducting business and a tax-friendly atmosphere are significant advantages."

Eleven days after beginning fasting for the ceremony, Modi arrived at the grand Ram Temple, where the dignitaries have been flocking in since the morning, at around 12 noon and went on to perform the rituals for the consecration ceremony.
During the entire time of rituals, Modi was flanked by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and very significantly Mohan Bhagwat, who is the head of the ruling  BJP's ideological patron Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

In an hour-long speech post consecration, Modi, who will seek a third straight term in power a few months later, said, ""Kalchakra (cycles of time) is changing. Our generation has been chosen for this.""
""This is the time. This is the right time. We have to lay the foundation of a thousand year from today,"" he said and added, ""Time for Ram to Rashtra consciousness now."" ""There is no time for despair now. No one is small now. Do not underestimate yourself,"" he said.
Envisioning Ram or Rama, a Hindu deity widely prayed in BJP's stronghold Hindi heartland, Modi referred to the dispute that went on for years as Hindus fought an over seven-decade-long legal battle over the site where a mosque stood till 1992.

""Ram is not fire, he is energy. He is not a conflict but a solution,""Modi, who broke his 11-day fast with Charanamrit (nectar of lord’s feet) after the 'Pran Prathistha' ceremony, said, apparently targeting those who predicted nationwide conflict over the temple's construction.
The Prime Minister, whose BJP is aggressively promoting the ""Sanatan Dharma"" in recent times, said, ""This is also the pran Prathishta of Indian culture.""
The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.

Thanking the judiciary, Modi said, ""I am grateful to the Indian judiciary which protected the honour of justice.""
""We ask for forgiveness from Lord Ram too. There must have been something lacking in us that we could not do it for such a long time. We hope Lord Ram will forgive us,"" he said.
Ayodhya witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict.
A majority of Hindus claimed that the site was the birthplace of Lord Ram before Muslim Mughals razed a temple at the spot to build the Babri Masjid.

Moving on from the communal clash which has dominated the political rhetoric in the state for decades, Modi gave a message of unity banking on the principles of Lord Ram.
He said, ""The creation of Ram Temple is a reflection of peace and patience as showcased by Indian society,"" and added, ""Ram is a point of solution and not a matter of struggle. Ram belongs to everyone.""
Congress declines to attend ceremony
Country's key opposition Congress has dubbed the temple opening ceremony as a BJP-RSS event, with its senior leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi declining to attend the event.
Many other opposition leaders have also decided to give the ceremony a miss stating they will visit the Ram temple after January 22 or once the temple construction is complete.

Verma, who was 18 at the time of the incident, was arrested.
After being kept in the police cell for two days, he was later released on bail.
British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 questioned him after he arrived in the UK.

Some 30,000 people are sheltering at the site and the death toll could be higher, said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner General, who also took to the platform to lament ""another horrific day in Gaza"".
""The compound is a clearly marked 'UN facility' and its coordinates were shared with Israeli authorities, as we do for all our facilities,"" he said, adding ""once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war"".
Shock and resignation
The incident was indicative of the recent intense fighting around Khan Younis, said Jamie McGoldrick, interim UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, speaking during a press briefing from Jerusalem.
McGoldrick updated journalists on his visit to Gaza on Tuesday, where he said humanitarians are struggling to provide displaced people with basic services such as food, medical support, shelter, water and sanitation.
“As a result of that, the people themselves are really struggling to get through this, and the shock is actually starting to wane now, and people start to see…a resignation that this is what we're going to have to face for some significant time.”
While in Gaza, McGoldrick visited the southern city of Rafah, located on the border with Egypt, and a crossing point for aid into the enclave.
Rafah normally has a population of around 280,000, which has swelled to an estimated 1.2 to 1.4 million as people fleeing fighting elsewhere pack into the city, setting up makeshift shelters and tents in the streets.
The squalid and unsanitary conditions have led to outbreaks of respiratory infections and hepatitis A, both of which had been eradicated in Gaza. Meningitis and other illnesses are also emerging.
Shelter and safety
The conflict in Gaza has displaced over 75 per cent of the population, with nearly 1.7 million people now living in UNRWA and public emergency shelters as well as informal sites.
He said humanitarians are facing “massive issues” trying to provide shelter for displaced people seeking safety in the south. Some have moved from Rafah to the coastal town of Al-Mawasi, which is poorly supported or serviced by aid agencies, given the overwhelming numbers in need.
Currently, around 250 trucks come through the Rafah border “on a good day” when in the past, roughly 500 trucks from the private sector would bring in basic commodities daily.
More supplies needed
McGoldrick said the UN and partners are doing their best in the face of massive challenges, many of which are outside their control, and he emphasized the need for “minimum operating requirements” so they can work better.
“We need more supplies to come in from the private sector. We need to be able to scale up our pipelines and the key lifesaving commodities, but also from the authorities, the Israeli side, we need to get them to give us communications equipment,” he said.
Humanitarian workers are being sent into very hostile areas, “and they have no radios, they have no communications that work for them to be able to be seen to be safe,” he said, adding that they also do not have enough armoured vehicles.
Critical items ‘prohibited’
Furthermore, many of the goods humanitarians are trying to bring into Gaza to support water and sanitation “seem to be prohibited by the Israelis”, he said.
“They see them as something that could be used for other things such as pumps, such as generators, such as spare parts, pipes for water sanitation, solar panels and some medical equipment, which is key to our ability to address the humanitarian crisis that's there in front of us,” he said.
Some of the medical materials include basic drugs for treating chronic illnesses such as insulin pens for children.
Humanitarians are also facing difficulties with bringing in enough shelter material, including tarpaulins, blankets and non-food items.
Fuel for hospitals
McGoldrick said more fuel also needs to get to the north to supply generators inside hospitals there, such as Al-Shifa, “because they're working in some cases without anaesthetic, without electricity, to serve patients who are also ill and been wounded”.
He added that there is no real medical or casualty evacuation system in place to transport badly wounded people out of Gaza.
“We're not able to get people out farther afield to the neighbouring countries in order to get this very sophisticated surgery, and that's something we've been trying to work with the Israelis on,” he said."

""In the last decade, the country has succeeded in bringing 25 crore people out of poverty,"" he wrote.
""Lord Ram has given the inspiration of sabka saath, sabka saath, sabka vishwas aur sabka prayas (everyone's support, everyone's development, everyone's faith and everyone's effort),"" he said. ""The ideals of Lord Ram give us constant energy to work for welfare and empowerment of poor"".
Murmu had written a two-page letter to the Prime Minister on the eve of the inauguration of the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and called the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the event an ""uninhibited expression of the eternal soul of India"".
Describing his experience at the newly-built Ram Temple, he said that he ""witnessed the most unforgettable moments of my life in Ayodhya Dham"". ""I have returned from there with an Ayodhya in my heart"".
""Lord Ram has arrived,"" the Prime Minister said after leading the grand consecration ceremony at the Ram Temple in the presence of hundreds of seers and renowned personalities from the world of business, sports, and Bollywood stars along with millions nationwide.

“I am under no illusion that this is the end of such attacks. I believe we have emerged stronger from this experience and more unwavering in our resolve to continue our humble contribution to the India growth story,” wrote Adani in The Times of India.
It's worth mentioning that most of Adani Group's companies have recovered the losses they made following the release of the Hindenburg Research report on January 25, 2023.
The report from the US short-seller accused the conglomerate of engaging in fraudulent practices and stock manipulation. This resulted in a major market capitalization decline of $150 billion and compelled the conglomerate to cancel the Rs 20,000 crore FPO for its flagship company, Adani Enterprises.
Although Adani Group vehemently refuted the allegations, the incident not only triggered a decline in Adani Group stocks but also became a subject of political discourse.
The Supreme Court initiated an investigation, forming an independent committee to examine the matter. Simultaneously, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) launched a parallel probe.
None of Hindenburg's accusations against Adani have been substantiated so far.
Gautam Adani further underscored that the Hindenburg episode went beyond being merely an assault on the financial markets.
""The impact of short-selling attacks is normally limited to financial markets. This, however, was a unique two-dimensional attack: a financial one, of course, and one that played out in political space, each feeding off the other,” he wrote.
Adani went on to add that if Hindenburg’s plan had succeeded, it would have triggered a “catastrophic situation” for the country.
""Had our detractors' plan fully succeeded, domino effects could have crippled many critical infrastructure assets, seaports, and airports to power supply chains - a catastrophic situation for any country,” Adani said.
Adani said that the challenges and difficulties faced over the past year have offered valuable lessons.
""Trials and tribulations of the past year have taught us valuable lessons, made us stronger and reaffirmed our faith in Indian institutions,” he wrote.
“While this devious attack on us - and our strong countermeasures - will no doubt become a case study, I felt compelled to share my learnings because it was us today, it could be someone else tomorrow,” Adani added."

Thakur read out portions of the resolution hailing PM Modi.
""In 1947, the body of the country gained independence, but its 'pran pratistha' (consecration) happened on January 22,"" the resolution stated.
On January 22, Prime Minister Modi participated in the consecration ceremony of Shri Ramlalla (the child manifestation of Lord Ram) in the newly built Ram temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.

From celebrities to politicians and seers, Ayodhya is currently overwhelmed by people from far and wide places who hope to witness a watershed religious event that will mark the course of the nation in the coming months. Many of them arrived in private jets for the ceremony.
A majority of Hindus claimed that the site was the birthplace of Lord Ram before Muslim Mughals razed a temple at the spot to build the Babri Masjid.
In a landmark verdict in 2019, the Supreme Court handed over the land to the Hindu community and ordered to allot a separate plot to Muslims.

The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.
It also witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict."

On arrival, members of the public were directed to leave the train while officers boarded and contained the group to a few carriages.
The police said that the group all had their faces concealed and were carrying a number of items, including shields and a flag.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported that the group of people were wearing all black, including balaclavas. It quoted NSW Premier Chris Minns as saying that there was absolutely no tolerance for this behaviour.
""Normal people don't celebrate Australia Day with a balaclava on,"" he said. ""Due to great police work millions of Aussies were able to celebrate and come together without a potentially ugly confrontation.""

""I conclude that there was no national emergency justifying the invocation of the Emergencies Act and the decision to do so was therefore unreasonable and ultra vires,"" Mosley wrote while delivering the decision on Tuesday.
The court determined that the act of freezing the bank accounts of individuals associated with protests was also unwarranted.
""The harassment of residents, workers and business owners in downtown Ottawa and the general infringement of the right to peaceful enjoyment of public spaces there, though highly objectionable, did not amount to serious violence or threats of serious violence,"" the judge wrote.
Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilivre slammed the Canadian PM and said ""Trudeau said he admired the basic Chinese communist dictatorship. He meant it: Violating the Charter. Breaking the law. Seizing bank accounts. Censoring the internet.""

The decision casts a shadow on Trudeau's government that defended the decision of using the Emergencies Act as necessary as the protest took place amid Covid-19 pandemic.
The Freedom Convoy protest took place in early 2022 over stringent public health mandates and vaccine requirements.
Trudeau, facing a national deadlock, deployed the emergency powers and labelled the same as necessary citing protesters' non-negotiable stance.

Work on the project has begun and is scheduled for completion in second half of 2025.
Installing largest vacuum tank degasser in North America Primetals Technologies will install a 230-metric-ton vacuum tank degasser (VTD) with a dry mechanical vacuum pump system.
This will be North America’s largest twin station vacuum tank degasser (VTD), allowing JSW Steel USA to produce cleaner steel and reduce levels of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur in different process steps.
“JSW Steel USA wanted to install this VTD at their existing Mingo Junction site with significant footprint and height restrictions,” said Joerg Buttler, Head of Upstream Business for Primetals Technologies USA. “Working closely with JSW’s Mingo team, we were able to create a custom design that worked for the space, budget, and metallurgical targets.”
The VTD design includes all the mechanical and electrical equipment for the plant, including the mechanical dry pumps, vacuum filters, and dust catcher.
It includes integrating new material handling technologies, associated auxiliary systems, metallurgical process model, and complete Level 1 and Level 2 automation systems.
“We look forward to the successful completion of these upgrades to strengthen our service capabilities and meet the growing needs of the renewable energy and infrastructure markets while in line with the Build America - Buy America Act (BABAA),” said Jonathan Shank, Chief Operating Officer of JSW Steel USA - Mingo Junction. “The project will strengthen our commitment to sustainability while providing additional momentum for growth by widening our product portfolio.”
For the 2-strand continuous caster upgrade, the project scope includes key mechanical equipment, Level 1 automation for strand No. 2, a complete Level 2 automation system, and the mold monitoring system Mold Expert.
Moreover, JSW Steel USA has signed up for a long-term software subscription model, based on a software as a service (SaaS) concept.
Primetals Technologies successfully minimized the downtime for revamping a continuous slab caster to just 30 days, a remarkable achievement compared to the usual several-month shutdown.
By preserving the concrete foundations and strand supporting structure, the project avoided time-consuming demolition work. The introduction of a specially designed adapter solution for the new strand containment further contributed to the efficient timeline.
Additionally, the implementation of Smart Segment, a patented continuous bending and straightening process, allows for online and remote adjustments of the roll-gap at one of the strands.
This strand is dedicated to producing high-quality API grades and plates for the US market. Advanced mathematical models developed by Primetals Technologies in the design phase optimize the caster to eliminate the risk of unsteady mold level bulging.
JSW Steel USA's new slab caster features advanced technology, including Dynacs 3D for real-time temperature monitoring and control during secondary cooling.
The caster is equipped with DynaGap Soft Reduction 3D for improved operator control and better internal quality. DynaGap, a user-friendly strand-guide system, also allows for effortless roll gap adjustments.
Key facts about the new vacuum tank degasser include being a twin-type vacuum degasser with a capacity of 230 million tons and major equipment like a vacuum filter, dust catcher, and dry mechanical pumps.
The slab caster's specifications include thicknesses from 228.6 to 304.8 millimeters, widths from 991 to 2,032 millimeters, a radius of 10.5 meters, and a metallurgical length of 26.45 meters.
JSW Steel USA's automation systems subscription model ensures regular updates and remote support, making it compatible with the latest technology and allowing for seamless integration of new functions while shifting from capital investments to annual operating expenses."

My proposal for seat-sharing was turned down by them on the first day. We have already decided to go solo in the elections in Bengal. We will decide about a national approach after the elections.""
Mamata claims Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, who is presently undertaking Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, did not inform her about the rally which is set to pass through the state.
West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee says ""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP. I am a part of… pic.twitter.com/VK2HH3arJI
""I am a part of the INDIA alliance but I haven't been even informed that the rally is passing through our state,"" said the TMC supremo.
Though earlier several reports had claimed TMC might offer two seats in North Bengal to Congress, later Mamata had asked her party to prepare for polls even in Congress' stronghold Murshidabad, which was speculated to have been opted out by the state's ruling party.
When asked about Mamata being disgruntled, Rahul on Tuesday boasted of his party's good terms with Mamata in arriving at a seat-sharing deal.
""The seat-sharing talks are on. We will arrive at the result... But myself and my party have a very good relationship with Mamata-ji.
""Yes, at times, some conflicting comments come from either side. These are natural things. These are not the things that are going to disrupt anything,"" Rahul said.
Taking a dig at Mamata's decision and the opposition alliance, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya posted on X, ""Mamata Banerjee’s decision to fight alone in West Bengal is a sign of desperation. Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats, in the hope that she can still be relevant, after the polls.
""Much against her desire, to emerge as the face of the Opposition alliance, no one ever proposed her name. Her several trips to Delhi, to build a national profile, didn’t work. She just couldn’t hide the blood of post poll violence and rid herself of the nauseating stink of appeasement politics. An embarrassed Mamata, to save face, pitched for Mallikarjun Kharge, ruling herself out in the process. She realised, despite her bluster, she had no currency in the Opposition camp and had been building ground to snap out for long.""
""But the fact that her announcement to go solo comes just before Rahul Gandhi’s circus arrives in Bengal, is a death knell for I.N.D.I Alliance…,"" he added.

In the 2019 General Elections, Mamata's TMC had received a jolt as her tally of seats went down to 22 of 42 seats while BJP won 18, the highest ever figure it recorded in the state.
But it is important to note, Mamata stormed back to power a couple of years later with over 200 of 294 seats and winning subsequent byelections in the state over the last two-three years."

The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.
It also witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict.

Amidst the political upheaval, Sikhs were grappling with the ramifications of the demand for Pakistan and the escalating Muslim League agitation. The rift between the Sikhs and the League deepened, pushing the former towards contemplating the creation of a separate Sikh-Hindu state in the Punjab districts where Muslims were in the minority.
Public protests erupted as Sikh leaders vehemently opposed the pro-Pakistan and provocative slogans propagated by the Muslim League. Phrases like ‘Khun se lenge Pakistan’ (We will take Pakistan through blood), ‘Dena hoga Pakistan’ (We will take Pakistan), and ‘Leke rahenge Pakistan’ (We will keep Pakistan) added fuel to the fire of communal tensions. The atmosphere became increasingly charged, reaching a boiling point on key dates like 15th and 21st February 1947.
During these tense times, the Muslim League adopted a bullying, menacing, and hooliganistic character, fueled by what seemed like a mild and almost indulgent attitude towards its activities. Incidents of train hold-ups in Amritsar, Ludhiana, Gujranwala, and other places underscored the growing lawlessness. Shockingly, the police response was often insufficient, failing to adequately address the mounting crisis.
A turning point occurred on the 14th of February, when non-Muslim tonga drivers had their faces blackened in an act of humiliation. The murder of a Sikh police constable in Amritsar revealed a chilling reality. The Muslim mob besieged the helpless constable, stoning him to death in a brutal manner. Disturbingly, Muslim members of the police party, including only a few non-Muslims, did nothing to rescue their Sikh colleague. This incident laid bare the harsh truth that Sikhs were being targeted solely based on their identity.
This discriminatory violence escalated, prompting urgent pleas from Sikh sources. On February 26, 1946, the Assembly Panthic Party, with Master Tara Singh in attendance, appealed to the Muslim League to halt their “unlawful activities” and warned of serious repercussions. Simultaneously, Master Tara Singh emphasized the need for the Punjab Government to adopt a firm stance and swiftly address the growing menace to the province’s peace.

No one died in the mishap, officials said.
Airport officials expressed the hope that normal flights will resume at the Lengpui airport on Wednesday.
The officials said that the Myanmar Air Force transport plane was the same that had airlifted 184 Myanmar army personnel on Monday and returned from Sittwe town in Myanmar’s Rakhine state to airlift the remaining 92 soldiers.
Officials, quoting eyewitnesses, said that the Shaanxi Y-8 aircraft landed at the Lengpui airport runway and ran extremely fast before suddenly turning and going off the runway.
Of the 14 crew members and the pilot, 8 sustained injuries and were brought to the Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Lengpui village. After learning that the X-ray machine at the PHC was not properly working, they were brought to Aizawl.
Three flights, two from Guwahati to Aizawl and one from Delhi to Aizawl, were cancelled due to the mishap, the officials said.
The 92 Myanmar soldiers were also transported back to Zokhawsang, near Aizawl, the proposed battalion headquarters of the Assam Rifles, once they were shifted out of central Aizawl city.
The ill-fated Myanmar Air Force transport plane was sent to Aizawl for the seventh sortie to evacuate Myanmar army personnel, who fled to southern Mizoram’s Lawngtlai district after their camps were overrun and captured by Myanmar’s largest ethnic armed organization, Arakan Army (AA) militants, during January.
The first and second sorties, airlifting 151 Myanmar soldiers by a Myanmar Air Force transport plane coming from Mandalay and landing at Lengpui airport, were undertaken on Jan 2.
The soldiers were flown to Sittwe Port town in Myanmar's Rakhine state. It was followed by another two sorties, which evacuated 104 soldiers from Lengpui airport to Sittwe on January 9.
While the two sorties carrying 92 Myanmar soldiers each were successfully conducted on Monday, the proposed single flight to airlift the remaining 92 soldiers went awry on Tuesday."

Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated earlier that the dates of Putin’s possible visit to North Korea were being coordinated via diplomatic channels, the Russian news agency reported.
North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Russia last week and met Putin and  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia last year.
He met Putin at the Vostochny Spaceport on Sept 13.
During his visit to Russia, Kim also visited the Gagarin Aviation Plant in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, the Knevichi Airport, and the Marshal Shaposhnikov frigate.
The USA earlier this month claimed North Korea supplied ballistic missiles and launchers to Russia.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during a press briefing: "" Our information indicates that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile launchers and several [dozen] ballistic missiles.""
He said Russia used them during the ongoing conflict against Ukraine.
""This is a significant and concerning escalation in the DPRK’s support for Russia,"" Kirby said.
""Now, in return for its support, we assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia, including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment or materials, and other advanced technologies. This would have concerning security implications for the North — I’m sorry — for the Korean Peninsula and the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said.
Russia, however, denied the collaboration."

Earlier this year, UNICEF, together with WHO, supported the Ministry of Health in implementing a supplementary measles immunisation activity (SIA) in Sri Lanka aimed at controlling the ongoing measles outbreak, with over 700 measles cases reported in the country since May 2023, according to a UNICEF report.
The SIA was launched in two phases; the first phase commenced on January 6, targeting 6–9-month-olds in nine identified districts with a high population density, where measles cases were reported, including Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, Kurunegala, and Kalmunai.
The second phase was initiated on January 20 and will be extended to other age groups across the country. The minister said tackling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remains a major challenge, as over 20 percent of Sri Lankans battle diabetes and the country has a high prevalence of high blood pressure.
Amid a rapidly ageing population, Sri Lanka is proactively addressing the rise of non-communicable diseases like memory impairment, eye diseases, and bone diseases through dedicated programmes, said Pathirana.
Dengue fever, another pressing concern, is being tackled with special efforts, seeking increased public collaboration alongside support from health and security departments, said Pathirana.
Recognising the existing drug shortage, the government is actively importing essential medicines, with shortages gradually decreasing, according to the minister.
In 1984, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was added to Sri Lanka's immunisation programme.
Sri Lanka was declared measles-free by the WHO in 2019 after a second dose of the vaccine was administered in 2001 to boost population immunity.
But from 2020 to 2022, there was a notable decline in the vaccination rate worldwide, which affected many countries in the region and resulted in a rise in measles cases, including in Sri Lanka.

“Community by community, terrorist groups are extending their reach,” he said, adding that networks are widening, adding fighters and resources, and making common cause with transnational organized crime.
“In every case, civilians are paying the highest price and, in the end, all of humanity pays.”
‘Fight this inferno now’
Addressing an audience of counter-terrorism experts, government officials and civil society and private sector representatives, Mr. Guterres said the crisis must be tackled head on before it spins out of control.
He highlighted initiatives such as the multinational task force in the Lake Chad Basin countering Boko Haram as well as the African Union (AU) Transition Mission in Somalia in addition to Security Council resolution 2719 on financing AU-led peace support operations.
“But, we need urgent action on a much larger scale than we’ve seen to date,” the UN chief said.
Emphasize prevention
The root causes of terrorism – fragility and instability – must be addressed, he continued, pointing to the New Agenda for Peace he launched last July.
He said efforts to counter terrorism must be anchored in human rights and strategies focus on the marginalized and vulnerable.
Two-day meeting
The top-level meeting of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact will address rising violence and the spread of terrorist networks.
Participants will also consider how counter-terrorism efforts can be aligned with the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the AU’s Agenda 2063.
Launched in 2018, the Counter-Terrorism Compact is a network of 46 UN and non-UN entities. It also includes INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization and the Financial Action Task Force, which combats money laundering and terrorism financing."

Yemen descended into all out conflict in 2015, with Houthi rebels battling internationally recognized Government forces allied with a Saudi-led coalition.
A fragile cessation of hostilities broadly holds within Yemen’s borders, but Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza has seen dozens of airstrikes in recent days by the United States and United Kingdom in retaliation.
Cargo vessels have been forced to divert from the Red Sea, threatening global trade and international economic recovery.
No legal basis
Confirming the letter demanding the exit of Sana’a-based staff, Dujarric stressed that “any request or requirement for UN staff to leave based solely on the nationality of that staff is inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the UN.""
He noted that it also “impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to support all of the people in Yemen, and we call on all the authorities in Yemen, to ensure that our staff can continue to perform their functions on behalf of the UN”.
The letter from the Houthi’s de facto foreign ministry in the capital was reportedly sent to the UN’s acting Humanitarian Coordinator, Peter Dawkins, himself a British national.
It reportedly also ordered foreign organizations not to hire US and British personnel going forward.
Dujarric emphasized that UN staff “serve impartially and serve the flag of the UN – and none other”."

Three stealth-guided destroyers were deployed “in various areas of the sea” to “maintain a deterrent presence” considering the “recent spate of attacks in the Arabian Sea,” the ministry said in a statement. It was also using long-range maritime patrol aircraft for “domain awareness,” it said.
The turbulence in the region has led to India’s deliberate and cautious emergence as a significant military player in West Asia’s troubled waters.
The transformation is driven by a convergence of interests between the two regions and the critical imperative to safeguard crucial shipping lanes, heralding a pivotal shift in India’s maritime presence.
While India does not directly align with the US-led mission against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has recently involved strikes on Houthi-operated facilities, the independent operations of the Indian navy set a precedent for India’s evolving military strategy in West Asia. This marks a departure from its traditional stance of strategic restraint.
The escalation of missile attacks by the Houthi rebels against commercial vessels in the region sent shockwaves throughout the maritime industry. Shipping giants like Maersk have diverted their container traffic away from the strategically vital Bab el-Mandab strait, significantly reducing Red Sea trade and disrupting global supply chains.  The alternative route circumnavigates Africa and imposes additional costs on already stretched global supply chains. Export-dependent nations in Asia, particularly India, bear the brunt of these consequences, and there is a potential for oil prices to surge if the standoff persists.
The situation in the Red Sea has triggered growing anxiety among Indian exporters, who may withhold shipments valued at an estimated US$ 30 billion as a precautionary measure. As India steadily expands its military presence in West Asia, the evolving dynamics in the region continue to be closely watched by international observers.  A Pentagon report earlier said that MV Chem Pluto, a Japanese-owned tanker carrying 21 Indians and one Vietnamese citizen, was hit while traveling 200 nautical miles (370km) off the coast of India. The attack sparked a fire, which was put out but caused no casualties."

Jamia Uloom Islamia, New Town, famously known as Jamia Binori Town, reportedly issued the Fatwa.
The religious school is considered as an influential seminary of the country.
Chaman Lal, a minority rights activist, shared an image of the undated decree on Facebook stating: ""A Fatwa is issued that, it is permissible to take votes from the population of more than one million minorities, but Today a fatwa has been issued that it is not permissible to vote for minority candidates in the general election.""
The fatwa in question was issued after a query: ""Is it permitted under Islamic laws to vote for a non-Muslim candidate?""
In response, the fatwa said: ""The vote should be given to a candidate who has the required qualifications and ability, his party manifesto must also be correct and about whom there's satisfaction that he can take better steps for the people of their constituency, religiously and secularly. And because the non-Muslim candidate does not live up to these standards; it is better to vote for a Muslim candidate.""
Commenting on the matter, Chaman Lal was quoted as saying by The News International: ""When the constitution has given equal rights then those people who have worked for the betterment of their area and are willing to work more for the people of Pakistan, then why shouldn't people cast their votes in favour of them even if they belong to minorities?""
""The world is running after technology while Pakistan is still stuck in religious issues — which is no doubt important but it is a personal matter. When it comes to the state then good candidates should come forward even if they belong to a minority community,"" he added."

This facility will use components manufactured in Hyderabad at Airbus' Main Constituent Assembly (MCA) line, which will then be transported to Vadodara for the final assembly.
In addition to this partnership, the agreement includes the production of a minimum of forty C-295 transport aircraft at the Vadodara facility, with Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) overseeing the operations.
On January 26, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra announced that India and France have successfully reached agreements on a defence-industrial roadmap and a defence space partnership.
This development was part of the agreements signed during the state visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to India.
The FAL in India will undertake the integration of the major component assemblies, avionics and mission systems, installation of electrical harnesses, hydraulic circuits, flight controls, dynamic components, fuel system and the engine.
It will also do testing, qualification, and delivery of the H125 to customers in India and the region.
The FAL will take 24 months to set up and deliveries of the first ‘Made in India’ H125s are expected to commence in 2026. The location of the FAL will be jointly decided by Airbus and the Tata Group.

“This helicopter final assembly line, which we will build together with our trusted partner Tata, is a reaffirmation of Airbus’ commitment to developing the full spectrum of the aerospace ecosystem in India. This will be the second final assembly line Airbus is building in India after the ‘Make in India’ C295 military aircraft manufacturing facility in Vadodara, Gujarat.”
N. Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said, “The Tata Group is delighted to set up India’s first helicopter assembly facility in the private sector. This facility will have the final assembly line in partnership with Airbus for the world’s bestselling Airbus H125 single engine helicopter for the Indian as well as export markets.”
Undisputed in its class, the H125 produced in India will catalyse the use of helicopters in the country.
This multi-mission workhorse will revolutionise passenger and goods transportation and will also be used for segments such as emergency medical services (HEMS), disaster management, law enforcement, tourism and aerial work missions.
Providing last-mile connectivity to remote areas, the H125 will significantly contribute to the Government of India’s regional connectivity scheme – Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) which will further promote the tourism sector in the country.
The H125 is the world’s best-selling single-engine helicopter that outclasses other helicopters in its category.
This high-performing versatile helicopter is a member of Airbus’ Ecureuil family, which has accumulated more than 38 million flight hours worldwide.
It can operate in high-and-hot and extreme environments and can be easily reconfigured for various missions, including aerial work, firefighting, law enforcement, rescue, air ambulance, passenger transport, and many others.
The H125 is the only helicopter to have landed on Mount Everest, demonstrating its agility in operating in high-altitude, extreme environments.
The proposed helicopter manufacturing facility will be the second FAL to be established in India by Airbus, leveraging TASL’s capabilities in aerospace and defence.
The two companies are building the C295 military transport aircraft FAL in Vadodara, Gujarat.
The latest announcement is part of Airbus’ efforts to develop a holistic aerospace ecosystem in India, where the company is expanding its industrial footprint with aircraft assembly, component manufacturing, engineering and digital design and development, MRO support, pilot and maintenance training as well as academic collaboration to foster human capital."
OJTWMZFACS_BMMKP3F8FZTI7P5,Love is love: More animals show same-sex bonding in new study,India Blooms News Service,"25 Jan 2024, 10:04 am",20240125,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/health-details/W/13325/love-is-love-more-animals-show-same-sex-bonding-in-new-study.html,"A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications has traced the evolution of same-sex sexual behaviour in mammals, using phylogenetic analysis, a method that traces evolutionary relationships among biological entities. Such behaviour, which is common in mammals, may have evolved in part “to establish, maintain and strengthen social relationships that may increase bonds and alliance between members of the same group,” the authors write.
“Our study has tested for the first time two adaptive hypotheses on the origin and maintenance of same-sex sexual behaviour using a large group of animals, the class Mammalia,” says José Maria Gómez, an evolutionary biologist at the Experimental Station of Arid Zones in Almería, Spain and an author of the study. “In this sense, our study provides strong evidence that this sexual behaviour is functional and plays an important role, at least in this group of animals.”
In their study, Gómez says the scientists conclude that social behaviour that helped maintain positive social relationships and mitigate intrasexual aggression were two factors shaping the evolution of these behaviours. The former factor did so for both males and females and the latter factor only for such behaviour expressed by males, they found.
Same-sex sexual behaviour, which includes courtship, mounting, genital contact, copulation and pair bonding, was observed in 261 species, which constitutes 4% of all mammal species. Their study also indicates that same-sex sexual behaviour is not randomly distributed across the mammalian phylogeny but tends to be frequent in some clades and rare in others and has been observed in males and females both in captivity and in wild conditions.
Same-sex sexual behaviour in animals is a topic that is seeing increasing interest in scientists of evolutionary biology. This growing field of research has amassed a list of 1,500 animal species exhibiting same-sex sexual behavior.

Not an aberration
“In the early 2000s, same-sex sexual behaviour in animals would often be seen as a ‘zoo problem,’ like it was the animals in captivity that were making the best out of a bad situation,” says Eliot Schrefer, author of Queer Ducks (and Other Animals), a young-adult book that illustrates the diversity of sexual behaviour in animals. “But this kind of science shows the prevalence of said behaviours throughout the animal kingdom, which shows that it’s not some aberration that has been localised, but it is something that is essential,” adds Schrefer, who was not part of the study.
The study suggests that social bonds may have played a role in the evolution of same-sex sexual behaviour and it may be connected to animals’ transition from solitary living to “sociality,” or living in groups, which has evolutionary advantages. “Due to the multiple benefits of sociality, many behavioural strategies have evolved to ensure the cohesion and stability of social groups,” the authors write.
Janet Mann, a behavioural ecologist who was not involved in the study, says, “It makes sense that animals make use of the social behaviour that they have available for them for social bonding.”
However, she finds maintaining social bonds and intrasexual aggression to be the flip sides of the same coin. Social bonding, she explains, includes when animals ally themselves with others and that provides protection. In extreme cases, male chimpanzees form tight alliances with one another, resulting in the whole community bonding to some degree. “They kill males with the neighbouring community, so it’s not like they are having sex with those males,” she says.
While the Nature Communications report is one of the first studies that has provided research on a broader scale rather than sticking to one species, the authors are not hesitant to acknowledge that the data available are limited because interest among scientists and researchers studying same-sex sexual behaviour in animals is very recent.
Mann says this lack of data meant the researchers couldn’t comprehensively address the frequency of same-sex sexual behaviour; rather, the data primarily show presence or absence of behaviours. Therefore, a case in which a behaviour is rare was weighed the same as a case in which it occurs frequently; both were reported as “occurring,” which is a limitation of the study.

For a long time, the prevailing notion was that sexual behaviour in the animal kingdom served solely as a tool for procreation, and that sexual behaviour among the same sex in animals was considered either an error - or was labelled ""perverted.""

Stigma in past research
This absence of sufficient data stems from intentional erasure by some scientists in the past due to the stigma attached to homosexuality and expected heterosexuality among animals. For a long time, the prevailing notion was that sexual behaviour in the animal kingdom served solely as a tool for procreation, and that sexual behaviour among the same sex in animals was considered either an error — or was labelled “perverted.”
Heterosexual worldview influenced the approach of scientists like Valerius Geist, a mammalogist who, decades ago, refrained from publishing about frequent same-sex behaviour noticed in bighorn sheep because, the Washington Post reports, it made him “cringe … to conceive of those magnificent beasts as ‘queers.’” Years later, he reportedly “admitted that the rams lived in essentially a homosexual society.”
“Science is made by scientists, and [some] scientists who go out in the field have the assumption that only heterosexual behaviour is natural. And so, for a long time, they weren’t bothering to sex the animal they were finding or seeing if it were male or female; they were just assuming when one animal is mounting another.” Consequently, Schrefer says he suspects same-sex sexual behaviours in the animal world are vastly underestimated “because there are very few scientists that are going out and looking.”
These stigmas have not entirely left the scientific community. Mann recognises that societal biases against same-sex sexual behaviour in human societies influence the willingness of researchers to undertake such studies. The stigma creates a barrier, as approaching traditional funding agencies for studies may be met with reluctance or denial. The hierarchical nature of science, mirroring broader societal structures, also imposes limitations on junior researchers, dissuading them from delving into studies that challenge established norms, she says.
Mann’s contribution to the anthology Homosexual Behaviour in Animals: An Evolutionary Perspective has also opened up a window to same-sex sexual behaviour among bottlenose dolphins. Reflecting on the trajectory of her work, she explains, “I wrote that chapter in the book because I was asked to, and they knew I had a lot of data. I had also already started tenure, so when the book came out, I was a full professor. As a full professor, I don’t have to worry; but my more junior colleagues, for them, there is some stigma.” It’s not correct, she says, but “if you are studying same-sex sexual behaviour … people make assumptions about you as a person, that you are homosexual.”
This assumption about researchers’ identities has put skeptical eyes on the sciences that many pursue. Schrefer talks about a primatologist named Linda Wolfe, who wrote about female-female sex among macaques in the 1970s. She was a graduate student when she published about this, and the response was: “Why are you interested in this? Is something wrong with you? Are you a lesbian?” Schrefer says. “And so, if someone is part of the queer community, people would not trust the science that much.”
Melina Packer, an assistant professor of race, gender and sexuality studies at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse says she believes that while many people push for science to be depoliticized, it is impossible to do that, as everyone is a political being. What can be done is to acknowledge those potential biases. She further explains that those in power have a political position, and to state that some folks are biased because they are different from so-called societal norms is a political statement in itself. Further, she points out, scientists of diverse racial, gender and sexual identities are expected to leave those identities at the laboratory door. “But what about the identity of the dominant being, what about the white man’s identity? Why doesn’t he have to leave his identity at the laboratory door?” she says.
Many times, these biases lead to the dismissal of same-sex sexual behaviours in animals within research. “Because it is infrequent behaviour, there aren’t necessarily studies of just sexual behaviour; there are studies of courtship and mating, but it’s usually in the context of reproduction and the population and how it’s progressing. So, most of the focus is on the things that have obvious adaptive value.” The lack of focus on behaviours with unknown or uncertain adaptive values is another form of bias, Mann adds.
A study published in 2019 by a group of researchers suggests that same-sex behaviour in animals is ancestral, meaning that it did not evolve independently but instead was always there in animals and persisted, as there are very few costs associated with same-sex behaviours. The authors note that it can be advantageous, and that the expression of both different-sex and same-sex behaviours “may be the norm for most animal species.” The authors propose shifting the questions from Why same-sex behaviour? to Why not same-sex behaviour?
To keep such biases from permeating scientific study, Packer refers to feminist science studies, which look at how science is embedded in culture and history. “Scientists are people, too, right? And scientists cannot help from bringing their biases, intentional or not, to the work we do, who we are, what culture we are raised in, how we are socialized, what historical moment we have lived in. All these forces are influencing the scientific process, what we sort of have been socially trained to see when we make an observation, particularly of animals. [If] you are raised in a culture that understands same-sex sexual behaviour or homosexuality or queerness as wrong or abhorrent, you’re more likely to project that view onto the nonhuman animals you are viewing.”
To resolve this issue, Packer suggests more interdisciplinary collaboration with experts outside the sciences from including, but not limited to, arts and humanities. “The way we educate scientists, fundamentally, would shift; ideally, we all would be working together and breaking open those boxes and constraints as well. I think being encouraged and empowered to think differently as a scientist is essential, and ultimately science is supposed to be about asking critical questions and testing hypotheses. But all too often, what happens in science is you just follow behind the scientist who came before you where you take dominant theories for granted and don’t necessarily try to implode them or explode them.”
Stating the relevance of their research for the public, Gómez says, “any behaviour or characteristic, no matter how unique we think it is to human beings, can be studied scientifically in a calm, disinterested and rigorous manner.

My proposal for seat-sharing was turned down by them on the first day. We have already decided to go solo in the elections in Bengal. We will decide about a national approach after the elections.""
Mamata claims Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, who is presently undertaking Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, did not inform her about the rally which is set to pass through the state.
""I am a part of the INDIA alliance but I haven't been even informed that the rally is passing through our state,"" said the TMC supremo.
Though earlier several reports had claimed TMC might offer two seats in North Bengal to Congress, later Mamata had asked her party to prepare for polls even in Congress' stronghold Murshidabad, which was speculated to have been opted out by the state's ruling party.
The announcement came from Mamata just a day after Rahul claimed he and his party share a ""good relationship"" with the TMC supremo and the seat-sharing talks are underway.
West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee says ""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone.

""Yes, at times, some conflicting comments come from either side. These are natural things. These are not the things that are going to disrupt anything,"" Rahul said.
Though the Congress top brass' bonhomie with Mamata was visible, the main opposition party's Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal's Baharampur, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, a staunch opponent of TMC chief, was consistent in attacking the state Chief Minister on all fronts.
Even after Rahul highlighted his equation with Mamata was good on Tuesday, Adhir called the TMC head an ""opportunist"".
Adhir, who is Congress' Lok Sabha floor leader, said the party will not fight in West Bengal at the ""mercy of Mamata Banerjee"".
Congress hopeful of having Mamata on board
Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, ""Mamata-ji said she is hellbent to defeat BJP. When we are undertaking long travels, speed breakers, red signals often come. It doesn't mean we will stop the journey. We overcome speed breakers.
""Rahul Gandhi has already made it clear that TMC is an important member of the INDIA alliance. We can't imagine INDIA alliance without Mamata-ji. INDIA alliance will be there in West Bengal and all parties will be a part of it.""

Mamata desperate, says BJP
Taking a dig at Mamata's decision and the opposition alliance, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya posted on X, ""Mamata Banerjee’s decision to fight alone in West Bengal is a sign of desperation. Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats, in the hope that she can still be relevant, after the polls.
""Much against her desire to emerge as the face of the Opposition alliance, no one ever proposed her name. Her several trips to Delhi, to build a national profile, didn’t work. She just couldn’t hide the blood of post poll violence and rid herself of the nauseating stink of appeasement politics. An embarrassed Mamata, to save face, pitched for Mallikarjun Kharge, ruling herself out in the process. She realised, despite her bluster, she had no currency in the Opposition camp and had been building ground to snap out for long.""
""But the fact that her announcement to go solo comes just before Rahul Gandhi’s circus arrives in Bengal, is a death knell for I.N.D.I Alliance…,"" he added.

In the 2019 General Elections, Mamata's TMC had received a jolt as her tally of seats went down to 22 of 42 seats while BJP won 18, the highest ever figure it recorded in the state.
But it is important to note, Mamata stormed back to power a couple of years later with over 200 of 294 seats and won most of the subsequent by-elections in the state over the last two-three years.
AAP follows Mamata in Punjab
In a further jolt to the INDIA alliance, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann announced AAP, which came to power in 2022 thrashing Congress, will fight in all 13 seats alone.
Addressing the media, Mann said, “We have nothing to do with Congress in Punjab.”
""Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will win the elections on all 13 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Punjab will become a hero in the country,"" he said."

He had joined the Congress ahead of the 2023 Karnataka assembly poll last year after being denied a ticket by the BJP.
Shivakumar, however, hinted that he is also not keeping quiet and several BJP leaders who want to join the Congress are in talks with him.
The Karnataka Congress President did not disclose the names of the BJP leaders who have been in touch with him. ""Should I read the list...let's not do it now.""
He also said that the Congress gave Shettar a ticket to contest the assembly election by sacrificing party loyalists, and yet his party made him an MLC.
""We were aware of BJP leaders contacting him from the last two or three months, and he kept saying he would not go. The day before yesterday I had spoken to him, but all of a sudden, he announced quitting the party,"" the DyCM said.
Shivakumar said Shetar's resignation from the Congress will not have any bearing, and on the contrary, the party leaders are happy over his desertion to the BJP.
Congress will give the seat vacated by Shettar to a loyal Congress worker, he added.
However, Shivakumar said that Laxman Savadi who had joined the Congress ahead of the last state assembly election will remain with his party.
Taking a dig at JDS and its leader HD Kumaraswamy for aligning with BJP, the Deputy Chief Minister accused them of bringing down the Congress-JDS government with the saffron party's help.

From celebrities to politicians and seers, Ayodhya is currently overwhelmed by people from far and wide places who hope to witness a watershed religious event that will mark the course of the nation in the coming months. Many of them arrived in private jets for the ceremony.
A majority of Hindus claimed that the site was the birthplace of Lord Ram before Muslim Mughals razed a temple at the spot to build the Babri Masjid.
In a landmark verdict in 2019, the Supreme Court handed over the land to the Hindu community and ordered to allot a separate plot to Muslims.
The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.
It also witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict."

SLN72MZPN7_AOLUTHWBNK4U4IG,"I did not consciously set out to write ecocritical poems, says poet-academic Ajanta Paul",India Blooms News Service,"24 Jan 2024, 11:10 am",20240124,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/life-details/LIT/7651/i-did-not-consciously-set-out-to-write-ecocritical-poems-says-poet-academic-ajanta-paul.html,"Her most recent anthologies of poetry, Beached Driftwood: 75 Poems and Earth Elegies, a book of ecocritical poems, were published in December 2023 and January 2024 respectively and will see their formal launches at the Kolkata International Book Fair, 2024. Dr Paul says, although poetry has niche readership, the digital age has definitely not sounded its death knell. Rather, it has offered re-invented platforms for its discussion and propagation. IBNS correspondent Supriyo Hazra caught up with her on the eve of her first book launch on January 22.
You just had back-to-back unveilings of two anthologies of poetry at the Kolkata International Book Fair. Please walk us through your literary career – a kind of a timeline tracing your entire journey and evolution as a poet.
Well, I began writing poetry in my youth, with some of the pieces having been published in Youth Times and The Telegraph Colour Magazine. Thereafter, my attention was claimed largely by critical/academic writings, and I moved away from poetry, except for the occasional piece of poetic prose. It's in the last ten years, or so, that I have returned to my first love. A volume of poetic plays - The Eternal Journey was published by Salesian College Publications in 2013. From the Singing Bowl of the Soul: Fifty Poems was published in 2023 by Setu, Pittsburgh. And recently I had two back to back releases, as you say. In December, 2023 Beached Driftwood: 75 Poemswas published by Hawakal Publishers, and in January this year Earth Elegies, a book of ecocritical poems was brought out by Penprints Publications.
Your book of fiction, a compilation of short stories, The Elixir Maker & Other Stories, was published in 2018. But you seem to be more inclined towards poetry. Any particular reasons?
I feel poems are easier to write, being slighter in structure, and requiring its truth, or aesthetic integrity to be sustained for that brief moment of its physical being. They can be composed on the go, on the backs of envelopes or any scrap of paper when the inspiration seizes you. Fiction, on the other hand, requires more time, attention and careful crafting, and even after such an investment it may not attract the attention it merits.
Tell us a bit about these two new anthologies – Beached Driftwood and Earth Elegies. What sets them apart from each other? What inspired you to write each? What message are you conveying through each?
Both Beached Driftwood and Earth Elegies have, more or less, the same range of genres and styles, moving freely between the impassioned lyric, the ironical monologue or the improvised villanelle. However, while the former engages with a variety of themes, Earth Elegies is exclusively focused on the environment, and the crisis that it's facing. It's not that I consciously set out to write eco-poetry, but I realized at a certain point, that a great many of the poems in my notebook had to do, in some way or the other, with the ecology, and that's when it struck me that I could bring out a separate book of ecocritical poems.
Apart from being a prolific writer and poet, you are deeply into academics, heading a leading girls’ college in Kolkata. How do you balance such a busy and demanding profession with your literary pursuits?
I don't necessarily see administration and writing as occupational binaries, at variance with each other. Though intrinsically different they can be complementary activities, too, that are mutually reinforcing, the one dovetailing into the other in a more or less seamless extension. Even as art and life may equably co-exist, the cultivation of the creative temper can bring a calmness of spirit to an otherwise fraught job. And, definitely, it's a luxury to escape into creative flights now and then to recharge one's battery.
What sets a poet apart from a fiction writer? How different are the creative sensibilities, or are they?
Let me address the second part of the question, first. The poetic sensibility, deeply imaginative, sees poetry everywhere. It configures visions from the slightest cerebral or sensory suggestions. Poetry becomes a way of seeing, and in a sense, more than seeing, as it often affords insights and epiphanies out of proportion to its materials. The sensibility of the fiction writer, on the other hand, does not always teeter on the brink of an awakening, not being called upon to exemplify the intensity of vision associated with poetry. The difference lies not in kind but in degree.
Now, to return to the first part of the question, I think it's the poet's relationship with language that sets him apart. Language is a site that both resists and reaches out. It is the writer's native soil where he feels most at home even as it is that magic portal which admits him into another world. How he resolves the contradictions in his attitude to language is key to an understanding of his poetic persona. Moreover, the language of poetry is also a kind of music, replete with pitch and tone. How the poet exploits this aural quality for best effect is, what I feel, sets the poet apart from the fiction writer.

Which writers and poets did you admire while growing up and why? Have they influenced your literary sensibilities in any way?
Brought up in a Bengali household I was naturally exposed to some of the great literary masters in the language. Then there were the British writers. Later, I came across the European ones in translation; American poets and novelists such as Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath and Ernest Hemingway; African American ones like Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Gloria Naylor; not to mention the Indian writers in English such as Jayanta Mahapatra, Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth, Arundhati Roy and others. More than any particular writer, it was generally the world of books which admitted me into a parallel realm of vicarious experience, stimulating and sustaining me at the same time.
How would you describe yourself as a poet – any particular genre that you could belong to? Do you experiment with various forms of poetry or have you tried any new technique with your poetry?
In terms of formal genre I would associate myself with modern poetry with its free verse, terse imagery and modulated use of voice. I'm not overly experimental though am interested in harnessing sound effects through the occasional rhyme, resonance and rhetorical figure which contribute to the auditory impact of a poem. From the point of view of sensibility I would say I share an affiliation with the post-colonial writer and the anxieties thereof. At the same time, being a member of several virtual communities of poets (predominantly American) I may have been unconsciously influenced by the apparent sparseness of the North American literary utterance, and its penchant for an understated evocation of truth.
How well is poetry received amongst readers today, in this highly digital age where social media has truly narrowed our attention span?
Poetry is written, published, bought, read, shared and promoted by a handful of like-minded people. It has a niche readership, and does not sell. That said, it continues to be important which explains the number of poetry books published every year despite the lack of a corresponding demand, not to mention the literary criticism generated by the same. The digital age, far from sounding the death knell for poetry, has in fact, reinvented modes of its propagation through online literary journals, virtual communities, open mics, poetry slams and Instagram accounts. Poetry is the artful intelligence of our times.
Which is your favourite piece of work from amongst your portfolio and why?
I'm afraid I don't have one, and since I keep revising my writings compulsively I usually end up disliking what I had written earlier.
You will be a participant at this year’s Kolkata Literary Meet (KLM 2024). What are your feelings on this?
I'm happy and proud to be a panelist at the Poetry Medley session of KLM to be held later this month at the Victoria Memorial. Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet is a prestigious event, one of the city's annual dates with literature and culture, and I'm looking forward to participating in it.
Tell us about your future plans for publication and literary pursuits. Would you return to fiction yet again in future?
Of course, fiction is a serious contender for poetry, as far as I'm concerned. I did not leave fiction, as it happens. It's just that several volumes of poetry came to be published serendipitously around the same time. An edited anthology of English short stories by contemporary Indian writers is on the anvil. Plus, I have a book of short stories ready for publication.
What is your message to your readers and aspiring poets, in this digital era?
Read till you drop, for books (in whatever format you use) are amongst those few things in life which will lift you up."

Over the last two days, two key leaders  Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal have announced to contest alone in the Lok Sabha polls ruling out any alliance with the Congress and saying they would go solo in Bengal and Punjab.
Kumar may even share the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his February 4 rally in Bettiah, said reports.
He has even called all his MLAs to Patna.
According to reports, the party now has two options either to dissolve the assembly and hold assembly elections alongside the Lok Sabha elections or to allow Kumar to continue as the Chief Minister which is being greatly resisted by the party's local leaders.
The majority mark in the 243-member Bihar assembly is 122. The RJD has 79 seats.  Kumar can form the government with 82 seats of the BJP and 45 of his Janata Dal-United. Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal has 79 seats.
Amid the political tumult, the Bihar Governor, who was to travel to Goa tomorrow evening, has cancelled his plans.
On Wednesday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee dropped a bombshell, switching her Trinamool Congress off from the anti-Bharatiya Janata Party national alliance, INDIA, in West Bengal, slamming the principal opposition force Congress just months ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
In an outburst of her anger in front of the media, Mamata, who held an administrative meeting in Burdwan on Wednesday, said in clear words, ""I had no talk with anyone. My proposal for seat-sharing was turned down by them on the first day. We have already decided to go solo in the elections in Bengal. We will decide about a national approach after the elections.""
Following suit, in a further jolt to the INDIA alliance, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann announced AAP, which came to power in 2022 thrashing Congress, will fight in all 13 seats in the state alone.
Addressing the media, Mann said, “We have nothing to do with Congress in Punjab.”
""Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will win the elections on all 13 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Punjab will become a hero in the country,"" he said."

""Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,"" says the message as quoted by BBC.
It is still not clear who created the audio.
The New Hampshire attorney general's office reacted to the development and issued a statement which read: ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications.""
""The message appears to have been “spoofed” to falsely show that it had been sent by the treasurer of a political committee that has been supporting the New Hampshire Democratic Presidential Primary write-in efforts for President Biden. The message’s content directed recipients who wished to be removed from a calling list to call the number belonging to this person,"" the statement said.
The office said the messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters.
""New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely. Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election,"" the statement said.
The investigation comes after a prominent New Hampshire Democrat, whose personal cellphone number showed up on the caller ID screens of those receiving the call, filed a complaint, reported NBC News.
The message concludes with a phone number belonging to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair who now runs a super PAC supporting the campaign to urge New Hampshire Democrats to write in Biden’s name in the primary, the news channel reported.
Kathy Sullivan described the act as an 'unpardonable sin'.
Kathy Sullivan posted on X: ""Interfering with the right to vote is disrespectful to them, and an unpardonable sin. So, to whoever called NH voters and told them not to vote tomorrow? No matter what you may think, you aren't a patriot. You don't love freedom. You don't get what America is about.""
Fraudulent calls ranged from 5,000 to 25,000
Anti-robocall application Nomorobo's CEO Aaron Foss told CNN their data showed that 76% of the robocalls targeted New Hampshire, with 12% directed at Boston and the remaining 12% covering other areas.
The application estimated the number of these fraudulent calls ranged from 5,000 to 25,000.
The campaign of Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is challenging Biden for the nomination, told NBC it was not aware of the calls.
“Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” spokesperson Katie Dolan told the news channel. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.”
A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign also denied involvement to the incident."

In an unprecedented instance, Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay accused his colleague, Justice Soumen Sen who presided over a division bench that stayed a single-judge order for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into medical admission irregularities, of working for the ruling political party in Bengal.
Justice Sen stayed an order passed by Justice Gangopadhyay, who had ordered a probe by the CBI into allegations of fake caste certificates being issued in Bengal.
However, after his order was stayed by Justice Sen's division bench, Justice Gangopadhyay took up the matter again and ordered the CBI to take up the probe.
In his later order, Justice Gangopadhyay not only ignored the Division Bench's order but also asked for a relook by the Supreme Court into the orders passed by Justice Sen whom he accused of working for a political party.
""Justice Sen is clearly working for some political party in this state. Therefore, if the Honorable Supreme Court thinks so, then there is a need to re-look at the orders passed in cases related to the state. What Justice Sen has done today is to further his personal interest to save some political party in power in this state. Therefore, his actions clearly amount to misconduct,"" Justice Gangopadhyay said.
Justice Gangopadhyay also questioned why Justice Sen remained a Calcutta High Court judge despite a Supreme Court Collegium recommending his transfer in 2021.
In his order, Justice Gangopadhyay revealed a purported private chat between judges.
He alleged that Justice Sen called Justice Amrita Sinha to his chambers on the last day before the recent court vacation and told her that Abhishek Banerjee has a political future and that he shouldn't be disturbed."

VSH4GDY58D_BEINDC6BNLJR3F2,The deafening silence of West in face of Pannun’s violent threats,India Blooms News Service,"22 Jan 2024, 03:11 pm",20240122,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/O/94458/the-deafening-silence-of-west-in-face-of-pannun-s-violent-threats.html,"What’s perplexing is this is not the first violent rant of Pannun’s. Last year he openly called for an attack on Air India flights, and subsequently he threatened an attack on the Indian parliament.
Free speech is a cornerstone of democratic societies, but it is not an unbridled license to spew hate speech and incite violence. Pannun’s recent video message, in which he threatens political death to Chief Ministers Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann if his associates are not released, should ring alarm bells not just in India but across the globe. As former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton astutely remarked, “You can’t have snakes in your backyard and expect them not to bite you.”
SFJ associates, Jagdish Singh, Manjeet Singh, and Davinder Singh, were apprehended by the State Special Operation Cell of Punjab Police. Pannun alleges they were working directly with the Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) for Khalistan referendum’s voter registration. His threats are not isolated incidents; they are part of a pattern of violent rhetoric that poses a clear danger to the security and stability of the region.
The West’s silence on Pannun’s threats is particularly troubling given the global commitment to combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of nations. Pannun’s call for an attack on Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav cannot be dismissed lightly. These are not idle words but dangerous incitements that have the potential to unleash chaos and destabilize the peace-loving citizens of Punjab and beyond.
While Chief Minister Mann has chosen not to take these threats seriously, the international community cannot afford to be as complacent. The West’s failure to condemn Pannun’s actions sends a troubling message — that terrorism and violent threats are tolerable if they are not occurring within one’s borders. Such a stance undermines the collective effort to ensure global security and stability.
It is essential for the West to acknowledge that free speech should never be a shield for those who exploit it to spread hate and advocate violence. The principles of democracy, which the West holds dear, must not be weaponized to shield terrorists and those who threaten political leaders with impunity.
As Pannun continues to openly defy the norms of civilized discourse, the West’s silence becomes increasingly conspicuous. The international community must stand united against all forms of terrorism, irrespective of geographical boundaries. The West cannot afford to turn a blind eye to Pannun’s brazen threats; doing so jeopardizes the very values it claims to uphold. It’s time for the West to break its silence and unequivocally condemn Pannun’s actions before his words translate into tragic consequences for the region and beyond.

He suffered a major loss in the Iowa phase of the primary which was clinched by Trump.
DeSantis, who was observed by many as a potential alternative to Trump for the presidential poll later this year, said in a video post on X: ""Today I am suspending my campaign.""
""It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" he said.
He said: ""While, I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.""
Nikki Haley factor
Nikki Haley currently stands as the only challenge for Trump to secure a Republican nomination and fight for the presidential seat.
Reacting to the development following Ron DeSantis withdrawal from the race, Haley told CNN: ""There’s two people in this race. That’s what we wanted all along. We are going to keep on going.""
According to CNN poll, Trump is leading Haley in New Hampshire by 11 points."

According to reports, he commented on Snapchat when he was on his way to the island of Menorca with friends in July 2022.
The message, sent before Mr Verma departed Gatwick airport, read as quoted by BBC: ""On my way to blow up the plane (I'm a member of the Taliban).""
During the hearing, he told the Madrid court that he never intended to cause public distress or public harm.
If found guilty, the university student faces a hefty bill for expenses after two Spanish Air Force jets were scrambled, BBC reported.
The UK  security services reportedly flagged the information to Spanish authorities after the message was picked up by them.
A court in Madrid heard it was assumed the message triggered alarm bells after being picked up via Gatwick's Wi-Fi network, the British media reported.
The court was informed that two  Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft after the message was received.
One of the jets followed the flight till it landed in Menorca. The plane was searched extensively there.
Verma, who was 18 at the time of the incident, was arrested.
After being kept in the police cell for two days, he was later released on bail.
British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 questioned him after he arrived in the UK.
He later returned to his home in Kent.
Appearing in court on Monday (January 22, 2024), Verma - who is now studying economics at Bath University - said the message was 'a joke in a private group setting', reported BBC.
""It was just sent to my friends I was travelling with on the day,"" the Indian-origin student was quoted as saying by BBC.
""Since school, it's been a joke because of my features... It was just to make people laugh,"" he said.
Police experts told the court that they combed Verma's phone and, although they found that he had researched clashes between Pakistan and India and the possibilities of an Islamic State attack in that area, they did not find anything of interest that linked Verma to jihadist radicalism, reported BBC.
He is not facing jail terms or terrorism charges.
However, he could be fined up to €22,500 (£19,300) if found guilty and the Spanish defence ministry is demanding €95,000 in expenses, reported BBC."

The facility will subsequently extend its downstream solutions portfolio to include Welded Wire Mesh and Bore Pile Cages, thus establishing itself as a “One-Stop Downstream Construction Service Center.”
It has been built in collaboration with the company's channel partner Samrat Irons Pvt. Ltd.
This facility is the first such centre from Tata Steel in the south.
The company has similar facilities in Cuttack (East) and Ghaziabad (North) opened for business last year.
The Cuttack facility, spread over 11 acres, has a monthly capacity of 3,000 MT, while the one in Ghaziabad can process 3,500 MT of steel products in a month.

In a landmark verdict in 2019, the Supreme Court handed over the land to the Hindu community and ordered to allot a separate plot to Muslims.

The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.
It also witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict."
