Iran has summoned the British charge d'affaires over recent sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom against the Islamic Republic.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that it had summoned the chargÃ© d'affaires of the British Embassy in Tehran "following the recent imposition of sanctions by the UK against three Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity."
The development came just a day after the UK imposed sanctions against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF) Unit 700 over alleged conduct aimed at destabilizing the UK or any other country.
London also imposed sanctions against three Iranian individuals, namely Hamid Fazeli and Behnam Shahriyari over having alleged intention of destabilizing Israel, and Abdolfatah Ahvazian over the alleged intention of destabilizing the UK.
"The condemnation of these actions, which are contrary to the new UK government's claimed policy of willingness to engage and cooperate, was expressed," the Iranian ministry said it had informed the British chargÃ© d'affaires.
"It was also emphasized that everyone knows the largest source of insecurity in the region is the Zionist occupying regime, which is supported politically and militarily by some who claim to maintain stability in the region, including the UK," the Iranian ministry said.
"The support of these countries for the genocide of Palestinians and their efforts to prevent accountability for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, the war criminal, are the basis of instability and insecurity in the region," the ministry stated.
