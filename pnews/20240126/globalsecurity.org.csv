00ZQ683CLC_JR6M1T8O1TLBRO0,Military battalion camp seized by Kachin rebels in Myanmar's Shan state,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240125-rfa01.htm,"The capture gives ethnic armies control of a key trade route leading to the border with China.
By RFA Burmese 2024.01.25 -- An ethnic army has captured the military camp of the junta's Light Infantry Battalion No. 123 in northern Myanmar's Shan state, residents and the rebel group said Thursday, capping months of fighting for control of a key trade route with China.
The loss of the base means that ethnic rebels now control the entire 130-kilometer (80-mile) trade route from Muse township on the border with China to Hseni, located some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of northern Shan state's largest town of Lashio.
It is also the latest in a number of setbacks for the military since an ethnic offensive in late October that has seen the Three Brotherhood Alliance capture 15 cities in northern Shan state, seize control of more than 200 military camps, and force the surrender of some 4,000 junta troops.
The Kachin Independence Army, or KIA, took control of the camp on Wednesday evening after initially overrunning Nam Hpat Kar town on Jan. 17, KIA spokesman Col. Naw Bu told RFA Burmese.
""We heard that the military camp at Nam Hpat Kar was seized around 3 p.m. or 4 p.m., but we haven't received any details from the field yet,"" he said. ""We haven't been able to get a phone connection through.""
A resident of Nam Hpat Kar who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, told RFA that KIA soldiers entered the military compound on Wednesday, prompting junta troops to flee toward nearby Tarmoenye township.
""I'm sure the KIA troops are now stationed at Light Infantry Battalion No. 123 camp,"" he said. ""Since the troops retreated toward Tarmoenye, they are following them and clearing them out. The damage to the village is huge.""
Ethnic rebels began attacking Nam Hpat Kar township in late August, but the KIA only started the fight for control of the Light Infantry Battalion camp on Jan. 14. Junta forces responded to attacks on the camp with heavy artillery and airstrikes, residents said.
The KIA claimed on Jan. 16 that it was able to shoot down a junta jet fighter during fighting in the area.
Civilian casualties
Another resident of Nam Hpat Kar, who was forced to leave his home amid the fighting, told RFA that the military airstrikes destroyed area homes and caused civilian casualties.
""The [KIA] also broke into the houses and fired from inside of them, so the military attacked the houses based on information they received,"" he said. ""At the moment, out of the eight houses I know [were fired on], four were reduced to ashes. The rest of the houses no longer have walls or roofs.""
The resident said at least two civilians were killed in the fighting, but was unable to provide additional details. He said villagers are afraid to return home because of the threat of additional airstrikes.
More than 20,000 people live in Nam Hpat Kar, which consists of four wards and nine village tracts.
Aid workers said that some 10,000 residents of villagers close to the military camp were forced to flee to monasteries in the townships of Namhkan, Muse, Lashio and other nearby areas amid the clashes.
Another resident of Nam Hpat Kar told RFA that, as of Jan. 17, he had documented the deaths of at least 24 civilians due to military airstrikes and artillery fire, and said at least 100 homes had been damaged.
A social worker who fled from Nam Hpat Kar due to the fighting said on Thursday that the number of casualties and extent of the damage had yet to be fully accounted for, due to severed internet and telephone lines.
The junta has not released any statement about the situation in Nam Hpat Kar.
KIA demonstrates importance
A former military officer, who now works as a commentator on military and political issues in Myanmar, said that the capture of the camp in Nam Hpat Kar is a demonstration of the junta's increasing weakness in the region.
""The attack took 10 days, and we should praise the bravery [of the junta troops] who resisted it,"" he said.
But he criticized the military's leadership for failing to do enough to hold the camp.
""[Nearby] Kutkai and Namhkan [townships were] seized by the [Ta'ang National Liberation Army],"" the former officer said, referring to one of the three ethnic armies that, along with the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army, form the Three Brotherhood Alliance.
""Now, Nam Hpat Kar, which is located at the top of the road heading to Namhkan, has been captured. So now it is all done, and [the KIA] has demonstrated the importance of its role [in fighting the military],"" he said.
In the five months of fighting between ethnic armies and the junta for Nam Hpat Kar, more than 50 civilians - including women and children - were killed, according to residents.

Monday, 22 January 2024 10:07 AM
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned a deadly Ukraine's shelling of a market on the outskirts of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.
A spokesperson for the UN chief said on Sunday that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
""The Secretary-General strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today's shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine, which reportedly killed at least 25 people and injured more than 20 others,"" the spokesperson said.
""Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable, and must stop immediately.""
On Sunday, the busy market in Donetsk came under artillery shelling by Ukrainian troops. According to the Head of the Russian-administrated areas of the Donetsk region Denis Pushilin, Ukrainian troops used 152mm and 155mm artillery systems. As a result, at least 27 people were killed and 25 more were wounded.
The Kremlin said the Ukrainian strike on civilians in Donetsk using non-precision weapons shows Kiev's vicious side.
Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, also said that Ukraine's shelling of Donetsk would be brought up at a UN Security Council meeting.
Pushilin announced a day of mourning on Monday in Donetsk, one of the four pro-Moscow regions that separated from Ukraine and joined Russia in a 2022 referendum.
In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry called the attack ""a barbaric act of terrorism"" by Ukraine that was carried out ""with the use of weapons supplied by the West.""
""The Russian side categorically condemns this treacherous strike against the civilian population,"" the ministry statement added.
After Russian troops began their special military operation in Donbas in February 2022, the US-led Western allies largely increased the supply of arms and munitions to Kiev, sending multiple shipments of guns and ammo worth tens of billions of dollars."
01SYWOKX3Q_M5X6PNN2KHBLJ6U,Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing,_,_,20230125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240123-dod01.htm,"January 23, 2024 Transcript
MAJOR GENERAL PAT RYDER: Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few things at the top, and then we'll get right to your questions. Earlier today, Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Brown hosted the 18th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group virtually, which comprises 50 plus countries who came together, or come together rather, monthly to coordinate security assistance for Ukraine.
The contact group continues to make a collective impact on the international military support to Ukraine as they continue to defend themselves from Russia's unprovoked war of aggression. In total, this coalition has committed more than $80 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, and important work continues via the capability coalitions focused on Ukraine's air force, artillery, maritime operations, ground-based air defense demining, and information technology.
In his opening comments for today's contact group, Secretary Austin reaffirmed U.S. support for a free, secure, and sovereign Ukraine, and that we will continue to work hard alongside international allies and partners to ensure that Ukraine receives the capabilities it needs to protect its citizens and defend its sovereignty for the winter and beyond.
Separately, as you heard us announce last night in a joint statement, the U.S. and UK, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, conducted strikes yesterday against eight Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the Iranian regime backed Houthi's continued attacks against international and commercial shipping, as well as naval vessels transiting the Red Sea.
These strikes were precise, proportionate, and intended to further disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis have been using to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners. Targets included a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthi's missile and air surveillance capabilities. Of note, shortly after taking these strikes, an additional Houthi target was struck by the U.S. in self-defense, destroying an anti-ship cruise missile that was prepared to launch and which presented an imminent threat to vessels operating in the region.
Again, our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea. But as our joint statement yesterday emphasized, we will not hesitate to defend the lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats. With that, I'm happy to take your questions. We'll go to Associated Press, Lolita.
Q: Thank you. Two things, Pat. One, can you give us an update on Secretary Austin's condition and any estimated expected time that he will return to the building? Do you want to do that first?
GEN. RYDER: Sure. In terms of return to the building, I don't have anything to announce today. Of course, we'll continue to keep you updated. The Secretary continues to recuperate from home. He's recovering well. As I highlighted last week, part of his care at home continues to be physical therapy. But again, we'll keep you updated on his return date to the Pentagon.
Q: And secondly, on the strikes last night. First, just clarification on what you just said. The additional unilateral strike, how long after that the initial barrage did that happen? And then can you provide a more detailed BDA at this point? Last night, they weren't able to say much about what they thought the impact of the strikes were.
GEN. RYDER: Sure, in terms of the self-defense strike, rough number, probably within 15 to 30 minutes of the main operation there. In terms of post-strike assessments, CENTCOM is continuing to assess the outcomes of the strikes. So, I don't have anything specific on that other than to say that we believe that we achieved good effects.
I can tell you that since January 11, we've assessed, we assessed that we've destroyed or degraded over 25 missile launch and deployment facilities, more than 20 missiles plus we've struck unmanned aerial, vehicle, coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities, as well as weapon storage areas with good effects. We'll continue to assess and provide you updates as we're able to. Tom?
Q: First of all, Pat. Can you give us an estimate of how much Houthis have been degraded by the numbers you just gave out, percentage wise? Ballpark?
GEN. RYDER: Again, Tom, I can't go into the specifics in terms of the totality of their capabilities and provide percentages other than, again, it's fairly significant when you look at the missile launch and deployment facilities, missiles, you're talking over 50 when you add those numbers together, in addition to the other capabilities. So, clearly a degradation of capability.
We have been very focused on targeting the kinds of things that they've been employing or using to conduct attacks against international shipping and mariners, and that will continue to be our focus. And so, the last Houthi attack that I'm tracking was on 18th of January. So, five days ago. As you know, since that time we have taken several self-defense strikes, when there was an imminent threat or an anticipated launch. But again, we'll continue to stay focused on that.
Q: Give us an update on al-Assad damage assessment? And also, there were two service members wounded. What's their status? And then I guess you're going to be monitoring others for TBI, potentially numbers. And finally, was this the first time ballistic missiles were fired at U.S. personnel in Iraq?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah. Thanks, Tom. So, a couple things there. So, in terms of the al-Assad and the attack that we saw over the weekend, to my knowledge, no significant damage to the facilities. I am tracking reports today of another attack at al-Assad, which were, heard those reports. We're looking into it, and so we'll have more to provide on that as it becomes available. In terms of the personnel that were injured in the attack over the weekend, at the time, we were tracking two U.S. service personnel that suffered TBI.
Since then, we have identified two additional service members for a total of four. To my knowledge, all have returned to duty at this point. But again, as you've seen in these kinds of things in the past, those numbers can fluctuate, so we'll continue to pay attention to that.
Q: And ballistic missiles?
GEN. RYDER: The last -- the last ballistic missile attacks were in November, November 21 of last year, also at al-Assad. Jennifer?
Q: Pat, what kind of drones are the Houthis using? Are they the same Iranian drones that are being used and shipped to Ukraine?
GEN. RYDER: Jennifer, I don't have the specific variant, but based on -- based on my understanding, these are one way attack drones of Iranian origin.
Q: Ok. Can you explain just generally the challenges that Ukraine will face, if it doesn't get more military aid soon?
GEN. RYDER: Sure. You know, obviously, the continued lack of funding has forced us to pause drawing down additional items from our inventories, given the implications for our own military readiness. And this, of course, prevents us from meeting Ukraine's most urgent battlefield needs to include things like artillery rounds, anti-tank weapons, air defense interceptors.
Also, without additional funding, it prevents us from being able to provide systems and equipment to meet both their medium- and longer-term requirements and help them sustain systems that we've previously provided to them. And so, again, we will continue to work closely with Congress and urge supplemental funding as soon as possible.
Q: Will they lose if they don't get more weapons?
GEN. RYDER: Well, I don't want to predict the outcomes on the battlefield. Obviously, Ukraine has a vote when it comes to fighting on the battlefield, but clearly, the threat is real. And I think, the fact that Russia continues to demonstrate an intent to fight against Ukraine and to occupy Ukraine and to eliminate Ukraine as a country highlights the fact that this is a serious security threat that is not going to go away. So, the sooner that we're able to continue to provide the levels of support that we have, the better, not only for Ukraine, but for the international community.
Q: This is the first time U.S. has not been able to pledge anything to the contact group. Was anything pledged today? Any long range weapons? Any more Abrams tanks?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah, I'm not tracking any specific material support, but of course, we do continue to provide support, for example, training, and of course, leadership via the capability coalitions that I highlighted in the topper. But the point is, in order for us to provide the capabilities that Ukraine needs on the battlefield today, but also in the longer term, we would really appreciate the support of Congress. Thank you. Carla?
Q: Thank you. The U.S. Secretary General just now is talking about the conflict in the Middle East. He's mentioning the Houthis, he's mentioning the U.S. and the UK strikes. He's mentioning what's going on with striking in Iraq, both Israelis and the United States. And he's urging all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict. What's the Pentagon's response to that?
GEN. RYDER: Well, Carla, we've been working for a very long time on regional security and stability, not only in the Middle East, but around the world. And so, we'll continue to work very closely with allies and partners globally to address tensions in the Middle East. Since Hamas's attack against Israel, of course, we've been very focused on deterrence and on preventing a wider regional conflict, and we'll stay focused on that.
Q: And what about his words on the brink? Is the U.S. on the brink of war right now in the Middle East?
GEN. RYDER: We are not at war in the Middle East. Clearly, there are significant tensions in the Middle East, and again, we're working closely with allies and partners to deescalate and reduce those tensions where we can, recognizing the fact that, you know, others have a vote as well. Natasha?
Q: Thank you General Ryder. Two quick things. So, on the strikes last night, were there any casualties that resulted from the U.S. (inaudible) strikes, including whether that's militants or civilians (inaudible)?
GEN. RYDER: On the civilian side, I'm not tracking any civilian casualties. Of course, we're continuing to assess, Natasha. I just don't have any numbers to provide in terms of potential Houthi militant casualties. But again, that's something we'll continue to assess.
Q: (inaudible) since they were -- 18th, I believe you said. Is that because the U.S. is just continuing to kind of take out their missiles and missile launchers as and when they see them kind of loading up and preparing to launch an attack, or is it because the Houthis simply don't have that capability anymore, or it's more difficult for them to launch these missiles? What is kind of the thinking behind why they haven't been launching as many?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah, I mean, that's really a question for the Houthis to answer. Clearly, our goal here is to disrupt and degrade their ability to conduct those kinds of strikes and to put that kind of pressure, especially when there's an imminent threat, I think does have an effect. They do maintain some capability.
So, it's not out of the question that there could be additional strikes. But again, our goal here is to ensure that the Red Sea is safe and secure for international shipping and mariners. That is our only goal. And so, again, we'll continue to work with our allies and partners toward that end. Thank you. Let me go this side of the room. Phil?
Q: Do you have any sense of when or if Secretary Austin will brief this press corps?
GEN. RYDER: Phil, very aware of the request, and I'll keep you updated on that. I do not have a date for you to provide right now.
Q: And on the attacks in Iraq, I mean, is there have been any communication between this department and the Iraqi government about the need to find the people who are responsible for launching ballistic missiles at U.S. base and U.S. forces?
GEN. RYDER: Well, Phil, I mean, we've had regular and ongoing discussions with our Iraqi partners on the topic of U.S. forces in Iraq and their safety and security. And so, those conversations, of course, will continue.
Q: Have you been notified of any Iraqi government plans to end the U.S. mission in Iraq?
GEN. RYDER: At this time, I'm not aware of any official notifications to the department.
Q: Thanks, General. What do you think your expectation that this dynamic in the Red Sea is going to continue until there's a sustained ceasefire in Gaza? In other words, are you expecting -- is the off ramp going to be a settlement in Gaza? How long do you think it's going to go on for?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah, well, obviously, I don't want to stand up here and predict the future. You've heard me talk about what our goal is, which is to ensure that international shipping and mariners can transit this vital waterway safely and securely. And so, we'll continue to work toward that end, both through Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is a defensive coalition to help safeguard shipping, but also with the international community, to conduct strikes against Houthi military targets that are being employed in these attacks when we need to.
And so, that will remain our focus. We're not looking to go beyond that. And of course, the Houthis have a vote in this as well, and they could make the choice to stop imposing costs on themselves and their capabilities and stop these attacks immediately.
Q: So, there's a distinction between Operation Prosperity Guardian and what we saw yesterday?
GEN. RYDER: Correct.
Q: And the name of that operation?
GEN. RYDER: There is no departmental named operation for the strikes last night.
Q: I know you don't want to get into the extent to which the Houthis have been degraded, but can you give a sense of how long it might take them to replenish their stocks once this is all over?
GEN. RYDER: I can't give you that, for a few reasons. One, I'm just not going to get into intelligence in terms of their resupply and refresh rates. Obviously, that's something that we'll keep a close eye on. But these strikes, from a physical standpoint, are having an impact on their ability to conduct attacks, as well as diplomatic and international standpoint. You know, economic standpoint. So, again, our focus here is not to escalate or get into a conflict with the Houthis. Our goal is to prevent these continued attacks against the international community and international shipping transiting the Red Sea.
Dan, did you have a question?
Q: Yeah, I guess this particular Ukraine contact group has sort of a muted appearance from D.C. We don't have the Chairman, we don't have the Defense Secretary, for obvious reasons, publicly discussing the urgency here. And as we look at it, we have no PDAs going. We have no sense that's anytime soon. Can you speak to, I guess, the symbolism here, that there isn't the same level of urgency or there isn't the same level of attention as there has been?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah. You know, at the risk of coming across as flippant, which is not my intent here, that's kind of a glass half empty look at it. I would turn it around and say the fact that despite the fact that we don't have supplemental funding, despite the fact that Russia continues to push against Ukraine and conduct these massive bombardments of Ukrainian cities, you continue to see every single month the international community come together in one form or another in order to focus on this priority, which is enabling them to have the capabilities they need to defend themselves and protect and take back sovereign territory.
And it's not just the United States; it's the international community, you know? I highlighted the total amount that has been provided so far, $80 billion. And so, that is going to continue when the Secretary, when he has talked to his counterparts, both in the past and just recently, and on the topic of Ukraine, it's always the same thing. What do we need to continue to do to ensure that they can protect their sovereignty and protect their people?   And so, I think it's actually a very positive thing that we were able to do this in this format and keep that conversation going. More importantly, continue to ensure that the commitments that have been made can be implemented in a methodical form and fashion. Thank you. Let me go to Laura.
Q: First of all, why can you not tell us whether or how many combatants have been killed in these?
GEN. RYDER: Because I don't have an answer to that question.
Q: You don't have?
GEN. RYDER: I don't have an answer.
Q: (inaudible) does not know?
GEN. RYDER: Again, we're continuing to assess. I don't have any information to pass to you.
Q: Second question. I want to ask you more context on the interceptions that were done by the Navy SEAL -- Navy SEALs last week against the -- the -- the Iranian weapon shipments. Are these types of missions usually done by Navy SEALs, or are they typically done by, I think I'd heard of the Coast Guard doing this kind of mission previously?
GEN. RYDER: That's correct. So, we've been doing these types of operations for a long time, right? Working with international partners when it comes to patrolling international waterways and search and seizure of illicit arms, among other things.
And so, going back to my time at Central Command, 2013 to 2016, and so, in terms of the kinds of capabilities that are applied, it just depends. It depends on the mission. It depends on the capabilities that are available. So, there's going to be a wide array of capabilities that can be applied to that mission under the auspices of U.S. Navy Central or the combined maritime force. Thanks.
Tom. Then I'll call on Janne.
Q: Thanks, Pat. I just want to follow-up a little bit. When Congress finally approves a supplemental that will include money for Ukraine, how quickly will the Pentagon be able to start sending supplies to Ukraine, please?
GEN. RYDER: You know, I can't give you a specific time hack, Tom. Other than, you know, as I just highlighted to Dan, I mean this is a priority for the department, and so we also understand the urgency. This is not an academic situation. There are lives on the line, and so we'll work as quickly as we can to get capability to them.
Q: Let me rephrase, if I may. Are there supplies ready to go if money is available?
GEN. RYDER: I think we've demonstrated that if we're made aware of capabilities, we have a variety of means at our disposal to either take those capabilities out of our own stocks to be replenished, or to contract out, or to work with partners to get those capabilities there. Janne?
Q: (inaudible) questions. Do U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee said that Kim Jong Un's threat to launch hypersonic missiles and use nuclear weapons must be taken seriously. What scenario is the United States preparing for North Korean Kim Jong Un's threats of nuclear weapons?
GEN. RYDER: Let me just make sure I understand. What steps are we taking to prepare for the use of nuclear? Yeah, so again, Janne, I'm not going to get into hypothetical situations. Clearly, we've been very public on our commitment to working with allies and partners in the region, to deter and help stabilize the security of the region. Any type of destabilizing acts are unwarranted, uncalled for, and we'll continue to call on North Korea to return to the -- the diplomatic table. Let me go to the phone, and then I'll come to Fadi . Tony, Bloomberg?
Q: Pat, I just unmuted myself. Can you hear me? Hello?
GEN. RYDER: Can you hear me? There we go. Okay, we'll come back to you, Tony. Fadi?
Q: Thank you, general. (Inaudible) effectiveness of these strikes against Houthi positions. To perspective, I think you mentioned 25 launching and deployment facilities for missiles, and more than 20 missiles in addition to radars and UAVs. Do. Does the Pentagon know how much they have in their arsenals in terms of missiles and UAVs?
GEN. RYDER: So, you know, again, without getting into intelligence, I mean, you know, clearly this is something that we will continue to study, and we have an understanding of the capabilities. But again, for operations security reasons, I'm not going to go into what we assess as the totality of Houthi capability, other than to say that these strikes that we're taking are very deliberate, proportional, as it relates to the kinds of capabilities they're employing against international shipping.
Q: And you said the focus is not to get into a conflict with the Houthis. According to officials and the Pentagon statements, I believe the U.S. have used more than 180 ammunition, striking more than 36 positions. A number of targets using aircraft carrier, submarine ships, aircraft. How does the conflict look to the Pentagon?
GEN. RYDER: Well, first of all, I wouldn't define it as a conflict. Again, I would define it as action that's being taken to disrupt and degrade Houthi -- Houthi capability to conduct attacks against the international community. And again, if we go back in time here, beginning in mid-November, the Houthis began these attacks, and despite multiple warnings from the international community, and despite the fact that there was a statement from 14 countries, plus the United States, saying there would be consequences, they made the choice to continue to do these.
And so, rhetorically speaking, should there be no cost for that? There is a cost for that. And right now, it's in the form of not only economic and diplomatic measures, but also in this case, physical means to reduce, disrupt, degrade their capability to conduct these attacks. If they stop conducting these attacks, then there'll be no further need to take these kinds of actions. But again, our hope is that we can restore security and stability to the Red Sea, and we'll continue to work toward that end. Let me try Tony again from Bloomberg.
Q: Pat, Thursday the Air Force announced that its ICBM program, the Sentinel, was estimated to run 36% over its current $96 billion cost estimate. That's a lot of money. How concerned is the Pentagon that this key program may be going off the rails and that you may have to spend money to upgrade the current Minuteman III program?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks for the question, Tony. I mean, you're correct. As I understand it, last week the Air Force and DOD did notify Congress that the Sentinel program had exceeded initial cost projections, which did result in a Nunn-McCurdy breach. As a result of that, DOD will conduct a robust review to determine what caused the cost growth and the way ahead for the program. As our senior leaders have said publicly before, Sentinel is one of the department's largest, most complex programs.
And we've also said that nothing that the department does is more important than maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent and reducing the risk of nuclear conflict. So, I'm not going to be able to get out in front of that review, Tony. I can say that work is underway under the current -- that work, under the current contract rather, is underway and will continue until the review is complete. And we will, of course, engage closely with Congress and be as open as possible as this moves forward. But beyond that, I'm afraid I'm just not going to have any more specifics to offer today.
Q: Pat, just a point of clarification. Is it accurate to say that for the first time since the U.S. hosted the contact group, it did not donate or offer any weapons to Ukraine? That's the first time that that happened?
GEN. RYDER: I will have to come back to you. I don't want to just make it up from the podium. I believe that's the case, but let me take that question, Jennifer, and come back to you. Thank you. Courtney?
Q: Can you address why the prepared remarks that Secretary Austin had for the contact group this morning included his acknowledgement at the top that he was at home and made a very vague comment about his health? Why he didn't say that?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah. Thanks, Courtney. So, what was posted was an as prepared for delivery version of his remarks. It's, of course, the Secretary's prerogative what to say or amend as he delivers his remarks. It's as simple as that.
Q: Why do you think, I mean, we would ask him this ourselves, obviously, but why do you think he decided not to address the fact that he was at home or say anything about his health in his first public appearance since being released from hospital?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the question. Again, it's his prerogative on any remarks that he gives to amend those in delivery. I will say I'm glad that everyone was able to watch his remarks about the impact of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and the important work that it's doing to save lives from Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression.
Q: To follow up to Natasha's question. I wasn't clear on the overall idea of potential people being killed in the strikes against the Houthis. Do you have any indication at all that any Iranians have been killed in any of these strikes? I know that you can't give numbers or anything like that, but some of these occurred now back on January 11. It's been some time. Do you have any indication any Iranians have been killed?
GEN. RYDER: I do not have any indication of that. Again, as I understand it, as these strikes were being planned, there was a very deliberate effort, as is always the case for us, to conduct these in a way that is going to minimize the potential for civilian harm, of course. And in terms of what we're striking, not being in overly populated areas when it comes to the total number of Houthis' operators, so to speak. Again I just don't have a number to pass along.
Q: That's the planned strikes. What about the dynamic strikes? Do you have that same level of fidelity that there may not be people around those when they, I mean, especially if the argument is that they seem to be preparing. I think they've all been missiles, right? Missiles that are on the rails, maybe being prepared to be launched. Do you have the same level of confidence that people may, Houthis or whomever, may not have been killed in the dynamic strikes?
GEN. RYDER: So, again, without getting into intelligence, you know, we're always going to take a look at those things, to your point. I mean, there can always be times where there's unexpected situations, but in this particular case, as I understand it, these are facilities that are on mountainsides, in fields, at airfields. They're not in crowded industrial or populated areas, as I understand it. Again, we'll continue to assess, but I just have not seen or been briefed on anything to indicate anything like that. We'll go to Jared and then come over here.
Q: Hey, Pat. On these efforts to interdict weapons smuggling to the Houthis from Iran. Obviously, this has been going on for a long time, these operations. But has there been any change in the pace or the scope or the focus of these operations in recent months, say to complement Prosperity Guardian and the U.S. and UK led strikes? Or is the main effort, so to speak, focused more on neutralizing the weaponry that has already made it ashore?
GEN. RYDER: Yeah. So, it's important to differentiate between those ongoing efforts that I talked about that have been happening for a while and Prosperity Guardian and these most recent strikes. So, the two are not connected.
Q: Has there been any change in the pace or the scope of those interdiction operations?
GEN. RYDER: I don't have a number to provide other than, again, I mean, part of that just depends on, you know, and again, this is a bit of a hypothetical, but it just depends on, for example, are there suspect vessels that need to be searched or stopped? It's sort of like any day you're driving down the highway, you know, if you see something suspicious and you pull someone over to check. So, I just leave it at that. Thanks. Yes, sir?
Q: On Syria, according to a report by our by Al Monitor, the Pentagon has looked at them. That encourages Syrian Democratic Forces to partner with Syrian government in the campaign against ISIS. Do you confirm there's any plan?
GEN. RYDER: I'm sorry? Which forces?
Q: Syrian Democratic Forces that encourage them to partner with the Syrian government?
GEN. RYDER: I don't have anything on that. I haven't seen those reports. I'd refer you to the SDF. I mean, of course, our focus in Syria right now is on the defeat ISIS mission. That's the only reason that we're there. So, that's the main focus.
Q: So, do you have a long-term strategy in Syria?
GEN. RYDER: Our focus, the only reason we're in Syria is, again, the enduring defeat of ISIS. When it comes to the broader, regional question of Syria, again, I don't have anything new to pass along on that. Let me take a couple more here. Howard Altman, War Zone?
Q: Thanks, Pat. I got a couple of questions and a couple answers. One, given that the Houthis have threatened U.S. bases in the region, can you say whether there's been any degradation of their surface-to-surface missile supply and what that degradation is? And then separately, on the Defense Contact Group's drone coalition, can you say which countries are involved? And then what are the deliverables and the timeline for those deliverables in that coalition? Thank you.
GEN. RYDER: Thanks. Howard, in terms of degradation of capabilities, I'm not going to have anything to provide to you beyond what I provided earlier. Clearly, again, some of those -- some of those missile capabilities that they've been employing against ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region. When it comes to force protection, of course, we're going to take necessary steps to protect our forces throughout the region, but I'm not going to get into specifics in terms of tactics, techniques and procedures.
And then on your final question, I don't have any specific countries to read out today, Howard. Of course, as we go into the future and as countries announce their participation or are comfortable announcing their participation will defer to them. But we'll certainly have much more in the days ahead on that, and we'll keep you updated. I can do one more. Michaela?
Q: Hi. Thank you for doing this. Apologies if my questions have been asked. It's a little fuzzy on the phones, but can you kind of explain how long can you confirm that the Houthis right now are actively getting replenishment from Iran right now? And then, as a follow up, do you think we're going to see more of these, kind of whack a mole strikes? Is that really what CENTCOM's strategy is going to be from here on, or are we actually preventing these attacks in the longer term. Thank you.
GEN. RYDER: Thanks. So, again, you know, we know, obviously, that Iran has a relationship with the Houthis, in terms of, again, their resupply refresh rate. I don't have anything to pass along other than, you know, that's something that we'll continue to monitor. I think the key point here is that the Houthis, starting in mid-November, began attacks against international shipping and mariners, and despite multiple warnings, have decided to continue to do that.
And we've been very clear that our single focus is on ensuring that the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are safe and secure and that these attacks against the international community stop. And so, our strategy is to continue to work closely with international allies and partners, to disrupt and degrade their ability to conduct these attacks, and we'll continue to stay focused on that. But again, no intent or desire to escalate. We just want the ability for the international community to be able to sail through these international waterways unhindered and safely. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.

Tuesday, 23 January 2024 12:01 AM
A senior official of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has warned that more than half a million people face the risk of death from starvation in the besieged Gaza Strip after more than three months of US-backed Israeli genocide in the territory.
Osama Hamdan, who represents the movement in Lebanon, made the remarks at a press conference in Beirut on Monday.
""Due to the high number of displaced people, lack of viable shelters, and scarcity of adequate food aid, more than half a million of our people in the northern Gaza Strip face the real danger of death and are starving,"" Hamdan said.
The official added that the people of Gaza have been forced to ""grind animal fodder"" in the absence of flour and food.
The Israeli regime launched its onslaught on Gaza on October 7, 2023 following Operation al-Aqsa Storm by the territory's resistance movements.
More than 25,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have lost their lives so far as a result of the brutal onslaught and a concomitant siege, which the regime has imposed on the territory with all-out American military and political support.
Hamdan said Israel and the administration of the United States President Joe Biden are responsible for the massacres that have been carried out against Gazans, calling on international organizations to declare northern Gaza a ""famine zone.""
He also urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League to intervene immediately to open Gaza's crossings and bring in aid.
""No safe areas in Gaza""
The Hamas' official said despite what the Israeli regime and the United States claim, there are no safe areas across the coastal territory.
Since the onset of its military aggression on Gaza, the regime has also staged sporadic attacks against Lebanon, sparking a firefight with the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah.
Iraqi and Yemeni resistance movements have also conducted retaliatory strikes against Israeli and American targets as a means of protesting the onslaught on Gaza and the United States' support for it.
Hamdan stressed that the US administration is fully accountable for the escalation that the region is witnessing due to its continued support for Israel and its aggression against Gaza.
'Israel failed to achieve its goals'
The Israeli regime, he emphasized, has stopped short of achieving any of the goals it had sought to realize through its military aggression against Gaza.
""After 108 days of this Zionist-American war against the Gaza Strip, the enemy has failed to achieve any of its aggressive goals. It has not been able to break the will of our great, patient, committed, and sacrificing people, nor has it been able to defeat the resistance,"" Hamdan said.
He added, ""Neither our people left their land, nor did the resistance raise the white flag, nor did any of [Israeli] captives return to it, except for those that the resistance released on its own terms.""
Condemning US terrorist designation of Yemen's Ansarullah
In another part of his remarks, Hamdan said the Hamas movement strongly condemns the US administration's designation of Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement as a terrorist group.
""We also condemn the continuation of the brutal American-British aggression against the brotherly [nation of] Yemen ... and we consider it a proof to US insistence on militarizing the Red Sea to protect the [Israeli] occupation and support its crimes and aggression,"" the Hamas representative said.
Concluding his remarks, Hamdan reaffirmed that Operation al-Aqsa Storm was a ""necessary step and a natural response"" by the resistance to the Israeli regime's plots against Palestinians.
He enumerated the regime's plots as ""liquidating the Palestinian cause"" of liberation from Israeli occupation and aggression, ""controlling and Judaizing"" the Palestinian territories, and eliminating Palestinians' sovereignty over the al-Aqsa Mosque Compound and other holy sites.
The Israeli regime has built hundreds of settlements across the Palestinian territories and is constantly ratifying plans to expand such structures, which are illegal under international law due to their construction on an occupied territory.
Backed by the regime's forces, illegal Israeli settlers also regularly invade the al-Aqsa Mosque Compound, Islam's third-holiest site, where it is forbidden to perform non-Muslim prayers or rituals based on longstanding international agreements."

A high-ranking member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement has hailed the resistance fighters' operation in the al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, saying Israel's heavy losses in a single day show the regime has failed in all its goals in the war against the besieged territory.
Ihsan Ataya, a senior member of the political bureau of Islamic Jihad, made the remarks in an interview with Palestine al-Youm broadcaster on Tuesday, after resistance fighters killed 24 Israeli troopers in Gaza earlier in the day.
""The occupation regime of Israel is in shock due to the deaths of its soldiers in the recent battle with the Palestinian resistance fighters,"" he said.
The senior Islamic Jihad official also noted that since the start of the Israeli aggression against Gaza in early October, there has been complete coordination between the Palestinian resistance forces to confront the occupying regime.
Ataya went on to say that the resistance fighters are aware that ""unity in the battlefield is the essential pillar for victory against this occupying regime,"" emphasizing that this movement will continue to fight along with other resistance groups against Israeli forces.
Separately, Islamic Jihad spokesman Musab al-Berim noted that this blow against the Israeli regime marks ""a political end"" for all those whose hands are stained with the blood of Palestinians, while referring to the successful operation of resistance fighters in the al-Maghazi camp.
He also said the number of deaths announced by the Israeli army is half the actual number of soldiers who have been killed in the operation.
On Tuesday, the chief Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari told reporters that 21 troopers were killed in Gaza after resistance fighters fired rocket-propelled grenades at a tank, and at the same time, an explosion occurred in two buildings where forces had planted explosives to destroy them.
Earlier, the military had said three soldiers were also killed in a separate attack in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, bringing the Israeli occupation forces death toll to 219 for ground operations.
The so-called Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the deaths of 24 soldiers in a single day make it ""clearer than ever"" that Israel must not cease operations in Gaza.
The Israeli military deaths came as Israeli forces pushed deep into western Khan Younis in Gaza, with an air, sea, and land bombardment that included storming a hospital and arresting medical staff, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra told Reuters.
The Israeli regime waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's atrocities against Palestinians.
Since the start of the aggression, Israel has killed more than 25,400 Palestinians, mostly women and children.
The Tel Aviv regime has also imposed a ""complete siege"" on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there."

SANAA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-British coalition struck Houthi camps in Yemen's capital and other provinces at midnight, the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported Tuesday.
The strikes targeted the al-Hafa camp in eastern Sanaa and the al-Daylami air base in the north. They also hit sites in Rada, a city in the central province of al-Bayda, and Maqbanah area in the southwestern province of Taiz, the TV said without giving details.
Residents said the explosions were powerful and their sounds could be heard across the city.
Meanwhile, U.S. media reported that the United States and Britain carried out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen late Monday, the eighth round of attacks on the rebels' camps in just over 10 days.
The strikes came hours after the Houthis said they launched a missile attack at a U.S. military ship in the Gulf of Aden on Monday and claimed a direct hit. The U.S. side did not comment on the alleged attack.
The U.S.-Britain maritime coalition in the Red Sea has carried out several airstrikes on Houthi camps in various northern provinces of Yemen. The coalition said these actions are aimed at preventing the Houthi group from launching missile and drone attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea shipping lane.
The Houthi group vowed to continue targeting ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea until Israel ends its war and blockade on Gaza, a Palestinian territory.
Last week, the United States re-designated the Houthi group as a global terrorist organization and said the move would not affect food and medicine supplies to northern Yemen."

ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) of Yemen convened an emergency meeting on Sunday to address the deteriorating security situation in the country and the military escalation by the Houthi forces.
According to a statement released by the state-run Saba news agency, the council warned the Houthis against the consequences of intensifying attacks, targeting civilian sites, and undermining peace efforts.
Government sources said that recent days have seen Houthi mobilization and repositioning of fighters, vehicles, and weapons on various fronts of the war-ravaged Arab country.
The statement praised ""the preparedness of Yemeni armed forces and popular resistance groups defending the country's state institutions and countering the Houthi aggression.""
The PLC also reviewed the potential impacts on global shipping and trade from repeated Houthi attacks in territorial waters, expressing hope that international unity would strengthen Yemen's capabilities to protect its waters and sovereignty.
Observers said that the PLC's meeting signals heightened tensions and a potential return to active fighting between the Houthi group and pro-government forces.
The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war against the government since 2014, causing a massive humanitarian crisis. Despite Saudi-led efforts to restore the internationally recognized government, the conflict remains deadlocked."

The U.S. Treasury Department on January 22 designated Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO for ""supporting"" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Lebanon.
The department said in a news release that Fly Baghdad for several years had supported the operations of the IRGC's' Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and its proxies, including Kata'ib Hizballah (KH), a militia group with close ties to the Quds Force, by delivering materiel and personnel.
""Fly Baghdad flights have delivered shipments of weapons to Damascus International Airport in Syria for transfer to members of the IRGC-QF and Iran-aligned militia groups on the ground in Syria, including the Syrian Arab Republican Guard, Lebanese Hizballah, KH, and the KH-affiliated Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas Brigade,"" the Treasury said.
In addition, Fly Baghdad CEO Basheer al-Shabbani was designated by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for owning or controlling -- directly or indirectly -- Fly Baghdad, the department said. OFAC also identified two Iraqi-registered aircraft owned by Fly Baghdad as blocked property.
OFAC also imposed sanctions on KH leaders Hossein Moanes, the head of KH political party Harakat Hoquq; Riyad al-Azzawi, a drone operator; and Awqad al-Hamidawi, who handles the group's businesses and financial portfolio.
In addition, Al-Massal Land Travel and Tourism Company, which is managed by Hamidawi, was designated for allegedly laundering money for the militia.
""Iran and its proxies have sought to abuse regional economies and use seemingly legitimate businesses as cover for funding and facilitating their attacks,"" said Brian Nelson, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
The sanctions freeze all property and interests owned by the individuals and companies in U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit people in the United States from dealing with them.
In a separate statement, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the IRGC-QF and Iranian-aligned militia groups ""pose a significant threat to the Middle East region.""
U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria have increasingly been targeted by Iranian-backed militias since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The conflict broke out broke out after Hamas extremists launched a cross-border attack on October 7, killing just over 1,100 Israelis, mainly civilians.
The most recent attack on U.S. personnel came on January 20, when missiles and rocket struck Iraq's Ain al-Asad Air Base, which houses U.S. troops. The U.S. Central Command said several personnel were ""undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries"" following the attack.
The so-called Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy says the group emerged in October 2023 and is made up of several Iranian-backed armed groups.

WASHINGTON -- Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met virtually with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.  Secretary Yellen reaffirmed the United States unwavering support to Ukraine in its defense against Putin's brutal invasion.  Secretary Yellen recognized Ukraine's successful IMF review in December and the effective work of Ukrainian authorities in managing Ukraine's economy and progress on reforms despite pressures from Russia's war. Secretary Yellen reiterated the Administration's ongoing efforts to secure $11.8 billion in direct budget support as part of the national security supplemental request before Congress and underscored the importance of Congress acting on financial support for Ukraine as quickly as possible.
U.S. budget support, which has an unprecedented level of oversight and transparency, helps support Ukraine's home front in its resistance to Russia's illegal invasion by maintaining vital government operations, such as keeping hospitals and schools open, and supporting first responders in Ukraine. This allows Ukraine to focus all its financial resources on its defense against Russia. U.S. leadership in providing Ukraine direct budget support also continues to catalyze other donors resulting in roughly three quarters of Ukraine's external financing needs in 2024 coming from sources other than the United States.
Financial support to Ukraine remains inextricably linked to its success on the battlefield.  A successful Ukraine will demonstrate the resolve of the United States and its partners to defend the territorial sovereignty and fundamental freedoms of democratic countries against authoritarian aggression.  Providing financial support to Ukraine will help Ukraine win the war and advance U.S. national security interests globally.

24.01.2024 - Press release
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock issued the   following statement prior to her departure for East Africa (Djibouti,   Kenya, South Sudan) on 24 January 2024:
The   Sudan in 2019 was defined by hope and optimism after the fall of the   war criminal al-Bashir. The Sudan in 2024 is defined by war and   destruction. For more than nine months, two generals have been waging a   ruthless power struggle at the expense of the civilian population. More   than 12,000 deaths and around 7.5 million people displaced - that is the   brutal result of this conflict. The images from Darfur in particular   evoke grim recollections of the genocide that was committed there 20   years ago. The regional repercussions are enormous, too. Neighbouring   countries, many of which are desperately poor, have taken in 1.5 million   refugees from the Sudan in recent months. Germany is the second-largest   donor helping to provide these people with what they need to survive.
The countries of the region as well as the regional organisation IGAD aand the African Union have a key role to play in international attempts   at mediation. With my dialogue partners in Djibouti, Kenya and South   Sudan, I want to explore ways to finally bring the generals Burhan and   Hemedti to the negotiating table so that they do not continue to drag   the people of the Sudan into the abyss and destabilise the region. To   me, it is clear that we must increase the pressure on both sides -   through sanctions, through accountability for their crimes against the   civilian population and by engaging with their supporters from abroad.
The   Sudan will only find lasting peace with a democratic civilian   government. I will thus also be meeting with members of Sudanese civil   society. Because as bleak as the situation there might currently seem,   the brave young people - women front and centre - who took to the   streets in 2019 for peaceful change and greater participation in society   stand for a better future for the country. We owe it to them not to let   this conflict become a ""forgotten crisis"".
In   Djibouti, one topic of my meetings will be how we can protect   international shipping in the Red Sea from the Houthis' attacks.   Djibouti lies in direct proximity to Yemen, and the two countries have   traditionally enjoyed close relations. Between them runs one of the   central arteries of international trade, the Bab al-Mandab strait, just   27 kilometres wide. It is in our shared interest to guarantee the safety   of shipping through what is a bottleneck for the global economy."

Remarks  Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State  Praia, Cabo Verde  January 22, 2024
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  It's wonderful to be here in Cabo Verde and the port of Praia.  We start this trip to Africa here in Cabo Verde because it is quite literally a gateway to Africa for countries around the world, including for the United States.  And a big part of that gateway is this port.  One of the things I'm very proud of is the fact that, thanks to the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the United States was able to invest significantly in modernizing and upgrading this port so that its capacity was dramatically expanded in terms of the number of ships that it could bring in, the efficiency of the port also dramatically increased so that ships could be processed much more quickly, the storage capacity around the port also built up, and all of that has created an incredibly vibrant place and a much stronger gateway to Africa for us and for so many other countries.
We also see that in the fact that this expansion project has produced jobs right here in Cabo Verde.  And we're also seeing Cabo Verde become increasingly a destination for tourism, for cruise ships, all of that thanks to work that was done in large part through the Millennium Challenge Corporation.  Cabo Verde is the only country in the world to have completed two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now it's embarking on a third, but a third that will really focus on regional connectivity and on integration and strengthening ties economically among countries in West Africa.
So we couldn't be more pleased and more proud for this partnership with Cabo Verde, and it seems like a very fitting place to start this trip to Africa that'll take us now to CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and on to Angola.  And it's further evidence of the fact that, as President Biden said, the United States is all in with Africa.  We see Africa as an essential, critical, central part of our future.  The partnerships between the United States and Africa were a big focus of the work that we did at the Africa Leaders Summit in Washington and, most important, the work that we continue to do ever since that summit in following through on the commitments and the agreements that were made there.  This trip is a big part of that, and it really does focus on President Biden's commitment and conviction that the United States and Africa are joined in partnership for the future.  So thanks very much and glad to be able to bring you to the port."

WHO and partners completed another high-risk mission on Monday to resupply fuel to the Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people remain cut off from aid. Across the Gaza Strip, the few remaining hospitals find themselves in ever more dire circumstances, with hostilities often preventing access for patients and supplies, and health workers managing on little rest and scarce supplies.
The mission was carried out along with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the United Nations Department of Safety and Security, and MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res.
The last humanitarian mission to northern Gaza took place on 12 January.
Yesterday's mission, which delivered 19 000 liters of fuel to Al-Shifa Hospital, faced delays at the checkpoint. The roads leading to the hospital were severely damaged, and the desperation in northern Gaza was apparent, as thousands of civilians surrounded the UN vehicles and fuel truck in the hopes of finding food and water, also delaying the mission.
In Al-Shifa Hospital, the mission saw that the functionality has improved since the last visit ten days ago. A significant decrease in the number of displaced people, from 40 000 to 10 000 was observed. There are 120 health and care workers, and 300 patients. The hospital conducts 5-10 surgeries daily, mainly trauma cases that require immediate care.
Essential services such as basic laboratory and radiological facilities remain operational, along with emergency care, a surgical unit with three operation theaters, post-operative care, and a dialysis unit. There are plans to reopen a 9-bed ICU over the coming days.
There are no maternity or pediatric services, and shortages of specialized doctors, medicines, and medical supplies such as orthopedic equipment. These units could become operational again, but will require a consistent supply of fuel, oxygen, medical supplies, and other aid.
The hospital's primary oxygen plant has been destroyed. They are relying on a smaller plant.
Seven out of 24 hospitals remain open in northern Gaza. These are only partially functioning, without enough specialized medical staff to manage the volume and range of injuries, nor sufficient medicines and medical supplies, fuel, clean water, or food for patients or staff. Additionally, two Ministry of Health primary healthcare centers in northern Gaza are partially functional but lack essential supplies, including syringes and vaccines needed for routine immunization.
Intensified military presence and hostilities in southern Gaza are also placing patients and health workers at risk, and compromising access to health care. They are severely obstructing the movement of health workers, ambulances, and health partners' ability to resupply hospitals, eroding their functionality. WHO staff say the situation for hospitals in Khan Yunis is ""catastrophic and indescribable.""
In southern Gaza, which used to have 12 hospitals, only 7 remain partially functional. A further two, Al-Kheir Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex, are only minimally functional and now inaccessible.
WHO is extremely concerned about reports of Al-Kheir Hospital, a small NGO-run hospital with around 30 beds, facing military incursions and several health workers being detained. Communication with the hospital is no longer possible.
Due to evacuation orders in neighborhoods surrounding Nasser Medical Complex--the largest hospital in the south--and continuous hostilities in the vicinity of the hospital, the Ministry of Health reports that large numbers of wounded people are on the hospital grounds.
An international emergency medical team deployed at Nasser says that no one can enter or exit the facility due to ongoing bombardment close by.
Health staff are reported to be digging graves on hospital grounds due to the large numbers of deaths anticipated and the need to manage dead bodies. This horrifying situation should never take place in any hospital.
Hostilities around Al-Amal Hospital are risking the facility becoming non-functional, as ambulances and injured patients reportedly cannot access the facility.
WHO again calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, active protection of civilians and health care, and sustained access for the delivery of critical aid across the Strip.

16BV1MFES8_BENV9XD27I7E9L9,"Decree Could Give Ukrainian Citizenship to Foreign Fighters, Nation's Diaspora",_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240122-voa01.htm,"By VOA News January 22, 2024
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a decree Monday that could grant Ukrainian citizenship to foreigners fighting in Ukraine against Russia.
The legislation was introduced Monday on the anniversary of Ukraine's Day of Unity, commemorating the unification in 1919 of western and eastern Ukraine, which has faced numerous invasions over its long history.
Thousands of foreigners rushed to Ukraine to defend the country alongside its soldiers when Russian forces invaded the country in 2022.
""Foreign volunteers who took up arms to defend Ukraine, all those who fight for Ukraine's freedom as if it were their homeland. And Ukraine will become such for them,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on social media.
Zelenskyy also announced that the new proposed legislation would formally allow ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from all around the world to gain dual citizenship, with the exception of Russia.
""Those who, with the outbreak of a full-scale war, regardless of their place of residence, birth or passport, said in the affirmative, 'I am Ukrainian.' ... Ukrainians by origin, who have long proven that they are Ukrainians in spirit. And after many years of waiting, they should finally become Ukrainians by passport,"" he added.
The decree, if approved by the Ukrainian parliament, would bypass Ukraine's constitution, which does not give Ukrainian citizens the right to dual citizenship. So, millions of people of Ukrainian origin who live abroad have not been able to hold Ukrainian passports so far.
The process would take about a year, so long as Ukrainian lawmakers approve and the constitutional court authorizes the decree.
The presidential decree also called for an action plan that would help preserve the identity of about 4 million Ukrainians living in Russia, the largest Ukrainian diaspora group in the world.
The decree, Zelenskyy said, would help restore the ""truth about the historical past for the sake of Ukraine's future,"" and counter Russian ""misinformation"" that aims to undermine the ethnic identity of Ukrainians living in Russia.
The Day of Unity has been marked as a national holiday in Ukraine since 1999.
The idea to mark the Day of Unity appeared almost a decade before that, when the country was still part of what was then the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians joined together on January 21, 1990, to form a live chain connecting Kyiv, the capital, with several other nearby cities in a show of unity and nationalism.
Some information for this report came from Reuters, Agence France-Presse and RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service."
17U3QLCO8U_S8DYP43XGXN9ZSX,Japan Takes Leadership Roles Protecting Global Security,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/japan/2024/japan-240125-dodnews01.htm,"January 25, 2024  By Jim Garamone , DOD News
Japan is growing and taking leadership roles that not only benefit people in the Indo-Pacific, but the global community, said Grace Park, the director for Japan policy at the Defense Department's Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Office said.
Park spoke at ""Japan in the Year 2024"" at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank named for President Woodrow Wilson.
Japan, the fourth largest economy in the world, has taken a greater security role in the past decade, Park said. Japanese leaders are reorganizing the self-defense forces in the country, fielding new military capabilities, increasing the amount spent on self-defense and more. ""I believe that the United States has gained a lot from this alliance relationship,"" she said.
Park hammered in on the security environment. She said at the very start that it is tough to speak of the security environment without including the effects of the economy, diplomacy and monetary policy and more. She said DOD works in cooperation with the State Department and National Security Council, the departments of Treasury and Commerce, and many other U.S. government agencies as the country approaches the U.S.-Japan Treaty Alliance.
For DOD, she said, the alliance involves three pillars: modernizing roles and missions and capabilities of the alliance, optimizing force posture within the region and the multilateral networking of alliances.
Applying these pillars to the challenges in the world is key. ""We've got Russia's aggression against Ukraine, we've got the Red Sea, ... [North Korean] provocations and, of course, the aggressive course of behavior of the [Chinese] in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as the Taiwan Strait,"" she said. ""In thinking through all of these networked security environments, ... they're all interconnected. There's not very much an artificial line between economic coercion versus military coercion.""
She said it is a testament to Japanese leaders that they are thinking through strategic messaging and ""through the continuity of the international rules-based order.""
The U.S. and Japan have agreed to modernize roles, missions and capabilities, and that ""is really about revamping our alliances,"" she said. The Japanese Self-Defense Force is working on new command and control setups, establishing joint operations centers.
The United States and Japan are deepening industrial cooperation, another was to enhance alliance interoperability.
All this helps ensure that if there is a contingency, ""we're all on the same page, looking at the same common operating picture or common information picture and really thinking through, who's got what? What roles and missions do you have in the geographic space, and also in the cross-domain space,"" she said.
Japanese leaders have agreed to increase its national defense budget to 2% of gross domestic product, essentially doubling the amount dedicated to self-defense.
The Japanese are also looking to breakdown stovepipes that can stand in the way of rapid innovation.
Two areas in particular are in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and in maritime domain awareness. ""For us, it's really speaking to Japan's capabilities and desire to be hands-on with their approach in contributing to peace and stability in the region,"" she said. ""These MDA and ISR capabilities are not just for the self-defense of Japan ... but really, to enhance awareness and also stability throughout the East China Sea, South China Sea region. It's incredible.""
Force posture discussions are also part of the picture in the region, but in a new way. It is more than just a simple question of where the United States should have forces and more about how the United States can work with allies and partners to increase interoperability, Park said.
""For us, we're really thinking about how do we make sure our alliance is positioned in more of a versatile resilient way,"" she said.
Japan is working with partners in the region as well with increased contacts between Japan and South Korea and Australia and the Philippines.
The Japanese share the values and thinking about the rules-based international order and that is welcome in the United States, Park said. ""It's very clear when I'm working with my counterparts that we're so aligned, not just on the strategic vision, but also on the methods to get there,"" she said."
18V8US0F9P_MD2YOW8ZJVHF93M,Junta plane repatriating Myanmar troops crashes in India,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240123-rfa02.htm,"Eight crew members on board were injured in the accident, a refugee in Mizoram said.
By RFA Burmese 2024.01.23 -- A junta plane repatriating regime soldiers to Myanmar crashed in India on Tuesday, injuring at least eight of the crew onboard, refugees in Mizoram state told Radio Free Asia.
The soldiers initially fled to Mizoram to escape fighting with the Arakan Army in Myanmar's western Rakhine state, Indian outlets reported. When the plane landed at Lengpui airport near the city of Aizawl, it skidded off the runway.
The injured are being treated at a hospital in Aizawl, said one refugee in the city who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons.
""It's known that there were 13 people on the plane. Eight people were injured, their heads and legs were broken,"" he told RFA. ""I heard that they have been sent to the hospital in Aizawl in three vehicles.""
Other accounts said as many as 12 onboard were injured. RFA called junta spokesperson Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun for more information about the crash, but calls went unanswered Tuesday.
The plane was tasked with returning 184 junta soldiers who fled to Mizoram's Lawngtlai district, added one outlet citing officers from India's Assam Rifles.
A total of 276 Myanmar soldiers fled battles in Rakhine last week, according to Reuters, citing an unnamed Indian military source. The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the junta administration reached an agreement to bring them back in two trips.
They are being sent back to Rakhine's Sittwe city, according to India-based news reports.
On Jan. 14, the Arakan Army announced it had captured Paletwa, a strategic border town, and six junta military camps bordering Mizoram.
According to Indian border officials, 635 junta soldiers have fled into Mizoram state during clashes with ethnic armed groups and their joint forces since the ceasefire between the junta and Arakan Army ended in November 2023.

January 25, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada
The Honourable MÃ©lanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, held her   first bilateral discussion with Israel Katz, who was recently appointed   as Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs.
During the call, Minister Joly reaffirmed Canada's support for   Israel's right to exist and to defend itself in accordance with   international law, including international humanitarian law. She   reiterated Canada's unequivocal condemnation of Hamas' terrorist attack   against Israel on October 7, 2023, its unacceptable treatment of   hostages and its heinous use of sexual and gender-based violence as a   tactic of war. She reaffirmed Canada's continued calls for the immediate   release of all hostages and its readiness to support investigations   into acts of sexual and gender-based violence committed on October 7.
Minister Joly shared her deep concern over the humanitarian crisis   faced by Palestinian civilians in Gaza and emphasized that the   protection of civilians is paramount, including ensuring they have   access to life-saving humanitarian aid.
Minister Joly thanked Minister Katz for his government's ongoing   cooperation to evacuate Canadians, Permanent Residents and their family   members from Gaza.
She reaffirmed Canada's commitment to a two-state solution, with   Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace and security,   with dignity and without fear.
Minister Joly and Minister Katz also discussed the threat posed by   Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups to Israel and its regional   security. Minister Joly underscored Canada's diplomatic efforts to avoid   further regional escalation, the impacts on civilians and the further   deterioration of the humanitarian situation.
2024 marks the 75th anniversary of Canada-Israel bilateral relations.   This important milestone serves as a reminder of the deep and enduring   people-to-people, economic and political ties between the countries."

New York,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-unbrief01.htm,"Department of Public Information . News and Media Division . New York
25 January 2024
The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by StÃ©phane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
**Briefing Guests
Good afternoon.  Welcome, happy Thursday.
In   a short while, we will be joined online by our colleague Jan Hoffmann,   who is the head of the Trade Facilitation Section at UNCTAD (United   Nations Conference on Trade and Development) in Geneva.
He will brief you on disruptions to trade in the Red Sea, and that is because of the ongoing military activities there.
Tomorrow,   I will be joined by the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social   Affairs, Li Junhua; we will have with us also Rabib Fatima,   Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed   Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing   States.
They will be here to brief on the fourth International   Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS4), which will be held   from 27 to 30 May of this year in Antigua and Barbuda; not a bad place   to have a conference.
**Gaza
Turning to Gaza:  In a   statement today, the Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied   Palestinian Territory and Director of UNRWA's (United Nations Relief and   Works Agency) Affairs in Gaza, Thomas White, said that heavy fighting   near the remaining hospitals in Khan Younis, including Nasser and Al   Amal, has effectively encircled these facilities, leaving terrified   staff, patients and displaced people trapped inside.  Al Khair hospital   has also shut down after patients, including women who had just   undergone C-section surgeries, were evacuated in the middle of the   night.
Mr. White said the situation in Khan Younis underscores a   consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of international   humanitarian law:  distinction, proportionality and precautions in   carrying out attacks.
This is unacceptable and abhorrent, he said, and must stop.
The   near collapse of the health system and the lack of trauma care in Khan   Younis city are making the humanitarian situation ever more intolerable   and intense.
And, just a bit more update on the training centre in   Khan Younis that was hit; our colleagues at UNRWA tell us that it was   hit by direct fire yesterday at a building which, as I mentioned to you,   this housed 800 displaced people.  At least 13 people were killed and   56 injured, 21 of those people were injured critically, in what should   have been a place of safety.
UNRWA says there are about   43,000 internally displaced men, women and children registered in the   already overcrowded UNRWA compound in Khan Younis.
Throughout the   day and into the early evening, ambulances and UNRWA emergency teams   were being denied access to the site.  When they finally reached it last   night, they were able to evacuate about 45 people.  The near collapse   of the health system and the lack of trauma care in Khan Younis city are   making the humanitarian situation ever more intolerable and intense.
Yesterday's   strike was the third direct hit on this compound. Buildings flying the   UN flag have been hit at least twice by tank fire, without any warning.
I   want to underscore â as I said yesterday â that we do share the   location of our shelters directly with the Israeli authorities and had   received assurances that people inside them would be safe.
We continue   tocall on all parties to take every precaution to minimize harm,   protect civilians and civilian objects, especially in densely populated   areas, and to protect hospitals, clinics, medical personnel and UN   premises in accordance with international law.
**Security Council
Back here, as we were just talking, the Security Council held a meeting on Haiti.    MarÃ­a Isabel Salvador, the Head of our mission in Haiti, briefed the   Security Council on the situation there.  She said the country remains   plagued by escalating violence â with an unprecedented surge in   kidnappings, rapes and other crimes committed by armed gangs.  This, she   said, increasingly affects the livelihoods of people and undermines our   humanitarian activities.
Last year, our UN colleagues documented   over 8,400 direct victims of gang violence, including people killed,   injured or kidnapped.  That's an increase of 122 per cent as compared to   2022.
Ms. Salvador said she will continue to encourage all   Haitian stakeholders to effectively prepare for the deployment of the   Multinational Security Support mission (MSS).
She also renewed her appeal to Member States to contribute generously to ensure the timely deployment of this mission to Haiti.
Also   briefing was Ghada Waly, the Head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime   (UNODC), according to her information report about the illicit flows of   firearms and ammunition to Haiti.
She added that the report found   11 informal or clandestine air strips in Haiti, which represent a blind   spot possibly used by traffickers and smugglers.
In the current   context, she said, it is more important than ever to take every measure   possible to prevent illicit flows from further destabilizing the   country.
All of those remarks were shared with you.
More   programming for this afternoon:  At 3 p.m., the Security Council will   reconvene for a private meeting on ""Maintenance of Peace and Security of   Ukraine"".  The Director General of the International Atomic Energy   Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, will brief, and afterwards he will come to   the stakeout and speak to you.
This meeting will be followed by a briefing on threats to International Peace and Security.  Rosemary DiCarlo, our head of Political Affairs and Peacebuilding, will brief the Council.
**Syria
And   just on Syria, I think I've been asked â I can't remember by which one   of you â about the Astana talks, and I can tell you that Najat Rochdi,   the Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, attended the two-day round in the   Kazakh capital.  Ms. Rochdi held constructive meetings with   representatives of the Governments of Syria, Russia, Turkiye, Lebanon   and Jordan.  During the meetings, she underscored the need to   immediately de-escalate violence both within and within the broader   region specifically in Syria.
Ms. Rochdi also conveyed that the   common priorities include civilian protection, resumption of the   Constitutional Committee, promoting confidence-building measures, and   supporting Syrian people everywhere, and implementing Security Council   resolution 2254.
Needless to say, we will continue to work with   various Syrian parties and all international actors, as well to push for   concrete progress.
**Honour Roll
One country on the Honour Roll today.  We've done food, we've done drink, we are going do animals today.
This country's national animal is the tapir.  It is the only country in Central America with English as its official language.
What?  [...] Belize. Ah, Belize, home country of our colleague Jamille [McCord].  All right, we are done, I am done you are not.
**Questions and Answers
Spokesman:  Edie, go ahead.
Question:    Thank you, Steph.  A couple of follow-ups.  First, on the attack   yesterday on the UNRWA training centre, there have been some questions   of whether it was actually hit by Israeli tank fire.  Did people in the   facility see or do they have evidence that it was Israeli?
Spokesman:  That is the understanding of my colleagues on the ground.
Question:  They saw that?
Spokesman:  That's their understanding, yeah.
Question:  Okay.  And can you... Yeah, I asked yesterday for an update on what our Yemen Special Envoy was doing.
Spokesman:    I think I gave one to you yesterday if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah.  Both   of us need a memory refresh, but I think I briefed you on all the   discussions he'd had in Riyadh with the Yemeni Government and the P5   ambassadors to Yemen who are based in Riyadh and others.
Correspondent:  I have something else, but I'll come back.
Spokesman:  Okay.  Dan?
Correspondent:    Thank you.  Steph, I think you've seen the footage that ITV News   obtained of a man being shot in Gaza while waving a white flag posing...
Spokesman:  You need to use your microphone, please.  Otherwise, our colleagues around the world cannot hear you. Yeah.
Correspondent:  Press the button.
Spokesman:  Press the button.
Question:    Okay, let me start again.  I believe you've seen the footage of a man   in Gaza, Ramzi Abu Sahloul, being shot, that our cameraman filmed there   for ITV News.  He was waving a white flag, was posing no threat   whatsoever.  Do you believe this is evidence of a war crime?
Spokesman:    We have seen the shocking video.  We don't have any corroboration about   the incident itself.  We've only seen the video.  I think what it   reinforces for us is a point we've been making since the beginning, that   no place in Gaza is safe for civilians.  And we have seen this over and   over again, whether it's people in the streets trying to evacuate,   whether it's people in shelters.  Our human rights colleagues are   continuing to monitor the situation and are pushing for an investigation   into all these cases.
Question:  Can I just follow up on that?  Would the UN lend its voice to an investigation into this particular incident?
Spokesman:  Yes.  All of these cases need to be investigated.
Question:  And one last question, if I may, StÃ©phane.  What was your personal reaction in seeing that?
Spokesman:    It's yet another sign of the horror that civilians in Gaza are facing   every day and the fact that people are just trying to live, and no place   is safe for them.  Gabriel?
Question:  Thank you, Steph.    One follow-up to that, then I have a couple of other questions.  You   said the UN doesn't have any corroboration to that video. What do you   mean by that?
Spokesman:  No, I'm not doubting the veracity   of what I saw.  What I'm saying is that we only have the video.  I   mean, to make a definitive statement, one would need to have a bit more   information on the context of what was happening.
Question:  Sure.  But clearly no doubt of what you saw?
Spokesman:  No, I'm not doubting what I saw.  I'm just saying what I said.
Question:    Fair enough.  Thank you, Steph.  On the ICJ (International Court of   Justice), real quick.  A few quick ones.  Obviously, a big decision   tomorrow, provisional decision from the ICJ.  Probably, perhaps one of   the biggest decisions by this body in many years, perhaps.    Question. The Secretary-General, the decision we think will come down   around 9 a.m. New York time.  They've changed the time a little bit, but   we're thinking about 9 a.m.  Where will the Secretary-General be?  Will   he get any previous advance of the decision and how closely?  I mean,   give us some details about how close... [cross talk]
Spokesman:    No, I mean, first of all, he will absolutely not get any advance notice   of what's in the decision.  The International Court of Justice is a   major organ of the United Nations, just like the Secretariat, but it is   fully independent from the Secretary-General.  So, he will not ask nor   will he receive, given his full respect for the independence of the   court.  He, like all of us, watch the developments in the courts   closely.  We need to see what the judgment will be, what the decision   will be, what the opinion of the court will be, and we will react to it   once we have it.
Question:  Safe to assume he'll be watching it live?
Spokesman:  It depends when it comes.  I mean, he will see it as soon as it happens.
Question:  Can we expect that no matter what the decision is that he will have a statement about it on camera?
Spokesman:  You can expect that there'll be a decision from the court tomorrow.  Alan?
Question:    Thank you, StÃ©phane.  On 7 January in Rome, Italy, dozens of people   held the rally, paying tribute to three far-right activists killed in   1978.  So, those people who assembled there, they raised their hands in   Roman salute. Well known fascist gesture.  I wonder what the UN make of   such trends in the world.  Do you think it's a kind of a glorification   of Nazism or what's going on?
Spokesman:  I mean, we've   seen the photos.  One, there are basic principles that people are   allowed to demonstrate peacefully.  Second, I think the Secretary-   General has been very clear for quite a long time now in calling out the   alarming rise of neo-Nazism, of fascism, of ethno-nationalism as a   dangerous trend throughout the world.  Sinan?
Question:    Thank you.  I have two questions.  Iraqi officials said they sent a   letter to Secretary-General about the Iran attacks in Kurdistan region   of Iraq last week.  I wonder if Secretary-General received any letter   yet.
Spokesman:  I will check.  I'll need to check with those colleagues who received the letters.
Question:    And my second question is, according to some news stories, is there   going to be a negotiation between USA and Iraqi officials about   withdrawing the coalition forces from Iraq?
Spokesman:  Sorry, say again?
Question:  According to Washington Post,   actually there will be a negotiation between United States and Iraqi   officials about withdrawing coalition forces from there.  And I wonder   if United Nations would participate in this negotiation or if there is   any information.
Spokesman:  No.  I mean, it's a bilateral   issue.  Obviously, I mean, it is good that these things are discussed   and negotiated, but it is not one that implicates our mission in Iraq.    Madame Celhia?
Question:  Thank you.  It seems that Mali   has reinforced its military cooperation with Iran.  But not only Mali,   more African countries.  Is the UN worried about it?
Spokesman:  Well, you know, Member States, countries are free to enter alliances and support that they have.  It's not for us to comment.
Question:  Yeah, but the UN was, the mission was in Mali.
Spokesman:  I know the mission was in Mali; it no longer is.
Question:  So, yeah, I know, but it says a lot about its success or, you know...
Spokesman:    I think you're linking things that, in my mind, are not connected. I   think the mission achieved great success in protecting civilians, in   creating zones of safety, in helping with humanitarian aid.  We know   very well the reasons why the mission left, and maybe those questions   are best asked to the Government of Mali.  Dezhi?
Question:    On Haiti, today, the Security Council had a discussion on Haiti, and we   know that the multinational force is still yet to be deployed, mainly   because of the country who's leading this team, we're still waiting for a   court ruling to go ahead.  What is the UN's expectation?  Because we   know that ruling is going to happen tomorrow... [cross talk]
Spokesman:    I mean, our expectation, I think, has been laid out by the   Secretary-General, was laid out by his Special Representative today that   this multinational support force is needed quickly, and we encourage   Member States to support its deployment as quickly as possible.
Question:  Say, if this request has been denied by the court in Kenya, do you have plan B?
Spokesman:    Well, I mean, as we've said repeatedly here, it is a force that will   operate under a Security Council resolution.  It is not a force that is   being assembled or managed by the Secretariat, right?  By the   peacekeeping department.  But Haiti needs help and it needs help   quickly.  And we hope that Member States who can contribute in kind or   in cash do so. Yes, sir.  And then, Margaret.
Question:    Thank you.  Yesterday, Russian Minister [Sergey] Lavrov continued to   spread propaganda lies here, including about the staging of the deaths   in Bucha.  Lavrov wants to drag the Secretary-General into this,   claiming that he has sent him requests for a list of the death.  So, my   question is, if Lavrov did send requests, did he explain what he was   going to do with this list?  And did the Secretary-General advise him to   use the Internet?  Because the list of this code is open information...   [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Yes, the request has been   received, like we receive different requests. It is not... your second and   third part of your question should be directed to the Russian Mission.    Margaret Besheer?
Question:  Steph, any update on the helicopter that went down in Somalia?
Spokesman:  No, ma'am.
Question:  Is that a bad sign that you have no update?
Spokesman:  I have nothing to share with you at this point, unfortunately.  Ms. Fasulo?
Question:    Thank you, Steph.  My question is regarding the fighting in Gaza.    Right now, I believe that the data being given about the number of   civilians or number of people killed or wounded is not separated.  You   don't have the fighters versus civilians.  Is this an unusual situation   in terms of war and is the UN doing anything to get a clarification?
Spokesman:    Well, we don't have the capacity.  We don't have the capacity.  We rely   in Gaza, as we have throughout the sadly different cycles of violence,   on the Ministry of Health in Gaza, to get those figures.  We don't have a   way to disaggregate them.  We have found post-conflict that these   figures usually tend to be within the ballpark of what actually   happened.  I'll come back to you.  Let me go to the screen first.    Abdelhamid?
Question:  Thank you, StÃ©phane.  Amihai Eliyahu   is the Israeli Minister of Jewish Heritage.  He called on Sunday for   the second time to drop a nuclear bomb on Gaza. Do you have any comment   on that?
Spokesman:  I didn't see those particular remarks,   but as we've said from the beginning, incendiary or inflammatory   remarks, to put it mildly, do not help bring peace to the region.    Edith?
Correspondent:  One more question.
Spokesman:  Yes, sir.
Question:    Yesterday, settlers in the West Bank were dressed in military uniform,   which made their attack easier because people think they are the Israeli   official occupation army.  Are you aware of this development?
Spokesman:    I have not seen this particular case, but obviously we've raised our   concerns repeatedly about the ongoing violence, settler violence in the   occupied West Bank.  Edie?
Question:  Thanks, Steph.    First, a clarification on Khan Younis, on what's going on there.  Are   the attacks still continuing and is everyone basically still trapped in   place and unable to...?
Spokesman:  I mean, in terms of our   compound, my understanding from here is that the attacks are not going   on, on the compound.  They managed to extract a number of people last   night.  There have been no new evacuations since.  As of a few hours   ago, my understanding is that there were still attacks going on in the   Khan Younis area.
Question:  Okay.  And secondly, President   [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy has called for an independent international   investigation of the plane crash yesterday.  Has the UN been approached   at all?  And would it have the facilities or whatever?
Spokesman:    Not that I'm aware.  We checked with our colleagues at ICAO   (International Civil Aviation Organization) in Montreal, who pointed   out, rightly, to something I should have thought about earlier, is that   this is a military plane, so it's not something that they have the   mechanism or the jurisdiction over.  Maggie?
Question:    Sorry, just one last one on Gaza.  You mentioned ambulances and UNRWA   emergency teams were denied access to the area after the fire, the   incident.  You did not say by whom they were denied access.
Spokesman:  Okay.  Let me get some more detail for you on that.
Question:  Well, it's simple.  Was it Hamas...?  [cross talk]
Spokesman:  If I had the fact in my book, I would share it with you.
Correspondent:  Okay, thanks.
Spokesman:  Gabriel?
Question:    Thank you.  Thanks for the follow-up, Steph.  Can you just characterize   how significant the ICJ ruling is tomorrow in the eyes of the   Secretary-General at this moment?
Spokesman:  Every case   that has to do with an ongoing conflict in front of the ICJ is an   important case.  I'm not going to characterize the ruling and the   importance of the ruling until something has been issued.  I will leave   you with our guests from UNCTAD, and more importantly, I will leave you   with Daniela [Gross de Almeida], who will moderate.  And I shall see you   all maÃ±ana, and we'll let you know about Mr. Grossi."
1BHURKDQMS_2GDTW111HKO38ZU,"Four years on, Wuhan remembers the first COVID-19 lockdown",_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2024/01/sec-240124-rfa01.htm,"Residents say they'll never forget the trauma, yet have more pressing economic concerns these days.
By Gu Ting for RFA Mandarin 2024.01.24 -- For many people in 2020, the news that the central Chinese city of Wuhan had been placed under lockdown was the first indication that something was profoundly amiss, and that the emerging pandemic could have a global impact.
On Jan. 23, 2020, the provincial authorities imposed a travel ban on some 18 million people in Wuhan and surrounding areas, prompting a mass rush to leave the city, three days after admitting that the newly emerging coronavirus was transmissible between people, something experts elsewhere had suspected for weeks.
Four years on, there has been no official mention of the anniversary, although the authorities appeared to be taking steps to ensure nobody uses the date to cause trouble for the ruling party.
Wuhan police took at least one activist out of town ahead of the politically sensitive fourth anniversary of the citywide lockdown - the first of the COVID-19 pandemic, RFA has learned.
The person, who requested anonymity for fear of further reprisals, said state security police had forced him to leave town with them on a ""day trip"" on Tuesday, which marked the anniversary of the start of Wuhan's lockdown on Jan. 23, 2020.
""They took me out for a day trip yesterday because it was the anniversary of the [Wuhan] lockdown,"" the person said. ""I was confused yesterday, and I didn't realize why I was being dragged out for the day.""
""I only saw later what my friends were posting on WeChat Moments, that it was the fourth anniversary,"" he said.
""The authorities were having a 'stability maintenance' day,"" the activist said, in a reference to a nationwide system of controls and restrictions that targets potential activists before they take action.
State media silent
There was no mention of the anniversary in state media, although some people commemorated the date on overseas social media platforms, posting the official announcement from four years ago.
""Today, Hubei province has launched its top-level response to a major public health emergency,"" the announcement said.
""From Jan. 23, 2020, all bus, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transportation in and out of the city will be suspended.""
""No residents will be permitted to leave Wuhan without a special reason,"" it said.
The notice was to plunge the city into a whirlwind of compulsory daily testing, enforced quarantine in rapidly constructed mass facilities, and a desperate struggle to seek medical treatment as hospitals in the city were overwhelmed.
As political heads rolled, the government tried to claw back control of the narrative by suppressing whistleblowing doctors like Li Wenliang and Ai Fen, as police started rounding up frontline bloggers, archivists, diarists, YouTubers, livestreamers and other citizen journalists.
Meanwhile, seriously ill people were left scrambling for medical attention, as crematoriums started operating around the clock.
A recent documentary made from footage filmed at the time and smuggled out of the country for editing overseas remains blocked to viewers behind China's Great Firewall, including the 11 million people who call Wuhan home.
""The level of control they had over people [back then] was like something out of a novel, with scenes straight out of [George Orwell's dystopian novel] 1984 becoming part of our daily lives,"" one of the film's producers, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals, told RFA. ""It was very scary.""
""What's even more scary now, looking back on it, is that people have already forgotten that this kind of thing was happening all around us,"" they said. ""It could come back at any time.""
Poverty spreads
Several Wuhan residents told RFA that most people have more pressing concerns in the current economic downturn.
""The trauma fades as time goes by, but I definitely won't forget it, because the pain of that time was unforgettable,"" a resident who gave only the surname Wang for fear of reprisals told RFA.
""Some people have no jobs, and nothing to eat, and the sequelae [of the zero-COVID era] aren't going to be resolved any time soon,"" he said.
A Jianghan district resident who gave only the surname Song agreed, saying that poverty appears much more widespread in Wuhan these days.
""Who could forget the beginning of lockdown on Jan. 23, 2020?"" she said. ""It had a huge impact on people's lives.""
""A lot of people were made unemployed ... and a lot of the shops are closed ... for example on Hongqiqu Road in Jianghan district,"" she said. ""Many people are worried about their livelihood - things are really tough.""
Others took to social media to comment on the date, or to say that the past four years were something of a blur. Others complained that they were far worse off, economically, than four years ago.
For many who lived through that time, the full story remains untold, although possibly guessed at.
Even by the end of Wuhan's 76-day lockdown, which was to set the pattern for ruling Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping's nationwide zero-COVID restrictions over the three years that followed, residents were calling into question the official death toll as the virus ripped through an unprepared and as-yet-unvaccinated community.
Widespread doubts remain that China's reported COVID-19 death toll - a 2021 study published in British medical journal The Lancet estimated excess deaths outside China at 18 million -- could be an accurate reflection of reality.

Remarks  Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State  Luanda Science Center  Luanda, Angola  January 25, 2024
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  It's a particular pleasure to be here in Angola's brand-new science museum, to get a chance to see the museum.  I can just see the generations of young Angolans who will come here to be inspired, to have their eyes opened, maybe choose careers in science, and to add to the incredible storehouse of human knowledge.  It's a wonderful facility, but it's also, I think, symbolic of two areas of collaboration between the United States and Angola that I'm very excited about and that we're really pursuing and digging into.
One is the fact that Artemis is now the third - excuse me, Angola is now the third African country to join the Artemis Accords for the peaceful use of space.  And you can see the extraordinary potential, some of which is already happening through existing NASA collaborations but will only be strengthened by Angola as part of Artemis, in terms of addressing some of the most acute needs here in Angola, including mitigating droughts, including irrigating soil and crops, and working on the effective use and management of water.  So much can be done from space using geospatial data, and the collaboration that we will now have between the United States and Angola is only going to strengthen those efforts and that partnership.
Second, and relatedly, I'm very pleased that Angola is joining as an early partner in our VACS initiative, Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils.  The power here is this:  As we've been dealing with the kind of food insecurity over the last few years and we've seen an almost perfect storm between climate change, COVID, conflicts like the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the impact they've had on food security, one of the things that I've heard again and again, particularly in Africa, is that for all of the thanks that we get for the emergency assistance that we've been able to provide - either directly or through the United Nations, like the World Food Programme - what our partners are really for are investments in their own sustainable productive capacity.  And at the heart of that is making sure that they have the strongest possible system for producing food.  And one of the things that we've understood is that it really starts with two very basic things: the seeds and the soil.
Here in Africa, and here in Angola, when we look at some of the traditional seeds that Africans have relied on - and here maybe it's cassava, maybe it's millet, maybe it's sorghum, incredibly nutritious and that can now be made even more resistant to the ravages of climate change, to the cycles of droughts and floods and other abnormal weather events - when you have high-quality seeds and then you put them into high-quality soil, and we now have the ability to map soil anywhere in the world and understand where it's strong and healthy, where it's not and how to remediate that - you put those two things together and you have a much stronger, sustainable, resilient, and nutritious agricultural base.  And then we get to the point where Africa is feeding itself and, indeed, probably feeding other parts of the world.
That's the vision behind VACS, and that's the partnership that we're now building with Angola as one of our early partners in VACS.  So this seemed like a fitting place to emphasize that collaboration - both new heights in space, but also right here on Earth - and to demonstrate how these two things are connected.  So I'm excited to be able to be here at the museum to think about, again, generations of Angolans who will come here, have their eyes opened to science, to exploration, to using human ingenuity to solve problems.
And finally, fundamentally, at the heart of all of our partnerships, including the partnership with Angola, is sharing and transferring knowledge.  Because, as important as assistance is, as important as investment is, it's that transfer of knowledge - the sharing of knowledge, the sharing of understanding - that genuinely builds capacity in our partner countries and allows them to stand strongly on their own feet.
Thanks very much."

At least seven people were killed and dozens wounded on January 23 in a fresh wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv as an air-raid alert was declared for the whole territory of Ukraine.
In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the number of people killed in the Russian attack increased to five, the Prosecutor-General's Office said on Telegram, after initial reports put the number at three.
""Despite the efforts of the medics, two wounded people died in the hospital,"" the message reads.
Another 51 people were wounded, including four children, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram, adding that Russian Kh-22 missiles struck civilian targets in the Kyiv and Saltivka districts.
""Apartment buildings, an educational institution, and other exclusively civilian infrastructure were destroyed,"" Synyehubov wrote.
Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 30 residential buildings were damaged, some 1,000 windows were broken, and the heating had to be turned off in 20 houses as the temperatures reached minus seven degrees Celsius.
In Kyiv, at least 20 people, including four children, were wounded, Mayor Vitali Klitschko and city administration chief Roman Popko said on Telegram.
One woman was declared clinically dead despite efforts by doctors to resuscitate her, Popko said.
Three districts -- Pechersk, Svyatoshynsk, and Solomyansk -- were targeted in the attack, Klitschko said.
""As a result of the Russian missile attack, 20 people were wounded; 13 of them are hospitalized, including three children. One 13-year-old boy and six adult victims were treated by medics on the spot,"" Klitschko wrote.
Russian missiles also hit the city of Pavlohrad, in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk, killing at least one person, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak announced on Telegram.
In Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on January 23 that the missile strikes ""successfully"" targeted Ukraine's military production facilities, hitting all intended targets, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov again denied that Russian forces had struck civilian areas, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Russia over the past several weeks has abruptly intensified its missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian targets, causing numerous deaths, injuries, and material damage. The eastern city of Kharkiv, just 30 kilometers from the Russian border, has been particularly targeted by Russian strikes.
According to Ukrainian officials, only between December 29 and January 2, Russia launched more than 500 Iranian-made drones and cruise missiles at Ukraine's cities.
The unusually intense wave of strikes has also put pressure on Ukraine's air-defense capabilities and its ammunition stockpiles, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call on Kyiv's allies to step up weapons deliveries.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said on Sunday he was disappointed to hear Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rule out the two-state solution to the conflict in Gaza.
""I think it is disappointing to hear that from the Israeli prime minister. There isn't another option, and the whole world has agreed that the two-state solution is the best way forward,"" he told Sky News.
Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he will never accept an independent Palestinian state on the Israeli border. He argues that Israel must have full security control over the Palestinian territory, which conflicts with the idea of Palestinian sovereignty.
Shapps reiterated that the UK government ""absolutely backs"" the creation of a Palestinian state as a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
""It needs to be viable, it needs to be sovereign on the Palestinian side. It needs that to provide security guarantees on the Israeli side, and there isn't another obvious way out of this,"" he stressed.
Shapps admitted that anti-Semitic attacks in the United Kingdom had been rising in parallel with Islamophobia since the Israel-Gaza war began last October. He said the UK government would not allow events in the Middle East to spill over into his country.

Thursday, 25 January 2024 6:43 PM
Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Russia's westernmost region of Kaliningrad, a Baltic Sea exclave that is largely surrounded by two NATO members Poland and Lithuania.
The Russian leader paid a visit to Kaliningrad Oblast on a planned working trip, said the RIA news agency in a report on Thursday, citing Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that ""militaristic statements"" from Baltic countries posed a risk to the Russian territory.
""Countries that are permeated with Russophobic tendencies are dragging more and more military facilities, military equipment belonging to the alliance into their territory. This is, of course, a danger. It requires additional measures to ensure that the security of our country is reliably ensured,"" Peskov emphasized, stressing that the exclave ""is an integral part of Russia.""
The Kremlin spokesman, however, Putin's trip to Kaliningrad is part of his work and that it does not send a message to member states of the US-led military alliance.
""When the president visits the regions of the Russian Federation, it is not a message to NATO countries. This is the main thing that the president does. The most important thing is not to send messages, but to do what he has been doing for many years - working on the development of our country and our regions,"" Peskov emphasized.
Putin last visited Kaliningrad in September 2022, seven months after he launched his ongoing ""special military operation"" in neighboring Ukraine, which strives for NATO membership.
The war unleashed waves of harsh sanctions from the United States and its European allies against Russia. Moscow has time and again warned that these sanctions and the flood of arms by some NATO members into the ex-Soviet republic will only prolong the war.
Elsewhere in his comments, Peskov said the Kremlin did not request a direct air corridor through Europe for Putin's flight to Kaliningrad."

Check against delivery!
Good morning to all of you.
Today, we are going to have an exceptional Foreign Affairs Council. I think that never before we have had a Council with so many, and so important guests, in these dramatic circumstances.
We managed to invite - and they are coming today - first, the Israeli Foreign Minister [Israel Katz] - the new one. Second, the representatives of the Arab and Muslim countries diplomatic initiatives: the Ministers [for Foreign Affairs] of Saudi Arabia [Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud], Egypt [Sameh Shoukry], Jordan [Ayman Al Safadi] and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States [Ahmed Abou Ghei]. And after, in a separate session, the Foreign Affairs Minister of Palestine [Riyad al-Maliki].
So, we are going to have here today all actors - [of] the countries engaged, the countries who are directly affected by the situation in Gaza. I have been talking with the new United Nations [Senior] Coordinator for the Humanitarian support [and Reconstruction for Gaza], Sigrid [Kaag], who explained to me yesterday on the phone. She will also come to the Council to debrief the ministers.
The humanitarian situation [in Gaza] could not be worse. It could not be worse. There are no words to explain how the situation is, with hundreds of thousands without anything - without shelter, without food, without medicines, and under the bombs.
And every day, there is a high toll of civilian people being killed. Many ministers have said that there are ""too many"". Well, the question is: how many is ""too many""? What does it mean ""too many""? [Is] too many 25,000 people? For how long is this going to continue?
This is the thing that ministers will discuss today, so it is a very important meeting. I am happy to have managed to invite them, and to make them to come.
And after, we will have a discussion among us, among the ministers, and I will present - I have already presented - a comprehensive approach. A comprehensive approach to what? I think that we have to stop talking about the ""peace"" process, and start talking more concretely about the ""two-state solution"" process. Because peace, it could be many different [kinds of] peace. What kind of peace are you talking about?
So, let's talk about what we want to do. What we want to do is to build a two-state solution, so let's talk about it. The way you are naming it is important. So, from now on, I will not talk about the peace process, but about the two-state solution process. If we are serious about that, we have to study the underling causes that prevent this solution from being implemented. Certainly, Hamas is one of them - an important one - but there are others.
This comprehensive approach has to be studied, and discussed. I know it is difficult. The 27 [Member States] have different approaches, but we have to work together with the Arab world. I know it is difficult, but it is our moral endeavour, our moral obligation to try to do our utmost to try to look for a solution.
So, from now on, please talk about the ""two-state solution"" process.
Q&A
Q. Hight Representative, the Prime Minister of Israel excluded that option for the moment. You are going to meet with the Israeli Foreign Minister today, so are you going to mention this? Because his government has a different stand than what you just told us.
I know they have a different stand, I know. The Secretary-General of the United Nations [AntÃ³nio  Guterres] knows also, and he answered yesterday in very concrete terms, saying that it is unacceptable to say ""I do not want this solution"", because this is a solution that has been approved by the United Nations, and the whole international community is behind it. So, if they do not agree we have to discuss. That is why we are here. We have to discuss even if they disagree. They have to come here, and they will discuss with us, and we will study whatever solution they have in mind. Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them? 25,000 already in Gaza, 70% women and children. Certainly, the way of trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations. We have in mind what Hamas is, what Hamas has done, and certainly we reject [it] and we condemn [it]. But peace and stability cannot be built only by military means, and not in this particular way of using military means. I say that with full respect to the victims of Hamas terrorist attacks.
Q. High Representative, when you are talking about a two-state solution; are you considering Hamas to be a part of this solution? How are you going to deal with that?
As I said, I presented a comprehensive approach. Do not say ""a 10-point plan"". Yes, it is 10/12 [points], it is a way of presenting things. It is a complex thing; it cannot be solved overnight. Thirty years that these things have been discussed without a solution, do not expect me in a Council to [find] a solution immediately. There are a lot of problems, I cannot give you a concrete answer to all of them, so, let us work.

Q. High Representative, what will you discuss on Ukraine, as Ukraine is also on the agenda?
Ukraine is also on the agenda, the first item in the agenda. The fact that we are engaged in looking for a solution in the Middle East does not mean that we are not continuing supporting Ukraine. The first one intervening [today] will be the Foreign Affairs Minister of Ukraine [Dmytro Kuleba], and we will discuss with the ministers our continuous support to Ukraine. And [at] the Gymnich meeting, [later on, there] will be a specific meeting with the Defence Ministers to discuss about it [and] boost our support. Do not worry, Ukrainians have not to worry, European support continues as strong as ever, and it will continue.
Q. How can you persuade Israel to accept your ideas, or to take them seriously? What arguments will you use to convince them? What leverage do you have to lure them in that direction?
We are not there still. Let us work.
Q. A quick question on humanitarian aid for Gaza. Are there any other options on the table to increase the humanitarian aid right now?
This is what Sigrid [Kaag] is trying to look for. Certainly, today the number of trucks and controls, and the delays of entering the trucks, is not in accordance with the needs of hundreds of thousands of people. And that is why, the United Nations has nominated a Special Coordinator for Humanitarian Support [and Reconstruction for Gaza]. She is working, and she told me yesterday that there are some issues, some possibilities - opening harbours, opening cross borders. It is her job, and we will support her. Because certainly, today the situation does not allow to make these people survive.
Q. Will you address the recent ballistic airstrikes in the Kurdish region by Iran? Because Iran is saying there is a Mossad headquarters there.
We will discuss about everything that affects the situation in the Middle East. Certainly, we will discuss about everything. I am sorry, I have the Egyptian [Foreign] Minister waiting for me.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Wednesday kicked off ""Exercise Steadfast Defender 2024,"" its largest military drills in decades.
""The dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall (LSD 44) departed Norfolk, Virginia, United States and following a series of operations will commence her transit across the Atlantic,"" NATO said, adding, ""His Majesty's Canadian Ship Charlottetown would depart Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada for Europe later this month.""
According to NATO, the drills will take place in several locations, with associated exercises running until May 31. ""It will show that NATO can conduct and sustain complex multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of kilometers, from the High North to Central and Eastern Europe, and in any conditions.""
The scale of the drills marks the bloc's ""irrevocable return"" to Cold War schemes, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told RIA news agency on Sunday.
The drills were announced last Thursday by NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe Christopher Cavoli, and will see approximately 90,000 troops from NATO's 31 members and Sweden participating."
1TT5E55J42_Y2SME1DD482HR8R,Haiti crises have reached 'a critical point': UN envoy,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-unnews04.htm,"25 January 2024 - More than 8,400 people were victims of gang violence in Haiti last year, including killings, injuries and kidnappings - a 122 per cent increase over 2022, the UN Special Representative for the country told the UN Security Council on Thursday.
""I cannot overstress the severity of the situation in Haiti, where multiple protracted crises have reached a critical point,"" said Maria Isabel Salvador, presenting the latest report of the UN political office there, BINUH.
The Caribbean country remains plagued by mounting violence and insecurity at the hands of armed gangs against a backdrop of political, humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges.
Violence spreading
About 83 per cent of the unprecedented surge in killings and injuries occurred in the capital, Port-au-Prince, but violence has spread elsewhere, specifically Artibonite, the largest of Haiti's 10 departments.
South of the capital, gangs conducted large-scale attacks to control key zones and continue to systematically use sexual violence in areas under their control, putting women and girls as young as 12 at risk.
Ms. Salvador said that since her last briefing in October, at least 75 people were reported killed by civilian vigilante movements that have emerged as collective defence against the gangs.
Support Haiti's police
Meanwhile, BINUH has continued efforts to enhance the capacity of the Haitian National Police (HNP), but high attrition rates have further diminished the force's ability to counter gang violence and maintain security.
The Haitian Government and the international community have stepped up support to the HNP over the past few months, she added.
This has included a 13 per cent increase allocated under the national budget for this fiscal year and the supply of individual protection equipment, armoured vehicles, motorcycles and weapons.
Last October, the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of a multinational security support mission (MSS) to back Haiti's beleaguered police force, which Kenya offered to lead. A 2022 sanctions regime targeting gang leaders and their financiers was also renewed later that month.
Ms. Salvador said she will continue to encourage all stakeholders to effectively prepare for the mission's deployment and again appealed for countries to contribute generously towards this end.
Break the cycle
While improving the security situation is essential to break the cycle of overlapping crises besetting Haiti, she stressed that long-term stability can only be achieved through a nationally owned and inclusive political process.
Echoing the UN Secretary-General, she urged all political actors and stakeholders ""in and for Haiti"" to unite in prioritizing and upholding the interest of the people above all.  She noted that ""new violent actors have been gaining prominence"" in recent months, sparking concerns over their potentially destabilizing role.
""The continuous support to the Haitian National Police, the rapid deployment of the MSS, effective sanctions and a sustained political process"" which results in ""credible, participatory and inclusive elections"" are essential, she said.
These are ""fundamental elements to restore security and stability in Haiti, where, consequently, the rule of law, democratic institutions and sustainable development become a reality for its people,"" she added.
Arms trafficking 'blind spot'
The head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Ghada Waly, also updated the Council on arms trafficking and illicit financial flows in Haiti.
A UNODC report last October had identified four major sea and land routes being used for illicit firearm and ammunition flows, mainly from the US.
The latest report, published on Wednesday, found that there are 11 recorded informal or clandestine airstrips spread out across Haiti.
""They represent a blind spot that is possibly being used by traffickers and smugglers, bearing in mind that smaller aircraft flying directly between the United States and Haiti are difficult to monitor,"" Ms. Wady said.
A regional concern
Regional dynamics are also important as the deepening crisis in Haiti is not occurring in a vacuum, she added, noting that illicit firearms are a growing concern across the Caribbean, ""feeding gang-related activity and drug trafficking in a vicious circle"".
The report also documents action to combat corruption and illicit financial flows, ""which are major factors enabling violence and organized crime and plaguing Haiti's own justice institutions"".
""Nevertheless, anti-corruption efforts continue to be impeded by insufficient capacity, lack of forensic equipment and limited expertise in conducting complex investigations,"" she said.
The next UNODC report will focus on a detailed analysis of gang dynamics in Haiti."
1U5TURV65D_2RI3PR8LVW73FV5,Foreign Ministry statement on the Ukrainian neo-Nazis' missile attack on Donetsk,_,_,20240122,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240121-russia-mfa01.htm,"21 January 2024 15:20  68-21-01-2024
The neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, supported by the United States and its satellites, has committed yet another brutal terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia.
On the morning of January 21, armed units of Bandera's followers deliberately targeted a market and shops in Tekstilshchik, a neighbourhood in the Kirovsky District of Donetsk, with multiple launch rocket systems. A total of six artillery rounds were fired at the busiest areas in town causing a large number of casualties. According to reports, at least 25 people were killed and 20 were injured.
Russia's Investigative Committee promptly launched an investigation into this crime. All those involved and responsible for this and other terrorist attacks on our soil will face inevitable punishment.
It was established that the shelling was coming from Avdeyevka, which is still controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and that the types of weapons supplied by the West were used. This is further confirmation of the Western countries' direct involvement in the conflict, implicating them in the criminal acts committed by the Zelensky regime. This regime has once again demonstrated its inhuman nature and hatred for innocent people they are calling ""species."" The leaders in Kiev are prepared to kill them mercilessly.
Russia strongly condemns this treacherous attack on civilians. The West's unrestrained desire to inflict a ""strategic defeat"" on Russia using their Ukrainian puppets to do the fighting, thoughtlessly supporting them without any limits, is pushing the Kiev regime to increasingly reckless steps, including terrorist attacks, massive violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes. Russia calls on all responsible governments and relevant international agencies to strongly condemn this brutal act of terrorism. Their silence would mean tacit approval of the murder of civilians and encourage Ukrainian neo-Nazis to commit even more terrible atrocities.
The terrorist attacks by the Kiev regime clearly demonstrate that it has no political will for peace and the settlement of the conflict by diplomatic means.
The need for achieving all the goals and objectives of Russia's special military operation is obvious. No threats to security or acts of terrorism must be coming from the territory of Ukraine."
1XI04YON9J_9MA6G6S8DDJTKSA,"Closer Vietnam-US ties not based on Beijing issues, says conference",_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-rfa01.htm,"Vietnamese and American experts offered different perspectives on handling China.
By RFA Staff 2024.01.25 -- There are stark differences in the ways the United States and Vietnam approach their relationships with China, participants at a recent U.S.-Vietnam conference in Washington, D.C. said.
Yet they agreed that the strategic alignment between Vietnam and the United States is not all about how Washington deals with Beijing.
""The strategic interests that the U.S. and Vietnam share ... are about far more than China and how we think about the China relationship,"" Lindsey Ford, deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, told the meeting held by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank.
""We should avoid looking at U.S.-Vietnam security ties through the lens of U.S.-China competition,"" said another participant, Bich Tran, postdoctoral fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore (NUS).
Vietnam and the U.S. elevated their bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level in international cooperation, in September 2023 during President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi. The upgrade is seen by some as part of the efforts by both countries to manage security and economic challenges posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive China.
Hanoi in particular has been worried about tensions in the South China Sea between China and other countries in the region.
""I think in some ways ... some of the concerns we may have about the behavior that we're seeing coming out of Beijing are similar it doesn't mean though that the only reason the United States and Vietnam have or would want to work together is because of China,"" Ford said, ""I would say the United States and Vietnam have a lot of interests in rule of law, in seeing operational behavior that accords with rule of law.""
Some of China's activities in the maritime domain, including in the South China Sea, were ""extremely unsafe and dangerous for us,"" according to the U.S. defense official.
""We believe that countries and their military and law and law enforcement forces should operate in a way that accords with international law,"" she said.
""In terms of U.S. and Vietnamese leadership, they all agree that China's behavior is their concern [but] I think Vietnam and U.S. leaders have different emphases on their approach,"" said Bich Tran. ""The U.S. focuses mostly on competition, but Vietnam is focused on cooperation with China because of the geographical proximity and the similarities of the political systems.""
Vietnamese senior diplomat, Nguyen Hung Son, said that while the U.S. and Vietnam ""see eye to eye on very clear violations of international law, especially in the South China Sea we also agree that there is a necessity to manage the relationship with China.""
""Even a superpower like the U.S. also needs to manage its relationship with China. You'd rather have a good relationship with China than a troubling one,"" said Son, who serves as vice president of the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam.
""We are an immediate neighbor to China, the risk for anything that goes wrong in our relationship with China is a lot higher than that of the United States and therefore you will see that there's a lot of prudence in our handling of the bilateral relationship with China,"" he added.
Vietnam is carefully watching recent developments between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea and ""drawing lessons"" from it.
""We are also exploring opportunities to collaborate with other ASEAN member states as the South China Sea is a concern not only to Vietnam and other littoral states but to the whole ASEAN,"" the diplomat said.
""Policies around the South China Sea should be founded around strengthening international law and building capabilities to help countries in the region enforce international law in the region.""
Military-to-military relationship
There was a certain ""over enthusiasm"" about U.S.-Vietnam military cooperation after the two countries agreed on their comprehensive strategic partnership (CSP), according to Nguyen Hung Son.
""Barely 10 days after President [Biden] visited Hanoi and upgraded the relationship there was this report on Reuters which alleged that there were talks between Vietnam and U.S. officials on a sale of F-16 [fighters] to Vietnam,"" Son said.
""If you believe, or are made to believe, that defense sales are the thing that follows the CSP, I'm sorry, you're going to be disappointed,"" he said. ""While the U.S. might think about the CSP in terms of deterrence, the Vietnamese, and probably the rest of ASEAN, thinks of the CSP more in terms of resilience.""
""The purpose [of the CSP] is to strengthen Vietnam's capability to resist influence and to lessen dependencies on nearby major powers,"" Son added.
The U.S. will continue to work with Vietnam to enhance military cooperation, according to deputy assistant secretary of defense Lindsay Ford.
""In terms of emerging areas of cooperation, there's obviously an awful lot we're doing related to maritime security. We are doing a lot and want to continue with helping Vietnam build its own maritime domain awareness capabilities,"" she said, adding that the U.S. continues ""to look at new technologies and capabilities that we can help with.""
""Cyber security is something that ... remains a key vulnerability for militaries across the world. U.S. Congress has been very focused on a pilot Southeast Asia cyber capacity building program and this is an area we want to continue to grow with partners including Vietnam.""
The U.S. official said defense trade is also a potential area of cooperation.
In December 2022, Hanoi held the first trade Expo to showcase its defense industry as well as to seek potential providers in order to diversify the market.
The U.S. plans to be there again this year, Ford said.
""This is an area that is not just about what the U.S. through commercial or other means has to offer, but increasingly where there may be opportunities for us to think about research or co-production together in the future,"" she noted.
Vietnamese officials have been speaking of the concept of ""strategic trust"" that Hanoi wants to grow with its major strategic partners.
""The United States is an important security partner of Vietnam and Hanoi has become increasingly more comfortable in working with Washington,"" said Bich Tran from the NUS.
Since Washington lifted its arms embargo against Hanoi in 2016, American drones and coast guard cutters have been transferred to Vietnam.
It appears that more arms transfers may be in the pipeline.
""Is there room for sales of F-16? I would say that I wouldn't foresee that is coming tomorrow but I wouldn't rule that out to come at some point,"" said Nguyen Hung Son. ""I'm not going to rule out that defense trade and defense cooperation is going to be at some point a very important pillar of Vietnam-U.S. cooperation.""

20IX5CELI2_2T0JUB46XQ3O50H,"End the war and recognize Palestine, Security Council urged",_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-unnews02.htm,"24 January 2024 - Work harder to end the war in Gaza and recognize the State of Palestine were the messages once more from many countries on Wednesday, taking part in the two-day Security Council debate over the Middle East crisis.
More than 70 delegates voiced serious concerns about the ongoing humanitarian ""catastrophe"" as the conflict in Gaza approaches its fourth month.
Council members alongside the wider UN membership on Tuesday established the major theme of the debate: urging Israel to accept a two-State solution or risk a perpetual war which is an increasing threat global stability.
The Palestinian people's right to build their own fully independent State must be ""recognized by all"", and any refusal to accept the two-State solution by any party must be ""firmly rejected"", UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said at the outset of that meeting.
""The two-State solution is the only way to address the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians,"" he told the Council.
Some of Tuesday's speakers called for the Council to overcome its veto-led impasse and stop the bloodshed and ""humanitarian disaster"" in Gaza.
The 15-member organ tasked with ensuring international peace and security must also hold Israel more accountable for an ongoing ""genocide"" against Palestinians, some speakers insisted.
Stop the genocide: OIC
Mauritania's Ambassador Sidi Mohamed Laghaf, speaking on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), said the deliberate killing of civilians was indicative of the intent to commit genocide. Raising a range of concerns, he pointed to the mass destruction of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals and rejected any efforts to forcibly displace Palestinians, which in itself ""amounts to a war crime"".
Israel's denial of essential supplies is already exacerbating a humanitarian catastrophe, and a swift intervention is needed, he said. Indeed, the international community must immediately put an end of all these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable, including for the mass detention of Palestinians, in line with international humanitarian law.
""The Council must do more to enforce its own resolutions, prevent further crimes of aggressions and acts that amount to genocide and ensure Israeli respect for and compliance with international law,"" he said, calling for action to end the war, provide international protection of Palestinians and ensure the creation of a humanitarian corridor.
The only way forward is through a two-State solution, he stated.
There is a need for 'real diplomacy': Brazil
Brazilian Ambassador SÃ©rgio FranÃ§a Danese underlined the need ""for real diplomacy and true political will"" that enables effective multilateral action to end the conflict and forge a path to revive the two-State solution.
""Now, we are witnessing the cruellest war, one that seriously threatens the prospect of a peaceful co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians,"" he said, calling for ""an immediate ceasefire in Gaza before there is nothing left to be saved"".
What is urgently needed are the provisional measures requested by South Africa to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), with the aim of preventing the risk of genocide by requiring the immediate ceasefire, but that does not tackle the root causes of the conflict, he said.
Help end the war now: Iraq
Deputy Permanent Representative of Iraq, Abbas Kadhom Obaid Al-Fatlawi, said the siege and collective punishment of Palestinians continues, and the Council has failed to act, leading to a ""humanitarian disaster"".
Israel has been ignoring calls for a ceasefire, even though UN Member States have adopted two resolutions at Emergency Special Sessions to stop the aggression.
The latest developments in the Occupied Palestinian Territory will have serious consequences in the region, he continued, warning that the conflict will spread beyond the borders if ongoing practices persist and the Council fails to shoulder its responsibilities.
""Expanding the conflict will not provide a solution,"" he said. ""The solution lies in the Security Council adopting a resolution to stop this war.""
Syria rejects bid to make 'executioners into victims'
Recalling the devastation in Gaza, Syria's Ambassador, Alhakam Dandy, said Israel is using prohibited weapons, including phosphorous, and is committing crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide.
Some countries are attempting to legitimize Israel's actions, ""making executioners into victims"" in the name of self defence.
Israel must be held accountable, he said, calling on the Council to adopt effective and immediate measures to end Israeli attacks and to halt impunity.
Expressing support for South Africa's related case at the ICJ, where provisional measures are expected to be made public this Friday, he said heinous violations also have been perpetrated against Syria.
Expanding settlements and the plunder of natural resources in the occupied Golan are part of hostile policies that, among other things, target residential areas in Damascus and other parts of Syria, he said.
Ending the war hinges on the two-State solution: Ireland
Condemning the 7 October attacks against Israel, Ireland's Ambassador Fergal Mythen, reiterated a call for the release of hostages. At the same time, Israel must limit its action in Gaza, in line with international humanitarian laws requiring military operations to respect the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, he said.
Ending the war hinges on a two-State solution, and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of this vision is not acceptable, he continued.
Emphasizing that the Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to the two-State solution in its relevant resolutions, he said ""today, the achievement of this vision is more pressing than ever.""
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DEBATE
â¢ Israel's ""clear and repeated rejection"" of the two-State solution ""is unacceptable"", said UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres opening the debate on Tuesday, adding that ""this refusal, and the denial of the right to statehood to the Palestinian people, would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security.""
â¢ Council members roundly called for the two-State solution to be realized and for an end to the war, with many calling for an immediate ceasefire to end the suffering of Palestinians and allow the aid they urgently need to be delivered unhindered
â¢ Many speakers from the wider UN membership echoed those calls
â¢ ""Stop this massacre,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan
â¢ ""We are running out of time. There are two choices: a spreading fire or a ceasefire,"" said the Foreign Affairs Minister for the Observer State of Palestine
â¢ Israel's Ambassador said if the Council continues to provide necessary aid to Gaza, without considering the Iranian threat across the region, the world faces ""a very dark future"""
21HTYKCXQR_AWWZ556N07GSHUV,UN Calls on Hong Kong to Drop Case Against Publisher Jimmy Lai,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/01/china-240123-voa02.htm,"By VOA News January 23, 2024
As Hong Kong's official legal year began Monday, the city's chief justice, Andrew Cheung, used the opportunity to stress how the judiciary takes its duty seriously.
The courts will not ""blindly convict"" anyone and will respect fundamental rights in national security cases, Cheung said at the official ceremony, adding that the justice system will also not bow to pressure.
""Threats of sanction or reprisal against judges for simply discharging their judicial duties are, therefore, repugnant to the rule of law and fundamentally objectionable,"" said Cheung.
The chief justice's comments come as U.N. experts have added their voices to those calling on Hong Kong to drop all charges against pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai.
Lai is one month into his trial on charges of sedition and collusion with foreign forces, under Hong Kong's national security law. The 76-year-old publisher denies the charges, but if convicted could face life in prison.
In a statement released Monday, four United Nations experts called for Hong Kong to drop the case against Lai.
The British national, who founded the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, has been in custody since his arrest in 2020. His news outlet later shuttered after the arrests of senior executives and freezing of assets.
Prosecutors in the case have described Lai as a ""radical"" whom they say was at the center of conspiracies to collude with foreign forces and publish seditious material in Apple Daily.
The prosecutors alleged that Lai used ""the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy"" to request that foreign countries, including the U.S., impose sanctions and other hostile activities against Hong Kong and China.
Cited as evidence was a meeting between Lai and then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington in July 2019.
The meeting included a discussion of an extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial. After mass protests, the proposed extradition bill was withdrawn.
Prosecutors also cited 161 articles in Apple Daily as evidence of sedition and said Lai instructed Apple Daily to introduce English content to bolster support for Western governments sanctioning China and Hong Kong.
Lai denies all charges.
The case against Lai appears ""directly related to his criticism of the Chinese government and his support for democracy in Hong Kong,"" said the U.N. experts, who are part of the U.N. Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.
The experts include Irene Khan, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression; Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, special rapporteur on the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly; Alice Jill Edwards, special rapporteur on torture; and Margaret Satterthwaite, special rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers.
The council reiterated its concerns about Hong Kong's national security law, which they said is not in line with international obligations.
Lai's trial is the second under the national security law after a case involving 47 pro-democracy activists who are awaiting a verdict, the U.N. said.
""We reiterate that national security legislation with criminal sanctions should never be misused against those exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association and of peaceful assembly, nor to deprive such persons of their personal liberty through arrest and detention,"" the U.N. experts said.
Hong Kong has pushed back against criticism that the law is affecting press freedom; Hong Kong's former chief executive Carrie Lam previously said the Apple Daily case was about ""a suspicious act of endangering national security,"" not media freedom.
Lai's case is seen by media freedom advocates as a test of Hong Kong's commitment to a free press.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, has identified China as a leading jailer of journalists, with 44 behind bars, and said Beijing's influence is being seen in Hong Kong.
""What we've seen in recent years is that Hong Kong has followed Beijing's very harsh national security law, to crack down on those seen as pro-democracy, including journalists speaking truth to power,"" said CPJ chief executive Jodie Ginsberg.
""Lai's case is an incredibly powerful and important test of Hong Kong's commitment to a free press,"" Ginsberg said. ""It's really, really important that we see the international community speak out in support of Jimmy Lai, in support of a free press.""
U.S. and British officials have condemned the case against Lai. At least 15 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial, which is scheduled to last between eight and 10 weeks.

Haiti's foreign minister appealed to the international community Thursday to expedite the deployment of a multinational force to help the national police combat brutal gang violence.
""I've been coming to the council on a regular basis for almost two years now, painting you a picture that gets sadder and bleaker each time I come, given that the security and humanitarian situation is deteriorating,"" Jean Victor Geneus told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. ""The Haitian people can't take it anymore.""
Geneus said Haiti's future is at a crossroads, and he hoped it would be the last time he addresses the council before the deployment of the multinational support force it authorized in October.
Kenya has volunteered to lead the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti and has committed about 1,000 police officers. Ambassador Martin Kimani said a pledging conference is being planned to meet gaps in funding, equipment and logistical support for the mission.
""We hope that this initiative will enable deployment without delay,"" he said.
The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Antigua and Barbuda have also expressed willingness to contribute personnel to the force. The United States has committed about $200 million in support, including logistics and equipment for the mission, but is not sending any personnel.
The multinational force, which was authorized by the Security Council but is not a U.N. mission, has been slow to deploy. First, it took months for the council to approve it. And now it has been going through the final domestic hurdles in Kenya before they can assume command. Kenya's high court is expected to rule Friday on a private lawsuit questioning the constitutionality of the deployment to Haiti.
In the meantime, the situation in Haiti has worsened.
Violent armed gangs control much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and have spread to other parts of the country. They have carried out massacres and kidnappings, human trafficking and sexual violence.
The deteriorating security situation has also created a humanitarian crisis, with almost half the population, around 5 million people, experiencing acute hunger and 200,000 displaced from their homes.
""It beggars belief that in 2023 alone, we've seen over 5,000 people murdered â that's roughly 12 a day,"" Geneus said. ""That means in 2023, someone was murdered every two hours in Haiti.""
He said more than 1,400 people were injured, nearly 3,000 kidnapped and 37 police assassinated in gang-related violence last year, noting that the real numbers are probably much higher.
Illicit arms from the US
The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) says in its latest report released Wednesday that guns and ammunition trafficked from the United States are ending up in the hands of the criminals. Shipped primarily from the state of Florida, they are flowing to Haiti by ships and small aircraft.
""UNODC has found that there are 11 recorded informal or clandestine airstrips in Haiti, spread out across the country,"" said UNODC Director-General Ghada Waly. ""They represent a blind spot that is possibly being used by traffickers and smugglers, bearing in mind that smaller aircraft flying directly between the United States and Haiti are difficult to monitor.""
She said a small number of Haitian gangs, including the 5 Segond and 400 Mawozo groups, have become highly specialized in the procurement, storage and distribution of weapons and ammunition.
""They move firearms from points of entry to their strongholds before distributing or selling them to other armed groups,"" Waly told the council.
U.S. envoy Robert Wood told reporters that Washington is concerned about the trafficking of arms into Haiti.
""The situation is dire, and we are taking this very seriously and doing what we can,"" he said.
The United Nations has stressed that Haiti needs a combination of a strengthened national police force, the rapid deployment of the multinational force, and credible elections to put Haiti on the path back to security and stability."

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian plans to make an official visit to Pakistan next week.
The Iranian foreign minister and his Pakistani counterpart, Jalil Abbas Jilani, issued a joint statement on Monday following an earlier phone conversation.
At the invitation of the Pakistani foreign minister, Amir-Abdollahian ""will travel to Pakistan on January 29, 2024,"" the statement said.
It added that the top Iranian and Pakistani diplomats also agreed that ambassadors of both countries would return to their posts by January 26.
The two neighboring countries witnessed an escalation of cross-border tensions over Iran's counter-terrorism operations.
On January 16, Iran launched simultaneous drone and missile attacks on two bases of Jaish ul-Adl, a terror outfit that was formed in 2012 and has conducted several attacks on Iranian soil in recent years.
The group claimed responsibility for an attack in December 2023 on a police station in the southeastern city of Rask that killed at least 11 Iranian police officers. On January 10, another attack by the group on a police station in the city killed one officer.
Pakistan carried out strikes on Thursday against what it called bases of the separatist Baloch Liberation Front and Baloch Liberation Army in regions close to Iran's border.
Tehran condemned the attack as unacceptable and unbalanced."

The Russian energy company Novatak suspended some operations at its liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal in the Russian Baltic Sea port of Ust-Luga after a fire erupted early on January 21 following reports of drone sightings in the area.
Novatek, which is partially owned by Gennady Timchenko, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said it had been forced to suspend unspecified operations at the huge fuel export terminal due to the fire.
The fuel export terminal that is used to ship oil and gas products to international markets, including to Europe.
It was not clear how long the disruption would last, how many tankers would have to wait outside the port, and what the knock-on effect would be on international energy markets.
Timchenko owns 23.49 percent of Novatek, according to data quoted by Interfax at the time of the company's annual meeting in April 2023. The largest shareholder is Leonid Mikhelson with 24.76 percent, Interfax said.
The fire at a terminal belonging to Russia's largest LNG producer, Novatek, was caused by two explosions, state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti cited local officials as saying.
The agency said the fire has been contained to a 100-cubic-meter fuel depot at the terminal, located about 110 kilometers west of St. Petersburg and near the Estonian border.
Russian media said earlier the fire followed reports of explosions and drone sightings in the area.
Leningrad regional Governor Aleksandr Drozdenko said on Telegram that there were no casualties as a result of the blaze and that the local fire service and the Emergency Situations Ministry was involved in the effort to extinguish it.
The fire was reportedly contained by 9 a.m. local time.
The outlet 47 News published videos and photographs it said showed a ""large reservoir"" at the Ust-Luga facility on fire. The outlet said that the Russian Defense Ministry had early on January 21 reported the appearance of two drones flying toward St. Petersburg.
The incident comes amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, which has been marked by frequent drone attacks by each side.
On January 20, Ukraine declared an air-raid alert for its entire territory after Russia launched seven drones and three guided missiles at Ukrainian targets. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of targeting energy and other key infrastructure during the winter cold in an effort to break the Ukrainian people's will to fight following Russia's unprovoked invasion in February 2022.
Moscow on January 19 claimed a Ukrainian drone attack had hit an oil depot in Russia's western Bryansk region. A day earlier, Russian officials claimed an attempted attack on a Baltic Sea oil terminal was unsuccessful.
The Ukrainian Defense Ministry traditionally does not comment on or claim responsibility for attacks Moscow claims Kyiv carries out on Russian territory.

Tehran, IRNA -- A military source in Yemen says that the futile attacks were carried out against bases that had been targeted dozens of times before, referring to the fresh US-UK aggression on the Arab country.
The bases were insignificant and contained no weapons, equipment, or forces, the source told the Almayadeen news channel on Tuesday.
Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Supreme Political Council, had earlier stated that the latest strikes were an attempt to ""discourage Yemen from supporting Gaza.""
He stressed that the US-UK aggression aimed to force Yemen to stop its naval operations, pointing out that ""the US and the UK should understand that we are in an era of retaliation and our people do not know surrender.""
The US and the UK have recently attacked Yemen several times after a UN Security Council resolution on the Red Sea, but the attacks are made in violation of international laws to protect Israeli interests.
The US has once again blacklisted Yemen's Ansarullah Movement, sparking condemnations over Washington's unilateral moves in the region and beyond.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The South Korean navy is holding a wintertime training for its special force units to improve their combat capabilities against threats allegedly posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Wednesday, citing navy sources.
The drills are taking place on the eastern coast of Gangwon Province, with South Korea's underwater demolition team and navy sea, air, and land teams involved in the training, the sources told the news agency. The special warfare units are reportedly practicing a maritime infiltration in the East China Sea and mobility skills at mountainous sites and in snowfields.
The information about the 10-day exercise launched back on January 16 was made public immediately after North Korea fired several cruise missiles toward the Yellow Sea earlier in the day, although no official statements has been made by Seoul to date. The morning developments marked the first cruise missile launch by North Korea since September 2023, Yonhap reported.
Last week, North Korea also tested an underwater nuclear weapon system in response to joint military drills by South Korea, the United States and Japan.

Relations ascend to new level with increased cooperation in traditional, new sectors
By GT staff reporters Published: Jan 24, 2024 11:05 PM
China and Uzbekistan upgraded bilateral ties to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for a new era on Wednesday during talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Uzbek counterpart, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, in Beijing.
Experts noted that as China and Uzbekistan's relationship has entered a new level, the two will see increased cooperation in both new and traditional sectors. Moreover, the turbulent international society highlights the urgency of stepping up security collaboration between China and Uzbekistan, as well as other Central Asian countries.
Xi pointed out that 32 years ago, Uzbekistan took the lead among Central Asian countries in establishing diplomatic relations with China. The two peoples have inherited the spirit of the Silk Road, and the friendship between China and Uzbekistan has deep roots and flourishing vitality.
Building a more meaningful and dynamic China-Uzbekistan relation is the common aspiration of the two peoples, Xi said. Both sides should take the development of the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership for a new era as an opportunity to build a solid foundation for the community of a shared future between China and Uzbekistan with high-level political mutual trust, and to promote their respective modernization endeavors through high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), he noted.
Xi emphasized that the China-Uzbekistan relationship is good because both sides have always treated each other with sincerity and trust. Faced with the current complex international situation, both sides should firmly support each other. China firmly supports Uzbekistan in safeguarding national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and firmly supports Uzbekistan in independently choosing its development path.
For his part, Mirziyoyev said that he hopes this visit will be an important opportunity to further strengthen mutual trust, expand comprehensive cooperation, and promote high-quality joint construction of the BRI. Mirziyoyev said he hopes to achieve more fruitful results in practical cooperation in various fields such as economy and trade, agriculture, green energy, local development, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.
The elevation of bilateral ties signals that China's relationship with Uzbekistan has entered a new era, Zhao Huirong, an Eastern European studies expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Zhao noted that the Uzbekistan president's visit reveals the great importance he attaches to ties with China.
Another dimension to Mirziyoyev's visit is to promote cooperation, especially after the China-Central Asia Summit last year. China's cooperation with Central Asia has now expanded, and there is vast potential for cooperation, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times. He noted that there are several projects being carried out between China and Uzbekistan, including the promotion of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, and this visit serves to push them forward.
Cui said that as Central Asian countries are undergoing an energy transformation, they are eyeing cooperation with China, a leading country in green transformation, to help them speed up the process.
Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao met with Jamshid Khodjaev, Deputy Prime Minister of Uzbekistan on Tuesday. Wang said that in 2023, China and Uzbekistan achieved a record high in bilateral trade volume, with China being Uzbekistan's largest trading partner for many years. Uzbekistan has become a hot investment destination for Chinese companies.
Wang vowed to deepen cooperation in areas such as energy, mining and infrastructure, and expand new growth points in cooperation in green energy, digital trade and cross-border e-commerce.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) signed a three-year project investment plan with Uzbekistan on Wednesday, media reported. According to the AIIB, the investment plan covers sectors including transportation, energy, water resources and the environment, and will provide financial support for the development of multiple areas in Uzbekistan.
Mirziyoyev visited China twice last year, once for the China-Central Asia Summit and later for the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.
According to Zhao, Uzbekistan places significant emphasis on the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China. This initiative has proven instrumental in transforming Uzbekistan's landlocked status into a strategic advantage, positioning it as a pivotal transportation hub in Central Asia. Uzbekistan has effectively become a crucial bridge, facilitating connectivity between China, Europe, the Middle East and South Asia.
Ahead of his visit this time, Mirziyoyev published a signed article in the Global Times on Monday with the title ""Uzbekistan and China: millennia-long friendship and cooperation."" He wrote, ""The development of multifaceted relations with China has been, and remains, one of the main priorities of Uzbekistan's foreign policy.""
Cui observed that Central Asia has become a focal point in the ongoing power struggles among major nations, such as the US, Russia, India and Turkey, who are all vying to strengthen ties with countries in the region. This emerging trend holds both opportunities and potential risks for the Central Asian nations, according to Cui.
In September, US President Joe Biden met with the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Biden described this meeting of the C5+1 diplomatic platform - held for the first time at this level - as ""a historic moment, building on years of close cooperation.""
At the time when conflicts and crises are mounting, Central Asia, located in a zone of volatile geopolitical competition, attaches growing importance to security, said experts.
Cui noted that China's security values have special appeal and deeply resonate with Central Asian countries. Those countries hope to align their security needs with China's security needs. In this sense, Central Asian countries hope to step up collaboration on security with China, according to Cui."
2UX308ZMNY_9NDVA2MP3ZORG0M,"World News in Brief: ICJ to release emergency measures over Israel genocide allegations, Libya flood repair bill, leprosy stigma continues",_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-unnews05.htm,"25 January 2024 - The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is due to issue an emergency measures order on Friday relating to South Africa's accusations of genocide by the Israeli military in Gaza, which Israel strongly denies.
Since 7 October when Israel launched its military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the militant group's terror attacks in southern Israel that left some 1,200 dead and more than 250 taken hostage, Gaza health authorities have reported at least 25,700 killed and some 63,740 injured.
In its case, which began earlier this month in the Hague, South Africa asked the Court - a principal organ of the UN - to indicate provisional measures in order to ""protect against further severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people under the Genocide Convention"".
Call for immediate end to fighting
Among the measures South Africa has asked for are the immediate suspension of military operations by Israel in the Strip, and that its forces take ""all reasonable measures"" to prevent genocide.
South Africa also asked the world court to order Israel to prevent forced displacement, allow adequate food and water to reach civilians and ensure that evidence of any potential genocide is preserved.
Provisional measures are a type of temporary injunction or holding measure ahead of a final decision on the dispute. It is likely to take years before a judgement is reached.
The measures are considered mandatory for implementation, but the Court has no means of enforcing them.
Israel argued in presenting its case that the war on Hamas was one purely of defence and ""not against the Palestinian people"".
Lawyers for Israel said that provisional measures, if granted, would amount to ""an attempt to deny Israel its ability to meet its obligations to the defence of its citizens, to the hostages and to over 110,000 displaced Israelis"".
$1.8 billion needed to restore Libyan communities after catastrophic flooding
To Libya, where the repair bill for catastrophic flooding last September that affected some 1.5 million people has been estimated at $1.8 billion, according to the UN team there.
More than 4,300 people died and thousands more were reported missing after Storm Daniel made landfall in Libya, bringing strong winds and sudden heavy rainfall that caused dams to burst and destroying thousands of buildings.
Building more resilient homes and public infrastructure is a critically important part of the post-disaster recovery process, the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) insisted, in a joint report with the World Bank and the European Union.
Georgette Gagnon, the top UN official in the country, said that ""time is of the essence for affected people"" in the east, notably the coastal city of Derna, which satellite imagery showed had been all but washed out to sea by the disaster.
Ms. Gagnon noted that the report offered ""a clear path forward"" for reconstruction, including the creation of a coordinated national platform.
""Let's channel our collective resources and expertise towards rebuilding, prioritizing the people, their livelihoods and wellbeing,"" she said.
Stigma and shame still surround leprosy victims, warn top rights experts
Although leprosy is age-old and can be cured, the disease is still endemic in more than 120 countries, leaving an estimated one to two million people visibly disfigured and lacking support to cope with the stigma they face.
That's the urgent message from top UN-appointed human rights experts on Thursday who said that some 200,000 new cases of leprosy are registered each year worldwide.
People suffering from leprosy, which is also known as Hansen's disease, have a right to high-quality support and health care, the rights experts maintained, urging governments and international organizations to make sure their policies and procedures reflect this fundamental requirement.
'Ex-colonies'
In a statement endorsed by the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Women, the rights experts noted that leprosy patients and their families continue to be segregated in ""ex-colonies"", kept away from public spaces and interaction with other people.
Ahead of World Leprosy Day on 28 January, the rights experts - who are known as Special Rapporteurs - stressed that affected persons had a right to early detection and treatment as well as rehabilitation and active support.
Children, the elderly and women are particularly affected by leprosy and judgmental attitudes and policies towards the disease, along with minorities and indigenous peoples, the rights experts said.
Special Rapporteurs are appointed by the Human Rights Council. They do not receive a salary for their work and serve in their individual capacity."

Tehran, IRNA -- Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy says that the Yemeni armed forces are acting independently in their military operations in the Red Sea, adding that attacks on Israeli-linked ships are in line with supporting the Muslim people of Gaza in their struggle against the Zionist regime.
""The Yemenis showed they cannot tolerate seeing the martyrdom of Muslim families in Gaza,"" said Rear Admiral Ali Reza Tangsiri in remarks published on Monday.
Tangsiri told the Al Alam news channel that Yemen is an independent country with a strong army and a strong leadership that is not directed by any external party.
Yemenis have been launching attacks on Israeli-linked ships since the Israeli regime started a brutal military campaign on Gaza in early October.
The attacks expanded earlier this month to cover ships owned by US and Britain after the two countries launched attacks on the Yemeni soil in what they said was meant to protect shipping in the Red Sea and surrounding waterways.

Fellow Ukrainians!
First of all, concerning the Russian strike in the morning. Almost 40   missiles of various types - another combined attack attempting to   bypass our air defense system. A significant number of missiles were   shot down. Unfortunately, there were also hits. More than 200 various   objects were damaged - 139 of them are houses, ordinary houses... 130   people were wounded or injured. All of them are being provided with the   necessary assistance. Unfortunately, 18 people were killed... My   condolences to their families and friends. And this death toll may   increase. In particular, the rescue operation in Kharkiv is still   underway - the rubble of the building is being dismantled. It was an   ordinary high-rise building, ordinary people lived there.
Ordinary life is what modern Russia considers a threat to itself.   This state is a typical terrorist. And let them in Russia know that the   Ukrainian character is capable of being long-range enough to retaliate.   The Russian war will inevitably be brought back home - back to where   this evil came from, where it must be quelled. Right there, in Russia. I   thank everyone who ensures that the logistics of the terrorist state,   the infrastructure, and the Russian state itself feel the true cost of   war.
Second for today. I would like to recognize the entire team of the   State Emergency Service of Ukraine, everyone who works to save lives and   help after the attacks. Who dedicates their lives day and night to   ensure that everyone is saved. Kharkiv and the region, Kyiv and the   region, Sumy, Chernihiv, Donetsk regions, Zaporizhzhia and the region,   Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odesa regions, Dnipro and the region, Kropyvnytskyi   and the region. All our regions, all our communities that need   protection and receive it from the State Emergency Service. I thank   everyone in the SES ranks for their dedication, professionalism and   humanity.
I would especially like to mention the employees of the State   Emergency Service in Kharkiv region: Sergeant Oleksiy Rudchenko, Chief   Master Sergeants Serhiy Onopriyenko and Ruslan Holik, Senior Lieutenant   Vitaliy Pidlisnyi and Major Mykyta Zakharov. Thank you, guys!
The State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kyiv: Master Sergeant   Andriy Didkivsky, Chief Master Sergeants Mykola Knysh, Kostiantyn Koniev   and Serhiy Nakonechnyi, and Captain Ivanna Davydenko. Thank you!
And the State Emergency Service of the Donetsk region: Sergeants   Artur Taranenko, Artem Tolmachov, Kostiantyn Kalus and Stepan Holivets,   as well as Captains of the Civil Protection Service Serhiy Subbotin and   Oleksandr Pekhterev. I thank everyone who saves and helps save lives.
The third thing that is important to say today.
I met with the President of the European People's Party, Manfred   Weber, who was on a visit to Ukraine today. This is a significant   political force in Europe. We had a rather productive conversation. I   informed him of the situation on the battlefield and our defense against   Russian terror. We must further step up our cooperation with all   partners on air defense - this is the priority that this year, both in   the defense of our cities and villages and in the defense of our   positions at the front, should influence the strategic situation, and   therefore the course of the war in general. I am grateful to every   partner who helps us with this. Of course, together with the head of the   European People's Party, we discussed our work at the level of European   institutions, our expectations from the European Council and, more   specifically, Ukraine's integration.
And one more thing. NSDC.
Today the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine issued a   decision on economic security and economic stability right now, during   martial law. It clearly defines the steps that will help both Ukrainian   entrepreneurs and state institutions to overcome the whole range of   problems that have been discussed a lot in recent weeks. As agreed upon   by the government and business representatives, a Council for   Entrepreneurship Support will be formed, and it will include   representatives from the business community. These are well-known names,   prominent executives of Ukrainian companies. Businesses that work for   the benefit of millions of people. Technology businesses, finance,   services, and other industries. Different sectors, to ensure a diversity   of views. But the common goal is the strengthening of our economy, our   society.
Furthermore, there is absolute clarity regarding law enforcement   agencies. The government will present amendments to the law on the   Economic Security Bureau and some other laws to minimize the potential   for any possible pressure on ""white"", legal businesses. The NSDC has   also decided on a three-month term of a de facto moratorium on   procedural actions that could block the work of an enterprise. An audit   of the tax invoice risk monitoring system is also to be conducted. All   issues with tax invoices must be resolved. And there's a lot more -   everything is specified in detail in the decree.
The state will fulfill its part of the moral contract with business.   It is important that every business in Ukraine also fulfills its part of   the agreement: the business pays taxes, operates legally, respects its   employees, and definitely does not work with Russia. We all work solely   for Ukraine's victory!
I thank everyone who strengthens Ukraine, who safeguards Ukrainians,   who fights, works and helps for Ukraine to withstand and emerge   victorious.
Glory to Ukraine!"

We are gravely concerned by reports today of strikes hitting a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) facility â with subsequent reports of fires in the buildingâin a neighborhood in southern Gaza where more than 30,000 displaced Palestinians had reportedly been sheltering. While we don't yet have all the details on what happened and will continue to seek further information regarding today's incidents, the loss of every innocent life is a tragedy. This conflict has already resulted in the devastating deaths and injuries of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and we mourn every single civilian life that has been lost. It's heartbreaking to see children killed, injured, and orphaned. The United States is unwavering in our support for Israel's right to defend itself, consistent with international humanitarian law, against Hamas terrorists who hide among the civilian population and want to annihilate the State of Israel. But Israel retains a responsibility to protect civilians, including, humanitarian personnel and sites. And, as President Biden has been clear from the earliest days of this crisis, the United States will also continue working to increase life-saving humanitarian assistance into Gaza and to bring home all of the hostages held there.

""The Ukrainian prisoners of war were transported to the Belgorod region in order to conduct yet another swap that was agreed between Moscow and Kyiv,"" Lavrov told reporters. ""Instead of this, the Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region, it targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government was insisting on an international investigation.
""All facts must be established,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Wednesday. ""As much as possible, given that the aircraft crashed in Russian territory that is beyond our control.""
Zelenskyy said Russia was ""playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war, the feelings of their relatives, and the emotions of our society.""
Ukraine's military did not directly mention the plane crash but said Russia had carried out attacks linked to Russian military aircraft landing in Belgorod, and that Ukraine would target Russian military planes believed to be carrying missiles for future attacks.
Video of the crash posted on social media showed a plane falling from the sky on its side before exploding into a massive fireball as it hit the ground in Russia's snowy, rural, western Belgorod region.
Kharkiv borders Belgorod, which is Russian territory. The two sides have carried out numerous prisoner swaps since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago.

Russia launched fresh drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's southern regions of Odesa, Mykolaiyv, and Dnipropetrovsk early on January 25, wounding several people and causing material damage, the Ukrainian military and regional officials said.
Ukraine's air defense said the drones attacked Odesa in two separate waves. A total of 11 of the 14 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia were downed -- 10 in Odesa and one in Mykolaiyv.
Regional Governor Oleh Kiper said six people were wounded by falling debris in the Black Sea port.
Kiper said that an industrial facility, residential buildings, and civilian infrastructure were damaged in the attack. He said the southern city's Primoriye and Khadzhibey districts bore the brunt of the attack.
Local authorities said the Russian attack also targeted the warehouse of a furniture factory in the industrial district of Odesa, starting a large fire.
In the Dnipropetrovsk region, an industrial enterprise was destroyed in a drone strike that caused a fire, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram, adding that the fire had been put out by firefighters.
Lysak also said the settlement of Myrivsk, in the Nikopol area, came under Russian artillery fire.
Russia also targeted Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, with five S-300 antiaircraft guided missiles, the air defense said. It was not immediately known if the missile strike caused damage or injuries.
The eastern city of Kharkiv, which is located some 30 kilometers from the Russian border, has recently been subjected to an unusually intense wave of missile strikes that targeted residential areas. In the latest such attack, at least 10 people were killed on January 23.
On the battlefield, amid a seesaw of offensive and defensive actions by both sides, Russian troops continued their unsuccessful attempts to encircle the industrial city of Avdiyivka in the eastern region of Donetsk.
The General Staff of Ukraine's military said in its early morning report on January 25 that four such attempts were repelled by Ukrainian defenders over the past 24 hours.

Remarks  Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State  Cabo Verdean Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva  Praia, Cabo Verde  January 22, 2024
PRIME MINISTER SILVA: (Via interpreter) Good morning, Your Excellency Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Welcome to Cabo Verde.  A special visit of yours to Cabo Verde, to the city of Praia, strengthens our excellent relations between Cabo Verde and United States of America.  This visit to four African countries that begins in Cabo Verde is an example of the Biden administration's genuine interest in win-win partnerships with Africa.
Cabo Verde is a longstanding and consistent partner of the U.S.  We have a diaspora of thousands of American Cape Verdeans, Cape Verdean American citizens who are proud of their origins.  We share values of democracy, good governance, respect for human rights, and a defense of human dignity.
History, diaspora, and values are the foundations of our relations.  That's why they are strong in structure.  In general, Cape Verde's foreign relations are guided by the values of liberal democracy, international law, and multilateralism, and by predictability, consistency, and trust in our partnerships.  It is based on these references that we strongly condemn Russians' - Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we condemned the terrorist act of Hamas in Israel, and we defend solutions that make the two states of Israel and Palestine viable.  We condemn coup d'etat and changes to constitutional term limits for presidents of the republic that have occurred in Africa.  We clearly and explicitly define the U.S.A., Brazil, the united European Union, and the UK as strategic partners for cooperative security and defense.
In relation to our partnership, I would like to express my gratitude for your support in the fight against COVID-19.  Vaccines have been decisive in the good fight we have waged against COVID.  As a demonstration of this, Cape Verde is one of the higher - has one of the higher rates of vaccination, and we are thankful for the quick and consistent response of the U.S.A.
To recognize another Millennium Challenge Account compact is an important distinction for Cape Verde (inaudible) to underline the important investment in the construction of the new embassy of the United States in Cabo Verde, specifically in the city of Praia, and underlined the important investment in the construction of the U.S. embassy.
We recognize the partnership program with the National Guard of the state of New Hampshire in the training and technical assistance of our coast guard.  I personally witnessed this partnership.  We want to strengthen our relations in terms of (inaudible) diplomatic dialogue of attracting investment and exports, training, science and technology, and the spread of the English language for the development of our country.  The massification of the English language is strategic for developing the potential of tourism; business; technological, scientific, and academic connectivity in a country open to the world and with a high level of economic freedom.  In this sense, we would like to have the Peace Corps return to Cabo Verde.
We believe that partnership for development and cooperative security should go hand in hand.  It is in our common interest for the developed countries and partners.  We would like to strengthen our partnership with the U.S. in maritime security and cyber security from a regional, global perspective - the structured, predictable, and sustained partnership.  We have good topics for conversation during our work (inaudible).  Thank you, and I'll give you the floor.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Prime Minister, thank you for the incredible warmth of your welcome, and I also mean that literally.  We've just come from the snows of Washington, D.C. to quite literally the warmth of Cabo Verde.  We're so delighted to be here.
(Interruption.)
Very good.  Thank you.  As you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are here on the first day of a trip that takes us from Cabo Verde to CÃ´te d'Ivoire and then on to Nigeria and finally to Angola, and this trip - and by the way, I believe the last time a secretary of state was in Cabo Verde was more than 20 years ago with Secretary Powell, and I'm thrilled to follow in his footsteps.  But we're here in Cabo Verde, in Africa because, as President Biden has said, our futures are linked, our prosperity is linked, our people are linked.  And African voices increasingly are shaping, animating, and leading the world in conversation.
The United States is committed to deepening, to strengthening, to broadening our partnerships across Africa, partnerships that benefit Africans and Americans alike.  As President Biden has said, we are all in when it comes to Africa.  But I have to tell you there's a good reason that we're starting here in Cabo Verde, and that's because you have been and you are a remarkable partner for the United States.  And as you've said, Prime Minister, this is a partnership that is based fundamentally on shared values as well as shared interests, and also a deep history together.  Assistant Secretary Phee was just telling me of a Cabo Verdean who played a prominent role in our own Civil War, and we have so much history since then, and very strong communities of Cabo Verdeans in the United States who contribute in remarkable ways to our country.
But in our own relationship, I believe that the work we've already done and that we can build on in terms of our economic partnership is absolutely critical.  It is extraordinary that Cabo Verde is the first country to complete two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now you're starting to build a third one.  I'm deeply honored that we were able through one of the compacts to make substantial investments in the port here of Praia, and that's had manifest benefits for the port.  In fact, I look forward to visiting it a little while later.
We'll have a lot on our agenda, as you've suggested.  One of the things that we'll focus on, health and health security - I have to congratulate you on the malaria -free certification for Cabo Verde, which is also a remarkable achievement.  But along with health, along, of course, with climate, which we know animates your government and animates our partnership, I have to also tell you that for the United States, Cabo Verde is truly a beacon of stability in the region at a time when there is more than our share of instability and challenge.  And, of course, that goes well beyond the region of West Africa.  We see it in different parts of the world.
But the work that you've done - and we've been proud to partner with you - for example, on law enforcement, on drug interdiction, seizing more than 30 tons of cocaine in recent years, has been very significant.  And beyond that, in our own partnership, working with you on your coast guard, restoring vessels, as well as strong packages to support U.S.-built aircraft here in Cabo Verde that are so critical to maintaining maritime domain awareness, making sure that, for a country that is 99 percent sea, that you have a complete picture of what's happening around you.
You also noted and I must underscore as well the global issues where we've been partnered.  I have to thank you, thank you for deeply, for the strong, principled voice Cabo Verde has brought to international conversations, international discussions, international work at the United Nations and beyond.  We see this in some of the very difficult issues that you've tackled from a place of principle, including Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
We're also building partnerships that are founded in multilateral work in other critical ways that will really be to the benefit of Cabo Verdeans and Americans alike - our new Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, where Cabo Verde is playing a leading role, and we are grateful for that - and then, as I mentioned as well, a strong voice around the world on climate, because you know better than so many the effects both now and potential when it comes to climate change.  But building a blue economy - that too is I think a very powerful part of our partnership.
Prime Minister, you said something very powerful that I just want to repeat, and that is that your true source of wealth, of richness is in the peace, security, stability, and democracy that Cabo Verde enjoys.  And we want to leverage those strengths to the benefit of Cabo Verdeans but also Americans and, in fact, the entire world.  So it's in that spirit that we're here today - a spirit of partnership, a spirit of admiration for the work that you've done, and a determination to do even more together between the United States and Cabo Verde.  We're grateful for your welcome, your hospitality.  And of course - I saved the best for last - congratulations on making the knockout round in the Africa Cup.  We'll be looking, we'll be watching carefully, and - don't tell anyone - we're cheering for you.  (Laughter.)  So thank you so much.
PRIME MINISTER SILVA:  Thank you."

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was submitting a key draft law to the Verkhovna Rada to introduce the institution of multiple citizenship in Ukraine. This was stated by the President in his address on the Day of Unity of Ukraine.
""Today I am submitting to the Verkhovna Rada a key draft law that will allow the adoption of comprehensive legislative amendments and the introduction of multiple citizenship. And it will allow all ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from around the world to have our citizenship. Of course, except for citizens of the aggressor country,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted.
As the President emphasized, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, the multimillion-strong diaspora of Ukrainians around the world has stood up for the interests of our country and has been helping us despite being hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from their homeland.
""Those who collect, find, pack and deliver everything needed for the victory. All those who have not forgotten their roots and do not let the world forget about Ukraine. Everyone who has Ukrainian blood in their veins and a free heart beating in their chest. Ukrainians by origin, who have long proven that they are Ukrainians in spirit. And after many years of waiting, they should finally become Ukrainians by passport. At the legislative level,"" he stressed.
According to the Head of State, multiple citizenship will be one of the opportunities to realize the right to be Ukrainian, for which we are now fighting.
""Foreign volunteers who took up arms to defend Ukraine, all those who fight for Ukraine's freedom as if it were their homeland. And Ukraine will become such for them. For everyone who can feel that ""being in Ukraine"" means ""being at home."" Not as tourists, but as citizens. Citizens of a great, united, single Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy added."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The coalition forces of the United States and Britain launched new strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Monday, the U.S. Central Command said.
The latest strikes, carried out at about 11:59 p.m. Sanaa time (2059 GMT), were aimed at 8 targets in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, the command said on X, formerly Twitter, adding that Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands provided support for the strikes.
""The targets included missile systems and launchers, air defense systems, radars, and deeply buried weapons storage facilities,"" it said.
Acting unilaterally or in concert with its allies and partners, the U.S. military has launched eight rounds of strikes against Houthi targets since Jan. 12.
These moves were intended to degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their attacks on commercial and naval vessels sailing in the Red Sea, Bab-Al-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden, the command said.
The United States has named the strikes ""Operation Poseidon Archer,"" CNN reported earlier, suggesting that they might become ""more organized"" and last for a longer period of time.
Earlier in the day, U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak discussed Houthi attacks against merchant and naval vessels transiting the Red Sea over the phone, according to a readout of the White House.
""They reiterated their commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks,"" it said."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Israeli military has reportedly carried out yet another artillery attack in southern Lebanon amid heightened tensions between the Lebanese Resistance Movement Hezbollah and the Zionist regime.
Sama news agency has quoted a Lebanese source as saying that the Israeli artillery shells the towns of Belida and Meiss al-Jabal in southern Lebanon.
The reported attack comes a day after a member of Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah was killed in an Israeli drone attack targeting a car in southern Lebanon. A high ranking official from the resistance group said to have survived the strike.
On early Sunday, Israeli warplanes also fired missiles and rockets at the towns of al-Adisa, Misra, and Aabbassiyeh, located in the south of Lebanon.
Last week, Hezbollah also launched new strikes on northern parts of the occupied territories, firing a barrage of missiles at Western Galilee where sirens were sounded. The group also targeted gatherings of Israeli soldiers near the outposts of Al-Abad and al-Raheb.
The two sides have kept exchanging artillery fire and rockets since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza in early October. The Lebanese movement says attacks on Israel will stop only if the regime ends its onslaught on Palestinians.

Twenty four Israeli troopers have been killed in Gaza in the last 24 hours, making it the deadliest day for its invading forces since their ground operation began.
The chief Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari told reporters on Tuesday that the number included 21 troopers who were killed in an explosion.
According to Hagari resistance fighters had fired rocket-propelled grenades at a tank, and at the same time, an explosion occurred in two buildings where forces had planted explosives to destroy them. The buildings collapsed onto the troops.
""We are still studying and investigating the details of the event and the reasons for the explosion,"" he said.
Earlier, the military had said three soldiers were also killed in a separate attack in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, bringing the Israeli occupation forces death toll to 219 for ground operations.
The so-called Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the deaths of 24 soldiers in a single day make it ""clearer than ever"" that Israel must not cease operations in Gaza.
American author and blogger Max Blumenthal said in a social media post that, ""Israel's military confirms 21 soldiers were killed as they were rigging homes in central Gaza to be detonated. This TikTok occupation army cannot break Gaza. US talk of 'the day after' is ridiculous. Invading soldiers will continue to die in vain until a ceasefire is imposed.""
The Israeli military deaths came as Israeli forces pushed deep into western Khan Younis in Gaza, with an air, sea, and land bombardment that included storming a hospital and arresting medical staff, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra told Reuters.
Israel launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, claiming it is the principal headquarters of Hamas fighters.
More than 25,295 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health authorities, ever since the Zionist regime launched its bloody attack against Gaza on October 7."

At least 27 people were killed on January 21 by shelling at a market on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk in Russian-occupied Ukraine, the head of the Russian-installed authority in Donetsk said.
An additional 25 people were injured in the strike on the suburb of Tekstilshchik, including two teenagers, said Denis Pushilin, who accused the Ukrainian military of firing the shells.
He blamed Ukraine for the attack, calling it a ""horrific"" artillery strike on a civilian area.
Ukrainian shelling of a separate neighborhood in the city killed one person, Pushilin said, bringing the total number of dead in occupied Donetsk to 28.
According to Aleksei Kulemzin, Donetsk city's Russian-installed mayor, Ukrainian forces bombarded a busy area where shops and a market are located.
Pushilin announced a day of mourning on January 22 in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, the name given to the part of the region Russia says it has annexed.
Kyiv has not commented on the event, and the claims of the Russian-installed officials in Donetsk could not be independently verified.
The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed the strike on Ukraine and described it as a ""terrorist attack.""
""These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will toward achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means,"" it said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a message on X, formerly Twitter, saying that thousands of people would still be alive today if Moscow had not launched the war but did not mention the strike against occupied Donetsk.
""Russia must feel and realize forever that the aggressor loses the most as a result of aggression,"" he said, adding that on January 21 more than 100 Ukrainian cities, towns, and villages in nine regions had been shelled and, unfortunately, there were dead and wounded.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today's shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,"" according to a UN spokesperson, adding that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
The Donetsk regional military administration, meanwhile, said one person was killed and another was wounded as a result of shelling by Russian troops of Kurakhovo on January 21.
Vadym Filashkin accused the Russian troops of aiming at residential buildings, adding that a 31-year-old man died at the scene.
A kindergarten and several private houses were damaged by the impact, and a fire broke out, which the rescuers have already extinguished, Filashkin said on Telegram.
Earlier on January 21, the Russian Defense Ministry announced a missile attack on the occupied Crimea.
Russian anti-aircraft missiles allegedly shot down three missiles over the Black Sea near the western coast of the Russian-occupied peninsula, the ministry said on Telegram.
Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Russian-installed governor of the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014, said at the time that air-defense forces had ""shot down an aerial target"" over the Black Sea.
Prior to the statement, an RFE/RL correspondent reported an air raid and three explosions in Sevastopol.
On the front line, Russian forces took control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, the Russian Defense Ministry announced on January 21.
Ukrainian forces confirmed that the settlement had been occupied, but Volodymyr Fityo, spokesman for Ukrainian Ground Forces Command, said Kyiv's troops had been pulled back to pre-prepared reserve positions.
He said Krokhmalne had a population of roughly 45 people before the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. ""That's five houses, probably,"" he was quoted as saying by Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske. ""Our main goal is to save the lives of Ukraine's defenders.""

Press release  24 January 2024  Brussels
Today, the Commission and the Belgian Presidency of the Council of   the EU, together with Member States, ports authorities, European   associations, EU Agencies (Europol, EMCDDA) and representatives from   customs and law enforcement authorities are launching the European Ports Alliance Public Private Partnership.   The partnership aims to bring all relevant stakeholders together, to   form solutions to protect ports from drug trafficking and criminal   infiltration.
This follows up on the EU Roadmap to fight Drug Trafficking and Organised Crime and is in line with President von der Leyen's commitment to take action   in 2024 to fight drugs smuggling and criminal infiltration into   European ports.
The launch of the European Ports Alliance Public Private Partnership   comes against a backdrop of criminal networks using extreme violence,   corruption and intimidation in their search for profits. Seizures of   cocaine in the EU are at record levels, with more than 300 tonnes seized   on an annual basis in recent years. In Belgium alone, authorities   seized a record 121 metric tonnes of cocaine at the Port of   Antwerp-Bruges in 2023, a 10% increase from the previous year.
Ports contribute to 75% of EU external trade volumes and 31% of EU   internal trade volumes. As such, ports are particularly vulnerable to   drug smuggling and exploitation by high-risk criminal networks.   Criminals use ports to organise the passage of containers containing   illicit goods into the EU. This includes drugs trafficking, one of the   most lucrative criminal activities, which poses significant security   threats to the EU. This is why public and private port operators, from   port authorities to terminal operators and shipping and logistics   companies, play a crucial role in protecting ports and EU's security.
The European Ports Alliance aims at:
This public private partnership will strengthen the resilience of ports and step up the fight against drug trafficking and criminal infiltration.   It will focus on identifying vulnerabilities, sharing best practices   and finding practical solutions to strengthen port security. It will   address intimidation, corruption and criminal infiltration in ports,   through the implementation of international and EU security standards   and cooperation between law enforcement and customs with public and   private operators working in the ports.
The launch will be followed by a joint declaration,   stating the commitment of law enforcement, customs and public and   private operators working in ports, to address together the threats   posed by organised crime.
The work of the European Ports Alliance will be further supported by the results of the Schengen evaluation on drugs trafficking,   which was concluded in November 2023. This thematic evaluation   constituted the first such type of exercise under the new Schengen   Evaluation and Monitoring Mechanism Regulation. As a follow up to the   evaluation, the Commission is adopting today a proposal for the Council to consider the best practices identified during the 2023 thematic Schengen evaluation.   The 2023 evaluation assessed Member States' capabilities in the area of   police cooperation, protection of external borders, and management of   IT systems to fight against drug trafficking in the EU.
Next steps
Following the launch event, the Public Private Partnership will meet   annually at ministerial level, to identify remaining challenges, set   strategic priorities and exchange on progress made. Senior official   meetings will take place to prepare and follow up on the priorities set   by the annual ministerial meeting.
Background
Fighting organised crime and drug trafficking is a priority for the   Commission as outlined in the EU Security Union Strategy, the EU Strategy to Tackle Organised crime and the EU Strategy on Drugs.
On 18 October 2023 the Commission adopted the EU Roadmap to fight Drug Trafficking and Organised Crime which included the European Ports Alliance as a flagship initiative,   bringing together all relevant public and private actors in the fight   against drugs smuggling and criminal infiltration of logistic hubs."

The Head of State thanked the Chancellor for his personal efforts aimed to ensure comprehensive long-term support for Ukraine in countering Russian aggression and increase defense assistance to â¬8 billion for the current year.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the recent decision to transfer six Sea King Mk41 helicopters to Ukraine. He informed the German Chancellor of the current situation on the frontline and the priority needs of Ukrainian defenders.
The parties had a detailed discussion of further defense cooperation, particularly bolstering Ukraine's air defense system to protect the skies from Russian aerial terror, and providing Ukraine's defenders with artillery and armored vehicles.
The President noted Germany's significant role in rallying EU partners to enhance defense support for Ukraine.

The United States and the Government of Iraq will start working group meetings of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission (HMC) in the coming days, initiating a process the two sides committed to during the U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue (JSCD) in Washington, D.C., on August 7-8, 2023. The commencement of the HMC process reflects the deep U.S. commitment to regional stability and Iraqi sovereignty.
The HMC will enable the transition to an enduring bilateral security partnership between the United States and Iraq, building on the successes of Iraq's Defeat-Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (D-ISIS) campaign in partnership with the Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve as part of the Global Coalition to D-ISIS.
The HMC builds upon the inaugural U.S.-Iraq JSCD, held on August 7-8, 2023. During that meeting, the United States and Iraq committed to start the HMC to discuss how the Coalition's mission to defeat ISIS will transition on a timeline that considers three key factors: the threat from ISIS, operational and environmental requirements, and the Iraqi security forces' capability levels.
Expert working groups of military and defense professionals will examine these three factors and advise the HMC on the most effective evolution of the D-ISIS Coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with Coalition partners at all stages of the process.
U.S. military personnel are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve's mission to advise, assist, and enable the Iraqi security forces in their ongoing fight against ISIS. The United States remains committed to a secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq.
The United States and Iraq have enjoyed a deep and productive partnership on security matters in the 10 years since the Iraqi government invited the United States and the Coalition to fight ISIS, including the seven years since the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq. The start of the HMC process reflects the evolving U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship under the Strategic Framework Agreement, and it underscores our commitment to deepen our security cooperation to advance stability within Iraq and the region.

Over the next six months, thousands of U.S. service members will participate in the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Dubbed Exercise Steadfast Defender 24, it will feature about 90,000 service members from the 31 NATO allies and Sweden. It will test the ability of the alliance to quickly deploy forces and will test NATO's new defense plans, officials said.
""The alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via trans-Atlantic movement of forces from North America,"" said Army Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, in a press release. ""Steadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order.""
The first movement in the exercise began yesterday as the dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall sailed from Norfolk, Virginia. Following a series of operations, the ship will sail across the Atlantic.
The overall exercise will run through June. It is NATO's principal multidomain exercise for 2024 and will consist of a series of national and multinational large-scale, live exercises conducted across various geographical locations.
Officials said Steadfast Defender is the largest exercise since the last Reforger exercise in 1988.
The exercise is the first, large-scale test of alliance defense plans approved at last year's Vilnius Summit in Lithuania.
At its base, the exercise is a demonstration of alliance unity and determination to defend every inch of NATO territory. The exercise will demonstrate ""NATO's ability to deploy, move and use reinforcements from North America and other parts of the alliance to continental Europe,"" alliance officials said. ""It will show that we can conduct and sustain complex multidomain operations over several months, across thousands of kilometers, from the high north to central and Eastern Europe and in any conditions.""
The exercise will take place primarily in Finland, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom, officials said. There will be more than 50 naval assets, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates and corvettes.
Air assets will include F-35s, FA-18s, Harriers, F-15s, helicopters and myriad unmanned aerial vehicles.
There will also be more than 1,100 combat vehicles, including more than 150 tanks, 500 infantry fighting vehicles and 400 armored personnel carriers.
Officials said the exercise is based on a fictitious Article 5 scenario ""triggered by a fictitious attack against the alliance launched by a near-peer adversary,"" officials said. ""NATO exercises are not directed against any country. In an unpredictable security environment, we must remain ready to deter all threats and to defend all allies.""
Still, Russia has launched the largest war in Europe since World War II, attacking neighboring Ukraine. Since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO has strengthened defense and deterrence on the continent. While Steadfast Defender has been in planned for years, the exercise incorporates defense plans based on Russia's actions.
""Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine will shape our understanding of conflict for years to come,"" a NATO official said. ""NATO is observing the conflict in Ukraine closely in order to improve our readiness and refine our future training, capabilities and innovation."""

KYIV -- President Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked Ukraine's Day of Unity with the introduction of a draft law that allows multiple citizenships, a move that would make it possible for foreign fighters and ethnic Ukrainians outside the country to hold Ukrainian passports while not giving up other citizenship.
Zelenskiy said in an address on January 22, which marks the 1919 Unification Act of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic, that the law would not apply to ""citizens of the aggressor country,"" a thinly veiled reference to Russian citizens.
Ukraine has been fighting to repel a full-scale Russian invasion, launched by the Kremlin in February 2022. The Ukrainian government established an officially sanctioned foreign legion just days after the invasion, with some estimates putting the number of foreigners at around 2,000.
""Today, we have to step forward not only to strengthen the unity of Ukraine and our people, but also for the unity of the rights and freedoms, the truth for Ukrainians, the truth for us, and the truth for our history,"" Zelenskiy said of the draft law that will allow the adoption of comprehensive legislative amendments and the introduction of multiple citizenship.
""Those who, with the outbreak of a full-scale war, regardless of their place of residence, birth, or passport, said in the affirmative, 'I am Ukrainian.'... Ukrainians by origin, who have long proven that they are Ukrainians in spirit. And after many years of waiting, they should finally become Ukrainians by passport,"" he added.
Current law does not allow dual or multiple citizenship for Ukrainian passport holders. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a similar law earlier this month enabling foreign fighters the possibility of receiving Russian citizenship.
Zelenskiy also signed a decree that contains an outline of a program ""to preserve the ethnic identity of Ukrainians"" traditionally residing in Russia's Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov regions.
The Day of Unity has been marked as a national holiday in Ukraine since 1999.
The idea to mark the Day of Unity appeared almost a decade before that, when the country was still part of what was then the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians joined together on January 21, 1990, to form a live chain connecting Kyiv, the capital, with several other nearby cities in a show of unity and nationalism.

20240122
Ukrainian forces deliberately attack purely civilian targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said while addressing the UN Security Council meeting.
The majority of impartial experts see that the West's continued support of Kiev impedes peace, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the UN Security Council in New York on Monday.
""Today, it is completely obvious to the overwhelming majority of non-biased experts that the key factor that impedes the search for paths to a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis is the ongoing Western support of the Kiev regime,"" Lavrov said at a UNSC meeting.
The Russian foreign minister put the blame for the recent civilian deaths in a Donetsk market on those sending weapons to Kiev.
""The 'merchants of death' are not at all embarrassed that their weapons, including cluster munitions and shells with depleted uranium, methodically, mercilessly and deliberately hit purely civilian targets, as it was during the attack on residential areas of Belgorod on December 30 and yesterday on the market and shops of Donetsk,"" Lavrov said.
""The blood of dozens of dead civilians is on the conscience of those who arm (Volodymyr) Zelensky's regime and at the same time officially declare that the Kiev authorities themselves have the right to choose targets for strikes,"" the minister emphasized.
Conflict in Ukraine Just Business for the US
Lavrov compared the US position on military funding to Ukraine to a profitable business project.
""Mr. Blinken, the US secretary of state, focuses on the fact that continued assistance to Ukraine is a guarantee of creating new jobs in the United States. As if this is not about financing a war that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in Ukraine, but about some kind of profitable business project,"" Lavrov said.
He recalled that a striking example of US entrepreneurial activity in Ukraine is the acquisition by the structures of businessman George Soros of black earth soils for the disposal of waste from the Western chemical industry.
""Most of the large Ukrainian factories and companies, including lithium production, were sold to the same Americans. Fertile lands were leased to them for an indefinite period, as we say, at a cheap price,"" Lavrov added.
The Russian top diplomat highlighted that Kiev resells some Western weapons on the black market, and it is difficult to imagine that Western capitals do not know about this.
""In an effort to profit as much as possible from the conflict [in Ukraine], those in charge in Kiev are simply reselling some of the weapons supplied by the West on the black market,"" the minister said. He noted that ""you can find enough similar advertisements on the darknet.""
""It's hard to imagine that this is happening without the knowledge and participation of Western businessmen, because, as they say, one hand washes the other,"" the Russian minister added.
If Ukraine stops fighting, hundreds of thousands of its citizens will not have to die for Western geopolitical interests, he continued.
""Hundreds of thousands of those whom the Kiev authorities are trying to catch like cattle today on the streets, in bars, in churches and as cannon fodder will definitely save their lives for Western geopolitical interests and, as they say for 'democratic values',"" the minister said.
Lavrov emphasized that there are no interests - and there never were - in the conflict with Russia in favor of the Ukrainian people. There are only ""the interests of the Anglo-Saxons, their henchmen and the criminal, rotten Kiev elite, which is tied to the West by mutual responsibility and which is afraid of being swept away the day after the end of the war.""
Russia Never Gave Up on Peaceful Resolution
Moscow has never given up on a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict, he reminded.
""We never gave up on the peaceful resolution, we are always ready to negotiate â negotiate not about how to keep the leadership of the Kiev regime in place but about overcoming the inheritance of a decade-long destructive looting of the country and violence against the people, removing the reasons for the tragic Ukrainian situation,"" Lavrov said.
The minister added that the plans of both Kiev and its ""masters"" have nothing to do with peace.
So-Called Zelensky Peace Formula a Path to Nowhere
The so-called ""Zelensky peace formula"" and other similar formulas are a path to nowhere, and the sooner the US and EU realize this, the better, Lavrov said.
""It's sad that the UN Secretariat is risking its reputation by participating in the absolutely surreal so-called Copenhagen format. All these formulas are a road to nowhere, and the sooner Washington, London, Paris, Brussels would realize this, the sooner the better for both Ukraine and West,"" Lavrov said.
The ""peace formula"", developed and promoted by Kiev, requires the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the provision of Euro-Atlantic security guarantees and the creation of a special tribunal to investigate ""war crimes"" attributed to Russia. Zelensky's ""peace formula"" is considered in Moscow to be completely divorced from reality. Moscow has repeatedly indicated that it is ready for negotiations, but Kiev has introduced a ban on them at the legislative level.
The West calls on Russia for negotiations, for which Moscow shows readiness, but at the same time the West ignores Kiev's constant refusals to engage in dialogue. Earlier, the Kremlin stated that there are currently no prerequisites for the situation in Ukraine to transition to a peaceful direction; the absolute priority for Russia is to achieve the goals of the special operation; at the moment this is only possible through military means.
As the Kremlin stated, the situation in Ukraine can move on to a peaceful course, provided that the de facto situation and new realities are taken into account; all Moscow's demands are well known, Lavrov concluded.
US Turns Blind Eye to the Death of American Journalist in Ukrainian Prison
Western officials including those in the United States lack the courage to comment on the death of US citizen Gonzalo Lira.
""Has anyone in the West, especially the United States or any officials, said anything about this death? No."" Lavrov said. ""And the Western delegations today and the representative of the Kiev regime will probably not find the courage to comment on this and other outrageous crimes by Zelensky and his colleagues.""
The State Department in January confirmed to Sputnik that Lira had died in a Ukrainian prison following a lengthy detention in Ukraine.
A dual citizen of the United States and Chile, blogger Gonzalo Lira was arrested by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) on May 5 on charges of justifying Russia's military operation in Ukraine and allegedly disseminating pro-Russian propaganda. He was released in July and later arrested again after he attempted to leave Ukraine by crossing the border with Hungary on a motorcycle.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was addressing the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board when he said that ""several outstanding issues"" still needed to be resolved by governments and that time was ""very short"" to find consensus.
""A failure to deliver the pandemic agreement and the International Health Regulations amendments will be a missed opportunity for which future generations may not forgive us,"" Tedros said.
Legally binding
The WHO chief's warning follows agreement by Member States of the UN agency to start a process to draft and negotiate a ""convention, agreement or other international instrument"" to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response after the huge loss of life caused by COVID-19.
Such agreements made between countries have legal standing and are binding.
WHO has emphasized that a proposed pandemic convention would be driven by the need to ensure equity of access to tools that can stop pandemics in their tracks, including vaccines, personal protective equipment, information and expertise and access to healthcare for everyone.
UN migration agency issues first ever global annual appeal for $7.9 billion
UN migration agency, IOM, issued a nearly $8 billion funding call on Monday to help almost 140 million people, including those internally displaced and the communities that host them.
Leading the appeal, IOM Director General Amy Pope said it was urgent to help communities resist climate change, which last year was an even bigger driver of migration than conflict.
""Hundreds of millions of people live in communities that are extremely vulnerable to climate shocks,"" she said.
Crisis ahead
""If we do not begin to build this capacity now, we collectively will face a displacement crisis that dwarfs anything we deal with.""
Speaking in Geneva, Ms. Pope stressed that irregular and forced migration had reached ""unprecedented levels"", with more than 71 million people already displaced within their own countries today.
But, the IOM chief also insisted there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that well-managed migration was ""a major contributor to global prosperity and progress"".
In line with the UN agency's long-term objectives, it said that Monday's appeal would help to save lives and protect people on the move, find solutions to displacement and facilitate safe pathways for regular migration.
Rights defenders demand protection for lawyers in Iran
Independent UN human rights experts hailed lawyers in Iran over their ""courageous commitment to the rule of law"" and efforts to practice their profession despite ""enormous obstacles and pressures"".
In a statement issued on Monday ahead of the International Day of the Endangered Lawyer, marked on 24 January, the Special Rapporteurs on Iran and the issue of judicial independence called on Tehran to fully protect the country's legal professionals.
Following the ""Women, Life, Freedom"" protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022, Iranian authorities arrested thousands, subjecting them to deplorable conditions and even death penalty charges, said the two independent experts.
Despite the risks, many Iranian lawyers attempted to provide legal support to the protesters and consequently faced intimidation, arbitrary arrests and being disbarred.
Rising to the challenge
""Lawyers in Iran have, again and again, risen to the challenge and have suffered the consequences,"" the experts declared.
They underscored that Iranian lawyers often operate in peril due to restrictions that violate international standards for the free and independent exercise of the legal profession and the right to a fair trial. The Bar Association, one of Iran's oldest professional organizations, has been targeted by the Government through structural changes and investigations, according to the rapporteurs.
They urged Iran to implement measures ensuring that lawyers can fulfil their vital role without the threat of prosecution for legitimate professional activities, emphasizing the impact on the right to a fair trial for all Iranians.
Special Rapporteurs are part of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. They do not receive a salary for their work and serve in their individual capacity."

China's human rights record was the focus of intense scrutiny Tuesday by the U.N. Human Rights Council, where Beijing faced criticism from Western democratic societies over its treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans and dissidents in Hong Kong.
Tuesday's meeting marked the fourth time that China's rights record has been examined by the council's Universal Periodic Review procedure and the first time since former High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet issued a blistering report on China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in China's western Xinjiang region.
The report, which Bachelet released just minutes before she left her post as high commissioner on September 1, 2022, accuses China of having committed ""serious human rights violations"" against the Uyghurs that might amount to crimes against humanity, allegations that China rejected then and rejects now.
""We strive to deliver a better life for all people. China sees peoples' aspirations for a better life as the focus of our efforts,"" said Chen Xu, China's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and head of its 60-member delegation.
""No one is left out or left behind as China builds a modern socialist country in all respects. The people of all ethnic groups are equal and closely united like the seeds of the pomegranate working together for common prosperity and development and for a better life for all,"" he said.
U.N. experts and human rights organizations accuse China of incarcerating more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in so-called vocational centers and of subjecting them to systematic, widespread abuse.
Charges such as those were categorically denied by a member of China's delegation at the council hearing Tuesday: ""We respect and protect their human rights. We maintain Xinjiang's social stability. We guarantee their right to life.""
The official said, ""In Xinjiang, we combat terrorism according to the law. For seven years there have been no cases of violence and terror. The society enjoys stability and a good life.""
China's delegation also dismissed international criticism of the government's harsh crackdown on pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong since its takeover of the territory.
""Since the establishment of Hong Kong's special administrative region in 1997, the principle of one country, two systems has been the cornerstone of our prosperity and stability,"" said Chan Kwak-ki Eric, chief secretary for administration, Hong Kong.
He accused pro-democracy forces of violent, chaotic behavior. ""With the implementation of the national security law, the days of social disturbance and fear are over. Stability as well as law and order has been restored and our city is back on track,"" he said.
Since more than 160 countries signed up to speak at the UPR, each representative was limited to 45 seconds. This created a somewhat unsettling form of human rights ""speed-dating"" in which delegates rushed through their questions, concerns and recommendations.
Many countries, among them several Muslim countries, went along with China's glowing account of its achievements and efforts to better promote and protect human rights at home. When it came time for them to speak, those friendly countries gave China an easy ride.
They congratulated China on its accomplishments and offered recommendations on issues such as ways to pursue development prospects, preserve the cultural identities of minorities and promote cultural diversity.
Western democracies, on the other hand, were forthright with their concerns, criticisms and demands that China change its ways.
Simon Manley, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, demanded that China ""cease persecution and arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Tibetans and allow genuine freedom of religion or cultural expression without fear of surveillance, torture, forced labor or sexual violence.""
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Michele Taylor, raced through her intervention to get everything she had to say within the 45 seconds allotted to her. She called for the release of all arbitrarily detained individuals and called on China to ""cease harassment, surveillance and threats against individuals abroad and in China, including Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.""
She demanded an end to torture, persecution throughout China, forced labor and marriage. She condemned ""the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, human rights abuses in Tibet, Inner Mongolia and across China.""
While delegates were verbally sparring with China and one another inside the council chamber, several human rights groups, including the Tibet Advocacy Coalition, the World Uyghur Congress and human rights defenders in Hong Kong were demonstrating against China outside the U.N. building.
Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uyghur Congress who was present at the UPR, reprimanded Muslim countries who applauded China's development efforts ""without a mention of religious and cultural persecution of Uyghurs.""
""The UPR was an opportunity for us to identify those with moral dignity and those who decide to look the other way in the face of genocide,"" he said. ""We know who those are."""

The Lukashenka regime continues its deplorable tactics of intimidation and repression against its critics and potential political opponents ahead of the ""elections"" in February.

Tehran, IRNA -- The Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has launched a new round of attacks on targets controlled by Israel as the group keeps up pressure on the regime to end its genocidal war on Gaza.
Hezbollah issued a statement on Sunday, saying its fighters had used appropriate precision weapons to hit the Branit military position in the north of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
The Al Jazeera news channel said the Israeli regime had responded by targeting a vehicle near an army checkpoint in the village of Kafra in southern Lebanon.
A report by Reuters news agency said that the Israeli attack on Kafra had killed two people and injured several others.
Hezbollah says it will continue attacks on Israel's military positions until the regime stops its aggression on Gaza that has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians since it started in early October.

The Palestinian Health Ministry says nearly 200 people were killed and more than 350 others wounded in the incessant Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip in the 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday afternoon as the occupying entity presses ahead with its genocidal war.
The Health Ministry made the announcement in a statement on Telegram and said the casualties took place after Israeli airstrikes targeting various parts of the Gaza Strip, particularly Khan Yunis in the south.
""At least 195 people were killed and another 354 were wounded in the past 24 hours,"" the Health Ministry said in a statement on Telegram, adding that some dead bodies remained under the rubble and medical workers were unable to retrieve them.
The ministry stressed that most of the Palestinians killed or injured during the latest Israeli aggression were women and children.
Khan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Strip, has been the focus of the regime's latest strikes.
Israel orders massive evacuation in Khan Younis: UN
The casualties come as the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the Israeli regime had ordered almost 90,000 residents and 425,000 displaced people to leave a 4sq-kilometer residential area in Khan Younis.
The UNOCHA said the massive clearance order in Khan Younis would affect 24 UN shelters for people displaced by Israel's war, three hospitals, which represent 20 percent of all partially, still-functioning medical centres in Gaza, and three other health clinics.
Israeli troops earlier raided the al-Kheir Hospital in the west of Khan Younis, arrested staff and ordered civilians at the hospital to move further south.
Heavy Israeli bombardments were also are reported in close proximity to three hospitals in Khan Younis - Nasser, al-Amal, and al-Aqsa hospitals - as fighting between the Israeli occupation forces and Palestinian resistance rages across much of the besieged territory.
The Israeli regime launched its devastating war in the Gaza Strip on October 7 after the territory's Hamas-led Palestinian resistance groups carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The relentless Israeli military campaign against Gaza has killed more than 25,500 people, most of them children and women. Over 62,000 individuals have also been wounded."

BRATISLAVA (Sputnik) - Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that he would hold a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal, in the western Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod on January 24, during which he would inform Shmyhal that Slovakia would block Ukraine's membership in NATO.
""As for their entry into the European Union, we respect that, but they must meet the conditions ... I will say that I am against Ukraine's membership in NATO, that I will use the right of veto and block it, because it will be the foundation of World War 3,"" Fico told the RTVS broadcaster.
He also reiterated the government's position not to provide weapons to Ukraine. At the same time, he noted that Bratislava does not refuse to provide humanitarian aid to Kiev.
Fico added that Ukraine is under ""the total control and influence of the United States"" since the events of 2014, and the European Union is making a big mistake by adhering to the American opinion on the Ukraine conflict instead of forming its own.

Ukraine and Russia have contradicted each other over whether there had been proper notification to secure the airspace around an area where a military transport plane Moscow says was carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs crashed, killing them and nine others on board.
Russian lawmaker Andrei Kartapolov told deputies in Moscow on January 25 that Ukrainian military intelligence had been given a 15-minute warning before the Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane entered the Belgorod region in Russia, near the border with Ukraine, and that Russia had received confirmation the message was received.
Kartapolov did not provide any evidence to back up his claim and Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov reiterated in comments to RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that it had not received either a written or verbal request to secure the airspace where the plane went down.
Yusov said Ukraine had been using reconnaissance drones in the area and that Russia had launched attack drones. There was ""no confirmed information"" that Ukraine had hit any targets, he said.
""Unfortunately, we can assume various scenarios, including provocation, as well as the use of Ukrainian prisoners as a human shield for transporting ammunition and weapons for S-300 systems,"" he told RFE/RL.
There has been no direct confirmation from Kyiv on Russian claims that the plane had Ukrainian POWs on board or that the aircraft was downed by a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for an international investigation of the incident, and Yusov reiterated that call, as ""there are many circumstances that require investigation and maximum study.""
The RIA Novosti news agency on January 25 reported that both black boxes had been recovered from the wreckage site in Russia's Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine.
The Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case into what it said was a ""terrorist attack."" The press service of the Investigative Committee said in a news release that preliminary data of the inspection of the scene of the incident, ""allow us to conclude that the aircraft was attacked by an antiaircraft missile from the territory of Ukraine.""
The Investigative Committee said that ""fragmented human remains"" were found at the crash site, repeating that six crew members, military police officers, and Ukrainian POWs were on board the plane.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on January 25 called the downing of the Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane a ""monstrous act,"" though Moscow has yet to show any evidence that it was downed by a Ukrainian missile, or that there were Ukrainian prisoners on board.
While not saying who shot down the plane, Zelenskiy said that ""all clear facts must be established...our state will insist on an international investigation.""
Ukrainian officials have said that a prisoner exchange was to have taken place on January 24 and that Russia had not informed Ukraine that Ukrainian POWs would be flown on cargo planes.
Ukrainian military intelligence said it did not have ""reliable and comprehensive information"" on who was on board the flight but said the Russian POWs it was responsible for ""were delivered in time to the conditional exchange point where they were safe.""
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's commissioner for human rights, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that ""currently, there are no signs of the fact that there were so many people on the Il-76 plane, be they citizens of Ukraine or not.""
Aviation experts told RFE/RL that it was possible a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile downed the plane but added that a Russian antiaircraft could have been responsible.
""During the investigation, you can easily determine which system shot down the plane based on the missiles' damaging elements,"" said Roman Svitan, a Ukrainian reserve colonel and an aviation-instructor pilot.
When asked about Russian claims of dozens of POWs on board, Svitan said that from the footage released so far, he'd seen no evidence to back up the statements.
""From the footage that was there, I looked through it all, it's not clear where there are dozens of bodies.... There's not a single body visible at all. At one time I was a military investigator, including investigating disasters; believe me, if there were seven or eight dozen people there, the field would be strewn with corpses and remains of bodies,"" Svitan added.
Russian officials said the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six crew members, and three escorts.
A list of the six crew members who were supposed to be on the flight was obtained by RFE/RL. The deaths of three of the crew members were confirmed to RFE/RL by their relatives.
Video on social media showed a plane spiraling to the ground, followed by a loud bang and explosion that sent a ball of smoke and flames skyward.

Tehran, IRNA -- The Islamic Jihad movement says the operation in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in southern Gaza, which caused the highest single-day casualty for Israeli soldiers, proves that the Zionist regime has failed to achieve any of its objectives in the war.
Ihsan Ataya, a senior member of the political bureau of Islamic Jihad, told Palestinian media that the Israeli regime is ""in shock"" after two dozens of its soldiers were killed in battle against Palestinian resistance fighters.
The casualty was by far the biggest single-day death toll among Israeli soldiers since the occupying regime launched the genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on October 7.
The battle came amid fierce fighting around the key southern city of Khan Younis, which has been under relentless Israeli attacks over the past several days.
""From the first day of the Israeli regime's army attack on the Gaza Strip, there has been complete coordination among the Palestinian resistance forces to confront the Zionist occupiers,"" Ataya said.
""We know that unity on the battlefield is a fundamental pillar for victory against this regime,"" he added.

On the morning of January 24, the Kiev regime committed another terrorist act by downing a Russian Il-76 military transport plane near the village of Yablonovo in the Korochansky District, Belgorod Region. It was carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs for an agreed-upon exchange. All of them, as well as six crew members and three Russian officers on board the plane were killed.
The plane was hit by a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system from the village of Liptsy in the Kharkov Region.
This is yet another atrocity committed by Zelensky's criminal regime. Immediately after the plane went down, they made a misanthropic statement about the victory of the ""valiant Armed Forces of Ukraine."" However, the office on Bankovaya Street changed its rhetoric as soon as it became known that the plane was carrying Ukrainian servicemen to an exchange site. They then began denying their involvement in the crash.
Kiev was well aware of the planned exchange. It also knew how the POWs were to be moved and by what route. The attack against the plane was a deliberate act. This terrorist act clearly demonstrates the Kiev regime's inability to negotiate.
This is not the first cruel murder of Ukrainian POWs by the Zelensky junta. On July 29, 2022, the Banderites fired a missile at the penal colony in Yelenovka (DPR) where militants from the Azov battalion had been held captive. Over 50 people were killed and more than 70 wounded.
We resolutely condemn the Kiev regime's terrorist act in the Belgorod Region. All those involved, including the organisers and executors from the Ukrainian military and civilian officials will be identified and held responsibly under Russian law.
This action shows once again the criminal nature of the neo-Nazi dictatorship in Kiev. Its leaders are indifferent to human life. They treat people as ""expendable material"" and kill them on orders from their Western bosses with Western-supplied arms.
It is perfectly obvious that the Zelensky criminal regime, nurtured by the US and its NATO satellites, poses a substantial threat not only to Russia but also to Ukraine, its ordinary citizens and the rest of the world. Being in agony, this regime can commit the most heinous atrocities.
We believe international organisations, national governments and the world public must denounce this terrorist act and other crimes committed by the Kiev regime. Silence can only mean support for the regime's barbarous nature and terrorist actions."

The Lebanese resistance movement of Hezbollah announces launching a drone attack against the Israeli regime's Iron Dome missile system in the northern part of the occupied territories.
In a statement carried by Lebanon's al-Manar television network on Thursday, the movement said it had launched ""two kamikaze drones"" against an Israeli missile system and Iron Dome platforms near the regime's Kfar Blum settlement.
The drone strike, the movement said, came ""in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.""
The regime has been waging a genocidal war against Gaza since October 7, 2023 following an operation carried out by the Palestinian territory's resistance groups.
Around 25,900 Palestinians, some 70 percent of whom are women, children, and adolescents, have been killed in the brutal onslaught so far, while 64,110 others have been injured.
Following the onset of the war, the Israeli regime began conducting sporadic attacks against Lebanon, which sparked a firefight with Hezbollah.
The firefight has grown remarkably in intensity following a spate of assassinations carried out by the regime, including against Saleh al-Arouri, a senior official of the Palestinian resistance movement of Hamas, who was martyred in a targeted killing operation on January 2.
The confrontation has seen the Israeli regime targeting areas lying in southern Lebanon, using United States-made white phosphorous shells, among other types of ammunition.
Also on Thursday, Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) reported an Israeli aerial attack against a home in the village of Tayr Harfa.
White phosphorous shells were also dropped on the outskirts of the village of Alma al-Shaab and the town of Dhaira, the NNA said.
Dozens of Hezbollah members and Lebanese civilians have been killed in the Israeli attacks."

By Lee Jeong-Ho for RFA 2024.01.21 -- North Korea has reiterated its dedication to enhancing its military prowess as South Korea has suggested that Pyongyang's claim about testing underwater nuclear weapons might be ""exaggerated"" and ""fabricated.""
""There is a widespread dominance of coercion and unilateral actions driven by the logic of power, which severely encroaches upon the sovereignty and survival rights of nations advocating for self-determination and independence,"" said Kim Son Gyong, North Korea's deputy minister of foreign affairs, as cited by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency on Monday.
Speaking at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Uganda last week, the deputy minister justified Pyongyang's continued pursuit of military advancement, including its nuclear program.
""The situation where the sovereignty, autonomy, survival, and development rights of sovereign nations are under severe threat is particularly evident on the Korean Peninsula,"" said Kim.
""As provocations from our adversaries increase, there is a continuous need to build an overwhelmingly strong military preparedness, capable of deterring any form of provocation or action, and being fully and thoroughly prepared.""
Such remarks came as North Korea said Friday it had carried out a test of an underwater nuclear weapons system, claiming it was facing severe security threats from the allies.
The North's Underwater Weapon System Institute tested the ""Haeil-5-23,"" its underwater nuclear system involving drones, its Ministry of National Defence claimed. Submarine-launched weapons can be deployed covertly, often evading the allies' detection systems, potentially offering Pyongyang a more elusive means of deploying its nuclear weapons.
South Korea on Sunday, however, raised the possibility that the claim might have been exaggerated and fabricated.
""There is a possibility that North Korea's claims may have been exaggerated and fabricated, based on our comprehensive analysis up until today,"" South Korea's Presidential Office said in a statement.
""If indeed a test had taken place, it is presumed to have involved some form of torpedo, and the likelihood of it being a nuclear-powered system is highly improbable.
""There are no instances of developing a small nuclear reactor suitable for a torpedo with a diameter of less than 1 meter.""
Amid the tensions, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un pledged last week to amend the country's constitution to declare Seoul as Pyongyang's ""primary and immutable enemy.""

Tehran - IRNA -- A Yemeni military spokesman announced on Thursday morning that the country's armed forces have once again confronted Americans in waters off the Yemeni coast, targeting warships with missiles and directly hitting one of them.
Yahya Saree is quoted by the Al-Masirah news network that the Yemeni forces engaged with a number of US destroyers and warships in the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Bab al-Mandab.
The forces reported striking the American warships and destroyers with the projectiles as they were providing protection for two American commercial vessels sailing through the strategic waterway.
""Despite attempts by the warships to intercept them, our ballistic missiles reached their targets successfully,"" Saree said.
""A number of ballistic missiles directly hit the warship while two American commercial vessels escaped from the scene"", he said., adding that the conflict lasted for 2 hours.
US central command or CENTCOM or a recently formed US-led coalition to protect Israeli interests in the Red Sea have not commented on the Yemeni attack on a warship.
Meanwhile, Saree reiterated his earlier statement that the Yemeni armed forces will keep preventing the movement of Israeli ships in the Red Sea until the end of the regime's invasion of Gaza and the lifting of the blockade on the Palestinian territory.
For over the past month, Yemenis have been staging strikes against Israeli vessels or those bound for ports in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The United States and Britain have launched several rounds of aerial strikes on Yemen over the past two weeks in response to the Arab country's anti-Israeli operations in the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Bab al-Mandab Strait.

22 January 2024  From Carrier Strike Group 12 Public Affairs
NORFOLK, Va. â The Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG 60) - part of the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRFCSG) - returned to homeport in Norfolk after an 8-month deployment to the U.S. Naval Forces Europe area of operations, Jan. 20, 2024.
Normandy steamed more 61,000 nautical miles while serving as the air defense commander for the strike group.
""From the North Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean, this deployment has enhanced and reinforced regional stability, as we worked with our allies and partners to uphold our mutual commitment to maritime security,"" said Capt. Errol A. Robinson, Normandy's commanding officer. ""Our Sailors expertly executed complex multi-ship maneuvers with our allies and tactically controlled aircraft and the airspace, while maintaining the material readiness of the ship.  During my two tours aboard Normandy, as division officer and 23 years later as her commanding officer, I can say that my Sailors' tireless and exacting performance was in keeping with Normandy's 34 years of superb service.""
Over the course of 262 days, Normandy's crew conducted over 40 replenishments-at-sea, and manned flight quarters 670 times. Normandy's embarked air detachment, the ""Spartans"" of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 70, flew 393 sorties, totaling 1,132 hours flown.
Normandy's culinary team prepared and served over 388,500 meals, which included over 68,619 lbs. of fresh fruits and vegetables, 4,382 lbs. of steak, 10,520 hot dogs, 3,207 lbs. of bacon, 89,000 individual eggs and 800 lbs. of coffee.
After departing Naval Station Norfolk on May 2, 2023, the strike group spent a month steaming in the High North before transiting the Strait of Gibraltar on June 15, entering the Mediterranean Sea where the strike group would spend the rest of deployment working with allies and partners to provide maritime stability and security in the region.
Normandy participated in two named multinational naval exercises while in the Mediterranean: NATO vigilance activity Neptune Strike in July and Sage Wolverine in August. During Neptune Strike, command and control of all participating vessels was transferred to Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO) to synchronize the U.S. and the NATO Alliance's planning teams and to improve the Alliance's ability to provide assurance, deterrence, and collective defense. Sage Wolverine consisted of 10 days of high-end maritime training events and air defense exercises with NATO allies. In concert with U.S. allies over the eight months Normandy was underway, the ship completed 24 air defense exercises, 12 low slow flier exercises, and 7 simulated air defense exercises.
Throughout deployment, Normandy's crew embraced numerous opportunities to strengthen partnerships with allied navies, hosting crew exchanges with the U.K. royal navy Duke-class frigate HMS Kent (F 78), the Italian navy Carlo Bergamini-class frigate ITS Carabiniere (F 593), the Turkish navy Gabya-class frigate TCG GÃ¶kÃ§eada (F 494), and the first-in-class Hellenic navy frigate HS Elli (F 450). In addition to these crew exchanges, the 2023 deployment saw Normandy steam with frigates of the Croatian, Dutch, French, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish navies, demonstrating a shared commitment to promoting safety and stability in Europe.
Port visits in the U.S. Sixth Fleet area of operations made Normandy's Sailors de facto ambassadors, as the ship moored in: Gothenburg, Sweden; Koper, Slovenia; Rijeka, Croatia; Aksaz, TÃ¼rkiye; Bar, Montenegro; and Athens, Greece. Office calls to local navy leadership, and community relations events in nearly every country Normandy visited, bolstered valuable partnerships. In Bar, Montenegro, Normandy hosted Nicole Otallah, the charges d'affaires of the U.S. embassy in Montenegro, at a reception for Montenegrin civil and military leaders held on the ship's flight deck.
Following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, Normandy and the strike group were ordered to the Eastern Mediterranean by the secretary of defense to provide a constant and stabilizing presence that would prevent regional escalation of the conflict.
""For almost 70% of Normandy's crew, this was their first deployment,"" said Command Master Chief William Palmer. ""That did not deter them from seizing opportunities to excel and gain further expertise in their fields. Normandy's Sailors are returning home more accomplished and more resilient, and their families should be proud of the work they have done.""
The GRFCSG is comprised of its flagship and namesake, the Ford-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8), Destroyer Squadron Two (DESRON-2), the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG-60), and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Ramage (DDG 61), USS McFaul (DDG 74), and USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116).
The squadrons of CVW-8 embarked aboard Gerald R.

Senior Defense Official; Senior Military Official; Senior State Department Official
MODERATOR:  Today's briefing is on background, which means that you may refer to and attribute comments from our briefers as a Senior Defense Official, Senior State Official, and Senior Military Official, respectively.  This briefing will run for approximately 30 minutes.  We'll start with opening statements and then turn to questions.  We do ask that you keep to one question out of professional respect for others' desires to ask questions.  And again, this is an on-background briefing.
And with that, we'll start with our Senior Defense Official.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  Good morning or good afternoon, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.
During the August 2023 U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue, the JSCD, between the Department of Defense and the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, the United States committed to launch the Higher Military Commission, the HMC, with our Iraqi partners on a mutually determined date.  Today is the date that the Secretary of Defense and his Iraqi counterpart have announced the launch of the HMC.
Before I get into the details on the HMC, I want to reflect on how we've arrived at this point in the campaign to defeat ISIS.  Nearly 10 years ago, the United States began working with allies and partners to confront the urgent threat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
At its height, ISIS controlled more than 100,000 square kilometers of territory containing more than 11 million people.  ISIS attracted tens of thousands of foreign fighters from multiple nations to Iraq and Syria.  It used its territory as a safe haven to plot and stage attacks across the region and the globe.
ISIS committed numerous atrocities and abuses, including those involving persecution of individuals and entire communities on the basis of their identity, kidnapping of civilians, forced displacement, killing and maiming of children, rape, and other forms of sexual violence.
Faced with this threat to our mutual security and shared values, together, the United States, with its allies and partners, formed Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, CJTF-OIR, and over the past decade, CJTF-OIR has removed ISIS from the territory it once controlled.
The partnership between CJTF and OIR and the government of Iraq has been a decisive factor in the defeat of ISIS, and the Iraqi Security Forces, the ISF, have been in the lead during the last several years of the campaign to defeat ISIS with CJTF-OIR in support to advise, assist, and enable our partner forces.  The ISF have made tremendous progress through cooperation with CJTF-OIR.
10 years after the Iraqi government invited the United States and the rest of the coalition to fight ISIS and seven years after our collective territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq, we see a need to transition to a normal bilateral security cooperation relationship.
And so that's the background for the announcement today of the launch of the HMC.  As I said, the HMC is not new.  It's a due out of the inaugural JSCD, which built upon previous strategic bilateral discussions on our mutual commitment to security cooperation and shared interests in regional stability.
These discussions include the July 2021 U.S.-Iraq Strategic Dialogue, the July 2021 U.S.-Iraq Military Technical Talks, the February 2023 U.S.-Iraq Higher Coordinating Committee, and as I mentioned, the August 2023 U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue.
The HMC process aims to determine how the coalition's military mission will evolve on a timeline according to the following factors â the threat from ISIS, operational and environmental requirements, and capability levels of the Iraqi Security Forces.
The HMC will consist of expert working groups focused on the three mutually determined factors I mentioned and will be led by military and defense professionals who will guide the discussion about the natural and necessary evolution of the D-ISIS Coalition mission while ensuring that ISIS can never resurge.  The HMC will be led by U.S. and Iraqi delegations, in close consultation with coalition partners every step of the way.
Let me be clear â the HMC meeting is not a negotiation about the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.  The United States and the coalition are in Iraq at the invitation the Iraqi government to fight ISIS.  Our Iraqi partners have assured us of their commitment toward working together to shape this future U.S. military presence and ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.
Both nations remain committed to security cooperation and our shared interest in regional stability.  The United States and Iraq will continue to work together to shape future U.S. military presence and ensure an Iraqi-led enduring defeat of ISIS.
So I'll â with that, I'll stop there and turn it over to my colleagues.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We'll now hear from our Senior State Official.
SENIOR STATE OFFICIAL:  Thank you.  The HMC is another facet in the development of the broader U.S. and Iraq relationship.  As my colleague in OSD mentioned, it's an outcome of the inaugural JSCD last August, which came after a host of other discussions, including the various dialogues that he mentioned.
All of those dialogues, they build upon previous bilateral discussions and fall within the spirit of our 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq.  These discussions focused not only on our security elements, but on issues that extend well beyond the security partnership with Iraq.  They have helped us advance our full 360-degree partnership with Iraq across a range of issues, including energy, finance, climate, water and trade, among many others.  So the HMC builds on this effort with the shared goal of transitioning to an enduring bilateral security partnership between Iraq and the United States.  Over.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And then lastly, we'll hear from our senior military official.
Sir?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  Hello, team.  This is your senior military official from Baghdad, Iraq.  And just to amplify a little bit about what we're about and our purpose, I command the 24 nations and their contributions to this Coalition Joint Task Force and the mission of Operation Inherent Resolve.  There are, as a reminder, over 80 nations involved in the global coalition to defeat ISIS, and we are in constant communication with their supporting efforts, as well.
A reminder that we are here at the invitation of the government of Iraq and remain steadfast partners in that effort.
We really focus on just two things as part of my mission: it's the enduring defeat of Daesh, or ISIS, and it's the advise-assistant-enable missions that we have with our partner forces, primarily the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Security Forces, and some of those Special Operations units that they both have.
Now, we look at the enduring defeat of Daesh and the three components as a reminder: the Daesh at large in Iraq and Syria, the Daesh in detention, of which there's less than 10,000 in detention facilities in Syria, and then there's the displaced persons at camps such as al-Roj and al-Hol that have about 2,000 and about 44,000 displaced persons at this time.
The at-large Daesh is where we partner with our forces to either capture or kill the Daesh before they can cause or create other operations against our forces or against the civilian population.
In detention and with displaced persons, our mission function is in the repatriation process of them back to their host countries for either justice and rule of law for detainees or reintegration/rehabilitation for those who are displaced persons, and that's important.  If there were to be a prison breakout, Daesh could become operational overnight with 2,000 prisoners being â could escape and become part of an operational force, and that is Daesh's operational goal right now.
In the displaced persons camps, that's a recruitment potential with the children and the brides of ISIS fighters who are in detention or who were killed.  And so our goal is to get them back home to reintegrate and rehabilitate to society and give those children a chance.
At A2E, we partner with the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Security Forces with non-lethal support.  A reminder that my mission is not a combat mission.  We have force protection capabilities and have had to use those, as you are aware, since the attacks began upon our formations October 18th to this day by some of the, what I would term, outlaw militias here in Iraq.
The HMC is a process that we are beginning very soon, and as discussed, it was defined and outlined in the outline minutes of the JSCD in August, and there are functional working groups that we've created, along with our Iraqi partners, mil-to-mil to make sure we discuss along those factors the state of the Iraqi Security Forces, the state of Daesh and the state of the operational environment.  Again, not a timeline-driven event; factors-based, and so we will govern that process with our dialogue together.
And pending your questions, that's our opening statement from Baghdad.  Thank you.
MODERATOR:  Thank you very much, and with that, we'll start with Associated Press, Tara Copp.
Q:  Hi.  Thank you, everyone, for doing this.  I wanted to ask about a timetable, because the Iraqi Foreign Ministry put out a statement shortly after the secretary did saying that this â these discussions will formulate, quote, ""a specific and clear timetable about the reduction of advisers in Iraq.""  So if we could just talk about, what does that mean for the U.S. troops?  Would there be a reduction from the 2,500?  And â or is there some sort of disconnect between what the U.S. is seeing will happen here and what Iraq will see?  And then secondly, what about, for the coalition â for coalition members, is this U.S. only, or will this also mean an eventual reduction of all coalition members?  Thank you.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is the senior defense official.  We're just not able at this time to provide any kind of specific timelines for HMC process itself, or for a date of the eventual transition of CJTF-OIR.  All of that is pending discussions between the HMC expert working groups during the initial stage of the process.  Any discussion of mission transition in Iraq will be factors-based, as my colleague has stated.
We're committed, along with our Iraqi partners and our coalition partners, to carefully revisit the question of timing and to ensuring that the HMC is comprehensive, efficient and a professional process.  But at this time, that's the most we can say about it.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Next, we'll go to Jared Zuba with Al Monitor.
Q:  Hi, all.  Thank you for doing this.  You mentioned that the U.S. troop presence in Iraq is at the invitation of the Iraqi government.  Going forward, if the Iraqi government requests that the U.S.-led coalition depart the country, you know, on a certain timeline, assuming that the U.S. will comply, how do you intend to support continued presence and operations of Operation Inherent Resolve in Syria?  And do you see a sustained CJTF-OIR presence in Syria after a potential withdrawal from Iraq, or at least, from parts of Iraq?  Thank you.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  I'll start.  This is senior defense official, and perhaps, our senior military official will chime in.
There are a lot of hypotheticals built into your question which we just really aren't going to be able to address.  As I said, the discussion about any eventual transition of OIR will be undertaken within the HMC process, but there's no way for us to forecast exactly where that leads or on what timetable that leads, and therefore, how it affects other aspects of Operation Inherent Resolve are kind of derivative hypotheticals of the first, so I don't think I'm going to address it any further.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  And this is the senior military official in Baghdad.  What I can amplify to it is as agreed to, the process is driven to an outcome for an eventual bilateral relationship for â you asked about the coalition contributions â those member nations in a bilateral relationship with the government of Iraq, and same with the United States government and the United States military, as we do with other countries in the region and around the globe.  That third-factor working group is kind of the catch-all, if you will, that would encompass potential transition formations and what the government of Iraq would like in that relationship going forward.
And that's a matter of policy, and that is not something we've been determined or has been directed, but it's part of the discussions we'll have as part of the HMC process.  Over?
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We'll go to Wall Street Journal's Michael Gordon.
Q:  Thank you.  You've mentioned that the goal is to transition eventually, at some point, to a bilateral relationship.  My question is, could this bilateral relationship, whenever it occurs, include the presence of US military advisers to assist the Iraqi security forces?
And also, administration officials have been saying in recent weeks that they didn't want to initiate the higher military commission process under the point of a gun while the U.S. forces were under attack by these Iranian-backed militias.  But that seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Why did you change your stance on the timing of beginning these talks?
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is the senior defense official.  To the first question, you know, Iraq remains a critical security partner to the United States.  We've been engaged in the D-ISIS fight side by side with Iraqi security forces since the D-ISIS coalition mission began 10 years ago.  We're going to continue this strong security partnership to advance our shared objectives and interests.
The HMC will help us determine what form that partnership will take.  Iraqi stability and sovereignty are essential for regional peace and security.  That's what we're there to support.
Regarding the timing of the HMC, it's not connected to recent events.  As it was mentioned a couple of times, this was agreed to â this was a commitment made in the August 2023 Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue.  The attacks, recent attacks from the Iran-aligned militia groups in the U.S. and coalition â against U.S. and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria that began in mid-October have really not influenced the decision of the United States and Iraq to convene this forum.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We'll go to Fadi Mansour with Al Jazeera.
Q:  Thank you for doing this.  As every single official here said, that the U.S. forces, coalition forces, are in Iraq, based on the invitation of the Iraqi government, the Iraqi government today, in a statement, clearly signaled that these discussions will address the phased withdrawal or reduction of U.S. forces in Iraq.  However, up front, you deny that these discussions will address the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
Can you explain to us the disconnect here?
And if the Iraqis insist on raising this issue, will you refrain from discussing the withdrawal of U.S. forces?  Thank you.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is the senior defense official.  Again, the HMC will enable the United States and Iraq to, together, discuss the future of the strong security partnership to advance our shared objectives and interests.  And I really don't think we can say more about what that outcome will be, because those discussions are just getting started.
Obviously, it does address an eventual transition for Operation Inherent Resolve, but further than that, I think, would simply be speculative.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We'll turn it over to Jeff Seldin with VOA.
Q:  Thanks very much for doing this.  Just wondering, what is the Pentagon's current assessment of the size, strength, capabilities of ISIS in Iraq right now?
And how connected do you see ISIS's operations in Iraq to those in Syria?  And how does that impact specifically these discussions?
Do you feel like ISIS is degraded to the point where the â the size of the U.S. presence is â doesn't matter as much, or does it still make a big difference to have the U.S. presence there, with what ISIS is able to do?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  This is the senior military official.  I'll go first with that.
One, having been on the ground with the fight for a while, through our partnered forces and through what they are assessing, you do have a Daesh presence, obviously, still in Syria and in Iraq â not to the level where they're operational, where they can tie their tactical engagements and battles together into an operation, nor can they hold or seize territory, and certainly, strategically, across the globe, not viable â maybe strategically plotting but not capable of controlling large areas or territory.
So if you're looking at numbers, what we're going to say is we assess that the numbers are very, very much around the 1,000 or so in Syria and in Iraq.  And that's if you count facilitators, fighters, financiers, the network that would support the Daesh fighters in those locations.
And in both areas, they're not in urban areas.  They're disrupted.  They're suppressed.  They are in complex terrain and mountain environments or in some of the less-governed spaces in the Badiya desert, Syria, or in some of the places in central Iraq around the Kirkuk Saladin province, for example, where the Iraqi security forces are constantly working their intelligence platforms to detect and track these small ISIS cells.
So, again, it's not about numbers; it's about a capability.  They're not â Daesh is not capable beyond small attacks, currently in Iraq and Syria, thanks to the great efforts of the Iraqi security forces, who are doing quite well at keeping a handle on the Daesh challenge.  Over?
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We have time for just a couple more questions.  We'll do Phil Stewart with Reuters.
Q:  I understand that the termination of the HMC has yet to be finalized, but is it the goal of the Biden administration to maintain a U.S. troop presence in Iraq, long-term?
And then my other question was, if the senior military official could bring us up to date about the number of U.S. wounded in the attacks by militia in Iraq and Syria, to date?  Thank you.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is the senior defense official.  Well, the United States, and really both nations, remain committed to security cooperation and our shared interests in regional stability.  Together we'll work to shape the future U.S. military presence and ensure an Iraqi-led enduring defeat of ISIS.  I think that's the most I will say on that.
Regarding the attacks and the casualties, I believe we've stated previously â I'm forgetting if it's two or three U.S. personnel wounded in the most recent attack at â
(UNKNOWN):  Al-Asad.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  â at Al-Asad Air Force Base, and one seriously injured Iraqi Security Force service members.
Q:  Do you have a total figure?
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  Total figure?  I don't have that.
Q:  In all the attacks?  Thank you.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL:  Yeah, this is the Senior Military Official.  So we've had one very serious injury in all of the attacks since October 18th and we've had 70 injured in various forms, lightly injured, mostly those, to be frank, are from concussive events from rocket, mortar, indirect fire, or one-way UAS attacks with anything from eight to 50 kilograms worth of explosives.
So we're very thankful the casualties have not been severe or more numerous, and the injuries are not necessarily wounds, it's just some of the concussive effects that happened during the blast that happened near their locations on bases.  Over.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We'll turn it over to Lara Seligman with Politico.
Q:  Thanks for doing this.  I wanted to ask you what has been the impact of these recent attacks and the environment in the Middle East on the discussions?  I know you said the timing of the discussions is not related but I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit and characterize what â how this change in the strategic environment is impacting the talks?
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is the Senior Defense Official.  You know, if anything, the militia attacks delayed our original plan.  The HMC was initially a â the commitment to do it was initially announced in August of 2023, the plan was to proceed later in 2023.
Obviously, events in recent weeks have, you know, caused everyone to have to tend to other business.  But we're now back to the long-planned and originally planned launch of this HMC, and if anything, we're here despite the militia attacks, not because of them.
So, you know, we're committed to â along with our Iraqi partners, to consistently revisit the question of timing, but we'll ensure as we do that the HMC is this comprehensive, efficient, and professional process.
Q:  And just to follow up, you've â you're kind of â everyone keeps talking around the â calling it a transition to normal â a normal bilateral security cooperation relationship and sort of talking around the fact that â what that means is a eventual drawdown of U.S. troops.  So can you just clarify that we're â we're understanding this correctly, like, the â the ultimate goal is eventually a drawdown?
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  Again, the Senior Defense Official.  You know, we are going to, together with our Iraqi partners, help determine the shape of the future U.S. military presence in Iraq, and at the same time, ensure an Iraqi-led enduring defeat of ISIS.  But beyond that, we won't speculate.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  We'll do one last question from Mike Glenn with Washington Times.
Q:  No, I'm good, (Pete ?).  You can go on to somebody else.  My question's been answered.
MODERATOR:  Okay.  Thank you.  Spencer Ackerman with Nation Magazine?
Q:  Thanks very much.  Can you talk about the impact, notwithstanding your answer just now, of the Iraqi Prime Minister saying that after the drone strike in Baghdad earlier this month, it was time to talk about something closer to a terminal phase of the U.S. military presence in Iraq?
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  This is Senior Defense Official.  I'll refer you to the government of Iraq to address comments made by Iraqi government officials.
The announcements today coordinated between our two governments about the launch of the HMC process describe â and I've repeated it a couple of times â what we intend â how we intend to conduct this process and what we're trying to achieve.  So that â I think that's the best way I can answer that question.
MODERATOR:  Okay, thank you all for joining us today, and of course, to our briefers.  Again, this briefing was on background and all comments should be attributed to a Senior Defense Official, Senior State Official, or a Senior Military Official.
Thank you very much.

The spokesman for the commander-in-chief of Iraq's Armed Forces has denounced the recent US strikes against sites and facilities of the Iraqi army and anti-terror groups as ""unacceptable"" and a ""blatant"" violation of the Arab country's sovereignty.
Yahya Rasoul made the statement on Wednesday after the US targeted with missiles a number of sites in western Iraq, including al-Qa'im town near the Syrian border, as well as Jurf al-Nasr town in the southwest of Baghdad.
The military sites and facilities belonged to Iraq's Armed Forces and anti-terror Iraqi resistance groups, including Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), known as Hashd al-Sha'abi, and Katai'b Hezbollah.
""In a clear determination to harm security and stability in Iraq, the United States has resumed carrying out airstrikes against the locations of Iraqi military units from the army and the Popular Mobilization Forces, in the areas of Jurf al-Nasr and al-Qa'im,"" Rasoul wrote.
""This unacceptable act ... blatantly violates Iraq's sovereignty, and contributes to an irresponsible escalation.""
The Iraqi official underlined that the US attacks were carried out at a time that the region is already grappling with the danger of expanding conflict, the repercussions of the Israeli war on Gaza, and the consequences of the immoral war of extermination faced by the Palestinian people.
""While the major powers, including the United States, remained silent regarding these crimes, we see the United States sliding into condemnable and unjustified aggressive actions against Iraqi territory and national sovereignty,"" Rasoul said.
""We call on the international community to fulfill its responsibility in supporting peace and security, preventing all violations threatening Iraq's stability and sovereignty,"" he added.
The spokesman for the commander-in-chief of Iraq's Armed Forces stressed that Baghdad will treat these operations as acts of aggression and take necessary actions to preserve the lives and dignity of Iraqis on their land.
During the latest US aggression, two people were reportedly killed and two wounded in the bombardments in al-Qa'im town.
In response, Iraqi resistance forces targeted a US-occupied military facility in neighboring Syria and Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq's western province of Anbar, vowing to continue their operations against the occupation military bases.
Anti-US sentiment has been growing in Iraq since the assassination in January 2020 of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Popular Mobilization Units, along with the region's legendary anti-terror commander General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.
They were targeted along with their companions on January 3, 2020 in a drone strike authorized by former US president Donald Trump near Baghdad International Airport.
Two days after the attack, Iraqi lawmakers approved a bill that requires the government to end the presence of all foreign military forces led by the US."

The spokesman for Iraq's Joint Operations Command (JOC), Brigadier General Yahya Rasool, says the Baghdad government is determined to end the presence of foreign troops from the US-led military coalition purportedly formed to fight the Takfiri Daesh terrorist group.
""The Iraqi government is resolute to put an end to the deployment of foreign forces in the country. It has devised a vision plan for the next stage, which includes joint technical activities intended for the US-led coalition's departure and subsequent security and military cooperation,"" Rasool said.
The high-ranking Iraqi security official underscored that with the presence of capable Iraqi forces, the US-led military coalition in Iraq is no longer needed.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani on Thursday repeated his call for the US-led coalition to depart his country, stressing that Baghdad demands the immediate withdrawal of the forces due to their destabilizing activities.
""The end of the US-led coalition mission is a necessity for the security and stability of Iraq,"" he said during a televised event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
""It is also a necessity for preserving constructive bilateral relations between Iraq and the coalition countries,"" the Iraqi prime minister noted.
Sudani has repeatedly said in recent weeks he would like to see foreign troops leave Iraq.
Iraq adopted the law to expel foreign forces after Washington's assassination of top Iraqi and Iranian anti-terror commanders four years ago.
General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), were martyred along with their comrades in a US drone strike that was authorized by then-president Donald Trump near Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020.
The two iconic anti-terror commanders are greatly admired for their instrumental role in fighting and decimating the Takfiri Daesh terrorist group in the region, particularly in Iraq and Syria."

According to the date from regional authorities, Ukrainian armed forces shelled Donetsk region 43 times in the last 24 hours, firing 161 projectiles.
At least 25 civilians have been killed and 20 more wounded as a result of a Ukrainian shelling of Donetsk on Sunday, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin said.
He has described the attack as ""atrocious"", stressing that the market was shelled on the day when it was especially crowded.
Rescue teams are working at the scene, information on casualties is being updated while specialists are looking for the shards of the projectiles.
Earlier, a Sputnik correspondent reported that Ukrainian armed forces fired at least six 155mm shells at the Kirovsky district of Donetsk, a busy area with markets and shops.

Tehran, IRNA -- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi says the main reason behind continued terrorist acts by the Israeli regime is its failure to reach objectives in the war in Gaza.
Addressing a Cabinet session on Sunday, Raisi offered his condolences on the martyrdom of five Islamic Revolution Guards Corps officers in an Israeli attack in Syria a day earlier.
The Iranian president said the attack was a sign the Israeli regime has become helpless as a result of its defeat in the Gaza war.
""The Zionists commit such crimes in the hope they could divert public attention in the region and in the world from their unsuccessful crimes in Gaza,"" he said.
The IRGC said on Saturday that five of its officers, who had been serving in Syria in an advisory capacity, had been killed in an Israeli attack on a residential building in Damascus earlier in the day.
Iran has said it will definitely respond to the crime at the right time and place.
The attack came as the Israeli regime has killed more 25,000 Palestinians since it launched an aggression on Gaza in early October.

A major Iraqi anti-terror group says it will continue its ""painful"" attacks on American forces as long as the occupation troops remain in the Arab country and the region.
Kata'ib Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades) made the announcement in a statement on Wednesday after the US military launched airstrikes on facilities used by the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), which is an umbrella group for resistance movements in Iraq.
It said the United States had committed another crime by bombing the PMU headquarters in Jurf al-Sakhr, in central Iraq, and the Western towns of al-Qa'im and Tarbil, which killed one and injured three people.
The continued US attacks require resistance fighters ""to expand the scope of their retaliatory strikes from the military bases used by the US occupation forces to their interests in Iraq and the entire region,"" it added.
""Iraq's resistance will keep supporting Gaza and the Israeli-occupied Palestine while conducting painful attacks on US occupation forces until they are driven out of Iraq and the region.""
The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said Wednesday's unilateral strikes were a response to attacks on American bases, including the one carried out last week on Ain al-Asad in Iraq's western province of Anbar.
The Iraqi government condemned the US air raids, saying, ""This unacceptable act ... blatantly violates Iraq's sovereignty and leads to an irresponsible escalation.""
""We will treat these operations as acts of aggression and take necessary actions to preserve the lives and dignity of Iraqis on their land,"" read a statement released by the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani.
In the past few months, Iraqi resistance forces have conducted dozens of strikes on the US-run military installations in both Iraq and Syria amid growing anti-US sentiments in the region over Washington's support for Israel's genocidal aggression against the Gaza Strip.
Israel waged its brutal war following a historic operation by the Gaza-based Hamas resistance group against the occupying entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.
However, 111 days into the offensive, the Tel Aviv regime has failed to achieve its objectives in Gaza despite killing at least 25,700 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring 63,740 others.
The US is a partner in the Gaza carnage as it has supplied Israel with weapons and intelligence support, and blocked UN resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian territory."

Yonhap News Agency: At the Universal Periodic Review of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the ROK government called on China to protect ""DPRK defectors"". What is China's position on this?
Wang Wenbin: There is no so-called ""DPRK defectors"" in China. People who illegally entered into China for economic reasons are not refugees. With regard to these people, China handles them under the principles of both domestic and international laws and the spirit of humanitarianism. The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism is a platform for countries to engage in equal-footed exchange and carry out dialogue and cooperation under the principle of being constructive and non-politicized.â
Hubei Media Group: On January 23, China took part in the fourth cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of the UN Human Rights Council. Representatives attending the meeting spoke highly of China's human rights development path and historic achievements in human rights cause. Can you share more details with us?
Wang Wenbin: On January 23, China took part in the fourth cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The Chinese government attached great importance to the review and sent a government delegation consisting of representatives from over 20 ministries, Xizang Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Macao Special Administrative Region to the UPR meeting in Geneva for constructive interactions and dialogues with all parties. Parties widely commended China's open and candid attitude and generally spoke positively of China's achievements in human rights.
In its statement, the Chinese delegation elaborated on China's human rights development path and achievements, stressing that China views respecting and protecting human rights as an important endeavor in governing the country and has found a human rights development path that echoes the trend of the times and suits our national conditions, and has made historic progress in advancing human rights in China. We follow a people-centered approach and work hard to deliver a better life for the people. We uphold the principal role of the people, and ensure that the people are masters of the country, the society and their own future, that human rights are enjoyed equally by all, and that everyone has the opportunity to shine in life. In the process of Chinese modernization, China has been committed to peaceful development, championed the common values of mankind, advocated the protection and promotion of human rights through security, development and cooperation, written new chapters in the development of the human rights cause, and contributed China's strength to the world human rights cause. During the review, China announced that it will adopt 30 new measures to safeguard human rights, covering areas of people's wellbeing, legal protection for human rights, international cooperation on human rights and the work related to UN human rights mechanisms.
More than 120 countries spoke highly of China's human rights progress, and fully acknowledged China's effort and historic achievements in advancing and protecting human rights. They commended China's work to practice whole-process people's democracy, formulate and implement the Human Rights Action Plan, revise the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests, and improve social safeguards and service system for people with disabilities. They noted that China's human rights development path fits China's national conditions, meets the aspiration of the people, and provides a brand new choice for countries, especially developing ones, in their independent exploration of human rights development paths. These comments point to the code of success for China's human rights progressâthe leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics, for they have determined the socialist nature of China's human rights cause, that in China, the people are the masters, human rights are enjoyed equally by all, and that the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority can be realized, protected and advanced.
During their remarks at the UPR meeting, many countries congratulated China on its election as a member of the Human Rights Council for the sixth time and on starting a new term. They expressed their hope that China will play a leading role in global human rights governance and safeguard international fairness and justice. China will stand in solidarity with the Global South, share weal and woe with fellow developing countries, propose more initiatives and propositions that serve the common interests of developing countries, work for more equitable, just, reasonable and inclusive global human rights governance, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
Associated Press of Pakistan: During his visit to Pakistan, Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong held high-level meetings with Pakistani leaders, during which the two sides renewed commitment for the success of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and expressed desire for enhanced cooperation in the areas of information technology, economy, agriculture, and human resource development. I wonder if you have any comment on that?
Wang Wenbin: From January 20 to 22, Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong visited Pakistan, during which he paid courtesy calls on Pakistan's President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of the Army Staff Syed Asim Munir, and Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani to have in-depth exchanges of views on the bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest, and co-chaired the Fourth Meeting of the CPEC Joint Working Group on International Cooperation and Coordination with Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi.â
China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners. China appreciates Pakistan's firm commitment to the one-China principle, supports Pakistan in defending its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and supports its unity, stability, development and prosperity. China stands ready to work with Pakistan to deliver on the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, deepen political mutual trust, expand practical cooperation, upgrade the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and accelerate the building of an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.
Reuters: With the resumption of bilateral ties with Nauru, does China plan to step up investment and trade with Nauru and also offer financial aid to the Pacific country? Are there any details as to what type of investments or trade or how much of financial aid?
Wang Wenbin: Today, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi and Nauru's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Lionel Rouwen Aingnimea, who is on a visit to China at our invitation, signed Joint CommuniquÃ©âon the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Nauru in Beijing. Our two countries decided to reestablish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level, effective as of this day. Nauru has become the 183rd country to have diplomatic relations with China.
The reestablishment of diplomatic ties between China and Nauru once again demonstrates that there is but one China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. It's an indisputable fact, a prevailing international consensus and a widely accepted basic norm governing international relations. China's sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no challenge, the Resolution 2758 adopted by the UN General Assembly allows no distortion, the historic trend toward China's reunification will not be stopped, and no country should be absent from the world's big family committed to the one-China principle.
China's relations with Pacific island countries have continued to deepen. The reestablishment of diplomatic ties between China and Nauru represents the shared aspiration of Nauru and the Pacific islands countries, and serves the fundamental and long-term interests of China and Nauru. The two countries have started a new chapter in bilateral relations and opened the door of friendly cooperation and common development. China will uphold the ""four full respects"" policy and work with Nauru in various fields based on equality, mutual respect, mutually beneficial cooperation, openness and inclusiveness for the benefit of the two peoples and their future generations.
There are still a handful of countries who still have so-called ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan. We call on these countries to recognize the trend, seize the historic opportunities, and stand on the side of the international community, on the side of international justice and on the right side of history. Yet it's never too late to welcome new friends. China stands ready to turn a new page with these countries on the basis of the one-China principle.
Global Times: On January 20, Viet Nam's Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Viet Nam has full legal basis and ample historical evidence to assert its ""sovereignty"" over the ""Hoang Sa Islands"" and the ""Truong Sa Islands."" What's China's comment?â
Wang Wenbin: Xisha Qundao and Nansha Qundao are China's territory with solid historical and legal grounds. China was the first country to discover, name, and develop and administer these islands, and we have exercised continuous sovereign jurisdiction over them. China opposes relevant countries' illegal claims over China's territory and will continue to firmly safeguard its sovereignty.
CCTV: The Philippines' President Marcos Jr. last night in an interview openly reiterated that the Philippines is committed to the one-China policy and that has not changed and will not change. The Philippines does not endorse Taiwan independence. Taiwan is a province of China and the matter they will be brought together again is an internal matter. What's China's comment?
Wang Wenbin: We appreciate the Philippines reaffirming its commitment to the one-China policy and emphasizing that Taiwan is a province of China and the Philippines does not endorse ""Taiwan independence.""
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Realizing the complete reunification in China is where global opinion trends and the arc of history bends. Any attempt to seek ""Taiwan independence"" is doomed to failure.
Reuters: The Financial Times reported that the United States has asked China to urge Tehran to rein in the Iranian-aligned Houthis attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, but has seen little sign of help from Beijing. This is according to US officials. The report said the US has repeatedly raised the matter with top Chinese officials in the past three months. Could we confirm with the Ministry if these discussions with the US took place? Has China been in touch with Iran or the Houthis about the Red Sea attacks? If so, what was discussed or any outcomes that China is hoping for?
Wang Wenbin: We are deeply concerned over the recent rapid escalation of tensions in the Red Sea. The Red Sea is an important international trade route for goods and energy. China has been in close communication with various parties and worked actively to alleviate the tension in the Red Sea. China calls for a stop of causing disturbance to civilian ships, and urges relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the fire in the Red Sea and jointly safeguard the safety of the Red Sea shipping route in accordance with the law. It must be stressed that the tension in the Red Sea is a manifestation of the spillover of the Gaza conflict. The priority now is to end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible to avoid further escalation and prevent the situation from getting out of control. In the meanwhile, we believe that the Security Council has never authorized the use of force by any country on Yemen and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yemen and other coastal countries of the Red Sea need to be earnestly respected. China stands ready to work with all parties to help cool down the situation and safeguard the security and stability of the Red Sea region."

In particular, the United States and the Republic of Korea reaffirmed their commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation, strengthen cyber resilience in the ASEAN region, and to counter Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) cyber threats, including the DPRK's revenue generation through malicious cyber activity to its regime's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.
The Consultations acknowledged the work that has been done in fostering greater regional cybersecurity cooperation and capacity building, as well as the importance of continued implementation of cyber confidence building measures to reduce the risk of misperception and escalation in cyberspace.  This includes efforts advanced through the ASEAN Regional Forum Inter-Sessional Meeting on Security of and in the Use of Information and Communication Technologies.
These Consultations are the first to be held since the announcement of the U.S.-ROK Strategic Cybersecurity Cooperation Framework in April 2023, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK Alliance.  The Consultations served as a venue to assess and further strengthen cyber cooperation between both sides.  The participants committed to further discussions on cyber policy over the course of 2024."

Azerbaijan on January 24 said it was suspending its cooperation with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) amid deteriorating relations with Brussels.
In a statement, the Azerbaijani delegation to the PACE said the Strasbourg-based legislative body was ""being used as a platform to target some member states.""
The decision came two days after Germany's Frank Schwabe challenged the credentials of the Azerbaijani delegation on the opening day of PACE's 2024 winter session.
Schwabe specifically raised concerns about the status of political prisoners in Azerbaijan and cited the ""violent displacement of people"" from Nagorno-Karabakh following Azerbaijan's recapture of the ethnic Armenian-dominated region. More than 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan recaptured the territory in September 2023.
The German representative also pointed out that PACE rapporteurs had been unable to visit Azerbaijan on at least three occasions in 2023.
The Azerbaijani delegation complained in its statement that ""core principles of the PACE are exploited by certain biased groups to advance their narrow interests."" It further charged that ""political corruption, discrimination, ethnic and religious hatred, double standards, arrogance, chauvinism have become prevailing practice in the PACE.""
The delegation accused the PACE of exhibiting ""Azerbaijanophobia and Islamophobia,"" creating what it described as an ""unbearable atmosphere"" that it said contributed to Baku's decision to ""cease its engagement with and presence at the PACE until further notice.""
Azerbaijan's decision to leave the PACE comes amid growing tensions with the European Union as Baku accuses Brussels of ""bias"" toward Yerevan as Armenia and Azerbaijan try to normalize relations.
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on January 10 rejected a proposal by Armenia to use Soviet-era maps drawn in the 1970s to delineate borders, claiming that Azerbaijani territories had been handed to Armenia by the Soviet authorities.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on January 22 criticized Aliyev's ""territorial claims"" and warned that there would be ""severe consequences"" if Armenia's territorial integrity was violated.
The following day, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said Borrell's comments amounted to a ""blatant misinterpretation of facts"" and accused the chief EU diplomat of engaging in ""threatening rhetoric.""

Just before the eruption of the spectacular fireball, caught on bystanders' videos northeast of the Russian border city of Belgorod, a massive military transport plane could be seen veering sharply, then nosediving over the horizon, and into the ground, kicking a plume of orange and black into the gray sky.
It was an Ilyushin Il-76 -- a workhorse plane of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, known for carrying heavy cargos: tanks, trucks, weapons, equipment, men.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, however, the jet that crashed on January 24 was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transported for a prisoner exchange. The culprit for the downing, the ministry alleged, was Ukraine itself.
The crash was not expected to have a substantial effect on the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. Nearly two years after Russia's all-out invasion, the battle lines are all but frozen: Ukrainians are digging in and trying to hold on, Russians are pounding their positions with meatgrinder infantry assaults and relentless artillery barrages as lethal drones whine overhead.
If nothing else, it was a potential body blow to Ukrainian morale, which has shown signs of slipping due to a failed counteroffensive and the political infighting in Washington that has deprived Kyiv of desperately needed weaponry.
Here's what we know so far about the crash of the Il-76.
Nose-Dive To the Ground
First word of the aviation disaster emerged late morning local time on January 24, when the governor of the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine and which has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian missiles and ambush units, announced an ""incident"" northeast of the city of Belgorod.
Shortly after, around 12:30 p.m. local time, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that an Ilyushin military cargo jet had crashed. The ministry said the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, along with a crew of six, and three other people identified as escorts.
Videos began to appear on Telegram showing a plane corkscrewing across the sky and disappearing behind a tree line before an explosion erupts and black smoke billows upward.
By late afternoon, videos on the Russian state news agency TASS and several Telegram channels showed wreckage of a plane scattered across a snowy field.
What Did Ukraine Say?
Shortly after the Russian reports appeared, several Ukrainian news outlets, including Ukrayinska Pravda and RBK-Ukrayina, reported that the plane might have been brought down by a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile. The outlets, however, removed the reports not long after.
The first official word from Ukrainian authorities suggesting some sort of incident came from a military intelligence official, Andriy Yusov, who said an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine -- a semi-regular occurrence -- had been scheduled for January 24 but was not taking place.
Yusov said officials were investigating the reports of the crash.
Pestered by journalists for comment or confirmation, Ukrainian government authorities declined comment for much of the day.
The military's general staff issued a statement midafternoon that did not mention the plane crash but asserted Ukraine's right to target Russian military transport planes in border regions.
""The armed forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery vehicles and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat,"" it said.
By evening, the country's military intelligence agency released a longer, more detailed statement that confirmed the plane's crash but said it could not confirm the presence of Ukrainian soldiers on the jet.
The statement insinuated that Russian officials had withheld information about exchanging prisoners, and implied that Moscow had willfully endangered prisoners' lives.
""This may testify to intentional Russian actions aimed at creating a threat to the lives and safety of prisoners,"" the agency, known as HUR, said. ""Landing of a transport aircraft in a...combat zone cannot be safe and must in any case be discussed by both sides [in advance], otherwise it endangers the entire process of exchange.""
In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for an international investigation.
""It is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones, and the emotions of our society,"" Zelenskiy said.
So, Were 65 Ukrainian POWs Killed?
It's not yet entirely clear, even though both sides say a prisoner swap was planned.
In its statement, the Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukrainian authorities were ""well aware that, in accordance with established practice, Ukrainian servicemen were to be transported by military transport aircraft to Belgorod airfield today for exchange.""
Still, more than 24 hours later, Ukrainian authorities had neither confirmed nor denied that prisoners of war were killed in the crash.
""Currently, there are no signs of the fact that there were so many people on the Il-76 plane, be they citizens of Ukraine or not,"" Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament's main human rights official, said in a post to the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
Adding further to the murk: a list of Ukrainian soldiers' names, purporting to be the names of the POWs on the Il-76, was published not long after news of the crash by Margarita Simonyan, the longtime head of the state-controlled TV channel formerly known as Russia Today.
Several of the names on the list, however, matched those of Ukrainian soldiers who had been released in earlier prisoner exchanges.
Also mysterious: videos from the debris-strewn field showed few signs of bodies or human remains.
""Believe me, if there were seven or eight dozen people there, the field would be strewn with corpses and remains of bodies,"" Roman Svitan, a Ukrainian aviation expert, told Current Time.
Were There Missiles On the Plane?
In the partially retracted Ukrayinska Pravda report from January 24, Ukrainian officials also said the Ilyushin was carrying S-300 air defense missiles.
Yusov, the military intelligence agency spokesman, repeated that assertion a day later, in comments to RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. He also said that there were other Russian military jets in the airspace nearby.
If true, that would potentially provide a partial explanation why the cargo jet could have been targeted by Ukrainian forces.
""Ukraine had the right to fire at these planes, which were carrying missiles in order to use the S-300 on Kharkiv,"" another aviation expert, Valeriy Romanenko, said.
The S-300 missile is a long-range, surface-to-air weapon widely used in antiaircraft systems, Russian and Ukrainian.
Yusov also asserted that high-ranking Russian officials had planned to travel on the jet but that Russia's main intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), barred them from boarding.
""Several official VIPs from the military-political representation of the aggressor state were supposed to have been on board. Their names are known and will be named,"" he said. ""But at the last moment, the FSB actually ordered them not to board and to use other modes of transport.""
He did not provide evidence.
What Does It Mean For The War?
Fundamentally, this changes nothing for the battlefield. Along the nearly 1,200-kilometer front line, both sides are hunkering down, digging into defenses, trenches, and shelters, as the winter freezes the ground and makes major advances harder to pull off.
Ukraine's widely touted counteroffensive, which kicked off in June, sputtered out late last year. Russian forces have been incrementally advancing near the towns of Avdiyivka and Kupyansk. Both sides are also believed to be trying to replenish unit strength and weapons supplies.
Ukraine has scored a series of dramatic surprise attacks on Russian targets in recent months. They've destroyed or severely damaged Russian Black Sea naval ships and related infrastructure in the Crimean ports of Sevastopol and Fedosia.
Last week, Ukraine claimed it had downed an Antonov A-50 reconnaissance plane, a flying command center used to help Russian aircraft locate Ukrainian targets, while flying over the Sea of Azov. There's been no definitive confirmation of the plane's destruction, however.
Those attacks, some of which are believed to have utilized Western-supplied cruise missiles and air defense systems, did not fundamentally change the trajectory of the war. But they did bolster Ukrainian morale.
If it is confirmed that Ukraine shot down the Russian cargo jet, and mistakenly killed dozens of Ukrainian POWs, it would undo that.

Mali's military rulers ended a 2015 peace deal with Tuareg separatist rebels in the country's north, government spokesperson Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga said in a televised statement on Thursday.
The government ""notes the complete impossibility of the deal,"" Maiga said, ""and in consequence announces its end, with immediate effect.""
He said it was not possible to continue with the agreement because of other stakeholders not upholding their commitments, as well as ""hostile acts"" by Algeria, which acted as a primary mediator.
That means the Algiers Accord, which the United Nations brokered, is no longer viable, the spokesperson said.
The separatist rebels â organized under the Coordination of Azawad Movements â in July 2022 accused the military junta of abandoning the peace deal.
The junta's announcement came after months of hostilities between rebel groups and the military, the latter of which launched back-to-back coups in 2020 and 2021.
The 2015 peace deal was considered vital to stabilizing Mali, which had endured jihadist violence since 2012.
But the agreement began to fall apart after years of calm when conflict between separatists and the national military was sparked amid the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers in December 2023.
Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse."

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]
The UK Ministry of Defence reported that   Ukraine's ports exported more agricultural products in December 2023 than at any other point since Russia's invasion, almost certainly driven by the reopening of Ukraine's main Black Sea ports and establishment of a unilateral shipping export channel. It has surpassed monthly volumes achieved during the UN- and Turkey-brokered Black Sea Grain initiative, which was subject to Russian inspections.
Ukraine has achieved this because it has largely prevented the Russian Black Sea Fleet from operating in the western Black Sea, where it is held at risk by Ukrainian missiles and uncrewed surface vessels. Market confidence is supported by the UK-brokered reduction in insurance premiums through the Unity Facility insurance package and the announcement that Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have formed a naval mine countermeasures force.
The health of this export route is vital in the long term: both for Ukraine's export revenue; and as a symbol that both sides are willing to suspend attacks on civilian shipping, paving the way to diminished risk and greater trade for all in the Black Sea.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day, 53 combat clashes took place.

A senior member of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says the Israel is collapsing at all levels as the regime is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity.
Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas' political bureau, made the statement on Sunday as he pointed to the latest developments regarding Israel's genocidal war against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
""The Zionist regime is collapsing by committing the biggest crimes against humanity at the internal, social, military and political levels and, today, has been brought to international courts,"" Hamad said, referring to lawsuits lodged by South Africa and Indonesia at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the regime's rights violations in the Gaza war.
""Now, this opportunity has been provided for all Palestinian groups to adopt a firm stance and force the international community to reclaim the rights of our nation.""
Hamad also praised South Africa for its ""great"" position at the Hague-based tribunal and said the move will ""go down in history.""
Stressing that the Israeli regime aims to impose a political solution on Palestinians, the Hamas official said the resistance movement has robust means to confront the occupying entity.
""We will not accept that they once again lie to the Palestinian people, the Zionist regime cannot impose a political solution on us,"" Hamad said, adding, ""We have very strong pressure levers and the facilities to deal with the enemy. Anyone who follows the Zionist enemy's news will see that there is confusion and disputes among the heads of the Israeli regime.""
Isaac Herzog, the Israeli regime's president, was targeted by Swiss prosecutors on Friday over the Zionist forces' genocidal war on the defenseless Palestinians in the besieged territory.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office (BA) said Herzog was handed criminal charges during his visit to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.
Israel waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad conducted the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm into the occupied territories in response to the occupying regime's intensified crimes against the Palestinian people.
More than 100 days into the campaign, the regime has achieved no objectives despite killing more than 24,900 people, mostly women and children.
The Tel Aviv regime has also imposed a ""complete siege"" on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there."

The US Central Command (CENTCOM) has said ""a number of American personnel were undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries"" after massive missile strike by Iraqi anti-terror groups on Ain al-Asad airbase.
CENTCOM confirmed in a statement that the airbase in western province of Anbar was targeted by ""multiple ballistic missiles and rockets,"" but declined to provide details on the extent of injuries.
Earlier, Iraqi reports said a barrage of forty missiles targeted the airbase on Saturday evening.
Meanwhile, citing an unnamed US official, the Reuters news agency said on Sunday that the American military personnel targeted in the rocket attack suffered what was described as ""minor"" injuries.
The official added that a member of Iraq's security forces was also wounded in the attack on Ain al-Asad airbase, which houses US occupation forces in Iraq's Anbar Province.
In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of anti-terror Iraqi armed groups, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Ain al-Asad airbase on Saturday evening.
Stressing that the base was targeted by a large number of missiles and rockets ""directly hit their targets,"" the statement said the large-scale rocket attack was carried out in retaliation for unflinching US support of Israel's genocidal war on the besieged Gaza Strip.
Since mid-October, Iraqi resistance forces have carried out dozens of strikes on the US military facilities in both Iraq and Syria amid growing anti-US sentiments in the region over Washington's backing of Israel's incessant bombardment campaign on Gaza.
Israel waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad conducted the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm into the occupied territories in response to the occupying regime's intensified crimes against the Palestinian people.
Since the start of the aggression, Israel has killed more than 24,900 Palestinians, mostly women and children.
The Tel Aviv regime has also imposed a ""complete siege"" on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.
The United States has supplied Israel with weapons and intelligence support, and blocked UN resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Palestinian territory."

January 23, 2024  23.01.24  IDF
This morning, I wish to update you regarding a very difficult incident that occurred yesterday. During the operation in the central Gaza Strip, 21 reserve soldiers were killed in action. The forces were operating in an area between the Israeli communities and Gaza - near the community of Kissufim. The forces were removing structures and terrorist infrastructure in the area - approximately 600 meters from the border. The mission is intended to provide the security conditions necessary to allow the residents of southern Israel to return to their homes.
As far as we know at this stage, it appears that around 4 o'clock, an RPG missile was fired by terrorists toward a tank that was securing the force. Simultaneously, there was an explosion that resulted in the collapse of two two-story structures, while most of the force was inside them and nearby.
The explosion of the structures was most likely from explosives laid by our forces, which were about to be used for demolishing terror infrastructure and buildings in the area.
We are still examining and investigating the details of the incident and the cause of the explosion. Following the explosion, commanders in the field, along with rescue teams that arrived very quickly at the scene, have been operating to evacuate the casualties and locate the injured in a very complex operation that has been ongoing until recently.
So far, we have authorized the release of the names of ten of the fallen soldiers, and in the coming hours, we will authorize the release of additional names. We have notified the families of all the fallen soldiers of the difficult news and are accompanying them during these hard times.
In reference to the rumors that circulated yesterday after the incident - I want to clarify that we only provide information that has been independently verified and only after all the families have been notified.
This is what we will continue to do. Behind the rumors are families who are experiencing their darkest hour. Therefore, I call on you to act with responsibility and sensitivity. Let's refrain from adding great suffering to their already severe pain.
This war has a very painful and heavy price; the devoted reservists who rallied to the flag sacrificed everything for the security of Israel so that we all can live here securely."

20240125
KISHINEV (Sputnik) - Moldovan Defense Minister Anatolie Nosatii on Wednesday denied media reports that F-16 fighter jets that the West will send to Ukraine would be based on the territory of Moldova.
Moldovan media and Telegram news channels have reported earlier that American F-16s to be handed over to Ukraine in the future would be based at the Marculesti air base in the north of the republic.
""This information that F-16s would be based on the territory of the republic is inaccurate, and its purpose is to discredit the [Moldovan] Ministry of Defense. I condemn and dismiss these lies. The national army acts in accordance with the approved plans and carries out activities in the country and abroad to strengthen the country's defense capability and develop the necessary capabilities to be able to act in any crisis situation. I urge citizens and the media to get information from credible sources,"" Nosatii told a government briefing.
In mid-January, Romanian Defense Minister Angel Tilvar and his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, discussed cooperation in training Ukrainian and Romanian pilots to fly F-16s via teleconference.
Romania received the first five F-16s for pilot training from the Netherlands in November 2023.
Western countries have been providing Ukraine with military aid since the start of Russia's special military operation in February 2022. The support evolved from lighter artillery munitions and training to heavier weapons, including tanks and jets. Last July, an international coalition was formed to provide Ukrainian pilots with training to fly F-16s, the fighter jets of its choice, spearheaded by Denmark and the Netherlands.
Russian officials have repeatedly voiced concerns that arms supplied to Ukraine will eventually end up on the black market and fall into the hands of terrorists or criminal organizations, thus jeopardizing the security of the entire Europe and increasing the risk of a direct clash between Russia and NATO.

The U.S. government provided Iran with a ""private warning"" about a terrorist threat within its borders ahead of a deadly attack earlier this month that killed more than 80 people, a U.S. official said on January 25.
The official said the U.S. government followed a long-standing ""duty to warn"" policy to warn governments against potential lethal threats.
""We provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks,"" a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity in an e-mail to RFE/RL confirming a report earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report about the warning.
Two explosions on January 3 at a memorial for U.S. of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) General Qasem Soleimani in the southeastern city of Kerman were claimed by Islamic State (IS). The group said two of its members detonated their suicide vests, causing the explosions, which injured more than 280 people.
The Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that the information passed to Iran was ""specific enough about the location and sufficiently timely"" that it could have helped Tehran to thwart the attack or at least mitigate the death toll.
Officials with Iran's mission to the United Nations didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the newspaper said.
The incident intensified fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East as Israel continues its war against the U.S.- and EU-designated terrorist organization Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as Yemen-based Huthi rebels allied with Iran continue their attacks on Red Sea commercial shipping.
Soleimani was killed in what the U.S. called a ""defensive"" drone strike while he was traveling in a two-car convoy near Baghdad's international airport on January 3, 2020. He was considered to be one of the most powerful men in Iran and the architect of Tehran's foreign policy in the region at the time.

Mr. Lai is the founder of the campaigning pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, which was shut down in 2021 in the wake of the June 2020 National Security Law clampdown in the region.
He has spent much of the past three years in solitary confinement after campaigning for decades for freedom of speech and democratic space in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
Arrested in August 2020, he was charged with sedition and foreign collusion under the new legislation. Charges related to tweets, interviews and articles he published in Apple Daily outlining the impact of the National Security Law on Hong Kong's fundamental rights and freedoms, the experts said.
Mr. Lai's trial on allegedly breaching national security measures got underway after lengthy delays in December. He faces life in prison if found guilty.
""Jimmy Lai's arrest, detention and series of criminal proceedings over the past few years appear to be directly related to his criticism of the Chinese Government and his support for democracy in Hong Kong SAR,"" the experts said.

""We are alarmed by the multiple and serious violations of Jimmy Lai's freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association and his right to a fair trial, including the denial of access to a lawyer of his own choosing and the handpicking of judges by the authorities,"" the four Human Rights Council-appointed Special Rapporteurs added.
Mr. Lai was convicted of unauthorized assembly in 2021 for taking part in previous protests and sentenced to 17 months in prison. He received an additional five years and 9 months for fraud in October 2022.
The UN rights experts previously raised concerns with authorities in 2020 and 2023. In their statement, the rapporteurs said they appreciate and have considered the extensive government responses of 10 July 2020 and 1 May 2023 and stand ready to continue their dialogue with the authorities.
""We expressed our concerns about the National Security Law before it was enacted and will continue to do so, as we believe it is not in line with international legal obligations,"" the experts said, echoing the Human Rights Committee's call on the Hong Kong SAR to repeal the law.
Mr. Lai is the second defendant to be tried under the controversial National Security Law following last year's trial of 47 pro-democracy activists, who are awaiting a verdict reportedly due next month.
Law 'misused'
""We reiterate that national security legislation with criminal sanctions should never be misused against those exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association and of peaceful assembly nor to deprive such persons of their personal liberty through arrest and detention,"" the experts said.
Special Rapporteurs are part of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. They do not receive a salary for their work and serve in their individual capacity."

On 25 January in Kyiv, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Gabrielius Landsbergis participated in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the EU Delegation to Ukraine and the Lithuanian Central Project Management Agency on cooperation in the implementation of the EU-funded project that aims to build new shelters in Ukrainian schools.
""There should be no bomb shelters at schools because children must never be targeted. Attacks on children are terrorism. Therefore, I believe that shelters are a temporary refugs until Ukraine wins. The victory will come. Russia's brutal attacks on civilians are an attempt to destroy the will of Ukrainians to resist. However, Ukraine has repeatedly proved that there is no lack of will to resist the aggressor. And the West must understand the importance of military support and civil protection funding for Ukraine,"" Landsbergis said.
Ukraine's Minister of Education Oksen Lisovyi attended the event and thanked the EU and Lithuania for their assistance.
The European Union has allocated EUR 15 million to construct new school shelters in Ukraine. Lithuania will contribute an additional EUR 0.5 million and assume the responsibility for implementing the project.
The Lithuanian Government has already funded implementing a mobile settlement project in Borodyanka, where the first new shelter in Ukraine has been built since the beginning of the invasion.
According to Landsbergis, the reconstruction projects financed by Lithuania have always aimed to fund the most sensitive and priority programmes and create an example to follow. Therefore, according to Lithuania's Foreign Minister, this EUDEL programme is an example of how Lithuania's development cooperation project can be further developed with funds from other donors."

Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement has warned the United States and its allies against any violation of the country's sovereignty amid the Yemeni Army's anti-Israeli operations in the Red Sea.
Ansarullah spokesman, Mohammed Abdulsalam, made the remarks in a statement on Sunday, cautioning the Western powers that Yemen will counter any acts of aggression.
""We affirm that Yemen will not allow any violation of its sovereignty, [and] will confront any aggression it faces,"" he said.
His comment came after the US and the UK conducted several missile attacks against Yemeni targets over the past month.
They claimed that the attacks were in response to strikes by Yemen's Armed Forces against Israeli vessels or those bound for ports in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The Yemeni forces have also launched missile and drone attacks on targets controlled by the Israeli regime in the occupied territories in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have come under a genocidal US-backed war by the regime since October 7, 2023.
More than 25,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli military onslaught so far, while over 62,600 others have been injured.
Abdul-Salam said, ""We affirm our support for Palestinian people by exerting pressure on Israel to stop its criminal aggression against Gaza.""
Elsewhere in his remarks, he urged the United States to ""stop evading responsibility for ending the aggression against Gaza.""
As the Israeli regime's biggest ally, the US has provided Israel with unwavering military and political support during its onslaught on the coastal territory. It has armed the regime with more than 10,000 tons of military hardware, and has also vetoed all United Nations Security Council resolutions that called for cessation of the aggression.
""We appeal to all countries to stand alongside the Yemeni position, [and] not allow themselves to be victims of American deception,"" the Ansarullah official said.
He, meanwhile, reiterated that the targets of the Yemeni strikes in the Red Sea will continue to be ""Israeli ships or those heading to occupied ports of Palestine."""

An Israeli attack killed at least 20 people and wounded another 150 at a traffic roundabout in Gaza City on Thursday as Palestinians waited for humanitarian aid, Hamas health officials said.
The Israeli military said it was investigating the report.
Also in central Gaza, Palestinian health officials said a nighttime Israeli airstrike on a house in Al-Nusseirat refugee camp killed six people.
Meanwhile, the death toll from a Wednesday strike on a United Nations training center in Khan Younis in southern Gaza rose to 12, with more than 75 wounded, according to Thomas White, a senior official with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
The U.N. relief agency did not directly blame Israel, although earlier it had said the facility was hit by tank fire and Israel is the only force with tanks in Gaza's second largest city. The Israeli military said it had ""currently ruled out"" that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but that it was still investigating the attack.
It said the building might have been hit by a Hamas rocket.
Israeli tanks bombarded areas around two hospitals in Khan Younis, forcing displaced Palestinians to scramble away from the city to look for safe shelter. The Israeli attacks are part of its efforts to end Hamas control of Gaza, the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea.
Gaza health officials said at least 50 Palestinians had been killed in Khan Younis in the past day, including two children in an Israeli air strike that hit a residential home. The city is now encircled by Israeli armored forces and under almost non-stop aerial and ground fire, residents say.
The Hamas-controlled health ministry says more than 25,700 people have been killed and another 63,000 wounded in Gaza since the shock October 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.
The U.S. government has created a channel with Israel to discuss worries about incidents in Gaza in which civilians have been killed or wounded by Israeli attacks, and civilian infrastructure has been targeted, according to a Thursday report by Reuters.
The channel was established after a meeting earlier this month between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israel's war Cabinet.
The head of the World Health Organization called for a cease-fire to the conflict in an address to the organization's governing body Thursday, during which he described the conditions in Gaza as ""hellish.""
""War doesn't bring solution, except more war, more hatred, more agony, more destruction. So let's choose peace and resolve this issue politically,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.
The U.S. and some Middle East countries are trying to negotiate a new cease-fire to halt the fighting, perhaps for 30 days, to allow the release of more hostages and the release of jailed Palestinians held by Israel. About 100 hostages held by Hamas and 240 Palestinians jailed by Israel were freed in a late November week-long cease-fire.
But no new cease-fire agreement has been reached.
A U.N. court at the Hague in the Netherlands is expected to issue a ruling Friday on South Africa's request for an order to halt Israel's Gaza offensive. But Israel often ignores such international rulings and it is not clear whether it would honor any decision against it this time either.
A senior U.N. official called Thursday for ""every measure"" to be taken to protect civilians, following the Wednesday attack at the Khan Younis training center, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have been staying.
The U.N.'s White said the situation in Khan Younis shows a ""consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of humanitarian law.""
""Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately,"" White said. ""People are being killed and injured. As fighting intensifies around hospitals and shelters hosting the displaced, people are trapped inside, and lifesaving operations are impeded.""
The United States, which has been a key Israeli ally in its war against Hamas, condemned the training center attack.
State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said, ""You've heard me say it before, you've heard [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] say it before, but civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected. And humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need.""
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N.'s Palestinian relief agency, said the Khan Younis compound had been clearly marked as a U.N. facility, and its coordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities.

Syria has strongly condemned the latest Israeli missile attack on a residential neighborhood in the capital Damascus concurrent with unrelenting ground and air strikes against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, emphasizing such acts of aggression attest to the criminal nature of the Tel Aviv regime.
""The racist Israeli entity launched a brutal act of aggression on Saturday, January 20, 2024, against a residential neighborhood in Damascus. The inhumane act resulted in the complete collapse of a building, damage to nearby structures, and death and injury of civilians,"" the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said in a statement.
It added, ""This barbaric aggression, together with the mass murder that the Zionist enemy is perpetrating in the occupied Palestinian territories, proves beyond any doubt the criminal nature of the entity and its leaders.""
Five Iranian military advisors of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) were killed in the Israeli missile attack on a building in the Mazzeh neighborhood of Damascus.
An eyewitness living in the area said he heard four to six missiles passing through the sky in quick succession.
The Syrian ministry also called upon the international community to take an immediate action aimed at stopping the crimes and massacres that Israel is committing against ordinary people and civilian facilities.
Such acts undermine regional and international security and peace, are in flagrant violation of the principles of the UN Charter, and openly flout the purposes and goals for which the world body was established, the statement noted.
The Syrian foreign ministry stressed that attacks on civilians and demolition of residential buildings, with utter disregard for women, children or elderly people inside, has become a regular approach of the Israeli regime.
The latest Israeli attack on Damascus reflects the policy of extermination instituted by fascist Zionism, which has its roots in the denial of existence of other peoples and their rights, the ministry said.
""Syria reiterates that this act of aggression will only strengthen its determination to stand up to these inhumane Zionist plots, and the policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing which the Israeli entity is practicing without any consideration for international law and conventions,"" the statement read.
The Syrian foreign ministry finally urged the international community to stand up to Israel's genocidal policies in the Arab world, asking the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities as to safeguarding international peace and security, hold Israeli political and military officials to account, and put an end to their inhumane and immoral policies.
Iran maintains an advisory mission in Syria at the request of Damascus to help the war-torn Arab country fight off the foreign-backed militants who have been fighting the democratically-elected Syrian government since 2011.
The Israeli regime has ramped up its airstrikes on Syria since early October, when it launched the ongoing genocidal war against the Gaza Strip."

HONG KONG, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- John Lee, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday said legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR should be completed as soon as possible as every day counts.
By addressing national security risks, Hong Kong can accelerate its progress and strive to boost the economy, Lee said during an interactive and consultative question-and-answer session with the HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo).
In his opening remarks, Lee said that the legislation is a constitutional responsibility of the HKSAR, noting that national security risks are real and continuous, and can emerge unexpectedly.
External forces are constantly watching, so it is necessary to legislate as soon as possible, he said, adding that once national security risks are eliminated, Hong Kong can accelerate its progress without any concerns to focus on boosting the economy, expanding markets, exploring business opportunities, and improving people's livelihoods.
Regarding the question of how the legislation of Article 23 can be forward-looking, Lee said it is necessary to establish provisions that can address the continuous development of technology which is rapidly evolving and can see a pace faster than imagined.
Noting that explanatory work is crucial, Lee said the HKSAR government will establish dedicated teams to conduct promotional and educational activities and provide explanations to different individuals, while efforts will be made to effectively explain the situation to the international community."

BRUSSELS -- Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said he is trying to ""put some urgency"" into providing ammunition and defense systems to avoid a ""too little, too late"" scenario as Ukraine fights off Russa's full-scale invasion.
Speaking in an interview with RFE/RL on the sidelines of an EU foreign ministers meeting on January 22, Sikorski said that, when he reflects on warnings he issued when he was Poland's foreign minister in 2014 about the danger of Russian intentions in Ukraine, Europe wasn't prepared to do anything about it.
""We might still be just like 10 years ago in the logic of too little, too late,"" he said, stressing that Ukraine urgently needs ammunition and ways to protect its cities and infrastructure.
""Ukraine needs to be helped to recover its territory, and we need to find ways to do it on time,"" he said. ""Because time is of the essence.""
Sikorski declined to speculate on how much time the EU has at its disposal in order to prepare for a possible attack from Russia's side, but said that when Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens other countries like he threatened Ukraine, ""I'm afraid that he's credible. And therefore, we have to make preparations.""
The minister, who returned to the foreign minister post in December when Poland swore in a new government, spoke about the challenges of providing military support particularly from the EU. Production capacity is not rising rapidly enough, he said, acknowledging that governments in the bloc should have written long-term contracts with manufacturers 18 months ago.
""It simply takes time to build new production lines,"" he said. ""I'm told that stuff is coming on line, but not fast enough.""
Sikorski spoke on the same day that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk met in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose office said Poland is planning a new defense package for Ukraine that represents ""a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukrainian needs.""
Sikorski didn't provide details about the defense package but said it wasn't the only thing to come out of the meeting. Poland also said it would join the Group of Seven's security guarantees offered in July and extend a military loan to Ukraine for purchases in Poland.
There also will be regular government-to-government consultations between Warsaw and Kyiv.
""We have the best possible relations with the Ukrainian government,"" Sikorski said but added that Polish farmers and truckers who recently blockaded Polish-Ukrainian border crossings have a ""real issue"" over the increase in trade and transportation across the border.
Sikorski said he has regular contact with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and noted that Poland has put forth some solutions. The goal is to find ""creative solutions to level the playing field for competition between truckers from Ukraine and Poland.""
Sikorski said that, while Poland appreciates that Ukraine is in ""dire need of our solidarity,"" the solidarity of all of Europe ""cannot fall on just one section of the Polish economy.""

The Pentagon today underscored the mutual commitment by the United States and Iraq to strengthening the evolving security relationship between the two nations.
Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said today that the two nations have, for a decade now, enjoyed a productive security relationship aimed at the shared goal of defeating the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist group.
The U.S. and Iraq will, in the coming days, begin discussions as part of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission, or HMC, to plan how the existing security relationship between the two partner nations is expected to evolve going forward.
Discussions taking place as part of the HMC are expected to shape the role of U.S. forces in Iraq and the defeat-ISIS mission. How the U.S. role in that mission will change depends on three key factors, Singh said. Those three factors include the current nature of the threat from ISIS, operational and environmental requirements and Iraqi security forces capability levels.
""Expert working groups of military and defense professionals will examine these three factors and advise the HMC on the most effective evolution of the D-ISIS coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with coalition partners at all stages of the process,"" Singh said.
The groundwork for the HMC discussions was laid last summer during the U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue in Washington, D.C., Singh said.
""During that August 2023 meeting, the U.S. and Iraq committed to start the HMC to discuss the coalition's mission to defeat ISIS,"" she said.
The U.S. currently has a military presence in Iraq as part of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve. The CJTF OIR mission is to advise, assist and enable partnered forces in the defeat of ISIS within designated areas of Iraq and Syria. Inside Iraq, the U.S. works in partnership with both the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish security forces to carry out that mission.
Discussions on how that mission may evolve, Singh said, are relevant now because after 10 years the threat posed by ISIS may also be different. That's something the HMC will investigate as part of its discussions she said.
""We want to make sure that the threat that we saw 10 years ago is not the same threat that we face today, which is why we have entered into this HMC working group to address what the future, what the partnership, what the bilateral relationship looks like,"" she said. ""This is about the future and making sure that Iraq is set up for success in defending its own national security and sovereignty, and how the U.S. can support Iraq in doing that.""
One thing Singh said the HMC meetings will not involve is U.S. ""withdrawal"" from Iraq.
""Let me be clear, the HMC meeting is not a negotiation about the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq,"" Singh said. ""The United States and the coalition are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to fight ISIS. Our Iraqi partners have assured us of their commitment towards working together to shape this future on U.S. military presence and the enduring defeat of ISIS. The HMC will enable the transition to an enduring bilateral security partnership between the U.S. and Iraq, building on the successes of the D-ISIS campaign in partnership with the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve.""
Singh said the U.S. and Iraq have for a decade now worked together in a productive and successful partnership that has put U.S. military and coalition forces alongside ISF and KSF in a mutual effort to eliminate the destructive influence of ISIS. While that partnership is expected to evolve going forward, neither nation wants to see it come to an end.
""The start of the HMC process reflects the evolving U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship, and it underscores our commitment to deepen our security cooperation to advance stability within Iraq and the region,"" Singh said."

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Israeli regime is resorting to ""blind terrorism"" to make up for its defeat in the besieged Gaza Strip.
In a meeting with Head of Iran-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group Marzouq al-Hubaini in Tehran on Sunday, Amir-Abdollahian commended Kuwait's stance in support of the oppressed Palestinian people.
""Although the Zionist enemy has destroyed Gaza on a large scale and martyred tens of thousands of people, it has not achieved any of its goals, so it is trying to make up for its defeat by resorting to blind terrorist acts,"" the top Iranian diplomat said.
Israel began its military aggression against Gaza on October 7, 2023 following Operation al-Aqsa Storm by the territory's resistance movements. More than 25,105 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli military onslaught so far, while over 62,680 others have been injured.
Amir-Abdollahian urged the Iranian and Kuwaiti parliaments to give priority to promotion of mutual relations.
Hubaini, for his part, said the expansion of parliamentary relations is the strongest pillar for the continuation of bilateral ties.
He reiterated Kuwait's resolve to boost parliamentary relations with Iran.
The Kuwaiti parliamentarian further said that Kuwait, as a Muslim and Arab country, hails Iran's principled stance on defending the Palestinian people's rights and cause."

A court in Moscow has sentenced Russian nationalist Igor Girkin (aka Strelkov) to four years in prison on a charge of making public calls for extremist activities.
The prosecution last week had sought almost five years in prison for the former leader of Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Girkin has denied the charges.
Girkin, 53, was arrested in July 2023 after strongly criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin in online statements for his handling of the Ukraine invasion. He accused the Kremlin leader of ""cowardly mediocrity"" and described him as a ""nonentity.""
He has also called out Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for making ""mistakes"" in the invasion of Ukraine and accused him and Putin of ""incompetence.""
Girkin last year even called on Putin to transfer power to ""someone truly capable and responsible.""
A former officer of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Girkin has also argued for a total military mobilization to ensure Russian victory in the war against Ukraine.
Girkin was a key commander of Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region in 2014 and helped Russia annex Ukraine's Crimea that year.
In November 2022, a court in the Netherlands sentenced Girkin and two other defendants to life in prison in absentia in the case of the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine. All 298 people on board died in the crash.
In February, international investigators said there were ""strong indications"" that Putin was personally involved in the incident.
The Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was blown out of the sky on July 17, 2014, amid a conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian armed forces. The victims came from more than a dozen countries, although more than two-thirds of them were Dutch citizens.
Russia has denied any involvement in the downing of the plane.

ADDIS ABABA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government said improvement activities are underway with a China-funded project to increase the amount of potable water supplied to neighboring Djibouti to 100,000 cubic meters per day.
The Ethiopian Ministry of Water and Energy said Sunday the Ethiopia-Djibouti cross-border potable water project, currently generating 20,000 cubic meters per day, is undergoing improvement activities to boost supplies, state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) reported Tuesday.
The project, contracted by the Chinese company CGC Overseas Construction Group Co. Ltd (CGCOC), has been operating since 2017.
It is regarded as one of Africa's largest cross-border water projects, covering 258 kilometers from underground wells dug in Ethiopia's Somali region to Djibouti city, the capital of the Red Sea nation.
With an annual average of 200 millimeters of rainwater in most of its territory, Djibouti has always been in a chronic water stress situation."

Yemeni Prime Minister Abdulaziz bin Saleh Habtoor has described support for Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip as a ""religious"" duty and says the United States will face defeat in its attempts to invade Yemen just as in other battles across the region.
Abdulaziz bin Habtour made the comment in an exclusive interview with Press TV's Face-to-Face program as he reiterated his country's unflinching support for the Palestinian people in Gaza in the face of Israel's months-long aggression.
Abdulaziz bin Habtour pointed to Yemen's decision to target Israeli-owned and -bound ships in the Red Sea in support of Gazans and said the move was a religious duty in response to Washington's backing of Israeli war in the besieged territory.
""What is happening in the world in general and what is happening in Palestine in particular pushes any person who has a little dignity and humanity; this decision was based on humanitarian, religious and moral aspects to support our people in Palestine,"" the Yemeni prime minister said.
""It is no longer important to confront the largest country or the smallest country when you witness daily queues of martyrs, wounded and debris piling up over the heads of our people in Gaza and the rest of the Palestinian territories.""
Abdulaziz bin Habtour underlined, ""This is a religious duty before which all considerations whether geopolitical, strategic or alliances of any kind are insignificant. We know that America is rampaging throughout the world and if we see things this way we will not move and will remain in our homes, therefore we have a vision that stems from the vision of the axis of resistance and this is what prompted us to respond.""
Asked whether the attacks have had any impact on Israel's economy, Abdulaziz bin Habtour said, ""The data that comes from the Zionist enemy says that more than 90 percent of the capacity in the port of Eilat is idle and this is a great gain for our people in Palestine and for us as well. When a port malfunctions in this way at the peak of confrontations, this is a great achievement.""
The Yemeni prime minister censured the US and UK as colonial powers and said they protect Israel as they established the illegal entity themselves.
""The United States and Britain are aggressive countries against all of humanity not against Yemen alone or any other country seeking liberation from Western colonialism. Therefore these two countries have their own old and new colonial projects,"" he said
""The US and Britain are the ones that established Israel in 1949; therefore they seek to protect this entity by all means and capabilities. Whoever stands against this entity, Washington and London will seek to destroy them,"" he added.
Asked whether Yemen was ready to confront US and British attacks on the country considering their military might, Abdulaziz bin Habtour said, ""We are betting on our people, on history and on the future that the United States will fail in every battle it enters.""
He stressed, ""The US entered the Vietnam war and was defeated, it entered the war in Korea and was defeated, it entered Iraq and Afghanistan and was also defeated, imposed siege on Iran since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979 and failed.""
Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched a devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after the territory's Palestinian resistance movements carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The relentless Israeli military campaign against Gaza has killed more than 25,400 people, most of them women and children. More than 62,000 individuals have also been wounded
Reports revealed that Israeli shipping companies have already decided to reroute their vessels in fear of attacks by Yemeni forces.
Yemeni forces have also launched missile and drone attacks on targets in the Israeli-occupied territories after the regime's aggression on Gaza."

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]
The UK Ministry of Defence reported that   on 22 January 2024, the Russian state Duma, or lower house, discussed a bill to seize the financial assets, including property, of Russians who openly criticise the Russian military and the 'special military operation'. A number of prominent Russian writers and a musician have been sentenced in recent months for their criticism of the war.
In July 2022, Russian President Putin approved amendments to the 2012 'Foreign Agents Law', which came into force on 01 December 2022. This legislation has been widely used to repress opponents of the regime. According to OVID-Info, a Russian human rights monitoring agency, in 2023, 217 individuals and organisations were designated 'Foreign Agents'. As of 03 November 2023, according to the Russian Ministry of Justice, the total list of 'Foreign Agents' was 707. 'Foreign Agents' include independent Russian news outlets and human rights organisations, many of which have been forced to operate outside of Russia.
This legislation highly likely seeks to deter and silence anti-war opposition. This recent bill in conjunction with the Foreign Agents measures, likely intends to restrict criticism of the war altogether.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day of January 24, there were 50x combat engagements. Russian forces launched a total of 2x missile and 53x air strikes, carried out 53x MLRS attacks at the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements.

Russia accused Ukraine of shooting down a Russian military cargo plane that crashed on January 24 in the Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine, killing all 74 people on board, including 65 Ukrainian POWs who were on their way to a prisoner exchange.
Ukrainian officials did not confirm or deny the Russian allegation, saying in a statement on Facebook that a prisoner exchange was to have taken place on January 24 and Russia had not informed Ukraine that Ukrainian POWs would be flown on cargo planes.
Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate said it did not have ""reliable and comprehensive information"" on who was on board the flight but said the Russian POWs it was responsible for ""were delivered in time to the conditional exchange point where they were safe.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for full clarity on the circumstances of the crash.
""We need to establish all the clear facts, as much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,"" he said in in his nightly video broadcast.
""It is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones, and the emotions of our society,"" Zelenskiy said.
He did not confirm or deny Russia's claims but said it had been a ""very difficult day.""
He also called for an international investigation into what brought down the plane.
Moscow backed up its accusation that Ukraine deliberately shot down the Ilyushin Il-76 military cargo plane by saying Russian radar registered the launch of two missiles from Ukraine's Kharkiv region, which borders the Belgorod region.
The Ukrainian military's General Staff said in a statement that did not mention the crash that the Ukrainian military had noticed more Russian military transport aircraft landing in Belgorod and linked this to Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities.
""With this in mind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy means of delivery and exercise airspace control to eliminate the terrorist threat, including in the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction,"" it said on Telegram.
The Ukrainian military intelligence statement on Facebook said Kyiv had not been asked to ensure airspace security around the Belgorod area as had been the case during previous POW swaps.
It said Russia's accusations that Kyiv shot down the transport plane could be ""a planned action to destabilize the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state.""
The United States has no confirmation of who may have been on board the plane, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
""We've seen the reports, but we're not in any position to confirm them,"" Kirby said.
Russia called for an emergency UN Security Council session to discuss the downing of the aircraft, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called a ""criminal"" act by Ukraine.
""The Ukrainian prisoners of war were transported to the Belgorod region in order to conduct yet another swap that was agreed between Moscow and Kyiv,"" Lavrov told a press conference at the United Nations in New York.
""Instead of this, the Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike.""
Russian officials said earlier that the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six crew members, and three escorts.
A list of the six crew members who were supposed to be on the flight was obtained by RFE/RL. The deaths of three of the crew members were confirmed to RFE/RL by their relatives.
Video on social media showed a plane, which appears to be an Ilyushin Il-76 military transport aircraft, spiraling to the ground, followed by a loud bang and explosion that sent a ball of smoke and flames skyward.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the plane crash, saying he was still gathering information on the incident.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the plane crash, saying he was still gathering information on the incident.
However, Russian lawmaker and retired General Andrei Kartapolov, speaking in a television interview, accused Ukraine of shooting the plane down, while the media outlet Ukrainska Pravda, citing what it called sources in the armed forces of Ukraine, wrote that Kyiv's military had indicated the crash was ""their work,"" adding that the plane was carrying missiles for Russia's S-300 air defense system. It later deleted the post.
Moscow and Kyiv have held several prisoner swaps since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The Russian Defense Ministry earlier reported that a drone had been shot down in the region but gave no further details.

On 18-19 January, NATO held its first talks with Civil Society representatives on the update of NATO's policy on Women, Peace and Security. The talks were carried out as part of the first meeting of the new Civil Society Advisory Panel (CSAP) on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) under the leadership of NATO Secretary General's Special Representative for WPS Irene Fellin.
Ms Fellin said: ""the CSAP provides a unique platform to engage with civil society experts with outstanding expertise and from a diverse range of backgrounds. Their perspectives bring invaluable insights for the WPS Policy update, and will support the advancement of NATO's WPS agenda"".
At the Vilnius Summit, Allies agreed to update NATO's 2018 policy on WPS, adapting it to the current security environment, in particular Russia's war in Ukraine, and its implications for women and girls. The policy, which drives NATO's work on WPS, is set to be endorsed at the NATO Summit in July 2024.
The CSAP was first established in 2016. In 2023, Allies agreed to revise its terms of reference to increase its representation and inclusiveness, and expand its areas of expertise to include gender implications related to climate change, cyber security, emerging disruptive technologies and counterterrorism. It comprises 24 civil society experts from across the Alliance, partner nations, and conflict-affected regions, from diverse backgrounds working on women's rights, peacebuilding, human rights advocacy, community leadership and mediation.
In his opening address on 18 January, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea GeoanÄ welcomed the re-establishment of the CSAP, which ""comes at a critical time as the Alliance is facing a multitude of complex security challenges"". He thanked the Secretary General's Special Representative for WPS for her efforts in making this happen."

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Decree No. 17/2024 ""On the Territories of the Russian Federation Historically Inhabited by Ukrainians.""
The document states that for centuries, Russia has systematically destroyed national identity, oppressed Ukrainians, and violated their rights and freedoms, in particular in the lands historically inhabited by them in Kuban, Starodubshchyna, Northern and Eastern Slobozhanshchyna within the modern Krasnodar Krai, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov regions of the Russian Federation. At the same time, Russia must comply with its international obligations to ensure that Ukrainians living in its territories, including those historically inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, have the right to education in the Ukrainian language and its free use, civil, social, cultural and religious rights, access to Ukrainian-language media, and the right of peaceful assembly.
""The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with the involvement of international experts, representatives of the Ukrainian World Congress, scholars, and the public, shall elaborate and submit to the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine an action plan to preserve the national identity of Ukrainians living in the Russian Federation, including the lands historically inhabited by them (Kuban, Starodubshchyna, Northern and Eastern Slobozhanshchyna within the modern Krasnodar Krai, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov regions of the Russian Federation),"" the decree states.
The action plan shall envisage, inter alia, the collection and examination of evidence and testimonies about crimes committed against Ukrainians who live (lived) in the territories of Russia historically inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, about the policy of forced Russification, political repression and deportation of Ukrainians, the restoration and preservation of historical memory, including the establishment of a center for these issues.
Work shall also be intensified to counter disinformation and propaganda of the Russian Federation regarding the history and present of Ukrainians in Russia and all the peoples enslaved by it, with the involvement of domestic and foreign scholars, experts, representatives of the Ukrainian community abroad and organizations of Ukrainians abroad in the preparation and holding of events aimed at debunking Russian myths about Ukraine.
In addition, cooperation between Ukrainians and the peoples enslaved by Russia shall be developed. Together with the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, the preparation and dissemination of materials on the more than thousand-year history of Ukrainian statehood, the historical ties of the lands inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians with Ukrainian national state formations in different historical periods shall be ensured.
The need to highlight the true history of ethnic Ukrainians in the lands historically inhabited by them within the Russian Federation in curricula and textbooks for educational institutions is also emphasized.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has also been tasked with ensuring that the provisions of this decree are taken into account when developing a comprehensive strategy for Ukraine's interaction with the Ukrainian global community.
This Presidential Decree has been prepared in compliance with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, in accordance with Article 12, paragraph 3 of part 1 of Article 106 of the Constitution of Ukraine."

I welcome TÃ¼rkiye's decision, which helps our good friend and neighbour Sweden take a significant step closer to joining NATO. Sweden becoming the 32nd member state of NATO takes the partnership of Estonia and Sweden to a new level and makes it possible to cooperate even more closely on defence and security. Sweden's NATO membership significantly increases the security of the Baltic Sea region, improves the security of supply of NATO's Eastern Flank and reinforces the entire Alliance.
I sent my Swedish and Turkish colleagues messages of congratulations, noting that it is a significant decision because Sweden's accession makes NATO even stronger."

Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)
As I have reported previously, militia groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perpetrated a series of attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria.  These attacks, including the recent attack on Al-Asad Air Base by Iran-affiliated militia groups, have caused injuries to United States personnel and Coalition forces operating alongside United States forces and have placed their lives under grave threat.
Previously, in response to these attacks and the threat of future attacks, at my direction, United States forces have conducted targeted strikes against facilities in Iraq and Syria used by the IRGC and IRGC-affiliated groups.
On the night of January 23, 2024, at my direction, United States forces conducted discrete strikes against facilities in Iraq used by IRGC-affiliated militia groups for training, logistics support, and other purposes.  The strikes were taken to degrade militias' capabilities and deter future attacks and were conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk of escalation and avoid civilian casualties.  I directed the strikes in order to protect and defend our personnel and assets who are in Iraq conducting military operations pursuant to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40).  The strikes were intended to degrade and disrupt Iran and Iranâaffiliated militia groups from conducting or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and facilities.
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations and in accordance with the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq (Public Law 107-243).  The United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law and in the exercise of the United States' inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

Sincerely,
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR."

The European Union sanctioned six Sudanese entities Monday for their involvement in the ongoing conflict in Sudan, where the regular army (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been fighting since April.
According to a statement issued by the Council of the EU and the European Council, the entities are ""responsible for supporting activities undermining the stability and political transition of Sudan.""
Those sanctioned played roles in arming or financing rival warring factions, according to the EU, adding to Sudan's worsening instability.
The conflict has pitted current army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against his former deputy and leader of the paramilitary RSF, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, causing thousands of deaths and displacing millions.
According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), more than 7 million people have been displaced due to the conflict, and at least 13,000 have been killed.
Among the entities targeted by the EU sanctions, three are controlled by Sudanese armed forces which include part of the Defense Industries System conglomerate, while three others were linked to Dagalo and his brothers. In the Council of the EU and European Council's statement, it was specified that two of the firms played a role in manufacturing weapons and vehicles, and that the others had a role in obtaining military equipment to be used in the conflict.
While the EU has condemned the violence in Sudan since the conflict began, these more stringent measures follow similar actions by other states.
The United States imposed sanctions in December on three former Sudanese officials for their role in undermining peace, security and stability in Sudan.
That followed sanctions imposed by both the U.S. and U.K. on businesses connected to military groups in Sudan.

Council of the EU  Press release  22 January 2024
The Council today approved additional restrictive measures against 6 persons and 5 entities, in view of the gravity of the ongoing situation in Syria.
The new listings include an economic advisor to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, three leading businesspersons providing support to, and benefitting from, the Syrian regime and two persons connected to the Assad family.
Five companies supporting, and benefiting from, the Syrian regime - Al-Dj Group, Cham Wings, Freebird Travel Agency, Iloma Investment Private JSC and Al-Aqila company - will also be subjected to restrictive measures. Some of these entities are engaged in the transfer of Syrian mercenaries, arms trade, narcotics trafficking or money laundering, which support the activities of the Syrian Regime.
Those listed under the sanctions regime are subject to an asset freeze. The provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly, to them or for their benefit is also prohibited. Additionally, a travel ban to the EU applies to the natural persons listed.
Syria continues to be a high priority for the EU. The Council remains deeply concerned about the situation in Syria. After more than a decade, the conflict is far from over and remains a source of suffering and instability for the Syrian people and the region. The Council also notes that the Syrian regime continues to pursue its policy of repression. It is therefore necessary to maintain and ensure the effectiveness of the restrictive measures in place by further developing them.
The EU reiterates that the only path to sustainable peace for Syria is a political solution in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254.
Background
Sanctions on Syria were first introduced in 2011 in response to the violent repression of the civilian population by the Assad regime. EU sanctions in place regarding Syria target the Assad regime and its supporters, as well as sectors of the economy from which the regime makes profit.
EU sanctions in place regarding Syria are not meant to impede the provision humanitarian assistance to any part of the country. EU Sanctions do not prohibit the export of food, medicines or medical equipment by the EU to Syria, and they do not target Syria's healthcare system. The sanctions regime includes a wide range of humanitarian exceptions to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance to any part of the country. Following the tragic earthquake of 6 February 2023, the already existing humanitarian exceptions were strengthened to further facilitate the speedy delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian population.
The EU and its member states have mobilised over EUR 30 billion since 2011, remaining the largest provider of international aid and delivering humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries. Since 2017, the EU hosts yearly the Conference on Supporting the future of Syria and the Region to keep Syria high on the international political agenda, to raise pledges for assistance to those in need and to dialogue with the Syrian civil society."

Human Rights Watch has accused Burkina Faso's security forces of killing at least 60 civilians last year in drone strikes while claiming to target jihadist fighters. HRW says the attacks may amount to war crimes.
HRW's report released Thursday says the strikes were ""in violation of the laws of war"" and showed ""little or no concern"" for civilians. The laws of war referenced forbid actions that fail to distinguish between civilians and combatants, as well as those expected to result in harm to civilians or civilian property.
While claiming to target extremists, the strikes took place at two crowded markets and a funeral from August to November 2023.
""The government should urgently and impartially investigate these apparent war crimes, hold those responsible to account, and provide adequate support for the victims and their families,"" HRW said in the report.
The first drone strike, in August, hit a weekly market in the village of Bouro that is said to be controlled by al-Qaida-linked extremists, HRW said. It quoted three survivors as saying that jihadi fighters were seen entering the market at the time of the strike. One of those interviewed said it was ""full of civilians when the drone hit.""
The second strike took place in September in the village of Bidi in the Nord region near the border with Mali at a funeral with 100 men in attendance. The report noted there was no militant presence there at the time of the strike and that 25 people were killed and dozens injured.
The third strike, in November, targeted a market across the border near the Malian town of Boulkessi. According to the witnesses quoted by HRW, there were some militants present at the time, but ""almost all"" at the market were civilians.
Jihadist fighters and rebel factions have been active in numerous isolated communities in the region. The report, derived from interviews with at least 23 witnesses and nongovernmental organizations, noted that state-owned media portrayed the strikes as successful operations targeting Islamic extremists â failing to acknowledge any civilian casualties.
Concerns about the government's treatment of civilians are not new. Last year, HRW reported the armed forces of Burkina Faso were engaged in extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and torture within communities affected by conflict.
Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press."

Tehran, IRNA --  A fighter of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has been martyred in southern Lebanon, the group has said amid the ongoing trading of fire across the Lebanese border with the Israeli-occupied Palestine.
Haidar Hussein Ibrahim from the southern Lebanese border village of Odaisseh lost his life in an apparent attack by the Israeli regime, Al-Ahed News website quoted Hezbollah as saying on Tuesday.
Hezbollah has been launching attacks on targets controlled by Israel in a bid to keep up pressure on the regime to end its genocidal war on Gaza.
The group carried out new missile strike late on Monday targeting a gathering of Israeli soldiers in the vicinity of a settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The Health Ministry in Gaza has said that the death toll from Israel's genocidal war against the Palestinians in the besieged territory has surpassed 25,000 since October 7, 2023 when the regime started its aggression.

8Q37FED70M_8CINCNYKXR2R8P4,Red Flag offers 388 FW F-35 maintainers a chance to grow together,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-usaf01.htm,"Published Jan. 25, 2024  By Micah Garbarino  388th Fighter Wing Public Affairs
NELLIS AIR FORCE BASE, Nev. (AFNS) -- Airmen from the 421st Fighter Generation Squadron are working around the clock to provide mission ready F-35A Lighting II aircraft for exercise Red Flag 24-1, but they are also working on their own growth as Airmen.
While the 421st Fighter Squadron and FGS recently returned from a U.S. Central Command deployment, many of the squadron's Airmen have never deployed. As other F-35A units stand up around the Air Force, they are drawing on the 388th Fighter Wing's experienced maintainers, resulting in an influx of new blood.
""Our squadron has recently onboarded 30-40 new Airmen straight out of their initial skills training,"" said Maj. Bryan Butler, 421st FGS commander. ""This exercise is going to give them an opportunity to see a high-end fight where our pilots go out and fly some complex missions. They'll see exactly why we need them to press hard on their upgrade training. There is going to be a day where we need those skills from them, or we'll fall behind.""
With day and night sorties and limited spare aircraft, the simulated combat environment at Red Flag offers a tempo and urgency meant to prepare Airmen for a real-world deployment. The increased amount of flying here leads to a wider variety of maintenance issues that pop up, Butler said. Each one of those is a valuable opportunity for growth in the squadron.
""You learn a lot whenever you come here,"" said Staff Sgt. Dakota Curran, an avionics craftsman from Oak Ridge, Tenn. ""It's helped me become a better troubleshooter, to dig deeper and learn some ways to fix things without all the support and capabilities we have back at Hill [Air Force Base].""
As a new supervisor, Curran says this trip has been a valuable tool for him as he works alongside less experienced troops, helping and observing the younger Airmen in an environment they may not yet be comfortable with.
""Back home, their work hours and workstations are set, daily tasks are pretty much set, but Red Flag forces us all to adapt,"" Curran said. ""It shows not only you, but them, what their strengths and weaknesses are and where they need to improve.""
A normal shift at Red Flag starts with Airmen and leadership taking stock of the current maintenance issues affecting each aircraft. Some Airmen perform inspections and prepare to launch or recover aircraft, while others dig into deeper maintenance issues to get each jet mission ready.
For 2nd Lt. Madi Maroney, from Anchorage, Alaska, learning the day-to-day mission of a deployed FGS has been a ""whirlwind"" experience. Moroney, who commissioned in October, is the officer in charge of the 388th Maintenance Squadron Accessories Flight. To learn the ropes, she was tasked with helping the 421st FGS during Red Flag and next week's Bamboo Eagle exercise.
""This is my first time away from home station, and it's been the coolest opportunity,"" Moroney said."" I've been able to see the duties of a maintenance officer, balancing the people and scheduling to ensure pilots have the aircraft to fly. I've never been this close to the mission and been able to see the results. It's a lot of work and long hours, but we love it.""
""It's nice to be out here and see our training paying off,"" said Senior Airman Gavin Wieszala, an F-35A crew chief from Buffalo, N.Y. ""As you do more, you gain confidence in your ability to do the job. It goes a long way to build you in all aspects."""
8T5AIFJ70K_JINOD8M12EBMKUB,Little time to review China's rights record at UN,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/01/china-240123-rfa02.htm,"Because 160 countries signed up, each only had 45 seconds to speak about China's human rights record.
By Alex Willemyns for RFA 2024.01.23 -- A five-yearly review of China's human rights record at U.N. offices in Geneva descended into a speed-reading contest on Tuesday after an unusually high number of countries registered in a limited schedule to offer their views on a country that has been accused of genocide.
With 160 countries signing up to offer their criticism or praise of China's rights record, each was allotted just 45 seconds in the approximately three-hour session. Beijing, meanwhile, was afforded a full hour to defend its record since its last ""universal periodic review,"" or UPR in U.N. speak, in 2018.
Prior to the review, diplomats speaking to Reuters said China's delegation in Geneva had been lobbying non-Western countries to praise its human rights efforts during the session.
In his opening remarks, Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the U.N. offices in Geneva, said that Beijing ""upholds respect for and protection of human rights as a task of importance in state governance"" and had ""lifted 100 million people out of poverty"" over the past decade.
""We embarked on a path of human rights development in keeping with the trend of the times, and appropriate to China's national conditions and scored historic achievements in this process,"" Chen said.
""A happier life for people is the ultimate human right,"" he said. ""China sees people's aspiration for a better life as the focus of these efforts.""
It was the first review of China's record since the then-top U.N. rights official, Michelle Bachelet, in 2022 issued a damning report that accused China of possible ""crimes against humanity"" for its forced-assimilation policies against the Uyghur ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region.
But China's diplomats in Geneva ignored those claims Tuesday.
Elevator pitches
With so many countries sign-up to speak, there was little time for each to review China's human rights  record in much depth, and many of the diplomats who did speak used their time to praise Beijing's record.
Ethiopia, for instance, said it ""applauds China for improving the criminal litigation system rigorously"" in order ""to make the judicial procedures of human rights in a more orderly way,"" and recommended that Beijing strive to ""carry out publicity and education on the rule of law.""
Gabon welcomed China's work ""to promote child protection through improvements to the law"" and said that its recommendation was for Beijing ""to continue to promote the rights of women and children.""
In contrast, many Western countries were critical in their 45-second reviews, but were still measured given the format of the review process, which requires countries to offer constructive criticism.
The United Kingdom called on China to ""cease the persecution and arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Tibetans, and allow genuine freedom of religion or belief and cultural expression without fear of surveillance, torture, forced labour, or sexual violence.""
Canada's U.N. ambassador in Geneva, Leslie Norton, said China should allow the United Nations ""unfettered access"" to the country to review the rights situation there, and recommended that Beijing end its forced assimilation programs targeted at Tibetans and Uyghurs.
""End all coercive measures imposed on Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities including forced labor, coercive labor transfer, forced sterilizations and mandatory residential schools,"" Norton said.
Finland's U.N. ambassador in Geneva, Heidi Schroderus-Fox, called on China to protect the rights of the Uyghurs and ""to invite the [U.N.] Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief to visit China, including Xinjiang,"" which Beijing has so far not allowed.
Israel, too, called for China to improve the human rights situation in Xinjiang, while Turkey recommended China ""improve overall conditions of all components of its population, including the Uyghur Turks, with full respect of their distinct identity, religion, and language.""
Long list
The most scathing review was offered by the United States, which in 2021 accused Beijing of ""genocide"" over its treatment of Uyghurs.
Speaking in a rapid-fire succession of sentences reminiscent of a patter song, the U.S. representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council, Michele Taylor, fit whole paragraphs listing human rights abuses committed by China's government into her 45-second slot.
""We recommend that China release all arbitrarily detained individuals, ... cease harassment, surveillance and threats against individuals abroad and in China, including Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, cease discrimination against individuals, culture, language, religion or belief and forcible assimilation policies, including boarding schools in Tibet and Xinjiang, and torture, unjust residential detention and persecution throughout China, and forced labor, marriage, birth control, sterilization, abortion and family separation in Xinjiang,"" Taylor said.
Without taking a breathe, Taylor then called on China to ""repeal vague national security, counterespionage, counterterrorism and sedition laws, including the National Security Law in Hong Kong, and repressive measures against women, LGBTQI+ persons, laborers and migrant workers, including in Hong Kong and Macau, permit the U.N. unhindered and meaningful access particularly in Xinjiang and Tibet.""
""We condemn the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and transnational repression to silence individuals abroad,"" she concluded, taking her first breathe before adding: ""Thank you.""
Human rights activists who gathered in Geneva blasted China for undermining a key global rights process, but said that Beijing's efforts did show how much it cared about the outcome.
""It seems as though some of those questions could have been drafted by the Chinese government,"" Kai Muller, the head of U.N. advocacy for the International Campaign for Tibet, told Radio Free Asia.
""China's investment into this U.N. process is quite stunning and tremendous and, at the same time, indeed worrisome.""

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk, who arrived in Ukraine on a working visit.
The Head of State noted that it was the first visit of Donald Tusk as Prime Minister to a country outside the EU.
""We greatly value this choice - the choice to be in Ukraine. Poland's choice of Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a meeting with media representatives following the negotiations with Donald Tusk in Kyiv.
The President thanked Poland and the entire Polish people for the support that helped Ukrainians withstand the full-scale Russian war.
""We highly appreciate that we were not left alone in this battle for Ukraine. We are together with many nations that have helped us and continue to do so. And the Polish people, the Polish state is one of our greatest helpers,"" the Head of State noted.
At the same time, he noted that due to support for Ukraine, Poland's freedom will definitely endure.
During their meeting in Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Tusk discussed all aspects of bilateral relations. Special attention was paid to defense support.
""There is a new Polish defense package. We appreciate such unflagging support. There is a new form of our cooperation - aimed at a larger scale of arms purchases for Ukrainian needs - the Polish loan for Ukraine. Today, Mr. Prime Minister and I also discussed the possibilities of joint future arms production,"" the President of Ukraine informed.
The parties also discussed security commitments and Poland's accession to the G7 Joint Declaration adopted in Vilnius.
""I am grateful for the willingness to start working on a bilateral agreement between our countries. I am confident that the agreement can be very ambitious, exactly what our nations need. I would also like to thank you for the joint work with Poland on the Peace Formula - Poland supports global efforts and participates in relevant meetings. This is important,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.
The leaders also discussed the situation on the border between Ukraine and Poland. The Head of State emphasized the importance of overcoming any problems together in the most pragmatic way possible for the sake of common interests.
""We discussed with Mr. Prime Minister that all critical issues can be resolved at the level of our governments. And work on this will begin shortly,"" the President noted.
The interlocutors also paid attention to the issue of cooperation in the energy sector, the possibility of building up and enhancing energy potential.
""This includes the expansion of the relevant infrastructure of energy ties between Ukraine and Poland, and our government officials will elaborate on all this,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
The Head of State and the Polish Prime Minister discussed Ukraine's course towards the European Union, particularly the exchange of experience in interaction with European institutions.
""I am grateful for Mr. Prime Minister's willingness to support Ukraine with his experience, and perhaps we should form a special advisory group between our countries, between our governments, to support Ukraine on its way to the European Union. I am sure we will be together in the European Union. We will be together in NATO,"" the President said.
In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Polish business to contribute to the country's recovery after hostilities.
""We share full understanding with Mr. Prime Minister on such cooperation and support of Ukrainian and Polish businesses. Together we will be free - Ukraine and Poland,"" the Head of State summarized.
Donald Tusk, for his part, noted that all political forces in Poland share the belief that Ukraine needs to be supported in its fight against Russian aggression by all available means.
""Poland will try to help in all aspects of the EU accession process so that Ukraine's full membership in the European Union becomes a fact as soon as possible. We will also cooperate in all other formats, so I have informed Mr. President that Poland has acceded today to the G7 Joint Declaration adopted at the NATO Summit in Vilnius,"" the Polish Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of Ukrainian-Polish business projects, as well as joint investment in the production of weapons and ammunition.
According to him, Poland plans to take part in Ukraine's recovery and the Polish government will appoint a commissioner responsible for this issue."

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]
The UK Ministry of Defence reported that   on 19 January 2024 the Ukrainian General Staff reported that there was a 27 per cent increase in Russian assaults onthe front line over the previous day with 81 air strikes and 45 multiple rocket attacks.
Additional data from the Ukrainian General Staff comparing the 14-18 January 2024 period with the previous five-day period supports this uptick in Russian assaults. Over these five-day periods the number of military vehicle losses by Russia increased by 88 percent and the number of Russian tank losses increased by 95 per cent. The number of Russian casualties overthe same period also increased by 15 per cent.
This data points towards a steady increase in the intensity of Russian offensive activity across the front over the past two weeks. A key enabler for this is highly likely the freezing ground conditions, which allows cross-country movement of armoured vehicles.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day of January 21, there were 59x combat engagements. Russian forces launched a total of 4x missile and 69x air strikes, carried out 50x MLRS attacks at the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Monday that Lithuania and Poland plan to hold military drills in the Suwalki Gap in April.
""I am very glad that the President of Poland quickly responded to the desire to conduct general exercises on this piece of land called the Suwalki Gap. We are already discussing a specific date, perhaps it will be April. But let's not forget that the Suwalki Gap is also an integral part of NATO's strategic plans, and it is certainly not the case that we are the only ones here talking about the Suwalki Gap and its protection,"" Nauseda was quoted as saying by the Delfi news agency.
The 100-kilometer (62-mile) long Suwalki Gap is a narrow stretch of Polish and Lithuanian territory that separates Belarus from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
Lithuania and other Western countries regularly speak of some kind of threat in connection with the Suwalki Gap, noting that in the event of its hypothetical closure, the Baltic republic would find itself completely isolated from its NATO partners.
Both Russia and Belarus have said they have no plans for these territories. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the republic ""has not needed this corridor for a thousand years."" The governor of the Kaliningrad region, Anton Alikhanov, noted that the Suwalki Gap is of no interest to anyone and is logistically inconvenient. He also called statements about the threat to the corridor ""official NATO mythology,"" which the United States is interested in dispersing for the sake of placing its bases in Poland and Lithuania.

Confirming the order from the de facto authorities, who control the capital Sana'a along with many other areas of the war-torn country, UN Spokesperson StÃ©phane Dujarric told reporters that the demand ran counter to the legal conditions under which the UN and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operate.
Yemen descended into all out conflict in 2015, with Houthi rebels battling internationally recognized Government forces allied with a Saudi-led coalition.
A fragile cessation of hostilities broadly holds within Yemen's borders, but Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza has seen dozens of airstrikes in recent days by the United States and United Kingdom in retaliation.
Cargo vessels have been forced to divert from the Red Sea, threatening global trade and international economic recovery.
No legal basis
Confirming the letter demanding the exit of Sana'a-based staff, Mr. Dujarric stressed that ""any request or requirement for UN staff to leave based solely on the nationality of that staff is inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the UN.""
He noted that it also ""impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to support all of the people in Yemen, and we call on all the authorities in Yemen, to ensure that our staff can continue to perform their functions on behalf of the UN"".
The letter from the Houthi's de facto foreign ministry in the capital was reportedly sent to the UN's acting Humanitarian Coordinator, Peter Dawkins, himself a British national.
It reportedly also ordered foreign organizations not to hire US and British personnel going forward.
Mr. Dujarric emphasized that UN staff ""serve impartially and serve the flag of the UN - and none other"".
UN humanitarians scale up cholera response in Somalia
The spread of cholera and acute watery diarrhoea is continuing in Somalia, with over 470 new cases registered in recent days, including nine deaths, the UN aid coordination agency, OCHA, warned on Wednesday.
Most incidents are concentrated in the areas that experienced severe flooding late last year.
Over 18,300 cases were reported during last year, more than half of them children under five.
OCHA leading the way
OCHA is leading the response, setting up new treatment centres in flood-affected areas and running extensive community education and awareness campaigns through health workers and outreach teams.
Alongside Somalia's Ministry of Health, humanitarians in the country have activated a national cholera task force and developed a six-month plan to scale up the response, which will require some $5.6 million.
With preparations for anticipated April to June flooding now underway, insufficient funding remains a critical concern, UN humanitarians said.
UNESCO trains teachers to counter hate speech
UNESCO, the UN agency for culture, science, and education, is highlighting the key role teachers can play in curbing the rise of hate speech worldwide.
Marking the International Day of Education on Wednesday, UNESCO said that education and classroom teaching in particular are pivotal to countering narratives that fuel prejudice, discrimination and violence.
According to UNESCO, a study conducted in 16 countries last year revealed that 67 per cent of internet users have encountered hate speech online.
Some 85 per cent of respondents expressed concern about the impact of disinformation.
'Peace starts with education'
In her statement for the day, Audrey Azoulay, Director General of UNESCO, underscored the urgent need to prioritize education as a tool to promote the values of human dignity and peace, adding that ""if hatred starts with words, peace starts with education.""
""What we learn changes how we view the world and influences how we treat others,"" she continued.
To address this pressing concern, the agency organized a one-day online training for thousands of teachers.
The workshop equipped educators with tools to identify, confront and prevent hate speech incidents.
UNESCO also brought together ministers, academic leaders and educators from around the globe at an event in New York - home to UN Headquarters - to discuss the role education can play in achieving sustainable global peace."

22 January 2024
Colleagues, two years ago, Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Since its illegal and unprovoked attack, over 300,000 Russian personnel have been killed or wounded. Mothers and wives of these soldiers have been arrested or ignored. Thousands of Russian anti-war protestors have been detained. Media organisations have been shut down, and many journalists are now in Russian prisons.
Russian military modernisation has been set back eighteen years.
Now Russia's defence industry strips down fridges for parts. It orders its weapons from the DPRK, in violation of multiple resolutions agreed in this Chamber, under this Russian Foreign Minister's instruction. Its purchase and use of Iranian drones involves both states violating a Security Council resolution.
And for what? To lose more than half of the land it seized since February 2022 and a fifth of its Black Sea Fleet? To have its economy deprived of over $400 billion by sanctions, and hundreds of thousands of young Russians, who have emigrated for a better future?
This war benefits no one, not Russians, and certainly not Ukrainians.
Colleagues,
Last time the Russian Foreign Minister was here, he spoke of protecting the rights of Russian-speakers in Ukraine.
Yet the only threat to any civilian in Ukraine continues to come from Russia. Russia continues to impede access for humanitarian organisations to the millions of people in need.
The UN Commission of Inquiry has reported a systematic pattern of torture against Ukrainian civilians by Russian authorities.
Russian missile strikes continue to strike population centres, with some of the most intense waves yet falling during the New Year. And Russia says it wants peace.
But while Ukraine, the UK and around 80 other countries were in Davos last week, discussing President Zelensky's plans for peace, based on principles of the UN Charter that all here have signed up to, the deputy head of Russia's National Security Council was proclaiming there could never be peace while an independent state of Ukraine existed.
That is not peace. That is subjugation, which would threaten Ukraine's very existence as a state and usher in a new era of global instability.
This is why the UK will continue to replenish Ukraine's air defences, to help it shield its civilians from these brutal attacks. This is why we have signed a new long term agreement on security cooperation, and announced Â£2.5bn more in military aid, and Â£18 million more in humanitarian aid for Ukraine.
Because Ukraine's security matters for global security.
President, as my Prime Minister said on his recent visit to Kyiv, we remain unwavering in our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its borders, to ensuring Ukraine's ability to defend itself, to resist future coercion, to choose its own future, and to prosper peacefully.
Thank you."

BAGHDAD, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani said on Monday that any attack on Iraqi soil violates its sovereignty, stressing the country's determination to end the presence of the U.S.-led coalition.
Al-Sudani made the remarks during his meeting with the Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren, whose country is scheduled to assume the presidency of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) mission in Iraq in mid-May, according to a statement issued by al-Sudani's media office.
Al-Sudani stressed his rejection of any attack on Iraqi territory or any violation of its sovereignty, reiterating ""the government's commitment to protecting diplomatic missions and advisors working in Iraq, as well as assisting the NATO mission in carrying out its tasks agreed upon with the Iraqi government,"" the statement said.
Meanwhile, al-Sudani affirmed ""the Iraqi government's decision to rearrange the relationship with the international coalition"" and move from the presence of foreign forces in Iraq to bilateral relations and cooperation with the coalition countries, according to the statement.
For her part, Ollongren confirmed that the Dutch government agrees with al-Sudani's vision that victory over the terrorist group Islamic State (IS) requires changing the mission of the international coalition and moving it to equal bilateral relations after the development of the Iraqi security forces' capabilities, according to the statement.
She also confirmed that the Netherlands will assume the leadership of the NATO mission in Iraq in the middle of this year and ""will work with the Iraqi government to achieve its new vision.""
The Netherlands is part of the U.S.-led international coalition tasked with training and advising the Iraqi security forces in their fight against the IS."

Ukrainian forces have shelled a busy market in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, leaving at least 18 people dead and 13 more wounded.
Head of the Russian-administrated areas of Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, said emergency services were working at the scene and that the relevant specialists were trying to collect fragments of the weapons used in the attack.
Alexei Kulemzin, the city's mayor, said Ukrainian forces had shelled a busy area where shops and a market were located.
The Donetsk region is one of four pro-Moscow regions in Donbas, which joined Russia after holding referendums in September 2022.
However, the Kiev forces are still in control of some parts of the regions.
Russia's Defense Ministry has announced recently that its troops had liberated a village in the Donetsk region.
The Russians said on Thursday that their troops had captured the small village of Vesele, 20km northeast of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine.
""In the Donetsk direction, as a result of successful actions of Southern Group troop units, the settlement of Vesele in the Donetsk People's Republic was liberated,"" Russia's Defense Ministry announced
The Russian troops announcement of fresh military advancements on the war front came as Ukraine's war minister told Kiev's Western allies that the Ukrainian forces were facing a ""very real and pressing"" shortage of artillery shells.
""A shortage of ammunition is a very real and pressing problem that our armed forces are facing at present,"" Ukraine Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Thursday in a message posted on X.
After speaking by video link to a gathering of the allies, the Ukrainian official said a new ""artillery coalition"" had been formed to supply Kiev's troops with more ammo. ""The artillery coalition is aimed at solving this issue.""
After Russian troops began their special military operation in Donbas in February 2022, the US-led Western allies largely increased the supply of arms and munitions to Kiev, sending multiple shipments of guns and ammo worth tens-of-billions of dollars.
However, Kiev's demand for more weapons and ammunition has prompted far-right US politicians to question the Ukrainian forces effectiveness in fighting the US-led Western countries' proxy war against the Russians."

Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan pointed out that the Al-Maghazi operation reveals a lack of prospects for the ongoing aggression to lead to favorable outcomes for the Israeli occupation
Tehran (ISNA) - Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Hamdan stated that the theory about Israeli security has collapsed, indicating that the Israeli occupation military is unable to protect itself and is fleeing the confrontation.
The Palestinian official indicated that the United States should seriously consider that the circle of Resistance will expand, and other forces may join it.
He ruled out that Egypt would accept part of its territory to be occupied if Israel took control of the Philadelphia Axis.
Hamdan revealed that several proposals have been submitted for a ceasefire, explaining that the essence of the Israeli proposals is a temporary ceasefire, followed by a return to fighting.
He mentioned that Hamas submitted a proposal that includes ending the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, receiving guarantees against the recurrence of aggression, and then implementing the prisoner exchange deal.
""We feel the pain of what is happening to our people, and we will not hand our people over to the Israelis for them to take over Gaza,"" he added.
The Hamas official underlined that the Palestinian Resistance cannot leave its homeland, recalling that the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from Gaza [in 2005] came due to the Resistance's operations.
Hamdan called on the world to think about the post-Israel phase that would come as a result of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm.
He added that the United States wants to restructure the region according to its interests and is aware that the continuation of the battle will unravel any front in the region that includes Israel.
He also noted that the United States is trying in vain to tell Israel that there is a strategic idea collapsing due to the Israeli crimes in Gaza, revealing that before the martyrdom of Hamas Deputy Chief Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri, a strategic agreement was reached to arrange the Palestinian internal front.
Elsewhere, the Palestinian official hailed the Resistance for its serious effort in confronting the Israeli occupation and the US project in the region.

DAMASCUS, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Saturday's Israeli missile attack on Iran's targets in the Syrian capital of Damascus has risen to 13, according to a war monitor on Sunday.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that among the 13 casualties were five Iranians, three of whom held commanding roles in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), four Syrians contracted with Iranian militias, two Lebanese individuals, one Iraqi national, and one Syrian civilian worker.
The Israeli missiles on Saturday struck the affluent Mazzeh Western Villas neighborhood, specifically targeting a residential building where a meeting of IRGC commanders was reportedly taking place.
On Saturday, the Syrian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the Israeli attack, and called on the international community to take immediate action to halt such ""atrocities."""

Question: What would be your comment regarding the statement released by the Government of Germany on its intention to take a stand against the Republic of South Africa which has instituted proceedings at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of perpetrating genocide against the Arab population in Gaza Strip?
Maria Zakharova: We were not surprised by the German Government's decision to oppose the Republic of South Africa which has filed a case with the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of subjecting people in Gaza to genocide. This move was predicated on the unfettered support Berlin has always lent to Israel while dismissing any possible consequences. Germany has been asserting its unwavering commitment to this policy for quite a long time as one of the main unspoken tenets of the so-called rules-based order as defined by Washington.
By acting this way, German political elites seem to have caused Israel more harm than good. In the corresponding Government statement, Berlin used language which reads: ""in view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah"" - thereby positioning itself as an expert in committing mass atrocities and exterminating people.
What about the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Germany against other nations, ethnic groups and peoples during World War II?
It seems that Germany has once again forgotten that under UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/60/7 and several other international instruments, the Holocaust is defined as the persecution and mass extermination of people representing various ethnic and social groups by the Nazis. There is also the OSCE's Berlin Declaration setting forth the need to promote the importance of respecting all ethnic and religious groups without any distinction.
There have been many historical precedents of criminals perpetrating serious crimes but then mending their ways and using their knowledge about their unlawful practices to prevent similar wrongdoing from happening again. However, this always required effective regret and repentance and an unconditional recognition of one's guilt without making even the slightest attempt to justify one's crimes, let alone repeat them.
We can see that Germany has chosen a different path in dealing with its past. Just like 80 years ago, Berlin has once again opted for dividing people on ethnic grounds, albeit on a new, more sophisticated level.
Let me give you several examples. Berlin has persistently refused to pay compensation to people of non-Jewish background who lived in Leningrad during the siege. It believes that Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Finno-Ugric people, Armenians, Georgians, Moldovans and many others are not entitled to receive money from the German Government. We spoke out publicly many times to awake the international opinion to this new kind of racial segregation, which is an outrageous fact. Leningrad suffered a tragedy with the city having to endure this terrible siege for over 800 days - we will be marking 80 years since its lifting on January 27. Together with the decisions adopted at the Wannsee Conference and the creation of death camps in Europe, it constitutes an important piece of evidence regarding the inhuman intentions nurtured by Nazi Germany and its allies. The German authorities opted for undermining Russia's efforts to prevent the rehabilitation of Nazism. Even before that, Germany regularly abstained when the UN General Assembly voted on the resolution, sponsored by Russia, on combating the glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Moreover, Germany has been voting against this resolution since 2022, which amounts to contesting its provisions on stopping the renewed effort to glorify the Nazi movement and whitewash former SS members, including from Waffen SS, who were recognised as criminals by the Nuremberg Trials.
Germany has surpassed other countries in the European Union in zealously defending the Kiev regime which has made the glorification of Nazi accomplices a key domestic and foreign policy tenet.
Berlin supports fighters holding neo-Nazi torch processions and glorifying World War II-era war criminals who have been borrowing their chevrons and stripes from SS divisions and decorating their military vehicles and gear with Wehrmacht's symbols. These people seek to kill ethnic Russians, Russian nationals and Russian speakers, but Berlin has been sponsoring and arming them, offering them medical services and backing them on the international stage.
We have been witnessing an increase in the number of statements by German officials lately questioning whether Berlin should condemn its Nazi past. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz publicly said that Germany and Ukraine's neo-Nazi regime were ""on the right side of history,"" which de facto amounted to exonerating Vladimir Zelensky's human-hating regime in its current iteration as it seeks to reincarnate World War II-era Nazi accomplices and erase the memory of those who fought against fascism. Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock proudly spoke about her forefathers falling during the siege of Konigsberg. This is the way the German ruling elite understands what it means to be on the right side of history these days.
Berlin persists in its refusal to recognise Nazi crimes against our people as genocide. Russian investigative bodies and courts have compiled a wide body of evidence exposing war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the Third Reich troops across various regions of our country.
On July 25, 2022, the Krasnodar Territorial Court ruled that Nazi invaders perpetrated an act of genocide in the occupied portions of the Krasnodar Territory between July 1942 and August 1943. During that period, Germans and the occupying powers, as well as their accomplices, intentionally carried out the mass extermination of over 48,000 civilians, including 9,000 children, who were either shot, tortured to death, hanged, poisoned by gas or burnt alive, or killed using a network of concentration camps in Kuban.
On October 10, 2022, the Leningrad Regional Court recognised crimes perpetrated by Nazi invaders within the region during the Great Patriotic War as genocide. The court ruled that between 1941 and 1944, the German occupying force intentionally exterminated over 33,000 civilians.
On October 20, 2022, the St Petersburg City Court issued an opinion recognising the siege of Leningrad as an act of genocide against the Soviet people. The hearings held by this court established that at least 1,093,842 people died during the siege.
It must be recalled that only 14 million Slaves were to remain on the former territory of the USSR conquered and populated by Germany under Generalplan Ost - Master Plan for the East drafted under the Reich Fuhrer Heinrich Himmler's supervision. Its provisions can be found in Doctor Erhard Wetzel's document titled Observations and Proposals regarding Generalplan Ost, dated April 27, 1942. Under the plan, these Slaves were to be controlled by 4.5 million Germans, while those viewed as undesirable in racial terms among locals were to be sent to Western Siberia. The deportation proposal revolved around the number of 31 million people slated for resettlement. It provided for weakening the Russian nation in ethnic and biological terms by undertaking a series of actions to reduce the birth rate.
We believe that these and other similar and multiple examples constitute a sufficient body of evidence for Germany to officially recognise as genocide the crimes committed by the third Reich against our country.
All this leads to the conclusion that in the context of the ongoing proceedings at the International Court of Justice, Berlin decided to single out the Holocaust issue by setting it apart from all other aspects of its guilty historical acts against humanity. Moreover, it refuses to view it in a holistic manner. Instead, Berlin adjusts its perspective as it deems fit to suit its momentary considerations.
As for the Middle East, the Olaf Scholz Government could have refrained from taking this initiative, considering not only domestic politics, but also the outrage the collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza has been causing around the world, especially in the countries of the Global South. We have already heard officials condemn this flawed approach at the highest level. President of Namibia Hage Geingob called on Germany not to take any actions on this extremely sensitive issue, since Germany itself has yet to undo the damage caused by the crimes against humanity it perpetrated in Africa. This refers to what happened in 1904-1908 when the German South West African administration exterminated tens of thousands of people belonging to Herero and Nama ethnic groups. Namibia views these events as an act of genocide against its indigenous people.
It is shocking and appalling that the German authorities do not see any cause for remorse in connection with the main crimes perpetrated by the Third Reich on a massive scale, including the killing of 27 million citizens of the USSR. On the contrary, Berlin has once again mired itself in exterminating people in a part of Europe where 80 years ago Hitler failed in his effort to exterminate or subdue people.
This raises the question of whether Germany was sincere in its repentance before and whether its de-Nazification was effective.
We believe the behaviour by Germany's current administration to be unacceptable, unlawful and immoral. That said, the ongoing revival of German militarism and the fact that it approves of neo-Nazi practices constitutes the most alarming trend. Considering Germany's conflicting historical track record, this trend can have an extremely grave impact on the future of Germany, as well as Europe and the entire world."

A Belgian minister has pledged her country's backing for the case filed by South Africa with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking to halt Israel's genocidal campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Caroline Gennez, Belgium's minister of development cooperation, made the call in a series of social media posts over the weekend.
""If the International Court of Justice calls on #Israel to cease its military campaign in #Gaza, our country will fully support it."" she said in a post on X on Sunday.
She noted that Belgium's position was a ""step in the right direction.""
""Our country is taking its responsibility, for human rights and humanitarian law. Meanwhile, I remain committed at all levels to making full humanitarian access to #Gaza a reality as soon as possible.""
Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Petra De Sutter ""also recently made a similar call and said her country could not remain silent against Israel's threat of genocide in Gaza and urged support for the lawsuit filed by South Africa.""
""Belgium cannot just watch from the sidelines the endless suffering of the people in Gaza. We must act against the threat of genocide.
""I want Belgium to follow South Africa's lead and take action at the International Court of Justice. I will make this proposal to the Belgian government.""
South Africa filed the lawsuit against Israel at the end of December, after nearly three months of Israeli aggression against Palestinians in Gaza.
The lawsuit said Israel's actions are ""genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.""
The application also said Israeli attacks breach the UN's Genocide Convention, and urged the court to ""order Israel to cease killing and causing serious mental and bodily harm to Palestinian people in Gaza.""
South Africa has been one of the outspoken critics of Israeli's ongoing onslaught against Palestinians and has led some initiatives to hold Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza.
In November, the country referred Israel to the International Criminal Court, which is already investigating the occupied Palestinian territories.
In the same month, the country's lawmakers voted in favor of closing down the Israeli embassy in Pretoria and suspending all diplomatic relations until the onslaught stops.
More countries have joined South Africa in a case filed against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the regime's genocidal war on the besieged Gaza Strip.
Israel waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after Palestinian resistance groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm into the occupied territories in response to the occupying regime's intensified crimes against the Palestinian people.
On the 107th day of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, the death toll rises to more than 25,000, predominantly comprising women and children."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - Russian Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov, in an interview with CBS, said that the US must stop its hostilities and stop vetoing UN ceasefire resolutions in order resolve the crisis in the Middle East, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
""Stop the fighting. Don't use veto when a resolution is proposed to declare humanitarian ceasefire. You used vetoes twice. There is no reaction from the Security Council as regards to demand a ceasefire. And of course, don't drag on like your predecessors did for decades on creating the Palestinian state,"" Lavrov said.
During the interview, Sergey Lavrov weighed in on the latest violent spiral of the Palestine-Israel conflict, saying that more and more cruelty will occur in the Arab and Muslim world until a Palestinian state is created.
On October 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages.
The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, when the Palestine-Israel conflict escalated, has increased to 25,105, while more than 62,600 others have been injured, the enclave's health ministry said on Sunday.

Russia on Wednesday accused Ukraine of shooting down a military transport plane that Moscow said was carrying 74 people, including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were set to be swapped for Russians held by Kyiv.
Ukrainian officials did not immediately confirm or deny the Russian claim but said they were investigating the crash of the Il-76 transport. Russia said a crew of six and three prisoner escorts were also on board.
""We currently do not have reliable or comprehensive information on who was on board the plane or in what number,"" Ukraine's main intelligence directorate said in a statement.
Video of the crash posted on social media showed a plane falling from the sky on its side before crashing into a massive fireball as it hit the ground in Russia's snowy, rural, western Belgorod region.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is in New York this week for meetings at the United Nations. He accused Ukraine of carrying out a ""terrorist attack.""
""The Ukrainian prisoners of war were transported to the Belgorod region in order to conduct yet another swap that was agreed between Moscow and Kyiv,"" Lavrov told reporters. ""Instead of this, the Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region, it targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike.""
Kharkiv borders Belgorod, which is Russian territory. The two sides have carried out numerous prisoner swaps during their nearly 2-year war.
Lavrov said Moscow had requested an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting for Wednesday afternoon. It has been scheduled for Thursday, as there is already a council meeting planned for Wednesday.
Russia's defense ministry put out a similar statement that was not backed up with any evidence.
Firefighters, ambulances and police rushed to the site of the crash in the Korochansky district of Belgorod, the state news agency Tass reported, citing a local emergency services official.
Two news agencies, The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse, said they could not independently verify the Russian claims that Ukraine shot down the aircraft.
Russia also reported destroying a Ukrainian drone over the Belgorod region earlier Wednesday, in addition to intercepting four drones over the Oryol region in western Russia.
Russian forces carried out a massive missile attack Tuesday on Ukraine, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said killed at least 18 people.
The worst-hit areas were the capital, Kyiv, and the northeastern city of Kharkiv.
Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Tuesday that more than 130 people were injured, and that the attack damaged 139 homes.
He said the Russian attack utilized 40 missiles, calling the barrage ""another combined attack attempting to bypass our air defense system.""
Ukraine's air force said it shot down about half of the missiles.

Senior officials from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and European Union gathered in Riyadh for the first GCC-EU Regional Security Dialogue on 24 January.
The main sessions focused on regional security and developments, as well as specific areas for increased cooperation between the GCC and the EU.
The security dialogue allowed for comprehensive, open and constructive discussions on regional security. Both sides exchanged views on the situation in the Middle East, Yemen, the Red Sea, Iraq, Iran, the Sahel, Somalia, and Ukraine.
Participants discussed opportunities for increased cooperation on counter-terrorism, maritime security, cyber issues, non-proliferation, as well as disaster preparedness and emergency management.
The meeting was a key deliverable of the 27th GCC-EU Joint Council and Ministerial meeting, when Ministers agreed to step up their cooperation.
The meeting was co-chaired by Presidency of the GCC representative Ambassador Dr. Khalid Fahad al Khater, Policy Planning Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar, Dr. Abdelaziz Aluwaisheg, GCC Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Negotiations, and Charles Fries, Deputy Secretary-General for Peace, Security and Defence, of the European External Action Service.

Meanwhile, in New York, the Security Council met once again to discuss the war stemming from Russia's invasion that will mark its bloody two-year anniversary next month.
At least 27 civilians were reportedly killed and a further 25 injured in the Donetsk attacks that struck local markets and a nearby residential area in the city, according to media reports.
OHCHR is trying to obtain more information about the attack, despite its lack of access to the city and other occupied areas in Ukraine, spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement on Monday.
""It is crucial that thorough, prompt and independent investigations be carried out to determine the facts and responsibility for this attack,"" she said.
""The investigation should establish whether this attack violated applicable law on the conduct of hostilities, with a view to ensuring accountability.""
Ms. Shamdasani also stressed the need to ensure strict respect for international humanitarian law and for the parties to the conflict to take all necessary precautions to protect civilians from harm.
'Unambiguous obligation'
Addressing the Security Council on Monday morning in New York, Adedeji Ebo, Deputy UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, reiterated the ""duty"" of warring sides to protect civilians.
""This is an unambiguous obligation,"" he said, briefing ambassadors.
""Let me say it again: attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international law. All such attacks must stop immediately.""
As of Sunday, OHCHR has verified 10,287 civilians killed and a further 19,444 injured since Russia's full-scale invasion began on 24 February 2022. The actual figures are likely far higher.
Prevent further escalation
Mr. Ebo said continued attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure were seriously distressing, adding that the use of aerial drones and missiles had resulted in many deaths and injuries.
""Just like any other weapons or weapons systems, armed uncrewed aerial vehicles and missiles must not be used in a manner inconsistent with international humanitarian law,"" he said.
He reiterated the UN Secretary-General's call on all States to help to prevent further escalation and bring about sustainable peace.
""The only way to end the suffering and devastation is by ending this war,"" Mr. Ebo said.
Council meeting a distraction: Ukraine
Ahead of the meeting, Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukrainian Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN, criticized Russia for calling for ""yet another UN Security Council meeting to criticize lawful arms transfers to Ukraine that are done in support of Ukraine's inherent right of self-defence"".
""This meeting today is another attempt by the Russian Federation to distract from its war of aggression against Ukraine and its intensified campaign of systematic air strikes killing civilians and destroying critical infrastructure,"" he said at a press stakeout, standing alongside dozens of ambassadors and representatives of other nations and the European Union.
Western support impedes peace: Russia
At the Security Council, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that ""the absolute majority of unbiased experts"" see clearly that the key factor impeding the peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis ""is the continued support on the part of the west to the regime in Kyiv"".
This is ""despite the fact that it is obviously in agony, and it is incapable of attaining the goal set to it, namely to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia,"" he said.
He added that the reality is that ""despite the complete failure"" of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the battlefield, ""western patrons of the Kyiv regime"" continue to push them towards a senseless military confrontation.
Grim humanitarian situation
The war continues to inflict ""immeasurable human suffering"" and is putting millions at risk of serious violations and generating grave humanitarian needs, according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Millions across Ukraine have been forced from their homes, including nearly six million living as refugees outside its borders.
Prolonged displacement has pushed many to the brink.
In 2024, 14.6 million people - about 40 per cent of the Ukrainian population - require humanitarian assistance.
UN agencies and partners aim to reach 8.5 million people with aid, focusing on the most severe needs and prioritizing communities on the frontline and in neighbouring areas.
Children rights
Meanwhile in Geneva, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, a body of 18 independent experts monitoring implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by its States parties, is discussing the treatment and conditions facing children in Russia, including the fate of Ukrainian children allegedly deported to Russia during the course of the conflict.
On Monday and Tuesday, the Committee will hold discussions with government representatives as well as review reports and submissions made by Russia and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
Alongside Russia, the Committee will also review the situations in the Congo, Bulgaria, Senegal, Lithuania and South Africa at its ongoing session, which concludes next week."

The United States and the United Kingdom have carried out a new round of military strikes across Yemen as Yemeni forces continue retaliatory attacks in the Red Sea on Israeli-owned ships or merchant vessels destined to the occupied territories over unrelenting Israeli onslaught against the Gaza Strip.
On Monday, US and British forces launched strikes at eight different locations in Yemen, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, according to a joint statement signed by the six countries.
A senior US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said roughly 25 to 30 munitions were fired, including from warplanes launched from a US aircraft carrier.
So far, eight rounds of strikes over the past month have failed to stop attacks by Yemeni Armed Forces against shipping linked to the Israeli regime.
US officials allege the strikes have degraded the ability of Yemeni forces to carry out complex attacks. However, they have declined to offer any specific figures as to the number of missiles, radar, drones or other military capabilities destroyed so far.
'US, UK strikes cannot stop attacks on Israel-bound ships'
Senior officials from Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement have strongly condemned the latest US and UK strikes against the Arab country, stressing that such assaults will not deter Yemeni Armed Forces from pressing ahead with their operations against ships bound to Israeli ports.
Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of Ansarullah's political bureau, stated that, ""We will continue our military operations against the Zionist enemy no matter how aggressively they might bombard Yemen.""
""Our strikes will go on as long [Israeli] atrocities and genocide in Gaza persist,"" he noted.
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a senior member of the Yemeni Supreme Political Council, also said the United States and the United Kingdom cannot stop Yemeni forces launching maritime operations in Red Sea against Israeli interests.
""The latest US-British strikes are aimed at discouraging Yemen from supporting Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Americans and Britons should realize that we are retaliating, and that the world 'surrender' does not exist in our lexicon,"" Houthi asserted.
US military cargo ship targeted in Gulf of Aden
The latest US and UK strikes came after the spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces said the country's naval units had struck an American military cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden with several missiles.
Brigadier General Yahya Saree said in a statement that the attack successfully targeted OCEAN Jazz, describing the strike as a victory for the oppressed Palestinian nation and a proportionate response to the American-British aggression against Yemen.
The statement reiterated that Yemeni forces will continue to block Israeli ships or vessels heading to the ports in the occupied Palestinian lands until the Tel Aviv regime's aggression stops and the siege on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is lifted.
Saree emphasized that Yemeni Armed Forces will take all defensive and offensive measures within the right of self-dense and in solidarity with Palestinians as Israel strikes Gaza.
He noted that Yemeni Armed Forces will continue to respond to any American or British act of aggression against their homeland, and will targets all sources of threat in the Red Sea and the Arab Sea.
Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched a devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after the territory's Palestinian resistance movements carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The relentless Israeli military campaign against Gaza has killed at least 24,620 people, most of them women and children. Another 61,830 individuals have been wounded.
Reports revealed that Israeli shipping companies have already decided to reroute their vessels in fear of attacks by Yemeni forces.
Yemeni forces have also launched missile and drone attacks on targets in the Israeli-occupied territories after the regime's aggression on Gaza."

Excellencies,  Dear Colleagues,  Dear Friends,
Thank you for coming together here at the United Nations Headquarters.
Now this building, and our organization, represent humanity's highest ideals.
Peace, dialogue, development, human rights and collaboration.
Terrorism represents the polar opposite of these ideals.
No one is immune from this global threat.
Today's meeting focuses on a clear and present danger to a continent â but also to our world.
In just a few short years, Africa has become a global epicentre of terrorism.
This growing inferno is engulfing millions of Africans.
This includes women and girls, who are deeply vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence.
Across the continent, Da'esh, Al-Qaida and their affiliates are exploiting local conflict dynamics and fragilities to advance their agendas, while shredding the social fabric of entire countries with the blades of violence, mistrust and fear.
In Somalia, Al-Shabaab is under pressure, but far from defeated.
In the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, terrorists continue targeting civilians, while expanding their areas of operation.
Terrorism remains an active threat in northern Mozambique.
Across the Sahel, the increased hostilities between terrorist groups fighting for control over territory and trafficking are creating nothing short of a hell on earth for the innocent people caught in between.
And the threat is rapidly spreading to coastal countries, as seen in Benin and Togo.
A disturbing pattern is clear.
Community by community, terrorist groups are extending their reach.
Growing their continental networks with more fighters, funding, and weapons.
Forging ties with transnational organized crime groups.
And spreading fear, misery and hateful ideologies through cyberspace.
In every case, civilians are paying the highest price.
But in the end, all of humanity pays.
Each terrorist threat, each violent, extremist attack undermines our shared efforts to build and maintain peace, development and stability in Africa.
Terrorism is an all-out assault on civilization itself.
Excellencies, Dear Friends,
We need to fight this inferno now, before it spins out of control.
Across Africa, we see a number of positive examples of Member States and sub-regional organizations stepping up to counter terrorism and violent extremism.
This includes the Lake Chad Basin's Multinational Task Force to counter Boko Haram.
It includes the African Union's Transition Mission in Somalia.
And it includes the efforts of the Southern African Development Community and Rwanda to tackle terrorism in northern Mozambique.
We ourselves are working closely with the African Union, ECOWAS and others on prevention, legal assistance, investigations, prosecutions, reintegration and rehabilitation, and human rights protection â including our support for countries as they implement the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.
We are also helping to support the victims and survivors of terrorism so that they and their families heal from all they've endured.
Another sign of important progress is the unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2719 on the financing of African Union-led peace support operations.
From the very start of my mandate, I have repeatedly called for a new generation of peace [support] operations â including peace enforcement and counter-terrorism operations â led by regional partners, notably the African Union, with a Security Council mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, supported by guaranteed funding, including through UN assessed contributions.
African-Union-led peace support operations authorized by the Security Council will now have access to funding from UN assessed contributions not exceeding 75 per cent of their annual budgets â with the remaining amount to be jointly mobilized from the international community as extra-budgetary resources, with all viable options considered in the event of significant shortfalls in resource mobilization.
So, Excellencies, Dear Friends,
These are all important steps.
But we need urgent action, on a much larger scale [than] we've seen to date.
I want to highlight two essential anchors of our approach in our fight against terrorism and violent extremism.
First â our efforts must be anchored in sustainable, inclusive development.
Terrorism finds its home in fragility and instability.
Isolation, inequalities, limited access to school, lack of job opportunities, eroding trust in government, institutions and the rule of law, human rights abuses and perceptions of impunity â together, these conditions are conducive to the spread of terrorism.
We need to end this vicious cycle.
The New Agenda for Peace puts a new emphasis on prevention.
It connects the dots between investing in development, building strong governance structures and justice systems that people can trust, and creating sustainable peace.
And second â our efforts must be anchored in human rights.
Terrorism represents a denial of human rights.
We cannot fight it by repeating the same denial.
Too often, counter-terrorism measures are misused or have unintended outcomes when put into practice, and lead to human rights abuses.
This is a recipe for resentment, deep grievances, and further death and destruction.
Our collective response to terrorism must be grounded in the principles that define our shared humanity â respect for human rights, the rule of law, and the pursuit of peace.
And it must be grounded in strategies that reflect marginalized and vulnerable communities.
For example, women and girls are often the first â and worst â affected by terrorism.
Despite differences in ideology, many terrorist groups have one strategy in common: the patriarchal subjugation of women and girls, and outrageous acts of violence against them.
From the Chibok girls of Nigeria, to the Yezidi women and girls of Iraq, recent years have seen horrifying examples of sexual abuse and violence, and even outright slavery â including women sold to finance terrorist activity.
We must focus our counter-terrorism priorities and strategies on this important issue, which cuts to the heart of our commitment to the human rights of all people, including the safety and freedom of women and girls.
Excellencies, Dear Friends,
Africa, to me, is the home of hope â a continent bursting with potential, ready to take on the challenges of the 21st century.
But this potential can only be realized by vanquishing the shadow of terrorism that is rapidly spreading across the continent.
We do not have a moment to lose.
For Africa, for Africans, and for the world we share â let's continue standing together and forging new solutions to lift this shadow, once and for all.
Thank you."

As the birthplace of Lord Buddha, we are   currently in the country of spirituality and serenity, and as a   prominent advocate for peace and dialogue in the region. This regional   meeting, following the visit of the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres,   underscores Nepal's pivotal role in promoting peace and disarmament in   the Asia-Pacific region.
Let me take this opportunity to commend the UNRCPD for its remarkable   efforts in bringing together delegates from 23 countries across the   Asia-Pacific region to this historic city of Kathmandu.
The Asia-Pacific region, like others, faces threats from small arms   and light weapons, evident in situations such as Afghanistan and   Myanmar. This proliferation contributes to armed violence, illicit arms   trafficking, displacement, and statelessness, with severe humanitarian   and socioeconomic consequences, undermining international laws and the   rule of law.
In the recent Small Arms and Light Weapons report, the   Secretary-General emphasized the ongoing global challenges posed by the   misuse and illicit transfer of these weapons, jeopardizing peace and   security. The escalation of armed conflicts has resulted in a tragic   surge in civilian casualties, with a 53% increase in deaths from 2021 to   2022. It is imperative that we unite to stop innocent civilians from   bearing the brunt of armed conflicts.
The Secretary-General highlighted a concerning record high in global   military expenditures, reaching $2.24 trillion in 2022. In addressing   this, both legal and political instruments, like the UN Programme of   Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons and its International Tracing   Instrument (ITI), are essential frameworks to promote peace, security,   socioeconomic development, and the protection of fundamental human   rights.
Since the adoption of the Programme of Action in 2001, there has been   a growing alignment among global agendas on sustainable development,   gender equality, arms control, and disarmament.
While these frameworks guide us towards collective peace, stability,   equality, prosperity, and security, their implementation has faced   challenges due to capacity and resource issues. Achieving these goals   requires collaborative efforts at national, regional, and global levels,   making this regional meeting crucial.
As the Resident Coordinator in Nepal, I pledge my full support to the   government in implementing the Programme of Action on Small Arms and   Light Weapons. I am committed to guiding the UN to support the   government in establishing synergies between the PoA and other crucial   agendas, including Women, Peace, and Security, and the Sustainable   Development Goals.
Before I finish, I would like to leave you 3 actions to keep in mind as you go into the sessions in the next three days:
Collaborative efforts between small arms control and sustainable   development communities are vital for interventions fostering   sustainable peace and development.
Embrace a holistic approach across sustainable development, gender   equality, and arms control agendas, extending synergies to reporting   mechanisms.
Your active participation in this regional meeting will shape global   discussions in New York during the Fourth Review Conference. Share   experiences and insights to contribute to replicable models for global   peace and security.
I would like to extend my gratitude to each of you for your   commitment to this important cause. Let us work together to forge a path   towards lasting peace, security, and development for the Asia-Pacific   region and beyond.
Thank you.

Tehran, IRNA -- The spokesman for the Armed Forces of Yemen Brigadier General Yahya Saree has said that a joint US-UK aggression on the country that took place in the early hours of Tuesday will not go unanswered.
These American and British aggressions will not go unanswered and unpunished, Saree said on Tuesday, adding that the US and the UK had carried out 18 attacks against Sana'a, Al Hudaydah, Taiz, and Al Bayda'.
The United States, UK, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Bahrain in a joint statement announced that they had targeted eight military bases of the Ansarullah movement in Yemen.
The statement claimed that these attacks were carried out against the missile and air defense systems of the Yemeni army.
Meanwhile, senior Yemeni official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi has on Tuesday said that the latest US and UK attacks on the country will not deter the Yemenis from supporting Gaza.
He said that Yemen's naval operations in the Red Sea are aimed at preventing the massacre of the people of Gaza and their siege, adding that the Americans are bombing the people of Yemen to protect the ""criminal terrorist enemy of Israel"".
The US and UK should understand that we are ready to respond and that our people do not know the term surrender, he stressed.

UNRWA IS ABLE PROVIDE HYGIENE KITS, INCLUDING SANITARY NAPKINS, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), BUT MORE DELIVERY OF CARE TO WOMEN AND GIRLS IS URGENTLY NEEDED
Women and girls are among the most vulnerable groups in any society. Their vulnerability is typically amplified in times of crisis, such as the displacement of Gaza's population because of the war. Nearly 1 million women and girls have been displaced, and more than 17,000 women and children have been killed since the war began in October.
Shelters for internally displaced people (IDPs) are unbearably overcrowded with little or no privacy, especially for women and girls. The shelter at the UNRWA Khan Younis Training Center (KYTC), for example, is one of the largest shelters in southern Gaza with 40,000 IDPs and 140 births recorded since the war began. In Rafah, meanwhile, overcrowding means that over 480 people share a single toilet.
UNRWA Director of Communications, Juliette Touma, reported that while in Gaza the past week ""many women told me that they don't eat and drink not only because there is not enough to go around, but also to limit the time they have to spend going to use the filthy and unsanitary restroom facilities.""
Maysa, an Associate Protection Officer from the UNRWA Protection Team at the KYTC, confirms that the team receives numerous requests from displaced women for sanitary pads. ""The shortage and scarcity of these supplies in the local market has a psychological and physical impact on women,"" she says. A young mother there underscored that, explaining that attempts to use home-made, makeshift alternatives to sanitary pads negatively impact her health and well-being. She adds that she faces significant embarrassment within her family and the displaced community is significant.
Overall, in Gaza there are over 690,000 menstruating women and adolescent girls who require menstrual hygiene products, in addition to access to clean water, toilets and privacy. Unfortunately, UNRWA cannot meet the high demand for hygiene kits as stocks have either totally run out or are at critically low levels. This scarcity puts women and girls at risk of reproductive and urinary tract infections and protection-related risks.
The closure of most stores and pharmacies in Khan Younis has exacerbated this situation. Dr. Nisreen, who works at the UNRWA health centre serving the KYTC shelter, confirms that the hygiene kits distributed to women at the shelter do not include sufficient sanitary pads. ""The scarcity of this product in the markets has led to increased prices, making it difficult for displaced individuals to afford them,"" she says.
To date, UNRWA has distributed over 80,000 family hygiene kits to IDPs in Gaza since the start of the war. The Agency will be able to provide more of the same with support from the EU, which has contributed a total of EUR 14 million to date for internally displaced persons for the provision of shelter support items, including supplies such as hygiene kits. Unfortunately, much more will be needed to alleviate the catastrophic humanitarian situation, which is particularly acute among vulnerable women and girls. Delivering humanitarian aid continues to face near insurmountable challenges, including constant bombardment and access restrictions. The level of life-saving humanitarian assistance entering the Gaza Strip is minimal and far below what the civilian population needs to survive."

Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has said the kingdom will not normalize relations with Israel without a credible pathway to a Palestinian state.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan made the remarks in an interview with CNN late Sunday.
""We need stability, and stability will only come through resolving the Palestinian issue,"" the foreign minister said.
""That's the only way we're going to get the benefit.""
Elsewhere in his remarks, the minister said the centerpiece of Saudi Arabia's agenda is the de-escalation of the conflict in Gaza and halting civilian casualties.
""What we are seeing is the Israelis are crushing Gaza, the civilian population of Gaza,"" he said. ""This is completely unnecessary, completely unacceptable and has to stop.""
Prince Faisal made a similar statement in the recent past when he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Palestinian statehood. The head of the regime is talking of plans for open-ended military control over Gaza.
In October 2023, there were reports that Saudi Arabia had reconsidered its foreign policy priorities in the wake of Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza by postponing a US-brokered normalization deal with the regime.
Israeli and Saudi authorities had earlier been claiming they were moving steadily towards such a deal. But the Israeli aggression proved otherwise.
Washington, Israel's great benefactor, has also been casting its veto against the United Nations Security Council resolutions that call on the regime to cease hostilities.
The United States remains unwilling to draw any red lines for Israel, which has killed more than 25,000 people in Gaza since early October."

Washington, secessionists the real troublemakers to undermine peace: experts
By Yang Sheng and Liu Xuanzun Published: Jan 23, 2024 08:07 PM Updated: Jan 23, 2024 10:00 PM
A US think tank released a report on Tuesday claiming that the ""majority of experts"" from the US and the island of Taiwan said they believe ""a crisis in the Taiwan Straits is likely in 2024,"" with a ""blockade"" or ""quarantine"" of the island by the Chinese mainland seen as the most likely scenario, while analysts from the mainland said this is an old trick of the US to hype regional tensions to spread fear in the region to serve its hegemonic interests.
A new survey from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) covering ""87 experts from the US and the island of Taiwan on cross-Strait relations"" said that most of these experts said China has the ""capabilities to execute a law enforcement led-quarantine [or] a People's Liberation Army (PLA)-led blockade of Taiwan,"" but fewer believed a ""forceful invasion"" was possible.
Aside from the CSIS survey, the US is taking concrete actions to add tensions to the region. After the Taiwan regional election which concluded on January 13, there have not been military tensions around the region so far, but the US is planning to send a bipartisan congress delegation to encourage secessionists on the island, and US aircraft carriers are also approaching the region, according to the US Naval Institute.
These expose a hard fact that, when accusing China of ""creating tensions"" in the region, Washington and secessionists on the island are the real troublemakers that are taking concrete actions to undermine regional peace and stability, said analysts, stressing that the US and its puppets on the island should not underestimate the determination and strength of the Chinese military forces.
Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""The US needs tensions and fears among the region to force its allies in the region to stand closer with it and push other countries to take sides and rely on the US. This kind of trick has already ruined peace in Europe due to the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, and Washington wants to copy this in Asia. The Taiwan Straits is its target.""
According to the CSIS survey, 68 percent of US experts said a Taiwan Straits crisis was ""likely"" or ""very likely"" in 2024, compared to 58 percent of experts from Taiwan island.
Li said the US is trying to hype an intensifying atmosphere around China, to make regional countries believe that China is going to take a massive action that will heavily impact everyone. However, China has not done anything yet, and even if China takes action, it will have been provoked by US military activities and Washington's politicians' encouragement of the Taiwan secessionist authorities. ""This is the truth that we need to let the world understand clearly,"" Li said.
The root cause of tension around the Taiwan Straits is US interference in China's domestic affairs, and without meddling from the US, the Taiwan question, the powder keg the US set in front of China, would have been long defused in past decades whether militarily or peacefully, Li noted. ""China will shake off this time-bomb sooner or later.""
On Monday, USNI News, the news website of the US Naval Institute, reported that the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier is now in the 7th Fleet area of operations as of last weekend.
It means that there are three US aircraft carriers operating in the Asia-Pacific region, with the other two being the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan, according to a graphic released by USNI News on Monday which is tracking the US Navy's deployed aircraft carrier strike groups.
US aircraft carrier deployments show that the US' strategic focus remains on the Asia-Pacific region, prioritizing major power competition and the ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" over conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
The PLA Navy recently organized some of its most powerful amphibious warships in a combat exercise.
According to a China Central Television (CCTV) report on Monday, the Type 071 amphibious landing ships Wuzhishan and Changbaishan joined up with a Type 075 amphibious assault ship in a multi-course drill.
The drill practiced live-fire anti-air and anti-sea shooting, which analysts said is important in self-defense in an amphibious landing mission.
Experts said that the Type 071 focuses more on horizontal landing by carrying air cushioned hovercraft and amphibious armored vehicles, while the Type 075 focuses more on vertical landing by carrying more helicopters.
The combination of the Type 075 amphibious assault ship and the Type 071 amphibious landing ship have strong island-seizing capability, and they can join forces with aircraft carrier groups as well as other warships and warplanes to form tremendous joint combat capabilities in an island-seizing mission, Song said.
Such a combination can play important roles on the island of Taiwan, the Dongsha Islands and the Penghu Islands if the need arises in the future, Song said.
Since August 2022, the PLA has organized three major island blockade exercises around the island of Taiwan as countermeasures to US-Taiwan collusion, and displayed its capability in conducting precision strikes to paralyze key military installations on the island of Taiwan, seizing air superiority and control of the sea, as well as stopping ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists from escaping and external military forces from interfering. All foundations have been established for the following landing missions, analysts said.
The best scenario for both the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan is peaceful reunification, but if ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and external interference forces deny that prospect, the PLA is always prepared to fulfill its sacred duty of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and achieve the eventual national reunification, experts said."

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said EU foreign ministers agreed during a meeting in Brussels on January 22 that now is not the time to reduce aid to Ukraine.
""On the contrary, we need to do more and faster...regarding financial resources, military equipment, military training, and all of Ukraine's defense needs. We will continue to work on the projected aid,"" Borrell told a news conference after the meeting.
He also announced plans to visit Ukraine in the second week of February but did not specify the date of his trip or with whom he plans to meet.
The agenda of the EU's 27 foreign ministers' first meeting of the year included the battles in Ukraine and the Middle East.
Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion remains a priority for the European Union, Borrell said before the meeting, adding that conflicts in the Middle East will not distract the bloc.
Ukraine ""is the first item on the agenda,"" Borrell told reporters ahead of the meeting. ""The fact that we are engaged in looking for a solution in the Middle East does not mean that we are not continuing supporting Ukraine.""
Ukraine is counting on quick steps in the first half of 2024 regarding the opening of negotiations on its bid to join the EU, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. He also called on the bloc to increase the supply of weapons and approve a long-term support program for Kyiv .
The war between Israel and Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the EU, has been a focus for Brussels since the conflict broke out after Hamas extremists launched a cross-border attack on October 7, killing just over 1,100 Israelis, mainly civilians.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki were scheduled to make separate appearances at the EU meeting on January 22.
While the EU says Ukraine is a priority, some members have made statements in recent months questioning whether such staunch support should continue.
Ahead of the meeting in Belgium, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticized the ""pro-war party in Brussels"" for seeking to supply $5 billion in military aid to Ukraine.
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on January 22 that he will tell his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv later this week that his country plans to veto Ukraine joining NATO because its membership would mean ""nothing other than a basis for World War III.""
Slovakia, which has been a member of NATO since 2004, was long one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. But when Fico's left-wing nationalist government took power in October, the country, which shares a border with Ukraine, decided to no longer supply Kyiv with weapons.

Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoev is in Beijing to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping for a high-profile state visit intended to lay the groundwork for strong ties between the two countries.
In an article signed by Mirziyoev that appeared in Chinese state media ahead of the trip, the Uzbek leader praised China's model of economic development and said relations between the two countries are experiencing ""new historical heights"" that will allow him to use the January 23-25 trip to ""develop a new long-term agenda"" for the two countries that will last for ""decades.""
""Every time I visit China, I sincerely admire the scale of the reforms taking place here, the accomplishments, creative strength, diligence, and talent of the Chinese people who are confidently pursuing the path of modernization to realize their centuries-old dream,"" the article said.
The state visit comes following the first in-person China-Central Asia leaders' summit in May where China inked several agreements to deepen its economic and security links with the region. In Beijing, Mirziyoev is looking to build upon those deals as well as a comprehensive strategic-partnership agreement signed in 2022.
While meeting with Xi and other top-level Chinese officials, the Uzbek delegation will look to court investment and agree with their counterparts on how to bring many previously signed deals to fruition, from developing green energy projects to cooperation in science and boosting tourism between China and Uzbekistan.
""This is less about concrete outcomes and more about setting a road map for the future,"" Niva Yau, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told RFE/RL. ""China has committed to investments and projects and this high-level visit is [about] how to achieve them and to search for new areas to cooperate together.""
Evolving Ties
The visit takes place against the backdrop of several major developments that have changed the political environment at home and abroad for Uzbekistan's relationship with China.
Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has boosted China's standing as a reliable political and economic force for the countries of Central Asia as Moscow -- the region's traditional dominant partner -- has grappled with financial and geopolitical fallout from the conflict.
After a decade of infrastructure investments around the globe through Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China wants to use the project to invest in new sectors and become a more strategic lender after facing criticism for a lack of transparency in BRI loans as it now grapples with a slowing domestic economy.
Facing such headwinds, China is looking to make the BRI smaller and greener through more risk-averse loans and investments in renewables, and Yau said this could factor into the results from Mirziyoev's visit.
China, she notes, has been investing heavily in environmental and scientific research and monitoring, with several notable investments in Central Asia.
Tajikistan, which neighbors Uzbekistan to the southeast and shares a border with China, opened a Chinese observation station on Lake Sarez in 2021, reportedly for environmental research and ""international disaster reduction and prevention,"" according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
In July 2023, Chinese researchers also unveiled a new ""super"" observation post for climate and environmental monitoring in Shahritus, near the meeting point of China's borders with Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.
The stations have scientific and technological applications, but observers note the installations are part of a broad network of similar stations across BRI countries in South and Central Asia that could have dual applications for security and surveillance.
Beijing has also looked to expand the list of countries cooperating with its space program, reaching an agreement with Turkmenistan in 2023.
While traditional Chinese investments in Central Asia are still in play, such as a proposed natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to China and a railway connecting China to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, their futures are uncertain.
Yau said Beijing is looking to bring these new areas of investment and industry that it has expanded elsewhere in the world to Central Asia, and Uzbekistan, with a population of some 35 million, is an attractive partner.
One particular sector of interest is renewable energy and opening up new markets for Chinese electric vehicles.
China has been positioning itself as a market leader around the world for years and, in December, China's Henan Suda signed a deal with the Uzbek Energy Ministry to build some 50,000 charging stations for electric vehicles around the country by 2033.
""These are areas where China is becoming a global leader and it wants to bring them to Central Asia,"" Yau said.
New President, New Era
While events like the war in Ukraine have affected the relative appeal of Beijing and Moscow as partners for Central Asia, Mirziyoev's high-profile visit is the product of years of warming ties between China and Uzbekistan, says Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia-Eurasia Center in Berlin.
""This direction towards China has been Mirziyoev's priority from the beginning,"" he told RFE/RL. ""Mirziyoev is very interested in China and often quotes [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping in his speeches; and he clearly sees the country as an example for how to develop economically.""
China's experience combating top-level corruption under Xi and its efforts to lift millions out of poverty, Umarov says, have been a particular focus for the Uzbek leader since he came to power in 2016 following the death of Islam Karimov, the country's first ruler after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
""China has become a source of knowledge in a way for Mirziyoev,"" Umarov said. ""Given that Uzbekistan is a personalistic regime, how he sees China matters a lot.""
Uzbekistan followed a far more isolationist foreign policy under Karimov that was suspicious of outside influence.
China was still an important partner, with Chinese leader Hu Jintao inviting Karimov to Beijing for a visit in 2005 less than two weeks after the bloody crackdown against protesters in the northeastern Uzbek city of Andijon, though the relationship was limited. Under the hard-line Karimov regime, Chinese companies and capital in many sectors of the economy were restricted.
That changed following Karimov's death, which brought Mirziyoev to power.
As the new Uzbek president has opened up his country's economy, China has been both a reliable source of investment and a valuable ally that has helped Mirziyoev build his legitimacy at home and abroad.
As Umarov notes, China's own model of opening its economy while retaining tight political control is one that looks increasingly appealing to Mirziyoev.
""This is very relevant to him as he tries to build his own political regime based on Karimov's heritage,"" Umarov said. ""He knows that he needs to adapt to the world and learn from similar regimes about how to navigate the complex realities of today.""

Israel has killed at least 190 people in a time span of 24 hours in the southern part of the besieged Gaza Strip.
Gaza's Health Ministry confirmed the death toll in the city of Khan Younis on Monday.
Israel targeted a house adjacent to Nasser Hospital.
Video footage showed people digging graves inside the hospital complex due to the large number of casualties.
Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesman for the health ministry, said the Israeli troops were committing ""horrific crimes.""
""Dozens of martyrs and wounded are still in the targeted places and roads. The Israeli occupation prevents the movement of ambulances to retrieve the martyrs and wounded west of Khan Yunis.""
Gaza's media office says Israeli forces bombed the Al-Aqsa University shelter, the University College accommodation, the Khalidiya School shelter, the Mawasi School shelter and the Khan Younis Industry shelter. Virtually 30,000 displaced people are taking refuge in the shelters.
Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed more than 25,000 people, most of them women and children, in Gaza. It has also displaced hundreds of thousands.
Despite the destructive genocidal campaign in Gaza, Israel has failed to achieve any objectives in the onslaught."
A0TTKWZS4K_3PUNV5WHEAWUYOR,Hokanson Sees Nascent Austria-Vermont National Guard Partnership Expanding,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-arnews01.htm,"By Sgt. 1st Class Zach Sheely, National Guard BureauJanuary 24, 2024
VIENNA, Austria -- The Republic of Austria and Vermont share historical and cultural roots based on common values, economic collaboration, winter sports, mountaineering, and, more recently, security cooperation.
The National Guard's top general met with Austrian Armed Forces leaders last week and saw how the security cooperation agreement Austria and the Vermont Guard signed in 2022 under the Defense Department National Guard State Partnership Program is already expanding.
""This partnership is off to a great start and will be a model for current and future partnerships to emulate,"" Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief, National Guard Bureau, told Gen. Rudolf Striedinger, Austria's chief of defense, during a roundtable discussion with joint Austrian Armed Forces and Vermont Guard leaders.
""The future of this partnership is bright,"" he said.
In the 20 or so months since pen to paper cemented this partnership, Vermont Guardsmen have held exchanges with their Austrian counterparts focused on cyber defense, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian aid, disaster response and â of course â mountain warfare.
When Jericho, Vermont, was selected to be the home of the U.S. Army Mountain Warfare School in 1983, its leaders reached out to the Austrian army for expertise and guidance.
Fast forward to April 2023: Vermont sent 16 Guardsmen to compete in two teams in the biennial Edelweiss Raid â a grueling military mountaineering competition in the Austrian Alps. One Vermont Guard team placed in the top 10 in this competition where merely finishing is considered an achievement.
Vermont and Austrian units regularly train together in mountain tactics in both countries, trading best practices and building lasting relationships.
A few months later in June, to mark the first anniversary of the SPP signing, the Vermont Air National Guard landed U.S.-based F-35 Lightning stealth multirole fighters in Austria for the first time to fly training sorties with Austrian Eurofighter Typhoons. Air Force 1st Lt. Kelsey Flannery drew wide Austrian interest and awe as the first female F-35 pilot in the Air National Guard and a symbol of U.S. military diversity.
At that event, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Austria, lauded the SPP as a huge success based on common security interests.
Last week, she told Hokanson the partnership is beyond transactional.
""Through the State Partnership Program, we are building stronger and deeper relationships between Austria and the United States, at both government-to-government and people-to-people levels,"" Kennedy said. ""Common values and shared goals are the foundation of this strong relationship and will continue to lead to even more connections in the future.""
The State Partnership Program was established in 1993 as a way for the Defense Department to help former Soviet states emerge from behind the Iron Curtain. What started with 13 countries now features 100 partner nations paired with the National Guard of every state, territory and the District of Columbia.
The program links a state's National Guard with a partner nation's military, security forces and disaster response organizations in a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship to support combatant commands, U.S. embassies and partner nation objectives.
Hokanson called the SPP one of America's most cost-effective security cooperation tools.
Vermont is one of a few states with three SPP partner nations and looks to build on its more established partnerships with North Macedonia and Senegal in Austria.
Army Maj. Gen. Gregory Knight, Vermont's adjutant general, sees the SPP as the entry point for deeper societal collaboration beyond military-to-military engagements.
""This partnership is an opportunity for trust building at the user level, and the prospects to grow outside mil-to-mil are vast,"" he said.
Just one example: As part of the Vermont delegation visit last week, Knight and Army Brig. Gen. Tracy Poirier, director of the Vermont Guard's joint staff, signed a memorandum to endorse the creation of a student exchange program between Vermont's Norwich University and Austria's Theresan Military Academy.
Vermont and Austria are also closely tied through music. Austrian naval Capt. Georg von Trapp and his family's exploits were famously â though somewhat inaccurately â portrayed in the 1965 film, ""The Sound of Music."" One thing is certain, the Trapp family ultimately settled in Stowe, Vermont.
During the annual Austrian Officer's Ball, held at Vienna's historic Hofburg Palace, the Vermont National Guard and the United States were the guests of honor, demonstrating the value Austria places on the partnership.
The Vermont Guard's 40th Army Band joined the U.S. Army Europe and Africa Band and Chorus, the Austrian Armed Forces Guards Band Vienna and other Austrian bands to play to the more than 3,400 people gathered for the 75th anniversary of the gala under the theme: ""The Sounds of Music.""
The CNGB also toured the Langenlebarn Air Base UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter facility, where Vermont Guard maintainers will soon work with Austrian counterparts in a maintenance apprenticeship program. Like the Vermont Guard, Austria uses its rotary-wing aircraft for medical evacuation and to aid civil authorities during disaster and emergency response.
Austria enacted a permanent, constitutional neutrality in 1955 that prohibits entry into military alliances and permanent foreign military presence within Austria.
When Austria entered the SPP with Vermont, it became the first neutral European country to formally join the program. This sent a signal to other neutral nations that working with the Guard is a good fit.
Early in 2023, Norway entered the SPP, formalizing a decades-long relationship with the Minnesota Guard. Hokanson visited Switzerland last fall to explore the prospect of security cooperation exchanges with the National Guard.
""Europe has always been a close ally for us,"" Hokanson said. ""We work very closely with NATO partners and non-NATO partners and allies and friends because we all see the importance of maintaining the rules-based international order.""

Tehran, IRNA -- The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) has launched a new round of attacks on US military positions in Syria.
The IRI said in a statement late on Sunday that it had targeted a US military base in al khazra village near in Al-Omar oilfield in the suburbs of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria.
In another attack targeting US forces, the Iraqi fighters hit a military base in Ash Shaddadi area in Hasakah province in northeastern Syria.
Both attacks were carried out using drones.
The IRI includes several paramilitary groups recognized by the Iraqi government as a legitimate force in the country's fight against terrorism.
Those groups have launched almost daily attacks on US and Israeli interests in Iraq, Syria and in the Israeli-occupied territories since the Israeli regime launched its aggression on Gaza in early October.

On January 24, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with the permanent representatives of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) nations at the UN.
They exchanged views on the unprecedented escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Sergey Lavrov told the OIC delegates about the main results of his participation in the recent UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East and described in detail Russia's view of the current turbulent problems in the region.
The meeting confirmed the similarities of the positions held by Russia and the Muslim world on the problems in the Middle East, including the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The participants emphasised the need to immediately declare a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians and settle the issue through political and diplomatic channels in accordance with UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and also the Arab Peace Initiative and the Madrid Principles, including the two-state formula. This implies the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with a capital in East Jerusalem, which would co-exist in peace and security with Israel.
In the context of the humanitarian crisis on Palestinian lands and the high risk of the entire Middle East sinking into a bigger war, Sergey Lavrov emphasised the importance of consolidating the positions of the external players on Palestinian-Israeli problems. This would make it possible to stabilise the situation and create conditions for new negotiations.
In this context, it is vital to ensure Palestinian national unity under the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and prevent the administrative and geographical fragmentation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The participants noted the importance of creating an effective collective mediation mechanism with a leading role played by the Middle East countries.
The Russian initiative to hold consultations in Moscow with the region's countries and the international players who are interested in an honest dialogue is designed to develop constructive multilateral cooperation on the Palestinian-Israeli issue."

By Finnish Defence Forces and U.S. European Command Public Affairs Helsinki, Finland Jan 24, 2024
Finland is deepening its bilateral partnership with the United States in the field of cyber defense. Senior military leaders from both nations approved and signed a Letter of Intent for an advanced cyber partnership during a formal ceremony in Finland's capital city, Helsinki, Jan. 24, 2024.
The event was hosted by the Finnish Defence Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Operations, Maj. Gen. Kari Nisula. U.S. European Command's Deputy Director of Plans and Operations, U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen.  James Cleet, served as the event's senior U.S. military representative.
""Cyber threats do not respect traditional national borders and that is why you need international partners in building security,"" said Nisula. ""Cooperation with the U.S. definitely strengthens Finland's defense capability in this domain and builds a solid foundation for effective combined cyber defense. We are very satisfied with this Letter of Intent with USEUCOM.""
International cooperation is vital in the global cyber operating environment. The Finnish Defence Forces participate actively in international cooperation and exercises according to National Cyber Security Strategy and its own action plan. The cooperation is done both multilaterally and bilaterally.
The U.S. is a close bilateral partner with Finland, and today also a NATO Ally. The countries signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement in December 2023, which further deepens the partnership between their militaries, and enables cohesive cooperation in all security situations. Defense cooperation with the U.S. has already existed for decades and the two nations have also conducted planning and training in combating cyber threats together for a number of years.
The Letter of Intent is based on a shared vision to develop cyber defenses to respond to the increased threats of today's world. It facilitates cooperation in five lines of effort, namely: policy, interoperability, training, capability development and cyber operations. Consistently improving cooperation in these areas will enable further advances in the partnership between Finland and the U.S.
The two senior military leaders signing the agreement emphasized the importance of international cooperation in cyber defense against the backdrop of the prevailing security environment.
""The European theater faces increasingly aggressive near-peer competitors and a much-expanded hybrid threat environment, posing significant risks to the Alliance,"" the American general, Cleet, said. ""With our NATO Allies and partners - notably, Finland - we must be resilient and able to resist and recover from attacks in the cyberspace domain. This is necessary to prevent adversaries from degrading critical systems and networks we share and depend on."""

23.01.2024  Brussels  EEAS Press Team
Check against delivery!
I am very happy to welcome you, Minister [for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, Sameh] Shoukry here in Brussels. Tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of the entry into force of the European Union-Egypt Association Agreement.
I very much appreciate your views, your readiness to discuss frankly and openly, and our overall cooperation and friendship, dear Sameh.
We already exchanged views yesterday, at the Foreign Affairs Council, about the situation in Gaza.
We appreciate the crucial role played by Egypt in ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza, in providing healthcare to medical evacuees, in negotiating the humanitarian pause and the release of hostages in November. This was an important topic.
But today, [we are] focusing on our [EU-Egypt Association] Council - which is, first of all, about our bilateral relations and the highest political platform of our Association following a comprehensive discussion and review of our relations and cooperation. We have made significant progress, and we reviewed this progress over the last 20 years and I am glad that our cooperation has gained intensity and quality.
Two years ago, we endorsed new and ambitious Partnership Priorities which define the framework for our relations to move forward.
And today, we have signed the Framework Agreement allowing Egypt to negotiate its participation to our programmes - to EU programmes - open to third countries, like for example, Horizon Europe.
This is a big step. This is a step that will allow us to untap the enormous potential in our relations. And we want to intensify cooperation on a wide range of topics.
We are discussing a Strategic and Comprehensive Partnership, building upon the Association Agreement and the Partnership Priorities that we signed two years ago.
This new partnership will foster enhanced political dialogue, support economic and social development, accompany Egypt's reform agenda - from the economy to human rights - and attract investments, which are crucial for a long-term stability.
Out of many fields, let me briefly mention the importance of our existing cooperation on counter-terrorism - both bilaterally and at the international level by our co-chairing the Global Counterterrorism Forum - on migration, but also on human rights, where we agreed to deepen our dialogue.
We also discussed the regional situation, where Egypt is facing many challenges in its immediate neighbourhood: from Sudan to Libya, in addition to the unfolding tragedy in Gaza.
Egypt has also been a victim of Russia's war against Ukraine because food has been weaponized causing food crisis which have been harming directly people in Egypt.
That is why, supporting Egypt remains a priority for the European Union. Egypt has benefited from the alternative export routes established by the European Union, called Solidarity Lanes.
And also, I am happy to announce [that] the implementation of the two projects under the Food and Resilience Facility for Egypt - with â¬100 million - has already commenced.
We also have our European Investment Bank (EIB). We see the EIB stepping up its contribution to Egyptians' food resilience with a loan of â¬150 million to invest in Egyptian agriculture.
But unhappily, there are other crises and challenges in the region, and Egypt is a crucial partner and a force for peace and stability in the whole Middle East.
Once again, I have to mention the conflict in Gaza. We aim to build a coalition supportive of the relaunch of the political perspectives for the Two-States solution - and Egypt is, and has to be, a key partner in this regard.
On the South, you mentioned yesterday and today the ongoing war in Sudan. We know that this poses a significant threat to regional stability and has implications on Egypt - direct implications on you. Because the conflict has already cost the lives [of] at least 12,000 innocent Sudanese people, but has also displaced 7 million civilians, many of them towards Egypt.
For us, the priority remains a cessation of hostilities. Just yesterday, we listed under our sanctions regime six companies involved in funding or supplying either of the two parties of the ongoing conflict in Sudan.
Egypt is in the forefront supporting the refugees, with a high number of Sudanese. We stand with you, and we will continue supporting Egypt in facing this challenge. Because, for us, our partnership is not only about cooperation, but also about solidarity, which is something more than cooperation.
And I am looking forward to this continued cooperation and solidarity.
Thank you.
Q&A
Q. Taking into consideration what you mentioned about the far-reaching impact of the war in Ukraine and Gaza on several economies, including Egypt. Could you provide more details about your vision for Egypt as a strategic partner? And how this vision has evolved in the European Union in the recent couple of years? My second question is related to the situation in Gaza. There is a shift in the European stance on the humanitarian and political situation in Gaza recently. My question to you is how can we collectively move towards implementing the Two-States solution in a practical way - as you mentioned yesterday in the press conference and your recent statements - rather than wasting time discussing reviving the peace process?
On building peace in the Middle East, Egypt is not a strategic partner - it is a strategic actor. It is an actor on itself. Nothing can be done without Egypt's participation and agreement. It was an actor in building peace already in the past, by doing this with Israel after so many years of war. It has been [providing] a strong support of the people in Gaza - not only allowing the [humanitarian] support to go through, but providing support. I remember, Minister, the figures you provided me, explaining how important was the effort done by you. From our side, we are very proud of supporting but you are supporting directly from any point of view. And in any process that one could imagine in order to build peace, Egypt will have to play a strategic role - inside the Arab world and the Muslim world, and in relations to us. We started doing that with the discussion yesterday that it has to continue. I know that you are working also from your side and the Arab world, in order to present ideas that we are ready to share and to work [on] together. And when I am saying that we have to talk about implementing the Two-State solution instead of talking about a ""peace process"", it because on peace, it is easy to agree, at least theoretically. Nobody will say that they do not want peace. Well, I heard this morning someone saying that, but normally people want peace. But what kind of peace? And I think that we have to go... because naming things is a way of progress. You have to name [it] in order to clearly identify your objective. And I think that the EU Member States - all of them - yesterday in our discussion, stated clearly that they consider the Two-States solution as the way to make peace.
So, let's talk about the purpose, the objective, the target - and let's put the political will after, and start talking systematically on the Two-States solution implementation. But we will continue working on that subject, and one thing is clear for me. You can say that in different ways, but one thing is clear: Israel cannot have the veto right to the self-determination of the Palestinian people. They do not have a veto right. If the United Nations recognises - as it has recognised many times - the self-determination right of the Palestinian people, nobody can veto it.
Q. After the discussion you had yesterday with the Arab partners, did you get positive reactions from the Arab countries? I think it is obvious, but could we say today that there is almost a common European Union-Arab countries' [position] on the issue? And what will be the follow-up of the discussions you had yesterday? Could we imagine the organisation of the Preparatory Peace Conference - that you suggested - that the European Union and the Arab countries can organise, or some of the Arab countries, let's say in a few months' time? Could we speak about this summer [that] could be the deadline?
I share your feelings and I share your diagnosis, Minister. When we talk about non forced displacement of persons, well, this person has already been forced to be displaced under the bomb[ing] and the destruction of their houses. These people have already been forced to be displaced. They are being massed in the south of Gaza - and as the Minister said - putting pressure in the border with Egypt. And yes, certainly we are against these people being forced to be displaced to the other side of the border but, if the situation continues, and they have to choose between dying or living. This is the dramatic choice that this people will have to face. So, we have to face not the consequences but the causes, and why it is happening. The diagnosis of the Minister has been very clear. I understand that you want to know more about what we are going to do. Look, yesterday it was a first step of a long travel, but you cannot pretend that in 24 hours you could look for a solution to some problem that has been pending for 30 years. But one thing was clear for us: I think that we have to continue. We have to continue talking. Yesterday it was a good momentum in the discussions between the Arab world and the European people - certainly not finished. But yesterday, we had the opportunity to listen to the Israeli [Foreign] Minister [Israel Katz], to the Palestinian [Foreign] Minister [Riyad Al-Maliki], to the diplomatic envoys of the Arab world. We have to continue, and I think that we committed to continue, looking for the ways to look for the solution to be implementable.
Q. Egypt is hosting more than 9 million refugees. Don't you think that Egypt deserves much more financial aid, especially considering what Egypt is doing is protecting Europe from much more refugees?
Egypt deserves support, certainly. As Commissioner [for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, OlivÃ©r] VÃ¡rhelyi has said, Egypt is an island of stability in the middle of a full storm. And certainly, when Egypt is receiving migrants or people looking for protection - because sometimes, they do not deserve to be called ""migrants"" but exiled people - they are providing support to the humankind. And from this point of view, it is why the European Commission - President [Ursula] von der Leyen announced its proposal of increasing our cooperation with Egypt, based on common interests, including migration.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said there will be more interaction and communication with the European Union and Ukraine's closest neighbors in the coming weeks.
""We have already determined our Ukrainian priorities for the coming weeks. We clearly see the task -- both in terms of packages that will strengthen our positions at the front, and in terms of political interaction with partners, and in terms of what is needed for the financial stability of Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy said on January 21 in a video address posted on X, formerly Twitter.
""We are preparing more interaction and new communication, new important negotiations,"" Zelenskiy said.
He also said that on January 21 there had been about 60 battles on the front, describing the fighting near Avdiyivka as the most intense, but also mentioning clashes near Bakhmut, Maryinka, and Kupyansk.
""In one day, the inhumane Russians shelled more than a hundred cities, towns, and villages in nine regions: from the Chernihiv and Sumy regions to the Mykolayiv and Kirovohrad region, he said, referring to regions in northeastern and southern Ukraine.
""Russian strikes are particularly brutal in the Donetsk region. Unfortunately, there are wounded, there are dead. My condolences to all those who have lost family and friends,"" Zelenskiy said.
He expressed confidence that Russia will be held accountable for such actions.
""Russia must feel and remember forever that the aggressor himself loses the most from aggression,"" he added, saying that he is grateful to everyone who ""brings Russia closer to responsibility in all ways,"" whether this is though military assistance, sanctions, or legal and political means.
Zelenskiy did not mention an attack on a market area in a suburb of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk that a Russian-installed authority said killed 27 people and injured 25. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-appointed head of the Donetsk region, said Ukrainian forces used artillery to carry out the attack.
The Ukrainian military's General Staff said earlier that Russian forces launched four missile and 69 air strikes, carried out 50 attacks from rocket salvo systems on Ukrainian troop positions and populated areas.
According to the General Staff, the Ukrainian military repelled attacks by Russian forces in seven directions, mostly in Lyman and Avdiyivka.
The General Staff said in its daily assessment that the Russian military actively uses aviation and first-person view drones and conducts assault operations with the support of armored vehicles.

""We understand both Russia and Ukraine are conducting separate investigations into the incident, and Kyiv has called for an international probe,"" Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, told ambassadors in the Security Council.
Russia said that there were no survivors from Monday's crash in the Belgorod region close to the Ukrainian border and stated that 74 people had been on board the military transport plane, 65 of whom were captured Ukrainian soldiers who were part of a prisoner of war (POW) swap.
Moscow claims that the plane was struck by a Ukrainian missile, according to news reports, but Ukraine has said it was not told to ensure the safety of airspace, as on previous occasions when POWs have been exchanged.
President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia in a post on social platform X, formerly Twitter, of ""playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war"", calling for ""all the facts to be established"" and insisted on an international inquiry.
Unable to verify
Noting that the United Nations is unable to verify the reports or the circumstances of the crash, Ms. DiCarlo said that ""what is clear is that the incident took place in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ongoing war.""
""To avoid further escalation, we urge all concerned to refrain from actions, rhetoric, or allegations that could further fuel the already dangerous conflict.""
Casualties 'rapidly rising'
According to the UN human rights office (OHCHR), since Russia's invasion in February 2022, 10,312 civilians have been killed and a further 19,530 injured.
""These figures continue to rapidly rise,"" Ms. DiCarlo added, noting casualties resulting from recent strikes.
""The Secretary-General has been unambiguous in condemning all attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, wherever they occur. They are prohibited under international law and must stop immediately,"" she said.
Concerns for prisoners of war
The senior UN official also highlighted her deep concerns for POWs on all sides, and their families.
""The recent incident in the Belgorod region, with its claimed link to a planned prisoner exchange, reminds us of the plight of prisoners of war,"" she said.
""Notwithstanding the circumstances of yesterday's incident, the fate of POWs should not be instrumentalized. We urge the parties to continue pursuing exchanges of prisoners of war,"" she added.
'A war of choice'
Ms. DiCarlo, said that the war in Ukraine ""is a war of choice"".
""Its tragic consequences are clear for all to see. The longer it lasts, the more death and destruction it causes and the more it eats away at the norms agreed to ensure and maintain a peaceful and secure world,"" she said."

Tehran (ISNA) - He stressed that the US-UK aggression's aim to force Yemen to stop its naval operations, ""will not be achieved,"" pointing out that ""the US and the UK should understand that we are in an era of retaliation and our people do not know surrender.""
For his part, a member of the Ansar Allah Movement's political bureau, Mohammad Al-Bukhaiti, announced that regardless of the size of the bombing, ""our military operations against Israel will continue until the genocidal crimes in Gaza end.""
Likewise, the Director General of the Yemeni State Radio and Television Corporation, Abdul Rahman Al-Ahnuni, stated that ""the Americans want to restore their image, which was shattered after their military ships were targeted.""

Citing Gaza's health authorities, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also noted that some 62,681 Palestinians have been injured by Israeli strikes launched in retaliation for Hamas-led massacres in Israel that left some 1,200 dead and around 250 people taken hostage.
Two Israeli soldiers have also been killed in Gaza since Friday, OCHA said, bringing the total to193 since the start of the ground operation and 1,203 soldiers injured, according to the Israeli military.
The same period saw 343 Palestinians killed and another 573 people injured, the UN aid coordination office said.
UN chief's two-State appeal
The development came as Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers prepared to meet their European Union counterparts on Monday in separate private talks in Brussels, after UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres condemned the ongoing Gaza bloodshed as ""heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable"".
Addressing a summit of the Group of 77 countries and China (G77) in the Ugandan capital Kampala on Sunday, Mr. Guterres described the Middle East as ""a tinderbox"", before issuing an appeal to ""do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region"".
""Israel's military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as Secretary-General,"" Mr. Guterres said, having earlier reiterated his support for a two-State solution for Israelis and Palestinians.
""The denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security, exacerbate polarization and embolden extremists everywhere,"" he said.
Hunger relief
Highlighting the scale of need among Gazans after more than three months of ""intense"" bombardment, OCHA said that only 15 bakeries were now operational in Gaza - ""six in Rafah and nine in Deir al Balah"" - and none is open north of Wadi Gaza.
Almost all of these functioning bakeries have continued to receive support from the UN World Food Programme (WFP) which has provided flour, salt, yeast and sugar.
""Through this initiative, about 250,000 people were able to purchase bread at a subsidized price,"" OCHA noted in its latest update on the emergency on Sunday.
Communications blackouts
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, meanwhile, reported on Monday that telecommunications shutdowns had entered a seventh day.
""Disruption of telecommunication services prevents people accessing lifesaving information, calling first responders and continues to impede humanitarian response,"" the UN agency said in a tweet on X, formerly Twitter.
In its latest update, UNRWA reported that 1.7 million people are now confirmed displaced within Gaza. At least 335 of these internally displaced people have been killed while sheltering in the agency's premises and 1,161 have been injured, in addition to the 151 UNWRA staff killed and 141 installations damaged since 7 October."
AOG991TRIE_GDWPK8LO93Y817E,China's Human Rights Record to Face Scrutiny During UN Review,_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/01/china-240122-voa01.htm,"By William Yang January 22, 2024
China's human rights record will come under public scrutiny Tuesday as the United Nations Human Rights Council holds the fourth Universal Periodic Review Working Group from January 22 to February 2.
As one of 14 states under review at this session, some analysts and rights advocates say the occasion offers a rare opportunity for China to be held accountable for its human rights obligations.
""The Universal Periodic Review is one of the rare opportunities for U.N. member states to give recommendations or comments on the human rights situation in China, so from that point of view, Tuesday's review is unique,"" William Nee, research and advocacy coordinator at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a U.S.-based activist network, told VOA by phone.
Since its inception in 2008, the UPR has reviewed all 193 U.N. members three times. China's last review was in November 2018. In preparation for the three-hour review, the U.N. releases three separate reports, including a stakeholder report summarizing concerns shared by NGOs, the U.N.'s assessment of the state of human rights in China, and a national report submitted by Beijing.
In the stakeholder report, international NGOs highlighted China's lack of commitment to international human rights treaties, the lack of protection of basic rights for Chinese citizens, and the ongoing persecution of ethnic minorities.
Chinese authorities say in their report that they have ""accepted"" more than 80% of the recommendations put forward by various countries during the last UPR and that they uphold the protection of human rights as ""a task of importance"" in state governance.
Despite China's assertion of implementing recommendations from other countries and regularly listening to inputs from NGOs, some experts say the scope of human rights abuses committed by Beijing has expanded since the last UPR in 2018.
""If we look at what Beijing said they had accepted in 2018, we see almost the opposite in the area of protection of freedom of expression, in ensuring rights of minorities and some concerns were raised around business and human rights,"" Sarah Brooks, Deputy Regional Director for Asia at Amnesty International, told VOA by phone.
Ahead of Tuesday's UPR, several human rights organizations and some American lawmakers have highlighted the various kinds of human rights violations committed by Beijing over the last few years, including sending more than one million Tibetan children to boarding schools, the large-scale persecution of the Uyghurs, and the bounties imposed on more than a dozen overseas Hong Kong activists.
""We want to see U.N. member states refer to the different types of abuses that China has committed against the Uyghur people, including the detention camps, bilingual education policies, boarding schools, forced sterilization, and the repressive system that's still in place,"" Zumretay Arkin, the spokesperson for World Uyghur Congress, told VOA in a recorded message.
In its national report, China claims that all ethnic groups have ""equal enjoyment of rights in all areas in accordance with the law"" and that it has embarked on a path of human rights development that is ""suitable to its national conditions.""
Despite Beijing's defense of its human rights record, some experts say it's important for concerned U.N. member states to challenge China on a wide range of human rights issues in a smart and accurate way.
""Since the last UPR, U.N. treaty bodies and U.N. human rights experts have produced an incredible amount of communications about [human rights abuses in China] that are very hard-hitting,"" Nee from Chinese Human Rights Defenders told VOA. ""I hope U.N. member states can use that information and reference human rights laws and standards when formulating their questions for China.""
While the UPR serves as a rare occasion for the international community to scrutinize China's human rights records, Nee also expects China to push back against criticism of human rights abuses in the country by rallying support from some U.N. member states.
""China is going to get as many countries as possible to give softball questions or praise its human rights record,"" he said, adding that Beijing will try to build an alternative narrative around its human rights record.
To attract global attention to human rights persecutions committed by the Chinese authorities, several organizations are organizing relevant events in Geneva this week, including an event focusing on Tibetan human rights and a press briefing examining the outcome of the UPR.
Some analysts say efforts by these organizations can hold the Chinese government accountable.
""These efforts are very important because they are some of the clearest and most factually grounded representations of the Chinese government's conduct,"" Sophie Richardson, former China director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA by phone.
While Beijing will likely dismiss concerns about human rights violations raised by some U.N. member states, Richardson hopes concerned governments will press for an investigation into human rights violations committed by Beijing.
""The scope and scale of human rights violations in China is clear, and the question is whether concerned governments are willing to come together and try to do something about it,"" she said.
In her view, since China has committed some acts of transnational repression in other countries, democratic countries now have responsibilities to deal with these challenges.
""I would say democratic countries have more reasons than ever to work in coalition to push back against China's human rights violations,"" Richardson told VOA."

TEL AVIV (Sputnik) - Israel does not want a war with the Lebanese movement Hezbollah, but is ready for any development of events in the north part of the border in light of the ongoing provocations, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday.
""We are monitoring everything that is happening in the north. Hezbollah continues its provocations, and I have now given a special assessment of the situation in this regard... We do not want war, but we are ready for any situation that may develop in the north. Therefore, we keep one hand in the south, and a sharp eye is directed to the north,"" Galant said at a meeting of members of the narrow cabinet of military operations with the authorities of the northern municipalities.
On October 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages.
The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, when the Palestine-Israel conflict escalated, has increased to 25,105, while more than 62,600 others have been injured, the enclave's health ministry said on Sunday.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The fighting on the Lebanese-Israel border between the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah would stop if a ceasefire agreement on Gaza is reached, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah BouHabib said on Monday.
""If they really reach an agreement in Gaza, this will stop immediately and automatically. It will stop in southern Lebanon or northern Israel,"" BouHabib said.
BouHabib characterized the skirmishes on the Lebanese-Israel border as ""minor fighting.""
""I don't think the intention is to have a big war. It has to do with what's going on in Gaza, which is not acceptable,"" BouHabib said.
The situation in southern Lebanon deteriorated after the start of Israel's indiscriminate bombardment and invasion of Gaza in which more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed and well over 60,000 have been wounded. The IDF and Hezbollah regularly exchange fire in areas along the border.

The Islamic Republic of Iran Army has received  large numbers of strategic combat, reconnaissance, destruction and radar drones.
The delivery of the homegrown unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) took place during a ceremony on Tuesday in the presence of Chief Commander of the Army Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi and Defense Minister Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani.
The drones were designed and manufactured by the Iranian Defense Ministry in cooperation with Iran's Army amid Western sanctions.
They included strategic multi-purpose Abail-4 and Ababil-5 drones, which are capable of carrying out all kinds of reconnaissance, surveillance, electronic warfare, combat and signal data collection missions.
Among the delivered UAVs were Arash and Bavar that can perform destruction, along with long-range and precision-strike missions, as well as Karrar, a jet-powered drone with the ability to perform a variety of target, combat and aerial interception missions.
The upgraded drones were equipped with self-protection, anti-electronic warfare and indigenous navigation systems, as well as smart precision-strike weapons.
They have also special and up-to-date capabilities for use with other weapon and network-based operation systems.
Speaking at the ceremony, Mousavi said that the delivery of the drones ""will definitely improve the combat power"" of the four branches of the Army, namely the Ground Force, Navy, Air Force and Air Defense Force.
""Everything in the field of UAVs, ranging from design to use against threats, today relies on the domestic capability and knowledge of the country's young scientists,"" he added.
Mousavi noted that the Iranian Armed forces have in recent years witnessed ""auspicious developments,"" including the delivery of hundreds of drones to the Army.
Meanwhile, Ashtiani said that the new UAVs ""will have a significant impact on the combat power of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army."""

23 January 2024  From Combined Maritime Forces Public Affairs
MANAMA, Bahrain -- The Brazilian Navy assumed command of Combined Maritime Forces' (CMF) counter-piracy focused task force during a change of command ceremony here, Jan. 23.
Philippine Navy Capt. Mateo Carido turned over command of Combined Task Force (CTF) 151 to Brazilian Navy Rear Adm. Antonio Braz de Souza. While Commander of CTF 151, Carido met with key partners from many nations, including Sychelles, Djibouti and Dubai. These engagements provide an opportunity to reach countries not yet members of CMF and discuss the work of the multinational naval partnership, as well as strengthening ties between CMF member nations.
Since assuming command last August, Carido oversaw ships working in support of the task force as they conducted multinational exercises to hone skills and promote transnational relationships. Ships also routinely conducted maritime patrols in the Gulf of Aden to directly suppress piracy outside territorial waters of coastal states, in coordination with the European Union Naval Force.
""We would like to express our sincerest gratitude most particularly to CMF, led by Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, for the trust and confidence given to me to lead this multinational counter-piracy task force,"" said Carido. ""To my team, thank you so much for your dedication and full support to the Philippine-led CTF 151, indeed, we are ready together.""
Braz de Souza takes command of CTF 151 following a tour as Chief of Staff of the Command in Chief of the Fleet. Over the years, he has participated in numerous missions navigating the South Atlantic Ocean, including rescuing the survivors of the Air France Flight 447 crash in 2009. He has also led oceanographic research missions, and as the head advisor of the submarine development program, his strategic vision shaped the future of Brazilian underwater defense.
""By accepting the invitation to guide this force once again, the Brazilian Navy, the first South American country to play a prominent role in this multinational maritime partnership, reaffirms its dedication to the maritime community, and particularly to the Combined Maritime Forces,"" said Braz de Souza. ""This commitment aims at enhancing overall security and stability, further contributing to the collective well-being.""
CTF 151 was established as a multinational task force in January 2009, and is one of five operational task forces under CMF. In conjunction with the European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR), and together with independently deployed naval ships, CTF 151 helps to patrol the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor.
CMF headquartered in Bahrain with U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and U.S. 5th Fleet, is the largest multinational naval partnership in the world, with 40 nations committed to upholding the international rules-based order at sea. It promotes security, stability and prosperity across approximately 3.2 million square miles of international waters, encompassing some of the world's most important shipping lanes.
CMF's other task forces include CTF 150, which conducts maritime security operations outside the Arabian Gulf against threats from no-state actors; CTF 152, dedicated to maritime security in the Arabian Gulf; CTF 153, providing maritime security in the Red Sea; and CTF 154, which delivers maritime training."

Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA) Senior officials in Tuvalu have affirmed that the Pacific island country will maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan after a warning emerged on Jan. 19 of a possible severance of ties, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.
Eric Chen (é³ä¿å), deputy head of MOFA's East Asia and Pacific Affairs, said MOFA and its embassy in Tuvalu reached out to Tuvalu's government and its ambassador to the Republic of China (ROC), Bikenibeu Paeniu, after the warning was issued by Paeniu.
According to Chen, the Tuvalu government immediately clarified that Paeniu's controversial statement did not represent the Pacific country's official stance, and it affirmed that its diplomatic relations with Taiwan remained strong.
In an article in the Weekend Australian on Jan. 19, Paeniu was cited as saying that ""sources from Tuvalu"" had told him that his country could follow Nauru and switch its diplomatic recognition to Beijing after Tuvalu's election on Jan. 26.
The former Tuvalu prime minister called on Australia and its allies and partners to closely watch the situation and to step up their support for his nation.
The warning came after Nauru announced on Jan. 15 that it was severing ties with the ROC, Taiwan's formal national designation, to recognize the People's Republic of China.
That left the ROC with 12 allies, including the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau in the Pacific region.
Meanwhile, a diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity told reporters Tuesday that Paeniu told MOFA that his source on the potential diplomatic switch was originally from Nauru.
Given that Nauru had just established diplomatic ties with China, the source said it was highly likely that Nauru was working closely with Beijing to spread disinformation to put more pressure on Taipei.
The source also said MOFA and Taiwan's embassy in Tuvalu have continued to maintain cordial relations with all 16 Tuvalu parliamentarians across party lines.
Except for one or two members considered to be more pro-China, a large majority of Tuvalu's parliamentarians have all agreed to continue to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the source said.
It is therefore believed that Taiwan-Tuvalu ties will remain unchanged no matter who wins the Jan. 26 general election and become the next prime minister of Tuvalu, the source said.
MOFA initially said on Jan. 21 in response to Paeniu's comments that it cherished ties with Tuvalu but it did not specifically voice any confidence that ties would be maintained.
The severing of ties between Taiwan and Nauru came two days after Vice President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸å¾·) of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected president.
It was the 10th diplomatic ally Taipei has lost to Beijing since President Tsai Ing-wen (è¡è±æ) took office in May 2016 due to deteriorating cross-Taiwan Strait relations.

B4MH1S51AW_L77PKM0IYPIBR62,UN: Taliban Dismiss 600 Female Afghan Workers Over Edict Violations,_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240122-voa04.htm,"By Ayaz Gul January 22, 2024
The United Nations said Monday that the Taliban government in impoverished Afghanistan had recently forced hundreds of females out of their jobs for allegedly not adhering to Islamic law requirements imposed on women nationwide.
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, documented the job dismissals in its latest report on human rights, covering the last quarter of 2023 in a country where millions of people need humanitarian aid.
""The de facto authorities continue to enforce and promulgate restrictions on women's rights to work, education, and freedom of movement,"" according to the report.
UNAMA noted that the Taliban's Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice had taken the enforcement role, impeding women from working or accessing services because they were unmarried or did not have a male guardian.
It said that a lack of compliance with the hijab or dress code, absence of a mahram, or male relative, and other restrictions imposed on women visiting public places, offices, and educational institutions had apparently led to at least 600 women losing jobs in two Afghan provinces during the reported period.
The provincial chapter of the ministry banned 400 women from working in a pine-nut processing plant in eastern Nangarhar province in October without providing any reasons, while men were allowed to continue working, the report stated.
It added that a Taliban-run power plant in northern Balkh province in November dismissed 200 women allegedly due to financial reasons, yet no male employees faced the same action. In one instance, the vice and virtue ministry officials ""advised an unmarried female staff at a healthcare facility to get married or risk losing her job, stating that it was inappropriate for an unmarried woman to work,"" the report said.
Last month, the ministry officials visited a bus terminal in southern Kandahar city to ensure that women were not traveling long distances without a male relative and instructed drivers not to allow female passengers to board buses if they are not accompanied by a chaperone, according to the UNAMA findings.
The report said that women without male relatives in the eastern Paktia Province have been denied healthcare access since early December, with authorities from the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice continuing to visit provincial health facilities to ensure compliance.
UNAMA stated that while there is no general ban on women's employment in Afghanistan, the mahram requirement effectively limits their right to work if they do not have a male relative who can accompany them to workplaces.
The report recorded instances of arbitrary arrests and detentions, sentencing, and some releases of human rights defenders and journalists, including women, from October to December.
""The de facto authorities continue to infringe the right to freedom of expression by limiting the public's opportunity to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas,"" UNAMA said.
The report also documented growing suicide bombings and other attacks on members of the country's predominantly Shiite ethnic Hazara community over the past three months. The violence, mostly claimed by Islamic State militants, killed nearly 50 Afghan Shiite Muslims and wounded many more.
The U.N. mission said its human rights workers continued to record extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture and ill-treatment of former Afghan government officials and security forces. The Taliban have persistently denied the charges, saying they are adhering to a general amnesty their leadership announced after seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021.
The fundamentalist Taliban have since imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, banning Afghan girls from receiving an education beyond sixth grade and most female employees from public as well as private workplaces.
The international community has denounced the Taliban curbs on women and demanded they be removed immediately. No foreign country has recognized the de facto Afghan government, mainly over human rights concerns and the treatment of women.
The Taliban rejected Monday's U.N. report, claiming it shows the world body's ""ignorance"" about Sharia or Islamic law.
Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesman, asserted in an English-language statement that denouncing Islamic rules as ""an act against human rights...is obviously an insult to people's beliefs.""
Mujahid advised UNAMA to desist from criticizing the Afghan nation's religious matters.
""Women's hijab, the necessity of Sharia mahram with women, Sharia environment for women's work and education....these are all the commitments and responsibilities of a responsive and Islamic government,"" he said."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Yemen's Ansar Allah movement, also known as the Houthis, attacked n a US military cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden on Monday, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said.
""The naval forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a military operation targeting an American military cargo ship (OCEAN JAZZ) in the Gulf of Aden, using an appropriate naval missiles,"" Saree wrote on X (former Twitter).
Back in November, 2023, the Houthis vowed to attack any Israel-linked ships until Tel Aviv halts the invasion of the Gaza strip.
In January, the US and the UK began airstrikes on Houthi positions in Yemen to degrade their fighting capabilities. Russia condemned both the Houthi actions in the Red Sea and the Western aggression against Yemen, characterizing the latter as ""another example of the Anglo-Saxons' distortion of UN Security Council resolutions and complete disregard for international law"".

Turkey's parliament officially ratified Sweden's NATO bid on Tuesday, bringing an end to over a year of delays that had been a source of concern for Western powers engaged in a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine.
Tehran (ISNA) - The majority of Turkish parliamentarians voted in favor of Sweden's bid to formally become the 32nd member of NATO.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly backed Sweden's bid, after long opposing it.
President Erdogan is anticipated to sign Sweden's ratification document in the coming days, formally concluding Turkey's role in the protracted process.
Hungary remains the last remaining hurdle in the accession process.
Hungary had closely followed Turkey's stance throughout the NATO accession process, expectations were high for Hungary's approval of Sweden's membership without significant resistance.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban extended an invitation to his Swedish counterpart to Budapest for discussions on the matter. However, indications of strains emerged as Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom asserted that there was currently ""no reason"" to negotiate with Hungary regarding Stockholm's NATO candidacy.

Fellow citizens!
Exactly 105 years ago, right here on Sophia Square in Kyiv, the   following lines were proclaimed: ""The age-old dreams have come true,   dreams that the best sons of Ukraine lived for and died for. From now   on, the parts of a single Ukraine, separated for centuries, are united   into one.""
These are the words of the Unification Act, which brought together   the Ukrainian lands on both banks of the Dnipro River into a single   state. And on this occasion, today we celebrate the Day of Unity of   Ukraine.
Every year on January 22, we have always recalled two key lessons of   those times, two guiding principles for all generations of the Ukrainian   nation: to gain your own statehood, you have to fight. To preserve it,   you have to unite.
And the day has come when it fell to all of us to prove: both these   lessons have been learned. Every Ukrainian knows this day. When   recalling it, there's no need to mention the year, just the date and   month will suffice. It's the 24th of February.
When we showed that the unity and independence of Ukraine are real,   not declarative values for us. And we did not give up our state, but   proved from the first day of the war that people's full-scale unity   repels full-scale enemy aggression. Not symbolically, not sporadically,   not in words, but on the frontlines - on all fronts of the war against   unfreedom. In all forms of the battle for the preservation of Ukraine.   United, independent, strong.
As a tribute to it, since 1990, Ukrainians have been coming together   in human chains of unity. Ukrainian unity stretching from west to east.   On February 24, Ukrainians joined hands again. Having chosen again not   the chains of slavery, but the chain of unity. The only difference is   that it has taken on a new form. When every Ukrainian no longer had the   concept of ""my"" or ""not my"" region, as every corner of Ukraine, every   city and village became native. When we became dear to each other. When   Ukrainians from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odesa, Dnipro fight for Ukrainians   in Donbas and Crimea, in the south and north. When Ukrainians from   Zakarpattia, Bukovyna, and Halychyna open the doors of their homes and   provide shelter to Ukrainians from Mariupol, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.   Ukrainians who fight. Ukrainians who work. Ukrainians who help.   Ukrainian mothers and Ukrainian children who have lost their homes and   are now abroad, contributing to the common resistance, collecting and   delivering what is needed here. When Ukrainians from every region work   to protect every region.
And to liberate every corner that is temporarily occupied. When the   Ukrainians who are now there are waiting for us and hearing us.   Continuing to be Ukrainians, continuing to resist. And together we will   definitely force Russia to leave. And the words of the Unification Act   about the unification of the parts of Ukraine that were separated from   each other will be heard again. They will become a reality. Because   today every Ukrainian is fighting for every Ukrainian. Proving that when   all Ukrainians join hands, they won't raise them to surrender.
We all fight. And today, this is true not only for the Dnipro's two   banks. Today, the unity of Ukrainians spans both hemispheres of the   Earth. In every corner of which, on February 24, there were people   declaring, ""I am Ukrainian."" Declaring it on all continents where our   people live. Those who, with the outbreak of a full-scale war,   regardless of their place of residence, birth, or passport, said in the   affirmative, ""I am Ukrainian."" Those who proved it with their deeds. Our   millions-strong diaspora, our lobbyists for Ukraine's interests around   the world. Those who collect, find, pack and deliver everything needed   for the victory. All those who have not forgotten their roots and do not   let the world forget about Ukraine. Everyone who has Ukrainian blood in   their veins and a free heart beating in their chest. Ukrainians by   origin, who have long proven that they are Ukrainians in spirit. And   after many years of waiting, they should finally become Ukrainians by   passport. At the legislative level. Today I am submitting to the   Verkhovna Rada a key draft law that will allow the adoption of   comprehensive legislative amendments and the introduction of multiple   citizenship.
And it will allow all ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from   around the world to have our citizenship. Of course, except for citizens   of the aggressor country.
All those who, during various emigration waves, were forced to leave   their homeland and ended up in Europe, the United States, Canada,   countries of Asia and Latin America. All those who help us despite being   hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from their homeland.
Foreign volunteers who took up arms to defend Ukraine, all those who   fight for Ukraine's freedom as if it were their homeland. And Ukraine   will become such for them.
For everyone who can feel that ""being in Ukraine"" means ""being at   home."" Not as tourists, but as citizens. Citizens of a great, united,   single Ukraine.
For the freedom of which we are fighting. Fighting for the right to   be Ukrainians. And the corresponding decision is one of the elements of   this freedom, one of the possibilities to realize this right. The right   to be Ukrainian.
Furthermore, today we must take steps not only to strengthen the   unity of Ukraine and our people, but also to act for the unity of rights   and freedoms, the truth about Ukrainians, the truth about us, and the   truth about our history.
To this end, today I have signed a Decree ""On the Territories of the   Russian Federation Historically Inhabited by Ukrainians."" This is the   restoration of truth about the historical past for the sake of Ukraine's   future.
Fellow Ukrainians!
In the spring of 2022, I saw Bucha for the first time after the   occupation. And for the first time I wore a T-shirt with the words ""I am   Ukrainian."" Always, and especially now, the words ""I am Ukrainian""   carry a special meaning. Today, they are filled with courage, pride, and   indomitability of our people. The pain that every Ukrainian feels and   at the same time the strength that helps us endure everything. Overcome   everything. Survive everything. Knowing and remembering that only strong   Ukrainians can be united. And only united Ukrainians can be strong.
Ukrainians all over the world.

I am Ukrainian.
Happy Unity Day, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!"
BAVHA1DCHX_H0BS16DXMMYYQ4V,Cambodia's canal project would link its coast with the Mekong River,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240123-rfa01.htm,"The $1.7 billion, 180 km-long canal could strengthen ties between Beijing and Phnom Penh.
By RFA Khmer 2024.01.23 -- A proposed US$1.7 billion canal linking Cambodia's southern coast with its section of the Mekong River could include funding from China and would allow shipments and security patrols on the major waterway to bypass Vietnam, several analysts have told Radio Free Asia.
Prime Minister Hun Manet spoke about the 180 km-long (110 miles) project last month, denying reports that the government is planning to take a loan from Beijing to fund construction, which is slated to begin later this year and could take four years to complete.
""It will become a lifeline for our own nation and people, and will eventually improve our economic growth and distribution,"" Hun Manet said at an inauguration ceremony for an unrelated project on Dec. 27.
The canal would begin south of Phnom Penh, cross over the Tonle Bassac and continue to the Gulf of Thailand coast in Kep province. It would impact some 1.6 million Cambodians, according to a government report.
The project is being called the Funan-Techo Canal, and is partly named after Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia since 1985 before stepping down in August. ""Techo"" references an ancient Khmer warrior and is one of Hun Sen's leadership honorifics.
""Funan"" harkens back to an ancient regional empire that ruled over the Mekong Delta from the first to fifth centuries. The empire featured a canal system that linked the Mekong River to the Gulf of Thailand during a period when the shoreline was farther north.
Environmental impact
The Cambodian government approved the canal, formally known as the Tonle Bassac Navigation and Logistics System, in May.
The canal could seriously change the environment and ecology of the lower Mekong River, according to Brian Eyler, Southeast Asia program director at the Washington-based Stimson Center, whose Mekong Dam Monitor records river levels, reservoir volume and precipitation across the river basin.
The Cambodian government report said the project would require the building of three waterway dams, 11 bridges, a 208-kilometer sidewalk and other infrastructure. It will be as wide as 100 meters (328 feet) and 80 meters (262 feet) deep in places.
It could also provide a route for Chinese security interests to travel up to Phnom Penh from the Gulf of Thailand and Cambodia's Ream Naval Base, where China has funded the construction of a deep-draft pier that can accommodate aircraft carriers, he said.
Two Chinese warships led a training program for the Cambodian Navy at the base in Sihanoukville province last month, satellite imagery shows. The base is about 100 km (60 miles) from Kep.
""I'm sure we're not talking about aircraft carriers,"" Eyler said. ""But the kind of joint patrol boats that we see on the upper Mekong coming out of China could easily move through that canal.""
The canal would cut transport costs from US$223 per container to US$170 while expanding agricultural development, creating jobs at the Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh ports and ""encouraging city development and urbanization,"" the report said.
Cambodia has already begun work on expanding the port at Sihanoukville, the Khmer Times reported.
During an official visit to Beijing in October, Hun Manet signed an agreement for the state-owned China Bridge and Road Corporation to conduct a feasibility study on the canal project.
""Samdech Techo already emphasized that this project is not something we would use credit from other countries,"" Hun Manet said at the Dec. 27 inauguration ceremony, referring to his father. ""A company that invests in this project will be responsible for seeking loan for spending on the overall construction.""
He did not comment on whether a Chinese company would be awarded the project.
'Vietnam is legitimately alarmed'
China and Cambodia have seen a rapid development of their relationship in recent years, with Beijing providing Phnom Penh with much needed financial assistance.
Chinese police and security forces already have a presence in Cambodia as they help address the issue of criminality among Chinese nationals in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, Eyler said.
He pointed to last month's Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Forum in Beijing - also attended by Laos and Myanmar - where the main discussion about the Mekong River was about joint security operations.
""So there is a motivation and an interest there to deepen the security presence. Is that something that could draw in other forms of waterborne security presence into Cambodia?"" he asked.
""This is something that should concern Vietnam. Should concern Thailand. It should concern the region.""
The canal would also allow Cambodia to be less dependent on Vietnamese ports, said Sophal Ear, an associate professor of global political economy at Arizona State University.
As a way of protecting its interests, Vietnam could bring up the project as a transboundary water issue at the Mekong River Commission, an inter-government agency that works with regional governments to manage river resources, or the International Court of Justice, he said.
""Vietnam is legitimately alarmed, though I can't imagine the Mekong ecosystem is their primary concern,"" Ear said.
The canal could affect the famous Tonle Sap reversal - a natural process that sustains Cambodia's fisheries and Vietnam's Mekong Delta agriculture, according to Pham Phan Long, president of the U.S.-based Viet Ecology Foundation.
Earlier in December, Hun Manet reassured his Vietnamese counterpart during a two-day official visit to Hanoi that the project wouldn't have ""any negative impacts on the flow of the Mekong or other rivers,"" said Jean-Francois Tan, a delegate minister to Prime Minister Hun Manet in charge of foreign affairs and international cooperation.
""Cambodia has presented the results of a number of studies showing that there are no environmental impacts,"" Tan told reporters on Dec. 13.
Vietnamese officials appeared to accept the prime minister's explanation, CPP spokesman Sok Ey San told RFA.
""We do not hear any more complaints from Vietnam so far after the official explanation by the prime minister during his visit,"" he said. ""The ruling party, as well as the government, will go ahead with the plan. It is built within Cambodia sovereignty.""
'Dual use'
Many Vietnamese government officials and experts are studying whether the canal could be used by militaries, a Vietnam-based expert who wished to remain anonymous told RFA.
In other infrastructure projects around the world, China has ensured that ports and other facilities are ""dual use"" - or available for civilian and military interests, the expert said.
Military vessels could travel up the canal and then down the Mekong to the Vietnamese border close to Ho Chi Minh City, he said.
Asked whether the project will be constructed by a Chinese company, Sok Ey San said the government will decide after feasibility studies are completed.
Cambodia could seek the involvement of companies based in Japan or elsewhere to avoid any reliance on China that could affect Cambodia sovereignty, Finland-based political commentator Kim Sok said.
""It is necessary that Cambodia builds the Funan canal. But the most important thing is that Cambodia should use its own money in building it,"" he said, referring to concerns that China's Belt and Road Initiative is a debt trap for poorer countries.
RFA asked the Vietnamese and Chinese embassies in Phnom Penh for comment on the canal project but did not receive any response.
Wesley Holzer, the spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, told RFA that the United States ""is deeply invested in the conservation of the Mekong River and improving the lives of the millions of Cambodians and Southeast Asians who rely on the river's natural resources.""
RFA was unable to reach Cambodian government spokesman Pen Bona for comment about the canal project. Tan also could not be reached.

""Daniel, Shay, Adam, Itamar, Ahmad, Elkana, Sergey, Nir, Sagi, Mark, Israel, Rafael, Barak, Cydrick, Nicholas, Yoav, Yoval, Elkana, Ariel, Eder, Matan, David, Ilay, and Eyal. These are the names of 24 fallen IDF soldiers, defenders and lovers of the land, who fell last night in a battle near Kissufim and in a battle in the heart of Khan Yunis - defending Israel and the security of the southern communities. On behalf of the entire IDF, I want to express our sorrow to the families during this difficult time. The cost of war is heavy and painful. The fallen fought with dedication and immense courage. Reserve soldiers from all sectors of Israeli society, in its literal sense, truly from all parts of Israeli society, from all sectors and from all over the country, sacrificed their lives for the security of the state and for our common home. May their memory be a blessing.
The commanders conducted a preliminary investigation in the field today. These are the findings of the investigation:  Yesterday afternoon, reserve forces operated in central Gaza, near the fence, in an area about 600 meters from the border in the Kissufim area. On October 7th, terrorists came from this area, murdering and kidnapping innocent people from the Kissufim Kibbutz as well as from the military post adjacent to it. The soldiers cleared the area of terrorists and terror infrastructure in a prolonged operation, and at its conclusion, deployed explosives in several structures as part of the operational activity. The incident occurred in a combat zone when a terrorist cell surprised the forces with RPG rocket fire. The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which the explosives were deployed. The hit apparently led to an explosion that caused the collapse of the building and of the adjacent building. Most of the soldiers were killed as a result of the explosion and the collapse of the buildings. Another rocket hit a tank, which was positioned as part of the defensive force in the area, and a commander and soldier who were in the tank's turret before they managed to fire at the terrorists. The field commanders mobilized forces from the Search and Rescue Brigade and from the 669 Unit, who arrived at the site and, throughout the night, in a prolonged operation with the Air Force, evacuated all the soldiers injured in the incident. The Chief of the General Staff arrived at the location today and met with the battalion soldiers and commanders during the mission they continue to carry out. They briefed him on the event, and the Chief of the General Staff instructed them to continue to thoroughly investigate, and draw all the necessary lessons to prevent and minimize harm to our forces in incidents of this kind. The soldiers in the field continue the mission with determination and a great sense of responsibility to change the security situation in the area, near the border communities.
Our forces continue a broad operation in western Khan Yunis, one of Hamas' significant centers of gravity. It is very complex terrain, densely populated with many Hamas terrorists concealed in the area, including in sensitive facilities, trying to surprise our forces. The forces are fighting courageously using a variety of methods, skilfully and with close support of aerial fire and intelligence. Our forces are striking military posts and terror infrastructure, and over recent days, destroyed a tunnel network spanning a kilometer and a half as well as a rocket production facility. We eliminated over 100 terrorists in western Khan Yunis in the last day. We continue to fight throughout the Gaza Strip, in the north, center, and the south. We are deepening our achievements and are continuing to operate around the clock to create conditions for the return of the hostages.
On the northern border, throughout the day, several launches were identified toward Israel. Some of the launches were intercepted, with one rocket hitting an Air Force base, damaging infrastructure that was repaired within a few hours. There were no casualties, and there was no damage to the Air Force's detection capabilities or the systems operating at the base. Air Force fighter jets struck terror targets in Lebanese territory and destroyed a significant military asset used by the Hezbollah terrorist organization which was also operated by Iranian forces. We will continue to systematically damage Hezbollah's terrorist cells and capabilities, which it tries to conceal in southern Lebanon, even amidst civilian population. Our readiness in this area is very high, and we continue to strengthen it all the time. We will do whatever is necessary, I repeat, whatever is necessary, in the northern arena, to safely return the residents of the north to their homes."""

22 January 2024
The Prime Minister spoke to US President Biden this evening.
They discussed the situation in Israel and Gaza, and the urgent need to secure the release of Israeli hostages while alleviating the very real impact of the conflict on civilians in Gaza. The Prime Minister stressed that supporting Israel in its efforts to defeat the threat from Hamas does not detract from the need for the IDF to take greater care to protect civilians and operate within International Humanitarian Law.
The Prime Minister and President Biden resolved to continue working together to encourage further humanitarian pauses to get hostages out of Gaza and allow more aid to enter. As part of this they underscored the need to open more aid routes into Gaza, including at Ashdod, while simultaneously increasing the efficiency of existing routes. The leaders also agreed that a two state solution which allows Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security is more important than ever.
The Prime Minister and President Biden paid tribute to the British and American personnel who are currently working closely together to uphold freedom of navigation and protect lives in the Red Sea. The Prime Minister passed on his condolences on the death of two US Navy Seals confirmed today.
The leaders condemned the surge in violent Houthi attacks on commercial ships transiting the area and undertook to continue efforts alongside international partners to deter and disrupt those attacks. This includes work through the multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian, putting diplomatic pressure on Iran to cease their support of Houthi activity and, as needed, targeted military action to degrade Houthi capabilities.
The Prime Minister updated President Biden on his recent announcement of Â£2.5 billion of further military support for Ukraine alongside the signing of a new UK-Ukraine bilateral security agreement. The leaders agreed that it is paramount that the world continues to back Ukraine as it resists unprovoked Russian aggression."

Tehran, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has reiterated his country's opposition to any foreign military aggression against Yemen and warns the United States and Britain that their strikes on the Arab country can expand the war.
Amir-Abdollahian took to his X social network and referred to his speech at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday night, in which, he said that the US-UK airstrikes on Yemen are a strategic error.
""I clarified that the US and British military aggression against Yemen only leads to the expansion of the scope of the war"", he said in the post.
During a speech at the Security Council meeting focusing on Palestine and the developments in West Asia, the top Iranian diplomat issued harsh warnings about the catastrophic situation in Gaza amid the ongoing Israeli genocide there.
""I emphasized the need to stop the crimes and genocide of the Zionists in Gaza and lift the blockade of this territory in order to send relief aid immediately"", Amir-Abdollahian wrote on X.
In reference to an independent Palestinian state, he said Iran considers that Palestinians can themselves decide their future without any foreign interference.
The top Iranian diplomat also criticized the US for its all-round support for the Zionist apartheid regime as the main obstacle to prevent genocide in the besieged Gaza Strip.

BPDD35AK65_VJK8Y0VQRXNBT8L,China unlikely to invade Taiwan in next 5 years: survey,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2024/taiwan-240123-rfa01.htm,"Experts polled by a U.S. think tank said the Chinese military was still capable of isolating the island.
By RFA Staff 2024.01.23 -- China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next five years, a survey released this week showed.
But Beijing is capable of executing ""a law enforcement-led quarantine and a People's Liberation Army (PLA)-led blockade of Taiwan,"" according to experts who took part in a survey by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) released on Monday.
A quarantine to substantially reduce trade into, and communications with, Taiwan would put significant pressure on the island and could serve as the prelude to a blockade by the PLA or a full-on amphibious invasion, said the experts.
The new poll - ""Surveying the Experts: U.S. and Taiwan Views on China's Approach to Taiwan"" - was released by the CSIS's China Power Project just after Taiwan elected its new president, Lai Ching-te.
It was conducted from Nov. 28 to Dec. 15, 2023 - before the presidential poll - with the participation of 87 experts, 52 from the U.S. and 35 from Taiwan, all leading academics or former officials.
Invasion unlikely
Responding experts said that in the next five years, ""if China seeks to coerce Taiwan, Beijing's most likely course of action would be a law enforcement-led quarantine of Taiwan.""
But ""if China's goal is to force immediate unification of Taiwan, a PLA-led highly kinetic joint blockade"" is the most likely scenario, according to 80% of respondents.
Without U.S. intervention, most experts did not believe Taiwan could resist a blockade for more than three months.
Just 26% of U.S. respondents and 17% of Taiwanese respondents agreed that China has the military capability to effectively launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan within the next five years.
The rest had much lower confidence in China's ability as such invasion would require ""a much larger commitment of military forces than a quarantine or blockade, and the operations involved would be significantly more complicated.""
Taiwanese experts seemed to have a lower perception of the China threat compared to U.S. experts - only 51% of them believed that China could sustain a high-intensity conflict for more than a year versus 71% of American respondents.
Among U.S. experts, 44% believed China would be willing to detonate nuclear weapons against U.S. or coalition forces during a Taiwan conflict, but only 11% of Taiwanese experts thought the same.
U.S. support
While virtually all U.S. respondents were confident that their country would intervene militarily in the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, 9% of Taiwanese respondents said they were not confident.
And 11% of Taiwanese experts were not confident that the U.S. would intervene if China conducted a joint sea and air blockade of Taiwan.
Some 63% of U.S. experts believed that America would step in against a quarantine of Taiwan, but only 40% of their Taiwanese peers thought so.
The survey's authors explained that these lower levels of confidence stemmed from various factors, the first of which was that ""U.S. support for Taiwan is conditional.""
""The goal of U.S. policy toward Taiwan has long been to avoid moves by either side of the Taiwan Strait to unilaterally shift the status quo,"" they said, ""and if Taiwan's actions precipitate a conflict, the United States may be disinclined to intervene.""
The second factor lies in China's campaign of misinformation and disinformation in Taiwan about U.S. willingness to support Taipei.
""These efforts are aimed at causing the Taiwan public to lose hope and feel that unification is their only option,"" the survey authors said.
Beijing, on the other hand, ""has little doubt that Washington would defend Taiwan,"" they added.

Nations expressed support for a future independent Palestinian state at the United Nations on Tuesday, days after Israel's prime minister took a strong stance against the two-state solution.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council that any refusal to accept a two-state solution ""by any party must be firmly rejected.""
""What is the alternative?"" Guterres asked. ""How would a one-state solution look with such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of freedom, rights and dignity. This would be inconceivable.""
The large gathering of countries to discuss the decades-old Middle East conflict takes place four times a year in the Security Council, open for all member states to participate. More than 50 nations planned to speak, many sending their foreign ministers.
Resolving the conflict has taken on renewed urgency as 15 weeks of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians and 1,200 Israelis and foreigners.
Seeking 'only total victory'
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is seeking ""only total victory"" over Hamas, following their October 7 terror attack inside Israel that triggered the latest war. At a news conference Thursday in Tel Aviv, he pushed back on the idea of a future Palestinian state.
""I clarify that in any arrangement in the foreseeable future, with an accord or without an accord, Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. That's a necessary condition,"" he said of land that includes the West Bank and Gaza. ""It clashes with the principle of sovereignty, but what can you do?""
Speaking to the council on Tuesday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki rejected that language and said it was time to recognize the state of Palestine at the United Nations.
""We were not granted a veto right over Israel's admission to the United Nations 75 years ago,"" he said. ""Israel does not have a veto right over the admission of the state of Palestine 75 years later.""
Several Arab and Muslim nations expressed support for an international conference to take up the issue, as did Russia's foreign minister.
""The objective of such a conference would be the proclamation of the Palestinian state; coming up with measures to ensure reliable security for Israel; and the normalization of Israel's relations with all Arab states, and also Muslim states, as a whole,"" Sergey Lavrov told the council.
The United States supports a two-state solution as the only durable path to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
""To achieve this future, the Israeli and Palestinian people, as well as their leaders, must make hard choices,"" said Uzra Zeya, U.S. undersecretary of state for civilian security, democracy and human rights.
""We do not purport to make these decisions for them. But we believe strongly that if they are willing to pursue these goals, they can help to usher in an era where Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace,"" she said.
Following Netanyahu's remarks, U.S. President Joe Biden said ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions,"" giving as an example, countries that belong to the United Nations but do not have their own militaries.
Calls for a cease-fire
Nearly all U.N. Security Council members appealed for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza in order to get aid in and for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.
Israeli Ambassador Gilad Erdan criticized those calls, saying it would only benefit Hamas.
""What do you think will happen if there is a cease-fire?"" Erdan asked. ""I will tell you what will happen â Hamas will remain in power. They will regroup and rearm, and soon, Israelis will face another attempted Holocaust.""
The United States, Britain and the European Union have all designated Hamas a terror group."

VIENNA (Sputnik) - Russia is indignant at the lack of reaction from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to the deadly strikes carried out by Ukraine on Donetsk, Russia's mission to the OSCE said on Monday.
On Sunday, Ukraine fired 152 mm and 155 mm caliber shells at a market in a bustling district of Donetsk, leaving at least 28 dead and over 20 more injured.
""We are indignant at the lack of reaction from the OSCE's senior personnel, including Malta's current chairmanship and Secretary General Helga Schmid, to the barbaric attack conducted by [Ukrainian President] Volodymyr Zelensky's formations on Donetsk (Tekstilshchik neighborhood unit) on the morning of January 21 2024,"" the mission said.
The mission decried the fact that the OSCE had turned a blind eye to all prior Ukrainian attacks on Russian cities, which, it said, amounted to the organization aligning itself with the actions of the Ukrainian military.
Russia's Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights said its head, Valery Fadeyev, reached out to various international organizations and rights groups with a call to respond to the Ukrainian military's attack on a civilian neighborhood it knew contained no military targets.
""We are calling on you and the international community to condemn the criminal acts committed by the Ukrainian authorities. We ask that you use your power and tools of influence on Kiev to put an end to the flagrant violations of human rights,"" Fadeyev wrote in his letters.
The letters were sent to OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities Kairat Abdrakhmanov, the International Committee of the Red Cross, international human rights organization Amnesty International, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.

Tehran, IRNA --  Senior Yemeni official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi has said that the latest US and UK attacks on the country will not deter the Yemenis from supporting Gaza.
""The US-UK targeting is a new attempt to deter Yemen from supporting Gaza, stopping its naval operations, which will not be achieved,""  al-Houthi was quoted by Almasirah as saying on Tuesday.
He said that Yemen's naval operations in the Red Sea are aimed at preventing the massacre of the people of Gaza and their siege, adding that the Americans are bombing the people of Yemen to protect the ""criminal terrorist enemy of Israel"".
The US and UK should understand that we are ready to respond and that our people do not know the term surrender, he stressed.
Reports coming from Yemen suggest there were several explosions early on Tuesday in the capital Sana'a as a result of new US and British attacks on the country.
The US and the UK have launched their aerial strikes on Yemen multiple times in recent weeks to protect Israeli interests and to prevent the Yemeni army's attacks on Israeli-linked ships which have been carried out to prevent the regime's genocide in Gaza.
The attacks have sparked condemnations with many countries accusing Washington and London of violating Yemen's sovereignty.

C3SWOPBTQG_2WCMAG7DKVPUYJT,Kayin Border Guard Force cuts ties with Myanmar junta,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240125-rfa03.htm,"Observers say the move diminishes the military's power and the junta's influence on ethnic groups.
By RFA Burmese 2024.01.25 -- The decision by the commander of the Border Guard Force in southeastern Myanmar's Kayin state to cut ties with the ruling junta has dealt a blow to the regime's military might and undermined its influence on the country's ethnic groups, observers said Thursday.
Earlier this month, Col. Saw Chit Thu, an ethnic Karen former leader of the insurgent Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, said his junta-affiliated Border Guard Force, or BGF, would no longer answer to the junta, which pays the group's salaries, or fight against Karen people living in the state.
He also proclaimed the BGF's neutrality in the armed resistance to junta rule.
Political observers and analysts told RFA Burmese that the breakup is significant because it diminishes the military's power and the junta's influence over ethnic minority groups, many of which have fought regime in the three years since it seized power in a coup d'Ã©tat.
The announcement came after Saw Chit Thu, general secretary and senior advisor of Kayin's BGF, withdrew about 300 BGF soldiers from a military base it shared with junta troops near the border with Thailand.
The colonel oversees 13 battalions with more than 7,200 soldiers in Kayin and neighboring Mon state, which patrol parts of Kayin's Myawaddy district, including the border with Thailand and the Chinese-backed Yatai Shwe Kokko Special Economic Zone.
He met with Lt. Gen. Soe Win, vice chairman of the junta, on Jan. 23 in the Kayin state capital Hpa-an to discuss the matter.
""The lieutenant general said that he would report the discussion to the commander-in-chief,"" Saw Chit Thu told RFA on Wednesday, referring to junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. ""We hope to resolve these issues. They are still being negotiated.""
Living in peace
Saw Chit Thu said BGF members no longer want to fight against their own people.
In 1994, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, or DKBA, split from the ethnic Karen National Union and signed a cease-fire agreement with the government, pledging support for offensives against its former group in exchange for military and financial assistance. In August 2010, the DKBA joined the Border Guard Force, part of the national army.
""It has been 30 years that the Karen people have fought and killed each other,"" said Saw Chit Thu. ""If we continue accepting support from the Tatmadaw [Myanmar military], we would have to continue to perform the duties of soldiers under its guidance.""
""For us, salary is not the main thing, but rather to live in peace,"" he said.
Analysts and ethnic armed organizations welcomed the news that the Kayin state BGF would go it alone.
Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-based political analyst, said the decision amounted to a peaceful revolution against the junta.
""The military has nothing more it can do. That's why they [left talks] without giving any answer. They dare not say that they will fight, or that they will allow [the separation],"" she said.
Hedging its bets
Political commentator Than Soe Naing questioned the Kayin BGF's intentions and suggested the group is hedging its bets.
""It will not be possible to stand by itself for a long time,"" he said. ""If the cards are stacked against the junta, it will join the KNU, but if it's the other way around, it will return to cooperating with the junta and continue to be a Border Guard Force.""
Col. Saw Kyaw Nyunt, secretary general of the Karen National Liberation Army-Peace Council, said that the move will benefit the Karen region and its people.
""My understanding is that existing independently and working for peace, which they want to do, will be much better than fighting and killing,"" he told RFA.
RFA could not reach KNU spokesman Padoh Saw Taw Nee or junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw min Tun for comment on the Kayin BGF's decision to split from the national army.
The Karen Information Center on Wednesday cited BGF Chairman Major Gen. Saw Tun Hlaing as saying that the junta had removed BGF Director Major Gen. Thet Paing Oo for failing to persuade the Kayin BGF to stay with the military.
In December 2023, Saw Chit Thu was sanctioned by the U.K. government for alleged human trafficking, forced labor and human rights violations in the China-backed Shwe Kokko New City project, a hub for gambling, online scams and other crimes, the online journal The Irrawaddy reported. The project is said to be a major source of income for the colonel and the Kayin BGF.
""We do not accept scam businesses because they are illegal,"" Saw Chit Thu told RFA on Wednesday.
""We plan to send the people involved back [to their countries],"" he added.

Monday, 22 January 2024 6:30 PM
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says the besieged Gaza Strip is experiencing the longest communications shutdown that has kept the territory cut off from the outside world over the past week.
In a Monday post on X, UNRWA, the largest UN organization in Gaza, said the telecommunication services in Gaza have been down for the past seven days.
It said ""disruption of telecommunication services prevents people accessing life-saving information, calling first responders & continues to impede humanitarian response.""
The Palestinian telecoms provider Paltel confirmed the complete loss of all telecommunications services in Gaza on Monday. ""We regret to announce that telecom services in Gaza Strip have been lost,"" Paltel said in a post on X.
""Gaza is blacked out again for the 10th time since October 7th due to the ongoing and escalating aggression.""
A near-total communications blackout across the territory leaves the civilians unable to call for help. Aid workers have also been struggling to reach the injured.
Digital civil rights group Access Now said last week that the telecommunications blackout in the Gaza has become a ""matter of life and death.""
""It is unconscionable to toy with connectivity amidst unprecedented violence and unfathomable human suffering,"" Marwa Fatafta, the group's policy and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement on January 18.
Gaza has been under Israeli bombardment since early October. The regime's troops have also been engaged in ground hostilities in the besieged territory.
Israel has killed more than 25,000 people, mostly women and children, in Gaza ever since.
The regime was caught off-guard by the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm conducted by the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas on October 7."

Israel said Wednesday that its troops carried out airstrikes and ground attacks in northern, central and southern Gaza, while the U.N. chief warned of the ""heartbreaking and catastrophic"" effects of the war on Palestinian civilians and a U.S. envoy's visit to the region included discussion of a potential new temporary cease-fire.
The Israeli military actions included the city of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where fighting has grown more intense in recent weeks and Israel said it had encircled the area.
An Israeli military warning told people in parts of northern Khan Younis to evacuate, the latest such order that Israel says is meant to protect civilians from the fighting. But with the war moving farther south, and nearly all of the population having fled their homes, there are fewer and fewer safe places for civilians to go.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the evacuation order affected an area with 88,000 residents in addition to an estimated 425,000 displaced people sheltering in schools and other sites. The area is also home to 20% of the ""remaining partially functioning hospitals across the Gaza Strip,"" the agency said.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council that Gaza's entire population ""is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history.""
The White House said Tuesday that Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in Cairo as part of the latest efforts to secure a temporary cease-fire that would include mechanisms for releasing hostages held by Hamas in Gaza as well as freeing Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
""The conversations are very sober and serious about trying to get another hostage deal in place,"" John Kirby, spokesperson for the National Security Council, told reporters.
In late November, about 100 of the 240 hostages Hamas seized in the militants' Oct. 7 shock attack on Israel were released during a weeklong cease-fire in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But none of the estimated 130 or more remaining hostages in Gaza has been freed since then and authorities believe two dozen or so of them have since died or been killed.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom and European Union, after its militants killed about 1,200 people in an October attack, according to Israeli tallies.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 25,490 Palestinians have been killed in the war, many of them women and children. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and Hamas fighters in its tally of those who have been killed.

CBVCIWF8XV_VS7N8HB7S9CHVCZ,Bhutan 'open for business' as voters choose former PM Tobgay to rebuild economy,_,_,20240122,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240121-rfa01.htm,"Harvard-educated conservation advocate, who served as Bhutan's prime minister between 2013 and 2018, was returned amid economic troubles.
By Tenzin Pema for RFA Tibetan 2024.01.21 -- ""Bhutan is open for business,"" wrote Prime Minister-elect Tshering Tobgay on X, after the people of the tiny Himalayan kingdom returned him to power in parliamentary elections this month.
Analysts say Tobgay's two-thirds majority win indicates the 800,000 people of Bhutan are pinning their hopes on an experienced hand to rebuild the economy, reverse an ongoing migration crisis, and strengthen ties with the landlocked nation's two neighbors, India and Tibet, amidst ongoing border negotiations with China.
The victory by Harvard-educated conservation advocate Tobgay, 58 - who served as Bhutan's second democratically elected prime minister between 2013 and 2018 - comes as the country faces ""unprecedented challenges"" that are prompting it to tailor its famed ""Gross National Happiness""(GNH) policy to one that takes into account its economic needs.
Tobgay's People's Democratic Party (PDP) - which promised to leverage GNH in its efforts to turn Bhutan into a developed nation - won 30 of the 47 National Assembly seats, while its rival Bhutan Tendrel Party (BTP) won the remaining 17 seats in Bhutan's fourth general elections since its 2008 transition from an from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy, with a bicameral elected parliament.
Bhutan's GNH index was first conceptualized in 1972 by the King Jigme Singye Wangchuk as a ""holistic approach"" to sustainable development and a more important measure of growth than gross domestic product. Since then, the country's leaders have promoted and the model -- which emphasizes good governance, sustainable development, cultural preservation and promotion, and environmental conservation -- widely regarded as Bhutan's soft power export to the world.
However, concerns about the economy and record high youth unemployment levels of 28.6%, which have forced young Bhutanese to emigrate in large numbers for better job opportunities, have weighed on this election, with both parties citing economic growth as a key priority.
The PDP has said it believes that ""...GNH should continue to be the springboard to enhance peace, prosperity, and happiness for all Bhutanese in our collective journey to become a developed nation.""
""The PDP has the experience of having worked as the opposition in the first democratic government and as the ruling party in the second. So, it has exposure to different aspects of governance,"" said Dasho Kunzang Wangdi, Bhutan's former chief election commissioner, who set up and ran the country's first democratic elections in 2008.
""We are hopeful their efforts will be geared towards not only reviving but also giving an added fillip to economic growth and balancing that with the need to ensure the general well-being of the people of Bhutan,"" he added.
Balancing happiness and growth
Tobgay - who detailed an ambitious 12-point economic transformation plan to turn Bhutan into a developed nation by 2047 - is expected to lead the implementation of a 15 billion ngultrum (US$181 million) economic stimulus plan and drive initiatives to attract foreign direct investment, improve ease of doing business, and boost export and tourism levels.
""Our nation's economy is teetering on the brink of collapse. With an average growth rate of just 1.7% in the past five years, our economy is at its worst in our recent history,"" said Tobgay in his party's manifesto, titled 'A Contract with Bhutan.'
""The next five years are crucial for us to rebuild - get our economy back on track, enable private businesses to thrive, increase job opportunities, revitalize our education and healthcare systems, uplift the poor, empower our public servants, transform agriculture, and boost national revenue generation,"" Tobgay added.
He also plans to accelerate Bhutan's hydropower and renewable energy generation, while bolstering the country's private sector through the establishment of special economic zones and the privatization and divestmens of state-owned enterprises to boost capital markets.
Tobgay's office did not immediately respond to Radio Free Asia's request for comment on his program.
Tobgay's approach represents ""a pragmatic tailoring of the GNH concept to what the world needs today,"" Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a Washington, D.C. think tank.
""Bhutan knows that it cannot be isolated from the rest of the world and the rest of the economy, and that's why this whole special economic zone has been proposed. And I think that is a classic example of how Bhutan tailors its GNH concept with its economic growth and economic need,"" he told Radio Free Asia.
Bhutan has been gradually boosting the communications and information technology sector since the early 2010s, and the move to set up the SEZs intends to draw investment and sustainable development through service-intensive projects such as resorts and IT parks, rather than industrial projects, Shivamurthy said.
""There's a massive expectation from the new government. I think people have voted for this new government for the very reason that they know this party... and expect that this experienced party will offer them solutions rather than a new party coming in and trying to start from scratch,"" he added.
Namgay Pem, a Bhutanese citizen who cast her vote at the Lingmu-Toedwang Constituency in Punakha District, one of the 20 dzongkhags or districts comprising Bhutan, echoed that sentiment.
""The interventions that the government brings in should not compromise the happiness and well-being of the citizens, and that GNH, which is the main philosophy, should guide all the developmental and economic developments in the country,"" she said.
Relations with India and China
The election was closely watched by India, against the backdrop of Bhutan's ongoing border negotiations with China - an issue of strategic concern for India, which has faced border disputes and skirmishes with its northern neighbor.
In October, Bhutanese Foreign Minister Dr Tandi Dorji visited Beijing and met with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, after which the two sides expressed their determination to accelerate the boundary demarcation process.
Border talks between the two countries have been focused on two key areas of dispute: the strategic Doklam plateau and other areas in western Bhutan, which lie near the India-Bhutan-China border; and the Jakarlung and Pasamlung valleys that lie near Tibet.
""Given India's special relationship with Bhutan, it is important for India to make sure that (any border) agreement (with China) does not strategically damage India's interest,"" said Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshshila Institute in India.
""That's largely what India's priority should be and one part of that is obviously highlighting to the Bhutanese public the threats the Chinese encroachment presents and we have seen some of that take place,"" he added.
A report by UK-based Chatham House, released in December, showed China had continued its ""unsanctioned programme of settlement construction"" across the contested border in the north of Bhutan, based on analysis of satellite imagery from September.
""The new outposts in Bhutan's remote Jakarlung Valley, part of the Beyul Khenpajong region, may become permanent Chinese territory after an announcement on a border deal between the two countries expected soon,"" wrote John Pollock and Damien Symon of Chatham House. ""It is thought that Bhutan, in a major concession, will give up the land that China has seized in both Jakarlung and the neighboring Menchuma Valley,"" they added.
Kewalramani said Bhutan-China's three-step roadmap will require first understanding where the border lies on paper and then visiting the places on the ground, before finally demarcating the actual boundary.
""So this is not a small, easy short-term process and I think Bhutan is discussing these changes with India... Bhutan does take into account India's interest because of the special nature of that relationship,"" he added.
""I think with Tshering Tobgay coming in, there is some relief that these border negotiations with China will happen with even more sensitivity towards India and with even more open conversations with India and that is something that is expected,"" said Shivamurthy.

CCN3M2LYI9_VUQKIYZJL0HFMUE,Madrasahs Go Mainstream: Taliban To Grant University Degrees To Religious Students In New Blow To Secular Education,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Radio Azadi, Abubakar Siddique January 25, 2024
Since seizing power, the Taliban has appointed its foot soldiers, commanders, and leaders as ministers and the heads of state-run institutions in Afghanistan, including universities and hospitals.
The decision has triggered widespread criticism among Afghans, who have accused the Taliban of hiring unqualified and uneducated fighters and clerics to key positions in its government.
In a move that is seen as a response to that criticism, the extremist group announced on January 20 that it would be granting graduates of madrasahs, or Islamic seminaries, the equivalent of high school diplomas and university degrees.
Afghan academics and educators say the Taliban is trying to pave the way for its members and loyalists to dominate government ministries and institutions.
Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, thousands of civil servants who worked for the Western-backed Afghan government have remained on the payroll of the Taliban government. But many have been forced to sign pledges that they will adhere to Islamic Shari'a law or were subjected to a test that gauged their knowledge of Islam.
""The Taliban loyalists are being gifted bachelor's and master's degrees,"" Jehandad Jehani, a former economics professor at Khost University in southeastern Afghanistan, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.
""This step will deny jobs to [non-Talibs] in the government and public sector,"" Jehani said. ""People pursued formal studies for decades to help equip themselves for specific roles.""
The Taliban's government is dominated by clerics and lacks management experience and expert knowledge, which analysts say has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian and economic crises in the country.
Overhauling The System
Under the previous Afghan government, madrasahs were often informal and offered religious instruction to children in mainly poor communities.
But since the Taliban takeover, the militants have overhauled the education system in Afghanistan. They have converted scores of secular schools, public universities, and vocational training centers into Islamic seminaries, leading to a surge in the number of madrasahs in the country.
The Islamist group has also vowed to change the national curriculum and build a vast network of madrasahs across the country's 34 provinces.
Hundreds of university professors and schoolteachers have been fired from their positions or fled the country, while teenage girls and women have been banned from receiving an education.
Afghan educators say the Taliban is bent on rooting out all forms of the modern secular education that thrived in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion in 2001 toppled the group's first regime.
In its latest attempt to undermine secular education, the Taliban's Ministry of Higher Education said on January 20 that it will grant the equivalent of high school diplomas as well as bachelor's and master's degrees to graduates of Taliban-run madrasahs.
The ministry said madrasah students who complete six years of education will get the equivalent of high school diplomas. Students who complete eight years of education will be granted a bachelor's degree, while those with 11 years of religious education will be given a master's degree after passing a test.
The move is likely to see tens of thousands of madrasah graduates receive formal qualifications, which are limited to Islamic subjects, including jurisprudence and Shari'a law.
The Taliban said it is currently administering exams across Afghanistan that will see some 50,000 madrasah students graduate with new diplomas and degrees.
""Now that they are equating the academic credentials of the madrasahs with those of the universities, it will render the latter irrelevant,"" Noorullah Shad, a former university professor in Khost, told Radio Azadi.
""One can graduate from a madrasah in eight years, but it takes 16 years to finish [secular] school and get a bachelor's degree from the university,"" he added.
Asif Nang, a former Afghan education minister, said secular Afghan universities offered degrees in Islamic studies even before the Taliban takeover. But he said religious instruction has now overshadowed secular education.
He said the Taliban's new decision is likely to pave the way for even more of its members to secure jobs in the government and state-run institutions.
Nang said the move is part of a broader effort by the Taliban to transform from a guerrilla insurgency into a functional government.
""The Taliban wants to transform its fighters from nonstate actors into state actors,"" he said.

24 January 2024
The Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron met the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem.
The Foreign Secretary reiterated UK support for Israel's efforts to secure the release of the 136 hostages from Gaza after the barbaric Hamas attack of 7 October. The Foreign Secretary explained that he wants to see an immediate humanitarian pause to get hostages out and aid in, leading to a sustainable ceasefire without a return to hostilities. To enable this, Hamas must agree to the release of all hostages, they could no longer be in charge in Gaza firing rockets at Israel, and an agreement must be in place for the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza to provide governance, services and security.
The Foreign Secretary underlined the need for a political strategy to achieve long term peace.  This must be based on a credible and irreversible pathway to achieve a Palestinian State alongside Israel, allowing Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.
They discussed the urgency of getting significantly more aid into Gaza to alleviate the desperate situation there. The Foreign Secretary reiterated the need for Israel to open more crossing points into Gaza, for Nitzana and Kerem Shalom to be open for longer, and for Israel to support the UN to distribute aid effectively across the whole of Gaza. The Foreign Secretary also underlined the need for Israel to ensure effective deconfliction in Gaza, and to take all possible measures to ensure the safety of medical personnel and facilities.
The Foreign Secretary also met Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, and Minister without Portfolio Benny Gantz whilst in Jerusalem, and Palestine Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah."
CGSMFHM0ST_JKRV4AWS0ABZPXH,Fuel pumps again running on empty in Laos,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-rfa03.htm,"Nationwide diesel shortage compounded by country's overreliance on imports from neighbors.
By RFA Lao 2024.01.24 -- Laos is again running out of gasoline, an indication that the country is still too dependent on its neighbors for fuel supplies and has failed to build adequate reserves following severe nationwide shortages in 2022.
Specifically, diesel fuel is hard to come by these days, as station after station has put up makeshift signs saying they are all sold out, urging lines of hundreds of vehicles to turn back and refuel elsewhere.
Diesel, as opposed to regular gas, is important for shipping and commerce and necessary to keep supply lines open.
The Lao government raised the official price of fuel four times in January alone, even though gas prices have been falling in the rest of the world.
""I waited at the gas station for half an hour for diesel,"" a motorist in the capital Vientiane told RFA Lao on condition of anonymity for security reasons. ""A few hours later the station was completely out.""
He was only allowed to purchase 200,000 kip (US$9.66) worth of diesel at each station and had to drive to several stations to fill up the tank.
The motorist compared the situation to 2022, when gas shortages were but one indication of the country's severely ailing economy at the time.
He was only allowed to purchase 200,000 kip (US$9.66) worth of diesel at each station and had to drive to several stations to fill up the tank.
The current price of diesel in Vientiane is 20,780 kip per liter ($3.76 per U.S. liquid gallon), up 600 kip (three cents) from last week.
A truck driver in the southern province of Savannakhet ran into a similar issue while trying to refuel there, saying he was turned away at several stations before finally getting a chance to refuel.
""I put more than four-million-kip (US$200) worth of diesel into my truck,"" he said. ""I'm afraid that the shortage will soon get worse.""
A gas station attendant in Vientiane told RFA that most stations do have regular gas to sell, but are out of diesel.
""I just asked my boss, who said we don't have any diesel right now and we have no idea when we'll have more,"" he said.
An attendant in Savannakhet said they were running out at the station he works at.
""We have only about 1,000 liters (about 266 gallons) of diesel left, so since yesterday, we aren't selling diesel to large vehicles like tractor trailers, only to small cars.""
An employee of a fuel import company in Vientiane said that to ease the shortage it distributed 4,000 liters of diesel to each gas station in the capital on Wednesday morning.
But a gas station attendant said that the 4,000 liters would be sold in only two hours.
We're working on it
The government has been frantically trying to fix the problem, an official from the Lao Ministry of Industry and Trade told RFA.
""All relevant departments of the government are trying to solve the shortage,"" he said. ""They've already issued a couple of announcements this morning.""
A statement from the Lao Fuel and Gas Association on Tuesday said the reason behind the shortage was that key oil refineries in neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam have suspended production to upgrade their production lines, and that they should resume production by the end of the month.
The Interior Trade Department, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Lao Fuel and Gas Association have, meanwhile, been in talks with fuel importers and distributors to try to find solutions.
On Wednesday morning, the Interior Trade Department said in a statement that Laos imports 140 million liters (37 million gallons) of fuel per month, 80% of which is diesel. In January alone, Laos imported 106 million liters (28 million gallons), not enough for the rest of the month - especially because demand is expected to increase as the shortage is prolonged.
Price spike
The prices keep going up because the kip is again depreciating against the U.S. dollar, an official from the Ministry of Industry and Trade told RFA.
""We buy gasoline in U.S. dollars from other countries and sell it in kip,"" he said. ""When we want to buy more gas, we have to exchange the kip for U.S. dollars. To keep up with the depreciation we have to raise prices.""
The kip had been only slightly declining against the U.S. dollar until late 2021, when it fell off a cliff. According to xe.com, in September 2021 $1 was worth about 9500 kip. By the end of 2022 it had passed the 17,000 mark. The kip stabilized in the beginning of 2023, but continued its decline in April and passed the 20,000 mark in September, before stabilizing again at around 20,500 in the last few months of the year.
The nationwide gas shortage is partly due to a shortage in foreign currency, the English-language Vientiane Times, a mouthpiece for the Lao government, reported Wednesday.
The report also mentioned the temporary closure of an oil refinery in Thailand, saying that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Lao Fuel and Gas Association were trying to buy diesel fuel from other sources to fill the gap.

Earlier today (Tuesday), the Chief of the General Staff,   LTG Herzi Halevi, conducted a preliminary examination at the location in   the Gaza Strip where 21 IDF soldiers were killed in action yesterday.
""This morning, the State of Israel woke up to a difficult   and painful announcement: 21 casualties. The finest of this country's   sons, who volunteered to defend our home and paid the ultimate price. We   share in the sorrow of their families for the heavy loss and know that   the pain is unbearable.
If this provides any consolation, I want   the families to know - they fell in battle near the border fence during a   defensive operation in the area separating the Israeli communities from   Gaza. The sole purpose of this mission is to create the security   conditions for the safe return of the residents of the Gaza Strip to   their homes. For this purpose, we went to war, a war that began with a   cruel attempt to end lives, and we are more determined than ever to   restore life here.
I have just returned from the location where   the soldiers fell and met with the commanders. I heard preliminary   insights and initial lessons. We, as always, will thoroughly investigate   the event and learn the lessons, even during combat, so that such an   event is not repeated.
Today, we mourn the loss of 21 soldiers -   all of them reservists deserving immense respect and appreciation from   the entire state - for volunteering, for their determination, and for   their infinite readiness [to serve]. They began their service together   in the Givati Brigade and continued in the reserves. They come from all   parts of Israeli society and from across the State of Israel - they are a   role model and an example for us all. None are dearer to us than them.   We bow our heads but stand tall in the face of the continued fight and   the defense of our home. We are still fighting.
The war will be   long, and many challenges await us. We are refreshing the forces and   changing combat methods, knowing that we will again call upon the   reservists after they have rested. We are attentive to all the   reservists, embracing and appreciating them all. Given the overall   mission, we remain focused - for the security of the civilians of the   State of Israel.
On this difficult day, it is important to   mention that we have been fighting for 108 consecutive days and are not   forgetting October 7th, not forgetting why we went to war. Throughout   the past day, we have been expanding our operations in Khan Yunis,   accumulating additional successes, and simultaneously continuing to   fight in the northern Gaza Strip and deepening our achievements. We are   eliminating and striking many terrorists and commanders - Hamas   murderers against whom we will continue to operate with great   determination.
On this day, we feel the great and painful cost of   war, but that which we are fighting is necessary and justified. We will   continue to fight for our clear right to live here securely."""

Tehran, IRNA -- The invasion of Yemen is tantamount to an invasion of the Islamic ummah, an official of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has said while reacting to the recent US-UK aggression against the Arab country.
Sami Abu Zuhri was quoted as saying by Samanews on Tuesday that attacks on Yemen reflects is an attempt by the US and Britain to spread the ongoing conflict in Palestine to other parts of the region.
The authorities of the two countries must take responsibility for the ramifications of inciting the Islamic ummah and for creating insecurity in Islamic countries, Abu Zuhri underlined.
The comments came hours after US and British fighter jets launched a fresh round of attacks on targets in Yemen.
US and UK forces began carrying out air, ship and submarine strikes against Yemen's Ansarullah fighters early on January 11, allegedly targeting weapons storage, air defense, and logistic facilities.
The strikes came a day after the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution against Yemen's Anarullah resistance movement condemning its strikes in the Red Sea against Israeli-linked ships.

The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has condemned the deliberate targeting of Gaza's hospitals by Israel as a ""war crime,"" urging the international community to take immediate action to stop it.
Hamas, in a statement on Tuesday, called on the United Nations, and other international bodies to take immediate action against the Israeli aggression against medical centers in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis.
The Palestinian resistance also warned that the Israeli attacks put the lives of patients, medical staff and the refugees at hospitals, at risk.
Earlier in the day, Gaza's health ministry said the Israeli tanks fired directly at the upper floors of the specialized surgery building at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.
The regime has also blockaded and targeted other hospitals in southern Gaza, claiming that Hamas fighters operate in and around these places. Hamas has denied the allegations.
Khan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Strip, has been the focus of the regime's latest strikes.
Some 190 people have been killed over the past 24 hours, almost a third of them in Khan Yunis.
At Khan Younis's main hospital, the biggest still functioning in the Gaza Strip, bodies were being buried on the grounds because it was unsafe to go out to the cemetery.
At the European Hospital, reached by media outlets in southern Khan Younis, Ahed Masmah brought in five corpses, piled on a mattress on his donkey cart. ""I found them face-down in the street,"" he said. ""I did a good thing and brought them in.""
Footage filmed by Palestinian journalist Hamdan El-Dahdouh showed persistent gunfire hitting the top of the main building.
""I am besieged at Nasser Hospital now and my life is in great danger. The smell of death, the only smell I know, is filling the place,"" Dr Mahmoud Abu Shammala posted on Facebook.
On the 109th day of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, the death toll has risen to more than 25,500, predominantly comprising women and children.
Despite its deadly and destructive campaign in Gaza, Israel has so far failed to achieve its main goals in the onslaught, namely destroying Hamas and securing the release of its captives through military means.
The World Health Organization said most of the enclave's 36 hospitals have been damaged by Israeli bombing. Only 15 are partially functioning and those are operating at up to three times their capacity, without adequate fuel or medical supplies, it says.
On Thursday, the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas announced the destruction of more than 390 schools, universities, and educational institutions in over 100 days of brutal bombardment of the besieged strip by the Israeli regime.
Hamas said that the destruction of school and university buildings in the Gaza Strip ""is a war crime and criminal behavior aimed at destroying all components of human life.""
The resistance group stated that Israel is deliberately targeting the education system to erode the national identity of Palestinians."

GAZA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian death toll from the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 25,490 since Oct. 7, 2023, the Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday.
The Israeli army killed 195 Palestinians and wounded 354 others over the past 24 hours, the ministry said in a press statement.
""A number of victims are still under the rubble, and ambulances and the civil defense crew cannot reach them,"" the ministry added.
On Monday, the Israeli army intensified its assault on the southern Khan Younis city, storming medical centers and killing dozens of Palestinians, making it the fiercest fighting in the area so far.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, suffered its deadliest single attack on Monday, in which 21 soldiers were killed in central Gaza.
The soldiers were preparing explosives to demolish two buildings when militants launched a rocket-propelled grenade at a nearby tank, triggering a premature explosion that resulted in the collapse of the buildings while the soldiers were either inside or nearby.
According to official Israeli figures, a total of 219 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the country waged a war against Hamas, following the Hamas-led assault on southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken as hostages to Gaza."

GAZA, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 Palestinians have been killed and dozens of others wounded by Israeli bombings on shelter centers of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical sources said on Monday.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said in a press statement that it had received ""reports of deaths and injuries among the displaced as a result of the occupation's bombings of shelter centers.""
""Israeli tanks approached Al-Amal Hospital, and we completely lost contact with our crews in Khan Younis as a result of the ground incursion,"" it added.
The organization said that ambulances were unable to reach the injured in Khan Younis, because of Israeli forces' siege of its ambulance center and ""targeting anyone who tries to move around.""
In addition, the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza said in a press statement that Israel had targeted five shelter centers in the city of Khan Younis.
The statement noted that ""the Israeli army targeted the displacement centers with direct bombardments, Quadcopter aircraft, drone aircraft, and artillery, which led to dozens of deaths and wounded.""
Ashraf Al-Qedra, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said in a press statement that ""the Israeli occupation is committing horrific crimes west of Khan Younis.""
He added that ""dozens of deaths and wounded are still in the targeted places and roads,"" and the Israeli forces prevented ambulances from transferring the wounded people and retrieving the bodies of the victims in the west of Khan Younis."

Fighters from the Iraqi anti-terror resistance groups have launched a drone strike against targets at a strategic port in the 1948 Israeli-occupied territories in response to the Tel Aviv regime's unrelenting ground and aerial offensives against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of anti-terror fighters, in a statement published on its Telegram channel, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Port of Ashdod, located about 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) south of Tel Aviv, early on Tuesday.
It said the drone strike was carried out in line with struggle against the occupying Israeli regime, in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and in retaliation for the massacres that the usurping Zionist entity is perpetrating against women, children and elderly people in the coastal area.
The group noted that it will continue to target and destroy strategic sites across the occupied lands.
Earlier, Lebanon's Arabic-language al-Mayadeen television news network, citing informed sources speaking on condition of anonymity, reported that a salvo of rockets had struck the US military base at the Conoco gas field in Syria's eastern province of Dayr al-Zawr.
There were no immediate reports about the extent of damage at the military facility, and possible casualties.
Unmanned aerial vehicles also targeted Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq's western province of Anbar, where US military forces are stationed on alleged training and advisory missions.
The strikes come amid smoldering anti-US sentiments in the region over Washington's unconditional support for Israel's atrocious onslaught against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Israel has launched relentless air and ground attacks on the coastal enclave, targeting hospitals, residences, and houses of worship, since Palestinian resistance movements launched a surprise attack, dubbed Operation al-Aqsa Storm, against the regime on October 7.
At least 24,620 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Another 61,830 individuals have sustained injuries as well.
The United States, Israel's biggest ally, has provided the regime with thousands of arms consignments since the initiation of the war.
The US House of Representatives on November 2 passed a standalone $14.3-billion military assistance package for Israel. The legislation, however, is yet to clear the Senate.
Washington has also vetoed United Nations Security Council resolutions that called on the occupying regime to cease its aggression."

Check against delivery!
Good afternoon, bonsoir,
Minister [for Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia, Bujar Osmani],
Excellencies,
Members of the Parliament,
Ambassadors,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure for me to be here with you this afternoon, to welcome you to discuss one of the most significant threats of our time. It is not about a bomb that can kill you, it is about a poison that can colonise your minds - and how to address it. How can we address together the Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI).
I hope, FIMI will become something familiar, something that people understand what it is about, as they learned to know what is COVID-19.
Four years ago, when I began my mandate, Russia and others had already built an extensive infrastructure for lying, manipulating and destabilising on an industrial scale and in a sophisticated manner.
Well, lies already existed. In Spanish, we say ""bulo"" - a ""bulo"" is something [such as] a rumour. You spread a rumour in the Middle Ages. The Jewish people were the victims of rumours, no? ""Oh, the Jewish kill young children and they drink the blood, or they put poison in the [water] sources to kill people."" It has always existed.
But now we are much more vulnerable to this threat because information circulates at the speed of light, and manipulation and interference have become an industrial activity.
We have been working a lot in order to make our people wiser, to have information, to know. Coming from illiteracy, not being able to read, to have enough information in order to be able to discern, to be able to choose. And at a certain moment in time, in order to participate in elections, you had to prove that you were able to read. Now, everybody has the right to participate in the elections. But the problem is not to be able to read and to know, the problem is to be misinformed, to be facing systematically an information which is false and can completely trump your understanding of reality.
And then came the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw how malign actors started to undermine trust in science and literally put our lives at risk - and not always ordinary people. You can remember someone who was not exactly an ordinary person, giving absurd advice about how to fight against the illness. Remember that people were saying ""Drink that, do that"", putting lives of [other] people at risk.
And then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and with that, we have been facing a full-fledged instrument of war. A war that targets not only us, but our partners in the Western Balkans. That is why, we invited my friend, Minister [of Foreign Affairs] from North Macedonia, who can explain you case studies of how disinformation works.
And that is why also, we have here our distinguished Member of the European Parliament who has written an extraordinary book - a best-seller - about some misinformation, disinformation and foreign manipulation.
FIMI actors actively seek to undermine democracy, proposing an alternative model, making people mistrust everything - mistrust institutions and toxically infiltrating our societies, to poison them.
So, we had to respond. And I think that our response has been important, decisive, advancing our capacities from the Strategic Compass. When I presented the Strategic Compass and made the list of the threats, disinformation was there, and imposing restrictive measures - sanctions, colloquially, we say sanctions - against disinformation actors and banning disinformation channels in Europe.
Now, we are facing a new wave of information manipulation during the war between Israel and Hamas. Let me share a real-life example, something that happened.
On 31 October, people in Paris, Parisians, woke up to the sight of 250 blue Stars of David spray-painted on buildings across the city. Not one, not two, but 250, strategically located around the city of Paris, marking the homes where Jewish people were living.
This reminds us [of] the worst days of the Holocaust and some of the darkest times in European history, and this spread quickly on social media.
Well, in another genocide that happened in Africa, also the houses of the people that were going to be killed were marked the previous day in order to guide the killers. But imagine the shock in Paris when people saw, in 250 places, the Stars of David.
Some commentators immediately started blaming the Muslim community. ""Oh, this is the Muslims. They are pushing hate against Jewish [people]"". And it immediately ignited a discussion in France breaking the social fabric, attacking political Islam and attacking multiculturalism. And these images reached many parts of the world, much beyond France.
However, a week later, the French authorities traced the incident - looked into it - and they found a Russian destabilisation campaign behind it.
It is a textbook example of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference, because the Russian perpetrators - and I can say ""the Russians"", knowing what I am saying because it has been proved and verified - identified a potential fault line in a European society. Stars of David marking the places where people are living. They pinpointed a subject that could generate divisive positions, and then immediately used over 1,000 bots to spread more than 2,500 posts on social media. As I said, many sources travelling at the speed of light.
The constant stream of lies is meant to plant the notion that all information is unreliable and not trustworthy. To disseminate the feeling that nothing is true, and everything is false. To make us suspicious about everything. That there is no such thing as the truth, and [that] there is nothing that can be trusted. This is a very uncomfortable society when you cannot trust anyone, anything.
And that is why it is a danger. Because disinformation weakens the social fabric, poisons democracies, because only information makes democracy possible. Democracy is a system that works on the basis of information, good information. That is why, dictatorships, the first thing they do is to close the newspapers, install censure and block information, [only allowing] the ones that they consider good for them.
Liberal democracies cannot live without information, without reliable information and without trust in democratic processes, such as elections.
And if we want to defend democracy, if we want to defend ourselves from manipulation, we have to protect ourselves considering that as a security threat and go to this battle with the same capacity as the ones who are attacking us.
That is why, when we presented the Strategic Compass, which planned to strengthen the European Union's security and defence policy, we made decisive actions against information manipulation as one of its pillars. We have to defend ourselves against the threats that are challenging us, and one of these threats is manipulation of the information.
If you go to the market and you buy a piece of meat, it will have a certificate saying: ""This is good, you can eat it. It is not going to kill you."" But when you receive information and your brain will process it, what is the label of quality saying ""This is true, you can believe it."" You are not going to be in a very bad shape because you eat bad information? There is none.
After the Strategic Compass, we created this Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) to help civil society in our Member States and beyond to pool their knowledge about root causes, about incidents, about threats, and we committed to the creation of a toolbox to fight Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI).
Two years after the adoption of the Compass - in the meantime, the war in Ukraine came - I can say that we have delivered, and I would like to explain to you what we have delivered.
The FIMI toolbox makes use of instruments such as restrictive measures against aggressors, which we used to ban the so called ""media"" of the Kremlin - Russia Today and Sputnik which have been banned here in Europe, not for example in other places like in the Sahel. The toolbox also provides for capacity building and works with civil society organisations to increase media literacy. Not only to be able to read but to understand which are the sources and which are the dangers behind some of the information you are consuming.
This comes at the right moment, as the Global Risk Report by the World Economic Forum has just ranked disinformation as the second biggest risk the world is going to face this year. That is difficult to believe, no? But the World Economic Forum considers that disinformation is the second biggest risk that we are going to face this year.
Additionally to that, artificial intelligence comes and has been making a real revolution on how you can manipulate content. It is much cheaper today to produce and much [more] difficult to detect an information which is completely false, making the asymmetric threats to our democracies still more dangerous.
And why this year? Because 2024 is a critical year to fight against FIMI because we have a lot of elections.
60 elections will be held around the world. Two billion people - 50% of the adult population of the world - will be asked to cast a vote. Half of the adult population of the world will be called to vote.
In the European Parliament, in the United States, in India, in many places around the world elections will become the prime targets for malign foreign actors, as we have seen last year in Spanish elections. In last year's Spanish elections, Russian agents - once again - imitated the official website of the Regional Government of Madrid two days before the elections, warning people about ETA - the former terrorist organisation that, thank God, no longer exists but before it was finished, killed more than 1,000 people in Spain. That ETA was coming back and was having a plan to attack the polling stations.
So, time and careful planning are of essence to counter such Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference attacks.
How do we have to proceed? We have to focus on four venues:
Containing incidents, to avoid them from spreading further. To detect and stop them as quick as possible.
Minimising their effects. Redirecting audiences to verified information. Make people that are sensible to one information to understand that they can check this information somewhere else.
And, maybe the most important one is strategically ignoring them, to avoid escalating an incident [by] attracting unwanted attention to this incident themselves. So maybe sometimes, the better strategy is not to give a lot of importance [to it] but encapsulate it and avoid that people know about the existence of it - not falling on it, not looking for it because they were aware that something was happening about something.
All that allows us and the people - thank you for your work - at the [European] External Action Service (EEAS) to target measures that can help us to prepare and protect societies against potential interference in elections: exposing false stories beyond the strike; restricting the amplification of manipulated content; removing websites or channels associated with FIMI; giving visibility to reliable content; identifying and limit financial incentive to FIMI activities; or taking legal measures, including sanctions. We built a legal framework to sanction people who disseminate false information.
We have a Threats Report, a Response Action Plan. And the first step is always situational awareness of what is happening.
Now we have published our second annual FIMI report that sheds light on the current threat landscape, based on 750 investigated FIMI incidents and presenting countermeasures.
In the incidents analysed, we see that different individuals are being targeted. And one of the most targeted individuals are President [of Ukraine, Volodymyr] Zelensky, another one is President [of France] Emmanuel Macron, but also movie actors to amplify their reach.
And the report also finds that Ukraine continues to be the country most often targeted by information manipulation - not by accident. It is not by accident that Ukraine is the most targeted country because, who is behind disinformation? Someone who is making war against Ukraine by the classical means of warfare.
Ukrainians are the most battle hardened, and Ukrainian civil society plays a major role in suffering disinformation and fighting against it, and we support them. We are doing a crucial work through the Foreign Policy Instrument, my services and the services of the [European] Commission, contributing to maintaining good information which is a good basis to maintain security.
For example, information that Ukraine tried to create a chemical incident in occupied Donetsk was immediately detected by social media users. They found that these images were created long before the [alleged] incident happened. But Russians immediately put this incident in order to make people believe that yes, Ukrainians in Donetsk were creating a kind of chemical weapon. Well, it is not the first time that we are being told that someone is having arms of mass destruction so, it means that the idea of sending lies to the public opinions worldwide has not been waiting until the social networks were covering the planet.
Rapid action is essential to prevent the manipulation of information from spreading, and it has to be debunked before it goes viral.
Then, we have to share information. What does it mean in concrete terms? Let's go back to the example of the Stars of David.
This operation was uncovered by the French government agency Viginum. Viginum in French, I suppose it is ""Vigile numÃ©rique"", on surveille le monde digital. Viginum, which is a digital watchdog that was created by the French government only two years ago.
Viginum shared its information with our Rapid Alert System, here in Brussels. We initiated this platform at the very beginning of my mandate. It will be part of my legacy. It is managed by the [European] External Action Service and brings together the Member States, the [European] Commission, Council and the European Parliament. This system is being used by members to alert of ongoing information manipulation activities.
And [it is] thanks to this communication between the French watchdog and our Rapid Alert System that we could discover which were at the origin of this Stars of David across Paris.
It is particularly important, because Russia, and others, are testing tactics in some countries before rolling them [out] in others. This was not by accident: it happened immediately after the start of the war in Gaza, in France, in a country with a strong Jewish community but also with a strong share of Muslim population. Let's test it and if it works, we will use it somewhere else.
It means that we need to build a strong international cooperation in order to fight FIMI on a global scale.
We cooperate with the G7 partners through a [Rapid Response] Mechanism, coordinated by our Canadian colleagues, and with NATO.
We are also discussing with the United States in different formats, including through the work of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council.
We have agreed on a concrete methodology in order to create standards that can be used to face the threat between us - EU - and the United States.
Let me say something about resilience building.
We need to support the citizens, the institutions, the civil society and crucially, journalists, to be better equipped to tackle FIMI.
I hope that all of you know and use our website EUvsDisinfo. They started working in 2015. Since then, the team of EUvsDisinfo has collected about 16,000 cases of information manipulation. They have reached more than 20 million people just last year and now, including audiences in Africa and other parts of the world.
Every year, we are providing hundreds of workshops for journalists, for fact-checkers, for Ministries of Foreign Affairs [of] the Members of the European Union.
Because what we are doing is fighting against an industry that produces lies as Ford started producing cars: in a chain production. 24 hours a day, non-stop.
And we are doing that everywhere, outside the European Union, like in North Macedonia. And in an instance, in a moment, Minister, you will debrief us on some of the cases you have been living.
And we are training independent journalists globally. Needless to say, how important journalists are as a pillar of democracies, and they are too often targeted by FIMI.
We are offering training and legal aid to combat lawsuits aimed at pressuring journalists into self-censoring. Why create a censorship department if you can influence journalists to become each one of them a ""censor"" on itself?
And of course, we provide training on how to recognise and respond to information manipulation.
Another word about sanctions. Sanctions has become a very popular word. Everybody talks about the European Union imposing sanctions. In fact, the word sanctions does not exist in our Treaty. You go to the Treaties, you do a search - sanctions does not exist. What you will find is ""restrictive measures"". You take a measure to restrict something. And we take measures to restrict the activities of the FIMI actors. I mentioned the activities of Russia Today and Sputnik.
Last July, we listed 7 Russian individuals and 5 entities responsible for conducting a digital information manipulation campaign called ""Recent Reliable News"". They have a sense of humour, ""Recent Reliable News"" was a factory of lies.
""Recent Reliable News"" was instrumental in spreading the images of the Star of David, through a large number of accounts affiliated with them on Facebook and the platform today called X.
Our FIMI Threats Report finds that 750 investigated incidents covered 4,000 channels [that] were activated almost 10,000 times.
Then, we have to work with the Digital Services Act that sets legal obligations for online platforms to prevent abuses. And we have made use of these powers in the wake of the attacks on Israel of 7 October, when social media channels were flooded with malicious content, things that were false. And we have to identify it and warn people.
But all of that would be useless - well not useless but not efficient - without a public debate. We must ensure effective safeguards without slipping into censorship. This is a very delicate balance.
We cannot invent the ""Ministry of Truth"", the one who says, ""this is true, this is not true."" You can imagine what will be the world in which someone could have a stamp to say: ""This is true, this is not true.""
Authoritarian regimes have enacted ""disinformation laws"", but they disguise [it] in fact as a protection of public order or national security, but in practice they are being used to suppress dissidents and suppress freedom of expression.
What is the border between controlling the quality of information and going into censorship? What is the balance between security and freedom? This is crucial. The balance between security and freedom appears in every dimension of the public life, now also in information.
The European Parliament has already debated this issue, contributing with useful recommendations. I would like to thank the INGE Committee and its Chair, the Member of the [European] Parliament [RaphaÃ«l] Glucksmann who is here, for their important work and for your very important book.
But you have to engage all institutions in this democratic process, because in the end democratic institutions are the primary targets of Information Manipulation and Interference.
More than ever, we must amplify the truth, counteracting the industry of lies.
When we enact decisions or rules here in Brussels, they reverberate around the world, and they can sometimes be received negatively. We have to take care of that.
For example, the Deforestation regulation or the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which some saw as protectionist measures. Which they are not, but you have to explain why they are not.
Because it is quite easy to present them as if they were. It is quite easy to present it and say: ""Look, in the end, it is just Western protectionism. They want to keep us out of the competition because we have a certain economic advantage.""
If we do not explain what we are doing, we leave the door open for others to fill the space. And it makes it more important than ever the pedagogical activity in the political life. You have to explain what you do, what is your purpose and how do you want to get it. Otherwise, someone will manipulate it and present it with a negative bias against you.
So, the work is not only to create a good tool but to make the ""service aprÃ¨s-vente"". Il faut le prÃ©senter, il faut l'expliquer. Il faut dÃ©penser plus d'argent et de temps, beaucoup plus d'Ã©nergie dans la pÃ©dagogie qui accompagne Ã  l'action politique.
Par exemple, for example, in Beirut, we have our Strategic Communications Hub for the Middle East. This Hub communicates in Arabic because we believe that everybody around the world speaks English or French - well, in fact I speak Spanish but... We believe that they speak English or French as we do, more or less, and then, we do not take care ofre the people - millions of people - who speak Arabic or Chinese. And if we want to get to them, you have to talk in their language.
The other day at the Cairo Airport, it was full of advertising of Russia Today broadcasting in Arabic. Russia Today has arrived in the Arabic world and it is announcing themselves as the good source of information in Arabic. We have to do the same thing: to speak and to use the same language.
So, we communicate in Arabic, including through social media with the [channel] ""EU in Arabic"".
This is more needed than ever. Sorry to say but we need people who speak not only English but Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and languages spoken by hundreds of millions of people which are not part of our traditional parameters [of] our linguistical culture.
This year, we have also set [up] a Task Force to combat disinformation in sub-Saharan Africa. Because we have seen images of people in Sub-Saharan Africa being clearly pushed by the Russian propaganda against the Western countries.
So, we are engaging on a ""battle of narratives"", something I was starting to talk [about] just at the beginning of my mandate when we started discussing about masks, about vaccines and viruses - and about political systems. We are going to live in a battle of narratives, and this battle has to be won. And in order to be won, it has to be fought - and in order to be fought you have to have capacities, tools, and dedicated people. Once again, thank you very much to the ones who are doing this work. A silent work, but little by little, it is emerging, being known by the media, by the public opinion and will be an important actor of a future political life.
To conclude, this is a matter of security. I am in charge of foreign policy and security policy - and security is no longer just a matter of weaponry, it is not a matter of armies. It is a matter of information. It is a matter of the social fabric and how the citizens get fed with the ideas, the facts, that later will determine their capacity as citizens to choose their government and to mark the policy of their nations, and the policy of the European Union and influencing the history of the world.
Keep in mind: unchecked, malicious content spreads like a cancer and puts the health of our democracies at risk.
But we have the tools to effectively fight against this disease. We have the capacity - we need more but we have started fighting this battle. And this meeting, and this discussion today is part of this process.
Thank you very much.

I was having coffee at home this morning in Kyiv, my neighbours were getting ready for work, children preparing to go to school, when our homes started to shake because of a wave of airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital. The attacks caused damage to civilian buildings just next to the United Nations office in Kyiv. Homes were damaged and civilians - those I just mentioned who were only trying to continue with their lives despite the war - are now hospitalized.
In Kharkiv, our team on the ground told us that rescuers are trying to find people under the rubble of a residential building hit and the wave of aerial assaults also caused loss and destruction in the Dnipro Region.
These strikes are yet another bitter reminder of the devastation, suffering and distress that Russia's invasion is causing for millions of people in Ukraine.  Brutal and indiscriminate attacks against civilians must stop.

Tehran, IRNA -- An Ansarullah movement official has vowed that Yemeni armed forces will continue attacking the Israeli regime targets despite the recent military aggression by the United States and its allies on the Arab country.
According to Yemen's Al-Masirah TV channel, member of the politburo of the Ansarullah Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said early Tuesday that Yemen will keep up its military operation against the Israeli regime no matter how much the US and UK bombard the country.
The Ansarullah member went on to say that the Yemeni strikes on the Israeli regime will continue until the end of the Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip.
Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi, head of Yemeni Ansarullah movement's supreme revolutionary committee, also said earlier that the United States and Britain's continued aggression against Yemen is a bid to force Yemeni armed forces to halt their maritime operation against Israeli-linked ships sailing in the region.
The official said the US-UK attacks on Yemen will enhance the determination of the Yemeni people to continue the fight against the Israeli regime.
In recent months, the Yemeni army has targeted over two dozen Israel-related commercial vessels and oil tankers in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab strait in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Yemen's Ansarullah leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi says the targeting of ships linked to Israel will continue until aid reaches the Palestinian people in Gaza.
In a televised speech on Thursday, al-Houthi said the main reason for the continuation of Zionist crimes is America's position.
""America insists that Gaza remain under complete siege and the Rafah crossing stays closed. America insists that the aid and supplies needed by the Palestinian people do not enter Gaza,"" he said.
""America sends its officers to the region to manage Zionist crimes. America is directly involved in the starvation of the Palestinian people. Not only are they starting them, but they are giving bombs to Israel to kill them.""
The US not only does not allow food and medicine to enter Gaza, but it has also escalated tension with Yemen which has cost it dearly.
""America's escalation against our country has a heavy price for them from an economic point of view, and it will also have negative results in the expansion of the scope of the war,"" al-Houthi said.
The US, he said, does not care about endangering shipping and turning the Red Sea into a battlefield, nor does it have any problem with expanding the scope of the war and intensifying the situation in the region.
The US is trying to project its aggression against Yemen and its actions to protect Israel as a step toward guaranteeing international shipping.
""It is the actions of the United States and the United Kingdom that are a danger to navigation and a violation of the sovereignty of the countries of the Red Sea region,"" he said.
Since the beginning of Yemen's operations in the Red Sea, 4,874 merchant ships have passed through the Red Sea, which is a high number, al-Houthi said.
""We only target Israeli ships. Our goal is to exert pressure to deliver food and medicine to the Palestinian people and to prevent Zionist crimes.""
Any escalation by America and England will have opposite results, al-Houthi asserted, saying it will not ""affect our will and determination"".
""We are doing a holy act, which we consider to be a part of Jihad in the path of Allah.""
The Muslim people of Yemen, he said, have presented themselves as a model at all levels, citing weekly demonstrations held across the country.
""The cry of our nation to the Palestinian nation is 'You are not alone' and 'We are with you until victory'. The people of Yemen will not leave Gaza alone, and our people in their homes will not ignore the events in Gaza.
""I ask our people to continue their weekly demonstrations. I want them to come to the streets tomorrow, Friday, in Saba'in Square in Sana'a and other provinces. Tomorrow, God willing, our nation will emphasize that Gaza is not alone and Yemen is with the Palestinian people until victory.""
The result of Yemen's operations so far has been attacking the enemy with more than 200 drones and more than 50 ballistic and cruise missiles, al-Houthi said.
""Our operations will continue until food and medicine reach all the people of Gaza and stop the Zionist crimes. Our conscience, our faith and our bond with the Palestinian people do not allow us to sit quietly and watch. America's insistence on supporting Zionist crimes and rejecting fair humanitarian equations will not affect our positions and will not cause us to retreat.""
Al-Houthi said nations whose regimes severely repress them can boycott American and Israeli goods.
""Muslims have a great responsibility to support the Palestinian people. If the Muslims had provided the necessary support to the Palestinian people and Islamic fighters, the equation would have changed completely.""
Al-Houthi said the enemy has failed to crush the will and determination of the Islamic fighters and the people of Gaza, only exposing its aggressive nature, hatred, brutality and moral bankruptcy with its heinous daily crimes.
""The more they failed to achieve their goals, the more they were inclined to commit horrible crimes,"" he said.
Meanwhile, international institutions are mere observers of the ongoing events.
""Where is their practical position? America and the West do not make any decisions regarding Israel's mass killings and the statements made by international institutions about Gaza do not in any way reflect the real events in Gaza.""
Al-Houthi said despite the financial and military support of the US and the West, Israel's military and economic losses to Israel are high.
""The losses of the Israeli enemy have reached thousands of dead and wounded, and the regime has been shaken in an unprecedented way and has completely failed in what it hoped to achieve."""
D8UX8F6YWD_V8II4M8EEYVPB9O,Pakistan Reopens Key Border Crossing With Afghanistan,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/pakistan/2024/pakistan-240123-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal January 23, 2024
Pakistan on January 23 reopened the Torkham border crossing with Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, a critical access route for trade and transportation between the two countries, after a 10-day closure prompted by Islamabad's imposing of a requirement for passports and visas for Afghan drivers.
A Pakistani customs official in Torkham told RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal on condition of anonymity that the border was reopened at 10 a.m. local time, allowing the flow of trucks and people once again.
The move came after a meeting between Pakistani and Taliban officials on January 22 in Torkham during which the two sides agreed to reopen the crossing, the official said.
The Torkham border crossing links Pakistan's western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to Nangarhar, an eastern Afghan province, through the historic Khyber Pass.
The Torkham closure on January 12 caused huge commercial losses to both countries, blocking the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying tens of tons of oranges and tangerines, according to Afghan trade officials.
lslamabad's move to impose tighter controls requiring drivers from both sides to have visas and passports -- documents many Afghans do not have -- came amid a deterioration of relations between the two neighbors, with Pakistan accusing the Taliban of allowing militants to stage attacks across the border from Afghan territory.
Since October, Pakistan has expelled more than a half-million undocumented Afghans over the Taliban's failure to rein in the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.
Islamabad blames the group for escalating attacks on security forces and accuses the Taliban government of sheltering TTP militants.
Officials say TTP attacks have killed more than 2,000 Pakistanis since the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.
Pakistan says that more than 1.7 million undocumented Afghans reside on its territory.

WASHINGTON -- Today, Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh spoke with Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko to discuss critical economic assistance and international efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine. Under Secretary Shambaugh highlighted the Administration's ongoing efforts to secure the full $11.8 billion in direct budget support as part of the national security supplemental request before Congress, which combined with other international support will enable Ukraine to continue defending itself and help maintain access to Ukraine's $15.6 billion IMF program. Under Secretary Shambaugh and Minister Marchenko also discussed continued cooperation through the G7 as well as the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform.

Participating in a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Tuesday (23 January 2024), NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed Allies' commitments to continue supporting Ukraine now and for the long term.
The Secretary General stressed that Russia's massive strikes highlight the urgent need to strengthen Ukraine's air defences. Through the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group, Allies have already delivered a wide range of air defence systems to Ukraine, including Patriots, IRIS-T and NASAMS. In addition, under NATO's Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), the Alliance is supplying more winter equipment, demining equipment, and fuel to help Ukraine weather the difficult winter, said Mr Stoltenberg.
The Secretary General outlined NATO's support to ramp up ammunition production, including the recent purchase of up to 1,000 Patriot interceptor missiles through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). Also today, Mr Stoltenberg announced that NATO has concluded contracts for the purchase of around 220,000 155-millimetre artillery shells worth 1.2 billion US dollars via the NSPA. This will replenish Allies' stocks, as they continue to bolster Ukraine's air defences. Mr Stoltenberg stressed that NATO is committed to providing long-term support to Ukraine. Allies agreed in Vilnius to expand NATO's CAP to a multi-year support programme to cover critical short-term needs and build long-term interoperability to help protect Ukraine's people, critical infrastructure and military forces.
Looking ahead, the Secretary General urged Allies and partners to continue providing Ukraine with the assistance it needs to prevail. He reiterated that NATO will continue to stand by Ukraine because it matters both for Ukraine's security and for the Alliance."

""The forgotten war"" is how many newspapers describe the brutal power struggle between two generals in the Sudan. Foreign Minister Baerbock will travel to the Horn of Africa to bolster efforts to promote dialogue, stability and peace.
It was the women who sparked hope in the Sudan   five years ago. They inspired large sections of the population to go   out onto the streets in demonstrations calling for democracy and   equality. The picture of the 22-year-old student Alaa Salah was shared   around the world: standing on a car roof, pointing an accusing finger   into the air, she recited a poem to the crowds and thus became a   flesh-and-blood statue of liberty - the peaceful symbol of the Sudanese   resistance to the dictatorship. ""Break down the resistance of the girls,   and then you will also break down the resistance of the men,"" one of   the Sudanese generals is said to have told the military at that time.   They did not succeed. The mass protests led to the overthrow of the   Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir. Civilian politicians and the military   agreed to form a joint transitional government until such times as they   could finally transfer power to civilian hands. But the military did not   keep their word.
For eight months now, the   Sudanese army commanded by General Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid   Support Forces (RSF) led by General Hemedti have been engaged in   fighting. More than 12,000 deaths, 7 million displaced persons, the   collapse of the healthcare system, a country partially reduced to rubble   - that is the bitter result. Both sides are accused of war crimes,   crimes against humanity and the use of systematic rape as a weapon of   war. Foreign Minister Baerbock is now to visit the countries and   stakeholders in the region playing a central role in efforts to mediate   and promote peace in the Sudan: Djibouti, Kenya, South Sudan and the   regional organisation IGAD.
Foreign Minister Baerbock:
With   my dialogue partners in Djibouti, Kenya and South Sudan, I want to   explore ways to finally bring the generals Burhan and Hemedti to the   negotiating table so that they do not continue to drag the people of the   Sudan into the abyss and destabilise the region.
In Djibouti, Foreign Minister Baerbock will hold political talks and meet representatives of IGAD,   the association of countries in the Horn of Africa. Since the outbreak   of the fighting in the Sudan, the Government of Djibouti and the   regional organisation IGAD have been striving to promote dialogue and bring about a ceasefire. The   small country plays an absolutely crucial role in maintaining stability   and security in the region. France, Italy, the United States, Japan and   China as well as the European counter-piracy operation ATALANTA have   naval bases in Djibouti and are thereby securing trade routes in the Red   Sea and the Horn of Africa.
In Kenya the   main focus will also be on efforts to bring about peace in the Sudan.   Here, Foreign Minister Baerbock will meet representatives of Sudanese   civil society living in exile as well as dialogue partners from the   political sphere. Yet our two countries are linked by diverse relations   which thrive on our ability to keep learning from one another. While   Kenya is a pioneer in the development of renewable energies and already   generates around 90 percent of its energy from geothermal power,   hydroelectric power and wind power, the country is tackling youth   unemployment with a tried and tested German export: the dual training   system. Foreign Minister Baerbock will therefore also visit a training   centre funded by GIZ and talk to the apprentices.
On   the last stage of her trip, Foreign Minister Baerbock will hold   political talks in South Sudan's capital, Juba, speak to German members   of the UN mission UNMISS and visit a UNHCR refugee settlement. South Sudan has provided refuge to hundreds of   thousands of displaced persons from the Sudan and, in view of its status   as a close neighbour and its history with the country, has offered to   mediate in the conflict. As the second-largest donor, Germany is helping   to provide the refugees in the Sudan's neighbouring countries with what   they need to survive. Yet international pressure to put an end to the   fighting is needed if the suffering is finally to cease.
Foreign Minister Baerbock:
As   bleak as the situation there might currently seem, the brave young   people - women front and centre - who took to the streets in 2019 for   peaceful change and greater participation in society stand for a better   future for the country. We owe it to them not to let this conflict   become a ""forgotten crisis""."

Denmark and the Czech Republic sign a cooperation agreement - Memorandum of Understanding - on a closer bilateral defence cooperation, including to secure future donations to Ukraine.
Denmark and the Czech Republic are continuing to deepen the collaboration on military donations to Ukraine. A formal cooperation agreement -Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) - has been concluded between the two countries.
The agreement describes the overall framework for a closer bilateral defence cooperation in a number of areas. The core of the cooperation is to secure additional donations of weapons and military equipment of high quality and speedy delivery to the armed forces of Ukraine.
""We have already send a significant amount of military donations to Ukraine in cooperation with the Czech Republic. Donations desperately needed by the Ukrainians. With this agreement, we emphasise the strong cooperation with the Czechs and create the framework for future donations via the Czech Republic,"" states the Danish Minister for Defence Troels Lund Poulsen.
A decision was made on donations of weapons, ammunition and equipment via the Czech Republic to Ukraine in connection with the Donation Package XII and XIII of the Danish Government in the autumn of 2023.
The cooperation agreement entails that future donations to Ukraine follow the already established modes of operation. Denmark transfers the funding directly to the Czech Ministry of Defence. The Czech Ministry of Defence has the direct contact with the involved companies for each donation. In addition, the Czech Ministry of Defence carry out quality assurance, delivery, negotiate final conditions, etc.
""Close bilateral cooperation between the Czech Republic and Denmark is a significant step towards ensuring steady stream of military assistance to Ukraine that is not only in line with the current urgent needs but a building block in terms of the transformation of Ukrainian Armed Forces towards NATO standards, while providing technological superiority on the battlefield,"" says the Czech Deputy Defence Minister Daniel BlaÅ¾kovec.
The cooperation agreement will further more open the opportunity for closer dialogue between Denmark and the Czech Republic within defence policy planning as well as increased cooperation between the Danish and Czech defence industries."
DMPOMXTJSD_4R1FN21GRMHEYDY,Blinken Expresses US Commitment to Boosting Africa Partnerships,_,_,20240118,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-voa06.htm,"By Nike Ching January 24, 2024
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the United States is committed to growing its partnerships across the African continent and increasingly sees African countries ""leading on issues of global consequence.""
""The United States is determined to be and remain a strong security partner for Nigeria,"" Blinken said in Abuja during a joint press conference with Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar.
Before heading to Lagos late Tuesday, Blinken held talks with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and Tuggar in which they discussed regional security after several military coups in West Africa
""We very much appreciate Nigeria's leadership in ECOWAS to try to move to a return to the constitutional order and democracy in Niger after it's been disrupted,"" Blinken said, referring to the Economic Community of West African States.
Nigeria is the largest country by population and economy in sub-Saharan Africa, and the dominant political, economic and military power in this regional bloc.
The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria and maintains a significant security partnership with Nigeria in its counterterrorism operations against Islamist insurgents in West Africa.
Nigeria borders Niger, where the military ousted its elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, in 2023, and subsequently scrapped defense agreements with France, its traditional security partner.
Last week, junta-appointed Niger Prime Minister Ali Lamine Zeine visited Moscow, and the two governments agreed to enhance their defense partnership.
""As some countries have looked to various ways of providing security, including going to partners like the [Russian paramilitary] Wagner Group, what we've seen is actually the problem getting manifestly worse and worse and worse,"" Blinken said in Abuja.
Ivory Coast
Speaking to reporters alongside Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara after talks in Abidjan earlier on Tuesday, Blinken said the discussion included growing commercial ties to create jobs and growth in both the U.S. and Ivory Coast, as well as investing in public health initiatives and addressing regional security challenges.
Blinken said the United States and Ivory Coast ""have a strong and growing bond.""
Blinken's visit to Ivory Coast is seen as reflecting U.S. interests in the country's stability and its preparations for the 2025 presidential election.
The U.S. and international community are concerned about stability in the Sahel sub-region of West Africa following coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger since 2020.
Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in August 2020 and May 2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September 2022.
The United States announced $45 million in new funding to help Ivory Coast and its neighbors prevent conflict and promote stability amid regional threats. This contribution brings the total U.S. stability-focused assistance in Coastal West Africa to nearly $300 million since 2022.
Cape Verde
Blinken's fourth African trip began Monday in Cape Verde and is scheduled to close in Angola. State Department officials said key priorities included bolstering security partnerships and enhancing health and economic development in the region.
In Cape Verde's capital, Praia, Blinken held talks Monday with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and visited the city's Porto da Praia, which received funding for modernization efforts from the U.S. government's Millennium Challenge Corporation.
""It is extraordinary that [Cape] Verde is the first country to complete two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now you're starting to build a third one,"" said Blinken.
He also congratulated Cape Verde's malaria-free certification by the World Health Organization.
Millennium Challenge Compacts are grant agreements designed to fund specific programs that support economic growth.
Silva said Cape Verde shares values of democracy and good governance with the U.S. in its foreign policy.
""We strongly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We condemned the terrorist act of Hamas in Israel. And we defend solutions that make the two states of Israel and Palestine viable,"" he said. ""We condemn coup d'etat and changes to constitutional term limits for presidents of the republic that have occurred in Africa.""
Cape Verde is a small island nation that has a large diaspora in the United States.
The U.S. and Cape Verde signed a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation in December 2022, focusing on maritime security.
Angola and Luanda Process
In a Monday call, Blinken spoke to recently re-elected Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi and discussed the concerns of election observers, as well as the need to enhance democratic confidence moving forward.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement they also discussed the crisis in eastern DRC and potential diplomatic solutions.
Following a contentious December election, Tshisekedi â sworn in Saturday for a second term â pledged to unify the country and address conflicts in the east.
The worsening conflicts in eastern Congo have prompted countries in the region to broker two peace initiatives: the so-called Luanda Process and the Nairobi Process, according to Molly Phee, assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
Increasing tensions between Rwanda and the DRC have led to several alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each other's territory.
Blinken plans to hold talks on the Luanda Process, led by Angola, with that country's President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o and Foreign Minister TÃ©te AntÃ³nio.
Last week, Blinken met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he reiterated the need for all actors to take concrete steps to ease tensions.
Avril Haines, director of U.S. national intelligence, traveled to Kinshasa and Kigali in November, meeting with leaders from the two countries to secure a commitment to de-escalate tensions in eastern DRC.
""We were able to institute a process of weekly check-ins that we undertook through the end of calendar year 2023,"" Phee told reporters during a Thursday briefing."

The United States is deeply concerned by the issuance of arrest orders and detentions against at least 33 Venezuelans, including members of the democratic opposition, civil society, former members of the military, and journalists.  Arrests without due process run contrary to the spirit of the October 2023 electoral roadmap agreement signed between the Unitary Platform and representatives of NicolÃ¡s Maduro.  We call for the end of politically motivated harassment, including attacks upon opposition campaign offices and all efforts to stifle the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people through fear and intimidation.
The United States continues to support the Venezuelan people in their desire for a peaceful restoration of democracy.  Actions that run counter to the spirit and the letter of the Barbados Agreement will have consequences.  We urge Maduro and his representatives to adhere to the electoral roadmap agreement, including by announcing a clear timeline for the 2024 presidential election, and to reinstate all political candidates."

Editor's note: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin refuted reports of a brain drain from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at a regular news conference in Beijing on Monday. The following are excerpts of his response to a question on these reports:
Some foreign media outlets have recently reported that global talent have become ""reluctant"" to work and live in Hong Kong, and that the SAR is experiencing a talent drain.
These reports and comments lack any factual basis. They do not respect the truth that the SAR remains a hub attracting global talent.
It is quite irresponsible for the media concerned to discredit Hong Kong in this way. The reality is that Hong Kong's strong appeal to global talent continues to grow and there is no so-called talent drain from Hong Kong.
According to the HKSAR government, from mid-2022 to mid-2023, the net inflow of Hong Kong residents amounted to 174,000. From January to November in 2023, the SAR government received more than 200,000 applications under various talent schemes. Among them, over 120,000 applications have been approved and 80,000 talent have arrived in Hong Kong, which far exceeds the annual target of admitting at least 35,000 talent.
Besides, the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, released the IMD World Talent Report 2023, which shows that Hong Kong ranks second in Asia in terms of talent competitiveness. These numbers and facts fully show that Hong Kong remains a popular destination for global talent.
Hong Kong has entered a new stage in which the region has restored order and is set to thrive. People there fully enjoy their lawful rights and freedom. This has created an unprecedented environment and golden opportunities for both Chinese and foreign talent to live and thrive in Hong Kong.
We believe that under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong's unique advantage of enjoying the backing of the motherland and being open to the world will be further strengthened. Hong Kong will further expand the progress it is making in economic and social endeavors. The region's appeal to global talent will only grow.
The central government of China will as always support the Hong Kong SAR in attracting global talent, building new advantages and welcoming world talent from all sectors to share in Hong Kong's development opportunities and open up a brighter future for Hong Kong."

The Palestinian death toll from the more than three months of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has passed the 25,000 mark, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday.
The ministry said the death count is at 25,102, including civilians and Hamas fighters, with about 70% women and children. Health officials said 62,681 people have been injured in the conflict.
In the past 24 hours, the ministry said that 178 Palestinians have been killed and 293 injured.
British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News Sunday that it is ""disappointing"" to hear of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opposition to a Palestinian state at the end of the Israel-Hamas war.
""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution,"" Shapps said.
Netanyahu said Saturday that he ""will not compromise on full Israeli control"" over Gaza and stated that ""this is contrary to a Palestinian state,"" rebuffing U.S. President Joe Biden's comment that creative solutions could bridge wide gaps between the leaders' views on Palestinian statehood.
Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions"" when he was asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, ""No, it's not.""
Biden said Friday he had spoken with Netanyahu, the first call the White House had in nearly a month with the Israeli leader, about possible solutions for creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a nonmilitarized government.
""In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,"" a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office said.
Netanyahu is facing increasing conflicting pressures at home.
Relatives of hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza protested outside his home Saturday, demanding his government take decisive steps to secure the release of their family members. They say they fear that escalating military activity further endangers the captives' lives.
Meanwhile, a divide over the direction of the war, now in its fourth month, is growing inside the Israeli Cabinet.
Former Israeli army chief Gadi Eisenkot, a member of the War Cabinet has said a cease-fire is the only way to secure the hostages' release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel's current strategy not to let up on Israel's war on Hamas militants until their destruction.
Netanyahu also is under heat from members of his right-wing governing coalition who want an all-out war against Hamas, while the U.S., Israel's main ally, is calling for restraint in Gaza to protect civilian lives.
The Israeli leader has said he will push for ""complete victory"" against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it.
Critics have accused him of preventing a Cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say Netanyahu is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition.
Attack in Syria
A strike on a residential building in Damascus, Syria, Saturday killed five members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran said, blaming Israel.
Hours later the IRGC issued statements identifying the five dead as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
Iran has vowed to carry out revenge attacks against Israel.
Syrian state television said the building, which was destroyed in the midmorning strike, was in a neighborhood of the Syrian capital where several embassies are located.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, which rarely acknowledges its actions in Syria.
The strike came as Israel hit targets across Gaza Saturday.
Israel said it targeted militants in northern Gaza who it said were trying to plant explosives and fire missiles at Israeli tanks.
Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

BUSAN, South Korea -- Commander, Naval Forces Korea (CNFK), commemorated the beginning of the construction of its new headquarters building with a groundbreaking ceremony on Republic of Korea (ROK) Busan Naval Base, Jan. 18, 2023.
The purpose of the new building is to expand CNFK's administrative and operational capabilities, allowing it to better achieve its mission of fostering a strong and productive relationship with CRF and the ROK Navy, as well as enable U.S naval forces to ""Fight tonight,"" in the Korea area of operations (KAO), should the need arise.

Mark Schafer, in an address to the event's attendees, ""With support from CRF, all of CNFK moved to Busan. Now, each ACOS [Assistant Chief of Staff] can meet face-to-face with their counterpart. This building is the final step to bring the full brunt of CNFK to our 70-year alliance.""
The new building will be substantially larger than the current building and will feature a number of quality-of-life improvements on top of its operational and administrative spaces.
""This project will construct a two-story facility at approximately 33,000 square feet, to support U.S military personnel and civilian staff, from Commander Naval Forces Korea,"" Said FED Project manager, Mr. Robert Zhang, ""The new facility will be three times the size of the current CNFK building and provides operational, administrative spaces along with new storage and a fitness center.""
The inclusion of these quality-of-life amenities are part of CNFK's commitment to its Sailors and its mission to be the assignment of choice for any Sailor picking new orders.
Construction is scheduled to be completed February 1, 2025. After the new building's completion, the current CNFK Headquarters the current will continue to be utilized by CNFK to support joint and combined naval operations across the Korean peninsula.
CNFK proudly celebrates its 70 year alliance with our ROKN partners, continuing to foster an enduring relationship of mutual respect and working together to temper combined maritime warfighting capability, interoperability, and readiness that has spanned generations."

Iran's former President Hassan Rohani has been disqualified from running in the upcoming election for the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body whose tasks include appointing and theoretically removing the supreme leader.
The decision to ban Rohani was made by the Guardians Council, Iran's hard-line vetting body and constitutional watchdog whose members are directly and indirectly appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Rohani's office announced the decision on January 24 in a brief statement without comment.
To be eligible to run in major elections in Iran, candidates must first be vetted and approved by the Guardians Council.
The Assembly of Experts is a council of 88 clerics whose members are elected every eight years by the public.
Rohani, who served as president between 2013 and 2021, has been on the Assembly of Experts continuously since 2000.
The ex-president has long been a target of criticism for hard-liners, who accuse him of ignoring national interests in his attempts to improve Iran's relations with the West.
Since Khamenei became Iran's supreme leader in 1989, every president has been sidelined after leaving office.
News of Rohani's disqualification comes a day after conservative lawmaker Nasrollah Pejmanfar renewed the hard-liners' criticism of Rohani's approach toward the United States. He even threatened to expose what he dubbed the former president's ""dark files,"" without elaborating further.
The Assembly of Experts election will be held simultaneously with the parliamentary polls on March 1.
Concerned about low voter turnout for the third consecutive nationwide election since 2020, Rohani had urged the authorities to facilitate a high turnout by allowing candidates from a wide political background to run in the elections.
For months, he has been warning about voter apathy, which he has attributed to public disillusionment and a deliberate strategy by hard-liners in power to ensure a low turnout.
The parliamentary election in 2020 and the presidential election in 2021 saw record low turnouts since the Islamic republic came to power in 1979, with official figures showing that less than half of eligible voters cast their ballots in both elections.
Nationwide unrest has rocked Iran in recent years in response to declining living standards, wage arrears, and a lack of welfare support.
Adding to the dissent, the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022 for allegedly wearing a head scarf improperly started one of the deadliest protests against the clerical establishment, which lasted for months.
Those protests were met by a brutal crackdown as they grew into one of the biggest challenges faced by the Islamic republic since its inception.
Rights groups say more than 500 people were killed in the crackdown. At the height of the unrest, more than 19,000 people had been arrested, including over 90 journalists and bloggers.
Nine people arrested during the protests and charged with capital offenses have been executed.

France and Cambodia have signed a $235 million aid agreement for drinking water and energy infrastructure development, as well as vocational training.
The deal is part of a move to boost bilateral relations between the two countries, which have maintained a postcolonial dialogue since Cambodia became independent in 1953.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and announced the pact last week. It was the West Point graduate's first official visit to a Western power since succeeding his father, Hun Sen, in August.
""Cambodia will always remember France's role in contributing to national economic recovery and development through the French Development Agency,"" Hun Manet said at a press conference alongside Macron.
""I hope that my visit to France, especially with the president, will enable us to discuss the work that needs to further strengthen Cambodia-France relations,"" Hun Manet said Thursday.
The meeting with Macron came just months after France joined other European Union countries in expressing concern about July's election, in which Cambodia's main opposition party was barred from participating.
After July's elections, in which the ruling Cambodian People's Party won all but five seats in parliament, France called for the release of jailed opposition politicians and respect for Cambodia's democratic obligations under international pacts and domestic law.
Former Prime Minister Hun Sen was the ruling party's prime minister candidate in the election but quickly stepped down to make way for his son in a long-planned succession. Hun Sen remains the president of the ruling party and is expected to be the president of the Senate after elections in late February.
Hun Manet's first trip after succeeding his father in August was to Beijing, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People. Cambodia has long supported China in return for receiving significant investments, loans and grants to build infrastructure, according to analysts.
Cambodia's democratic donors have largely set aside differences over political freedom and human rights to focus on areas of cooperation with the new government in Phnom Penh.
During the visit, Macron reiterated France's appreciation of Cambodia's position at the United Nations regarding Russia's war against Ukraine, according to the joint statement.
Cambodia has repeatedly voted with Ukraine's supporters in condemning Russia's invasion, in a rare break with China on the world stage.
Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who is in exile in France, criticized Macron in a post on Facebook and an opinion article in The Geopolitics for legitimizing Hun Manet's rule.
""Macron has clearly made the calculation that it is better to engage with dictators rather than deny them legitimacy,"" he wrote.
""There is no sign that Macron, along with some other Western leaders, fully understands the unseen impacts of affording high-profile acceptance and credibility to dictators such as Hun Manet,"" Sam Rainsy added. ""An official visit to a venue such as the Elysee is a major propaganda coup for any such regime. It gives an unequivocal message to the Cambodian regime and the Cambodian people that arrests of and violence against opposition supporters can continue.""
Sok Eysan, a spokesman for the ruling Cambodian People's Party, told VOA Khmer on Friday that the visit showed that the Cambodian government and its new prime minister were recognized by the world's leaders and other officials.
Before traveling to France, Manet also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. While there, he met with Samantha Power, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
In a post on X, Power said they discussed ""opportunities to build a more productive relationship.""
Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, criticized Power's approach:
""How about talking about human rights, Samantha? #Cambodia has descended into a single party dictatorship under the Hun family and you want a 'more productive' relationship? Aiya! How about some sanctions instead?"""

The U.S. Navy announced that USS McCampbell (DDG 85) will forward deploy to Yokosuka, Japan.
From U.S. Naval Forces Japan and Naval Surface Force Public Affairs
McCampbell will replace USS Antietam (CG 54), which will depart Yokosuka, Japan, and move to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as part of a scheduled rotation of forces in the Pacific. Upon arrival in Yokosuka, McCampbell will join Commander, Task Force 71/Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 15, the Navy's largest DESRON and the U.S. 7th Fleet's principal surface force.
The forward presence of McCampbell enhances the national security of the United States and improves its ability to protect strategic interests. It will directly support the Defense Strategic Guidance to posture the most capable units forward in the Indo-Pacific Region.
The United States values Japan's contributions to the peace, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific and its long-term commitment and hospitality in hosting U.S. forces forward deployed there. These forces, along with their counterparts in the Japan Self-Defense Forces, make up the core capabilities needed by the alliance to meet our common strategic objectives.
The security environment in the Indo-Pacific requires that the U.S. Navy station the most capable ships forward. This postureenables rapid response times for maritime and joint forces, and brings our most capable ships with the greatest amount of striking power and operational capability to bear.
Maintaining a forward-deployed naval forces capability with the most advanced ships supports the United States' commitment to the defense of Japan and the security and stability of the vital Indo-Pacific region."

President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. of the Philippines says his government ""will not lift a finger"" to help the International Criminal Court in its probe of the country's brutal crackdown on illicit drugs.
The court launched a formal investigation in 2021 into possible crimes against humanity carried out by Marcos's predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. At least 6,000 people on the archipelago were killed under Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign during his six-year tenure, which ended in 2022.
Some human rights groups, however, say the real death toll could be as high as 30,000, including executions by vigilantes who, according to activists, often work closely with police.
The ICC dropped its probe after Manila said it had launched its own investigation. But the court resumed its probe last year, expressing dissatisfaction with the Philippines' investigation. The court rejected an appeal by Manila to reverse its decision.
President Marcos told reporters Tuesday he does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction, calling it ""a threat to our sovereignty."" He said ICC investigators can enter the country ""as ordinary people"" but would receive no help from any government agency.
Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC in 2019 after the court launched a preliminary investigation into his crackdown."

2024.01.22 -- Myanmar's Kachin Independence Army and allied People's Defense Forces claim they captured 30 junta soldiers during battles in the country's north, a Kachin army officer told Radio Free Asia on Monday.
The Kachin Independence Army launched the raid on Friday near the Kachin and Shan state border in another attempt to capture Mongmit city, according to the army's information officer Col. Naw Bu.
Some 30 junta soldiers, including a deputy battalion commander, were captured alive along with their weapons, he said. The group also seized a junta camp near Man Wein Gyi village in Kachin state's Mansi township when the clashes ended on Sunday.
""I received a report from the frontline that 30 junta soldiers, including the deputy battalion commander, had been captured,"" Col. Naw Bu said. ""They are currently being held under the international prisoner of war law. It is not yet known what action will be taken against them.""
Over 10 junta soldiers were found dead in a clearing after the battle, he said, adding  that they are seizing regional military bases in order to regain control over all junta-held areas.
Scores of junta soldiers crossed the border into China on Sunday, Col. Naw Bu added. Roughly 57 of them were sent back through the Muse crossing which borders Yunnan province on Monday, according to reports by local media.
Strategic Captures
Mansi township's Man Wein Gyi camp is a strategic military base that connects Kachin's Bhamo city and northern Shan state's Namhkam city, Col. Naw Bu said.
The Kachin Independence Army and joint forces also captured Kachin's Mabein city on Sunday morning, located between Mansi and Mongmit townships, he added.
""Mabein has also been seized,"" he told RFA. ""All armed forces, including the Arakan Army, People's Defense Forces, and the All Burma Students Democratic Front united and fought the junta camps.""
The junta retaliated with airstrikes, damaging some houses, Col. Naw Bu said, adding that the extent of the damage isn't known at this time.
Y-12 planes dropped more than 60 bombs in Mabein township's Waing Long, Kone Ma Hkan, and Nam Pong Pong villages on Sunday afternoon, locals told RFA today, adding that scores more were dropped around 8 p.m. on Sunday.
More than 4,000 civilians have fled Mabein city and nearby villages since the attack began on Thursday.
Mongmit Battles
Kachin Independence Army coalition forces have also been trying to seize Shan state's Mongmit since Thursday, leading to intense fighting until Saturday, residents said. Almost all residents in Mongmit have fled as well, they added.
On Friday night, the junta army retaliated with airstrikes and heavy weapons, destroying the entire Mongmit market, a local who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals told RFA on Saturday.
""The city's main market was flattened and turned black. It happened at 6 p.m. Friday. The entire market was burnt. The residents have been allowed to leave Mongmit this morning,"" he said. ""Everyone has fled the city. [Can you hear] heavy weapon blasts? The planes are passing over our heads this morning and it is fierce.""
Around 150 shops in the market were destroyed by the bombing and only around 200 people out of the city's 10,000 residents have remained, he added.
During Thursday and Friday's battles, four people, including an elderly woman and a middle-aged woman from Mongmit city, were killed. At least ten civilians were injured, locals said.
Junta Infantry Battalion 348, as well as Light Infantry 276 and 223 are all based in Mongmit. As of Monday morning, the fighting has been ongoing for five days, locals said.
The military junta has not released any information regarding the battles in Mansi, Mabein, or Mongmit. Calls to Kachin state's junta spokesperson Thant Zin Ko Ko, and Shan state's junta spokesperson Khun Thein Maung went unanswered Monday.

EAWMBEALGE_3L9ULCNVH4YNKF7,Israel Reports 24 Soldiers Killed in Gaza in Single Day,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240123-voa02.htm,"By VOA News January 23, 2024
Israel on Tuesday reported that 24 of its soldiers were killed in the Gaza Strip, one of the single worst days for Israeli forces since launching its campaign to eliminate the Hamas militant group.
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters 21 of the soldiers were preparing to demolish two buildings with explosives Monday when a militant fired a rocket at a tank nearby and the explosives in the buildings detonated, collapsing the structures onto the soldiers. The other three Israeli troops were killed in a separate attack.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military opened ""an inquiry into the tragedy.""
""Yesterday we experienced one of our most difficult days since the war erupted,"" Netanyahu said. ""In the name of our heroes, for the sake of our lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory.""
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant wrote early Tuesday on the X media platform that it was a ""difficult and painful morning.""
""This war will determine the future of Israel for decades to come, and the fall of soldiers is a requirement to achieve the goals of the war,"" Gallant said.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the White House announced that Brett McGurk, President Joe Biden's Middle East adviser, was in Egypt and would visit other countries to discuss ""the potential for another hostage deal, which would require a humanitarian pause of some length.""
In late November, about 100 of the 240 hostages Hamas seized in the militants' October 7 shock attack on Israel were released during a week-long cease-fire in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But none of the estimated 130 or more remaining hostages in Gaza has been freed since then and authorities believe two dozen or so of them have since died or been killed.
Israeli forces carried out intense bombing in southern Gaza Tuesday, while health officials accused Israel of attacking health facilities.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli shelling struck the group's headquarters in Khan Younis, ""coinciding with intense gunfire from Israeli drones, resulting in injuries among internally displaced individuals who sought safety on our premises.""
Israeli forces stormed a hospital and arrested medical staff in Khan Younis, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra told the Reuters news agency.
Israel did not immediately comment on the situation, but in the past the Israeli military has accused Hamas of operating in and around hospitals, which Hamas denies.
The United States on Monday called for Israel to protect civilians in hospitals.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that while Israel has a right to defend itself, ""We expect them to do so in accordance with international law and to protect innocent people in hospitals, medical staff and patients as well, as much as possible.""
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel in October, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others, also took the hostages.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 25,295 Palestinians have been killed in the war, many of them women and children. The ministry does not differentiate between the number of civilians and Hamas fighters who have been killed.
The war has been devastating for Palestinian civilians, with the United Nations saying 85% of the population has been forced from their homes and a quarter of the people face starvation.

On the Day of Unity of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk spoke with students and faculty of several Ukrainian higher education institutions.
The meeting, which took place at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, was attended by students from this university, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Mariupol State University, and Kyiv National Linguistic University.
Addressing the audience, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that the Day of Unity of Ukraine is an extremely important and symbolic holiday filled with meaning and important signals about the power of unity.
""It was so important to unite at the very beginning of the war. And this powerful shield that we have, that we managed to build in Ukraine, is a signal that reached the whole of Europe and the whole world. And then, having united, we managed to resist Russian aggression together with the whole world. And help came. I am very glad that Poland, the Polish people, was with us in those moments. I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart, from all Ukrainians,"" he said.
The Head of State emphasized that this solidarity must not be lost today.
""We cannot lose this unity in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world, because we will lose everything,"" the President is convinced.
For his part, Donald Tusk noted that today Ukrainians are fighting for their territorial integrity and independence, but Ukrainians also dream that Ukraine will be home to their children and grandchildren.
""Russian aggression is not only an attack on your country, it is an aggression against your future, the next generations. It is an aggression aimed at everything that matters to you,"" the Polish Prime Minister said.
""I am convinced that today one cannot be in the European Union and not help Ukraine. Ukraine's fight with Russia is a fight for the essence of Europeanness,"" he added.
Donald Tusk also noted that NATO would be much stronger if Ukraine became a member of the Alliance, as its army is one of the best trained today.
""Therefore, in particular, the task of the Polish government is to convince all skeptics that it is in the interests of every NATO member and the entire Alliance that Ukraine becomes a member as soon as possible. This is an obvious way to strengthen the security of the entire free world,"" said the Prime Minister of Poland.
During a conversation with the students, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his belief that Ukraine should become a member of the EU.
""We did not receive the candidacy just like that. And the accession negotiations were not opened just like that, nor was the path to the future in the EU. Because we truly gained it,"" emphasized the President.
Answering the question about the most effective measures to combat Russian disinformation and PSYOP, the Head of State noted that it is very important, including for the youth, to verify and analyze information in the current saturated information space. In addition, the sanctions policy, which affects the ability of Russia to finance propaganda, has a certain effect.
Speaking about the prospects for the development of Ukrainian-Polish relations, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his belief that despite any difficulties, common victories can be achieved through respect for each other. In his opinion, they can be achieved in the agro-industrial complex and in the logistics sector. The challenges posed by the neighborhood with Russia and Belarus give impetus to joint development in cybersecurity, security issues in general, and joint arms production.
According to the President of Ukraine, attention should also be paid to the development of joint educational programs, given the large number of Ukrainians living in Poland.
Donald Tusk added that during this war, Ukraine and Poland have built extraordinary mutual trust not only at the level of leaders, but also at the level of people and societies.
""The war has shown that you are one of the most modern, innovative nations. It has shown extraordinary flexibility and creativity, starting from the frontline and in other areas. You are experiencing tragedy, but you are moving forward,"" he said."

Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian denounces the United States for its preventing the UN from fulfilling its duty to press for an end to the Israeli regime's ongoing war of genocide against the Gaza Strip.
The top diplomat made the remarks on Wednesday, addressing a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting on the situation in the Middle East, especially Gaza.
The Israeli regime launched the war on October 7, 2023 following Operation al-Aqsa Storm by Gaza's resistance movements. Close to 25,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have lost their lives so far as a result of the onslaught.
The United States has been providing Israel with unbridled military and political support in its onslaught against Gaza, arming Tel Aviv with more than 10,000 tons of military hardware. The US has also torpedoed the prospect of cessation of the Israeli aggression by stonewalling ratification of all Security Council resolutions that have been calling for a permanent ceasefire in the Israeli aggression.
Amir-Abdollahian denounced the US for serving ""as the practical supporter and main accomplice of the Israeli regime in its crimes.""
Washington, he said, ""has prevented this body (the UNSC) from effectively fulfilling its inherent duties in stopping the overt genocide of a nation and establishing a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.""
""...the US must compel the Israeli regime to stop the war and pull itself out of the trap that the Israeli regime has set to drag the US into direct conflict.""
'War not the solution'
Amir-Abdollahian stressed that the killing of innocent civilians, especially women and children, had to be stopped immediately.
""War is not the solution. Security cannot be achieved by resorting to the use of force and committing the crime of genocide in Gaza,"" he asserted.
Amir-Abdollahian called on the UNSC to act on its duty to pass a resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the territory.
Such a resolution should also urge immediate and complete withdrawal of the Israeli regime from the coastal sliver, and extract a commitment from the regime to refrain from any efforts to relocate Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan.
'Israel can never destroy Hamas'
The foreign minister pointed to one of the goals that the Israeli regime has purportedly been seeking through waging the war, namely ""total destruction"" of the Palestinian resistance movement of Hamas that rules Gaza.
""That time will never come,"" Amir-Abdollahian stated.
Expressing the reason for his assertion, the top diplomat said, ""In the past 80 years, this nation (the Palestinian nation)'s will of steel has not weakened."""

By Liu Xuanzun Published: Jan 21, 2024 11:38 PM
Experts on Sunday said that while the Chinese military is prepared to counter the US' close-in drone reconnaissance attempts on China, the country is ready to establish a set of rules with the international community governing maritime and aerial interactions with drones, after a think tank report suggested that the US is increasing deployment of drones in such missions that will lead to more complexities in the two militaries' maritime and aerial interactions, as well as crisis management and control.
The MQ-4C unmanned aerial vehicle has gradually become the main force in the US Navy's close-in reconnaissance missions in the Asia-Pacific region, replacing the manned EP-3E electronic reconnaissance aircraft, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think tank, said on Friday in a report.
After a first deployment in Guam in early 2020 for two years of missions in the Asia-Pacific, MQ-4Cs were again deployed in Guam in September 2023, and the scope of their activities indicated that these drones have assumed the roles of EP-3Es at least in the East China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, the SCSPI said.
Since the start of 2024, MQ-4Cs continued to maintain high frequencies of operations, while no activities of EP-3Es were observed in these regions, according to the think tank's monitoring.
The SCSPI pointed out that the reconnaissance capabilities and efficiencies of the MQ-4C, including long endurance, all-weather and all-dimensional performances, are far superior to those of the EP-3E, not to mention that the operators of the drone can control the drones from as far as Guam, Hawaii or even the US mainland, where time differences will easily allow the drones to operate at nighttime in the Asia-Pacific region.
Drones have advantages in close-in reconnaissance because they have longer endurance, can cover a wider region, incur lower costs and are stealthier than a manned aircraft, so they can spy on regions 24 hours non-stop, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.
Since such close-in reconnaissance operations pose serious national security threats, China will have to respond, including by hiding military activities from the US drones, conducting jamming, disrupting the control of the US drones or even shooting them down should they violate Chinese airspace, Song said.
Another Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday that the US could take advantage of the unmanned nature of drones to make more provocations since there is no risk of casualties.
On the other hand, pilots who are tasked to identify, monitor and potentially intercept the drones will face higher risks if the drones make dangerous maneuvers, the expert said.
Sending manned aircraft is also less efficient because of higher human resources and aircraft operational costs, the expert said.
The SCSPI also cited the risks of accidents, saying that regular activities by large US drones in hot regions will add complexity in maritime and aerial interaction as well as crisis management and control between China and the US.
In the three-day Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS) Workshop 2024 hosted by the Chinese Navy that wrapped up in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province on Thursday, the Chinese Navy raised the topic of the establishment of a research working group on unmanned systems, in addition to discussing the revision of the WPNS Business Charter and the use of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday.
Experts said that a set of rules must be established for drones so they do not violate codes of maritime and aerial interactions, and international cooperation in this aspect is important."

The Department of Defense announced today the award   of two contracts totaling $49 million to revitalize advanced packaging   capabilities and capacity for semiconductors used in defense   applications. The awards were made through the Industrial Base Analysis   and Sustainment (IBAS) program to Micross Components and the government   of Osceola County, Florida.
""Revitalizing a semiconductor advanced packaging manufacturing   ecosystem in the U.S. is critical to enabling the Department's weapon   system development and manufacturing partners across industry to support   our warfighters,"" said Dr. Laura Taylor-Kale, Assistant Secretary of   Defense for Industrial Base Policy. ""It will also enable lower volume   manufacturing commercial markets across the U.S. to advance their   products and to assist in sustaining these critical manufacturing   capabilities.""
These awards, which focus on low-volume/high-mix production of secure   2.5 and/or 3D advanced packaging solutions, include options for further   expanding the advanced packaging ecosystem and associated technologies.   They are part of DOD's Re-shore Ecosystem for Secure Heterogeneous   Advanced Packaged Electronics (RESHAPE) efforts, and directly support   the National Defense Industrial Strategy's strategic priority of building resilient supply chains.
RESHAPE is an advanced packaging manufacturing capability initiative   to revitalize a critical packaging manufacturing ecosystem in the U.S.   for use across the defense industrial base (DIB) and commercial markets.   The effort focuses on multi-supplier ""back-end-of-line"" processes for   300mm wafer diameter capabilities. It is aimed at pure play, low-volume,   high-mix, and secure manufacturing capabilities that all DIB-supporting   companies can design into for their next generation applications. This   ensures access and availability to a U.S. microelectronics ecosystem   that enables a secure, comprehensive component, and reliable system   integration.
In 2023, the Innovation Capability and Modernization (ICAM) office,   which manages the IBAS program, made awards totaling nearly $700   million. ICAM is part of the ASD(IBP)'s Manufacturing Capability   Expansion and Investment Prioritization (MCEIP) directorate, in the   Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base   Resilience.

Dozens of people were killed or injured, including two children, when a busy market came under attack in a neighborhood of the Russia-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the region's Russia-appointed government said Sunday.
Russia blames Ukraine for the attack in Tekstilshchik, that according to Russian officials killed at least 27 people and injured 25 others. Ukraine has not commented on the event and the Russian claims could not be independently verified.
Russia-appointed head Denis Pushilin said that the area had been hit by 155mm caliber and 152mm caliber artillery, and that the shells had been fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west. He also confirmed that emergency services continued to work at the scene.
Reuters news agency photographs and video taken at the scene showed crying people, some of whom said they had lost their relatives, and bodies lying on blood-soaked snow in the area.
In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry called the attack ""a barbaric act of terrorism"" committed by Ukraine, adding it was carried out ""with the use of weapons supplied by the West.""
Russia also condemned the attack as ""a treacherous act against the civilian population,"" saying, ""These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means.""
Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over intensified attacks on civilian populations over the past two months.
During its almost two-year invasion of Ukraine, Russian airstrikes and heavy shelling on the sovereign nation have killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
The market strike was one of the deadliest on Russian-controlled Donetsk since Moscow attacked Ukraine in February 2022 and claims to have annexed the territory, a move condemned as illegal by most countries in the U.N. General Assembly.
Responding to media questions about the attack, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement that the secretary-general strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today's shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine.
""Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately,"" the statement said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not speak of the attack in his nightly address but said that in a single day, Russia had shelled more than 100 cities, towns and villages in nine Ukrainian regions and that the attacks in the Donetsk region had been the ""most brutal.""
He also said, ""Russia must feel and remember forever that the aggressor loses the most from aggression.""
The Ukrainian leader added that Russia will be held accountable for all this terror. ""If it hadn't been for Moscow's decisions to start this aggression and this terror, thousands and thousands of people would be alive today,"" he said.
Drone attack, massive fire
Meanwhile, Russia's second-largest natural gas producer Novatek said on Sunday it had to suspend some operations at a huge Baltic Sea fuel export terminal due to a fire started by what Ukrainian media said was a drone attack.
The giant Ust-Luga complex, located on the Gulf of Finland about 170 kilometers (110 miles) west of St. Petersburg, ships oil and gas products to international markets.
""The Ust-Luga oil terminal ... is an important facility for the enemy. Fuel is refined there, which, among other things, is also supplied to Russian troops,"" the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported citing unnamed sources. The news agency also said that according to unnamed sources, the fire was the result of a special operation carried out by Ukraine's security services.
In a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, Novatek also said that the fire was the result of an ""external influence.""
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of Russia's Kingisepp district where the port is based, said in a statement that there were no casualties, but that the area had been placed on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg Sunday morning, but that they were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. The Associated Press could not independently verify the reports.
The Russian Ministry of Defense did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. The ministry said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia's Smolensk region, and that two more had been shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Ground war stalemate
Russian forces also seized the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
Ukrainian forces confirmed the report but called the capture of the village a ""temporary phenomenon.""
The fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces along the roughly 1,500-kilometer front line has remained static throughout the winter.
Some material for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

Hamas says it will commit to a potential International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling mandating a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, which is enduring a genocidal Israeli war if the Israeli regime adheres to such a verdict too.
The Palestinian resistance movement made the remarks in a statement on Thursday, a day before the court is expected to hand down the ruling in a case lodged against it by South Africa late last month.
Hamas ""is following with great interest the deliberations of the International Court of Justice following the request submitted by South Africa to the court to stop the genocide against our people, especially in Gaza,"" the statement said.
""In the event of a decision by the court in The Hague to cease fire, the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas will commit to a ceasefire as long as the enemy adheres to it,"" it added.
The Israeli regime has been waging war against Gaza since October 7, 2023, following an operation carried out by the Palestinian territory's resistance groups, which led to the captivity of hundreds.
Around 25,900 Palestinians, some 70 percent of whom are women, children, and adolescents, have been killed in the brutal onslaught so far, while 64,110 others have been injured.
The Hamas' statement further said the movement ""will release the Israeli prisoners held by it if the occupation releases the Palestinian prisoners, who have been detained by the regime.""
It also demanded that ""the Zionist enemy end its 18-year blockade on Gaza and allow all necessary aid for the relief of Gaza's people and [the territory's] reconstruction.""
The regime imposed the crippling siege in 2007 after Hamas won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections to rule the territory.
Israel has tightened the siege since the onset of the war, preventing the flow of food, water, fuel, medicine, and electricity into the coastal sliver."

Tehran, IRNA -- The administration of US President Joe Biden has told media on Wednesday that Washington is not thinking about pulling out its forces from Syria.
According to the Al-Arabiya channel, the White House has rejected reports that the US government is weighing on withdrawing its troops from Syria.
Earlier, a Pentagon official also quoted by Sputnik that the rumors of the withdrawal of American forces from the war-torn Arab country are false. That after some US media reported that the country's forces were ready to leave Syria.
The US deployed forces and military equipment to Syria in 2014 without any authorization from Damascus or a UN mandate under the pretext of fighting Daesh.
Americans maintain their illegal presence on the Syrian soil, although Damascus and its allies defeated Daesh in 2019 and despite the Syrian government's repeated calls for US forces to leave.
Damascus also refutes US claims that the military presence is aimed at preventing the reemergence of Daesh and says the deployment is only meant to plunder the country's natural resources, especially oil.
The call for US forces to leave Iraq is also growing amid anger at the US support for Israel's war crimes and genocide in the Gaza Strip.
CNN reported that Washington and Baghdad will discuss the future presence of the American coalition forces in Iraq.
However, Iraqi Prime Minister, Mohammad Shia al-Sudani, has demanded the withdrawal of American forces from the country.
Iraqi lawmakers also voted overwhelmingly in 2020 and asked their government to call on Washington to pull out its forces after then President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of Iran's Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi Al-Mohandes in Baghdad.

Tehran, IRNA -- The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has conducted a drone attack on a US base near the Erbil airport in the north of the country.
There were no immediate reports of possible casualties or damage from the attack.
It followed airstrikes by the US on Tuesday night that hit positions of Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) that are part of the Iraqi army, engaged in anti-terror operations.
The US airstrikes hit PMU positions in the central province of Babil and the city of Al-Qaim on the border with Syria, leaving at least two PMU forces martyred.
The Iraqi government condemned the US airstrikes, saying that it would sue Washington at international bodies for violating Iraq's sovereignty.
The Iraqi Resistance also said following the airstrikes that it would start a new phase of anti-US and anti-Israel operations in retaliation for the war in Gaza, which the group along with many countries including Iran says is taking place with the direct support of the US.
Israel waged the Gaza war on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas, carried out a surprise operation into the occupied territories in retaliation for the regime's ceaseless atrocities against the Palestinian people over the past seven decades.
With the Israeli war continuing unabated and killing Palestinian civilians in the besieged territory, other resistance movements and groups in the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, Yemen's Ansarullah, and Iraq's fighters launched military operations against US and Israeli interests in an effort to exert pressure on the regime to end its genocidal war.

EZ1OQBRRN7_Z5D7OCZPHUVW5K2,How A Russian Fighter-Jet Manufacturer Continued To Import Western Aviation Parts Despite Sanctions,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/01/russia-240124-rferl01.htm,"By Svetlana Osipova, Dmitry Sukharev January 24, 2024
One of Russia's leading manufacturers of fighter jets and civilian aircraft continued to import parts and other equipment from European and U.S. suppliers despite the imposition of Western sanctions following the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Customs import data provided to RFE/RL's Russian investigative unit, Systema, found that aviation parts worth more than $8 million were imported to Russia from the start of 2022 until July 2023. More than half of that figure came from Germany; overwhelmingly from a plant owned by the U.S. industrial and technology corporation Honeywell.
The main Russian recipient of those imported parts was Yakovlev, a company formerly known as Irkut, with a flagship plant located in the Siberian region of Irkutsk.
Among Yakovlev's best-known aircraft are the multipurpose fighter jets Su-30MK and Su-30CM, both of which have seen wide use in Russia's nearly two-year-old invasion of Ukraine. The company also produces the Yak-130 training jet, and components for the Airbus A320 passenger jet as well as the Russian passenger jets MC-21 and Sukhoi Superjet 100.
RFE/RL obtained the data with the help of C4ADS, a nonprofit data-analysis and global-research organization based in Washington, D.C.
Omar al-Ghusbi, an analyst at C4ADS, analyzed the trade data to identify components sent to the Irkut factory with potential military applications in the Su-30 fighter jet.
Included in the imports are various avionics and aircraft components, in particular electric-drive computer controllers, navigation equipment, and automatic systems modules, all of which can be potentially used in the construction and repair of the Su-30 and other military aircraft, according to al-Ghusbi.
On March 9, 2022, Honeywell announced it was exiting Russia entirely due to the sanctions. The company, a major U.S corporation that manufacturers everything from home-security and climate-control systems to technology components, did not respond to a request for comment from RFE/RL.
Yakovlev did not respond to a request for comment from RFE/RL.
The Business Of Russian Aircraft Industry
Under a sweeping industrial reorganization ordered by President Vladimir Putin 2006, Irkut and Russia's other leading aircraft design and manufacturing companies were put under the umbrella of the United Aircraft Corporation.
The United Aircraft Corporation, meanwhile, is part of the state-controlled military and technical conglomerate Rostec, whose chief, Sergei Chemezov, is a former KGB officer who worked alongside Putin in East Germany in the 1980s.
The European Union and the United States began levying sanctions on Russia in 2014, after Moscow seized control of the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. The measures restricted some imports on weapons and related military products into Russia.
After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Irkut -- and then Yakovlev -- was among scores of other Russian companies that were specifically targeted by new Western sanctions. Its manufacture of Su-30 fighters was specifically cited.
The result has been escalating problems for the Russian aviation industry in general, as airline companies struggle to service and maintain Western-built jets like Boeing and Airbus, which are commonplace in commercial airline fleets.
Also widely used are Russian- and Soviet-designed Tupolev and Ilyushin jets, which are easier to procure replacement parts for, as well as conduct required maintenance.
Experts say the Russian government must invest heavily in rebuilding domestic supply chains for civilian and military aviation, which have atrophied as Russian companies tapped global supply chains for parts and supplies. Supply chains for countless Russian imports have been severely disrupted by Western sanctions.
For its part, Yakovlev intends to retool its internal production line and begin building engines and spare parts. But it still imports large amounts of parts from Western suppliers.
""Western components are not available, and everything needs to be started again. To do this, you need to completely restart the entire process. And there are very big problems with this,"" Aleksandr Lanetsky, director of the consulting company Friendly Avia Support, told Current Time. ""Sanctions have a cumulative effect. And the further it goes, the worse it gets.""
'Not For Military Use'
Though not a huge amount of money -- the company reported revenue of around $2 billion in 2021, the year before the invasion -- the value of the parts imported by Yakovlev highlights just how hard it has been for Western governments to police sanctions restrictions on Russia -- and how spotty some Western companies have been in adhering to the restrictions.

Another Western company that Yakovlev sourced supplies from was Thales Avionics, a unit of Paris-based Thales. Customs data show Yakovlev imported at least $783,000 worth of aviation parts in 2022 and 2023.
In the months immediately after the Ukraine invasion, Thales continued to supply Russian customers. However, in the summer of 2022, the company announced that it would exit Russia entirely and close its offices in the country.
Procurement documents from Yakovlev provided to RFE/RL show that Yakovlev labeled some of the Thales equipment it was importing as ""not for military use."" It's unclear if that was an error or deliberate.
Thales did not respond to requests for comment from RFE/RL.
Several months after the start of the all-out invasion, French reporters found that French suppliers had continued shipping industrial goods -- including navigation systems, infrared detectors, and thermal-imaging cameras for tanks -- to Russian companies even after 2014, and the initial imposition of Western sanctions.
Thales and Safran, a company whose main shareholder is the French government, were the primary shippers of prohibited goods, the French reports found.
Some of Yakovlev's imports, meanwhile, came via third parties, or third countries. The company received some items that were labeled as military from Knipex and Bosch, both major German companies.
The data showed Bosch items being shipped via Algeria, in the spring of 2023, was a piece of equipment that appeared to be some sort of hot-air gun; Knipex allegedly supplied a wire cutter.
Knipex did not respond to a request for comment from RFE/RL. In an e-mail to RFE/RL, a Bosch spokeswoman said the company stopped selling the Bosch-made product prior to the invasion. She also said the company had instituted policies to meet sanctions regulations and export-control laws.
""Production and direct distribution of the product model has been stopped for several years, it ended before the start of the war in Ukraine and respective sanctions,"" the spokeswoman said. ""It is our goal to prevent Bosch products from being used in a way that violates sanctions at the end of the direct or indirect supply chain within our sphere of influence.""
Vladimir Milov, a former deputy Russian energy minister who is now an outspoken critic of the Kremlin, asserted that ""European and generally Western business does not want sanctions against Russia"" and ""are looking for any opportunities to supply something, finding legal loopholes.""
""Businesses will look for loopholes and in the absence of an executive apparatus for monitoring the implementation of sanctions, of course, they will find these loopholes,"" he said.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's eighth Type 055 large   destroyer recently received a multi-mission examination that experts   said on Monday tested the newly commissioned warship's comprehensive   capabilities, as the vessel readies itself for combat.
A vessel training center affiliated with the PLA Navy recently organized the Xianyang and the Bayannaoer to conducted a full-course training examination featuring tests in sea   attack missions, anti-submarine missions and air defense missions at an   undisclosed sea region, laying down a solid foundation for the ships'   future missions, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Sunday.
The   vessels conducted live-fire shooting with their main guns, close-in   weapon systems and anti-submarine depth charges, the report shows.
The Xianyang is the PLA Navy's eighth 10,000 ton-class large destroyer, the commissioning of which was announced in April 2023, while the Bayannaoer is a Type 054A frigate, according to the CCTV report.
Receiving   a full-course training examination indicates that the warships are   close to achieving operational capabilities, a Chinese military expert   who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Monday.
Thanks to experiences garnered by previous hulls of the Type 055, the Xianyang is gaining combat capabilities fast since it has commissioned in less a year, the expert said.
The Xianyang is commissioned into the PLA Southern Theater Command facing the South China Sea, CCTV reported when the Xianyang was announced entering service last year.
At   a time when tensions remain in the South China Sea, having another Type   055 ready for missions is a powerful boost in the safeguard of national   sovereignty, security and maritime rights, analysts noted.
Shi   Hong, executive chief editor of the Shipborne Weapons magazine,   considers the Type 055 to be the world's best destroyer in terms of   comprehensive capabilities. He told the Global Times that the Type 055   can not only accompany aircraft carriers, but can also serve as the   command ship of a flotilla, and provide more flexible tactics for the   PLA Navy.
With a displacement of more than 10,000 tons, the Type   055 large destroyer is equipped with an integrated mast that gives the   warship outstanding situational awareness, plus the 112-cell missile   vertical launch system hosting a combination of land attack, anti-ship,   anti-air, and anti-submarine missiles, according to openly available   information and analyses."

Qatar has condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent remarks on Doha's mediation role in the Gaza war, saying his comments are detrimental to mediation efforts in the besieged enclave.
Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, made the remarks in a post on X on Thursday, after a leaked recording allegedly captured Netanyahu calling the Persian Gulf state ""problematic"".
""We are appalled by the alleged remarks attributed to the Israeli Prime Minister in various media reports about Qatar's mediation role,"" Ansari said.
""If the reported remarks are found to be true, the Israeli PM would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives, including Israeli hostages,"" he added.
The Qatari spokesman further expressed hope that Netanyahu decides to ""operate in good faith and concentrate"" on the release of the captives, ""instead of concerning himself with Qatar's strategic relations with the United States.""
In a leaked recording from a meeting with families of captives that aired on Israel's Channel 12 news on Tuesday, Netanyahu called Qatar ""problematic"".
""You haven't seen me thank Qatar, have you noticed? I haven't thanked Qatar. Why? Because Qatar, to me, is no different in essence from the UN, from the Red Cross and in a way it's even more problematic,"" Netanyahu said.
However, he added, he is willing to use any mediator who can help bring the captives home.
The Israeli premier further accused Qatar of financing the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, adding that he ""got very angry with the Americans"" for renewing a deal to extend US military presence at a base in the Persian Gulf state.
Qatar played a key role in mediation efforts and helped secure a week-long ceasefire in Gaza that ended on December 1 and allowed Palestinian resistance groups and the Israeli regime to exchange captives and prisoners while enabling international organizations to deliver badly-needed humanitarian aid to the coastal sliver.
The Israeli regime waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's atrocities against Palestinians.
Since the start of the aggression, Israel has killed more than 25,700 Palestinians, mostly women and children."

""570,000 people in Gaza face catastrophic hunger. Intense fighting, access denials & restrictions + communications blackouts are hampering UNRWA's ability to safely & effectively deliver aid. As risk of famine grows, UN calls for a critical increase in humanitarian access,"" the UNRWA said on X .
On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip, while its fighters breached the border and opened fire on the military and civilians. As a result, more than 1,200 people were killed in Israel and some 240 others were kidnapped. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza, and launched a ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave with the stated goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages.
More than 25,000 people have been killed in Gaza so far as a result of the Israeli attacks, according to local officials.
On November 24, Qatar brokered an agreement between Israel and Hamas for a temporary ceasefire and the exchange of some prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The truce was extended several times and expired on December 1.

The ""China threat"" bubble fermented by US politicians is getting bigger, while their real intention of curbing China's development under the guise of national security is also becoming more pronounced, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson from China's Foreign Ministry, said on Monday.
Wang's remarks came after that several US lawmakers have again invoked so-called security concerns to launch a probe into the Swedish-Swiss multinational engineering giant ABB Group's operations in China.
The investigation focuses on Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co, with ABB becoming involved because it's a sub-supplier to the Chinese state-owned manufacturer of container cranes, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing a letter from US Congress.
""It seems that the victimization paranoia of the US politicians concerned is getting more serious."" Wang said. ""I would like to ask those US politicians why they keep accusing the Chinese companies of threatening US national security without providing any evidence, and why the spearheads of the US national security threats are always pointing at the leading Chinese companies in various sectors,"" Wang asked.
""Why is it that when other countries do not feel threatened by Chinese products, and the US has to coerce them into blocking relevant Chinese companies, by claiming that cranes produced in China are a Trojan horse for intelligence gathering, or rendering Chinese-produced electric car batteries a threat to its national security,"" the spokesperson asked.
Wang said that for those US politicians, anything advanced from China is a threat, and they have to take all measures to suppress it. What the US politicians represent is ""an act of bullying.""
""The US politicians talk about abiding by the rules, but what they actually do is to ignore the rules and undermine them; they talk about fair competition, but in reality, they suppress their competitors by all means and deprive other countries of their legitimate right to development, which is despicable and deserves to be condemned and opposed by the international community,"" Wang said."

Russia's heavy losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine mean that Moscow now sees its battlefield nuclear weapons as increasingly important in deterring and defeating NATO, according to a new report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), which warns that the West must wake up to the rising nuclear threat.
On February 24, 2022, as the first tanks rolled over the Ukrainian border at the outset of the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a televised address warning the world of ""consequences you have never faced in your history"" if anyone tried to stop Russia, a threat widely seen as nuclear saber-rattling by the Kremlin.
The IISS report says fear of escalation with Russia has caused the West to hesitate in supplying arms to Kyiv. But nearly two years on, a declassified U.S. intelligence report last month estimated Russia has lost around 315,000 troops in Ukraine since the outset of the invasion, nearly 90% of its pre-war army - much of it at the hands of weapons donated by the West.
""Russia has less confidence now in their conventional capabilities because of everything they've lost in the Ukraine war,"" said William Alberque, the report author and Director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at IISS.
That means Moscow's shorter-range atomic weapons, known Non-Strategic Nuclear Weapons or NSNW - designed for use on the battlefield - are becoming increasingly important to the Kremlin, according to Alberque.
""Russia has basically short range and medium range, air-launched, ground-launched and sea-launched missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads throughout the theater and able to hold all of NATO at risk. NATO itself lacks sort of a countervailing capability to match the Russian capability.""
Deterrence efforts
Russia has already placed non-strategic nuclear weapons in the territory of its ally Belarus, which neighbors several NATO states. Last week, Belarus announced it had adopted a new military doctrine. ""The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons on Belarus territory is an important component of the preventive deterrence of potential adversaries from unleashing armed aggression against Belarus. This is our forced measure,"" Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said on January 20.
The IISS report also highlights a paper published in June by the high-profile Russian political and military analyst Sergei Karaganov, head of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy in Moscow, in which he endorsed a tactical nuclear strike on a European state supportive of Ukraine, in order to restore deterrence against NATO.
In the paper, titled ""A Difficult but Necessary Decision,"" Karaganov wrote ""It is necessary to arouse the instinct of self-preservation that the West has lost and convince it that its attempts to wear Russia out by arming Ukrainians are counterproductive for the West itself. We will have to make nuclear deterrence a convincing argument again by lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.""
""Morally, this is a terrible choice as we will use God's weapon, thus dooming ourselves to grave spiritual losses. But if we do not do this, not only Russia can die, but most likely the entire human civilization will cease to exist. By breaking the West's will to continue the aggression, we will not only save ourselves and finally free the world from the five-century-long Western yoke, but we will also save humanity,"" Karaganov wrote.
Alberque notes that several other well-known political scientists in Russia have engaged in this nuclear debate following the publication of Karaganov's paper.
Karaganov even has presidential approval. In October last year, at an annual political conference at Valdai, a lakeside town between Moscow and St Petersburg, Putin himself picked out Karaganov among the audience.
""Putin said (to Karaganov), 'Yes, I read all of your papers. And I don't think we need to strike NATO, but I do think I need additional options in terms of escalation with the U.S. and NATO in order to maintain deterrence,'"" Alberque said, adding that those options increasingly involve non-strategic nuclear weapons.
""They're constantly thinking about what sort of dosage of nuclear weapons would they need to make us acquiesce, to make us basically sue for peace, without escalating the conflict beyond their control, where we start actually hitting targets deep inside Russia? So, basically, how do they prevent us from striking Moscow? How do they keep the conflict at the theater level?""
""I think that they believe that smaller uses of nuclear weapons could be contained and could be advantageous for Russia. So, this is what we would consider nuclear warfighting to win the battle, to knock out the U.S., to prevent the U.S. from joining in the war by, for instance, preventing us from being able to reinforce from the continental United States,"" Alberque told VOA.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the use of any nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would ""fundamentally change the nature of the conflict"" and would have ""consequences.""
Russia believes NATO does not have the resolve to respond with its own nuclear weapons, according to the IISS report, which says it is vital for the West to re-calibrate its own deterrence.
""Do we have to introduce the same (NSNW) systems? Or do we take the Russian options off the table through better-integrated air and missile defenses? These are the things that we have to figure out. This is a new dilemma - or a dilemma, I should say, that we've ignored for such a long time,"" Alberque said."

24 January 2024
The Foreign Secretary travels to the Middle East and Turkey this week   where he will urge regional leaders to work with the UK to achieve a   sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, so that Israelis and Palestinians can   build a peaceful future together.
The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have set out the necessary   elements for progress - Hamas must agree to the release of all hostages,   they can no longer be in charge of Gaza and the threat from their   terror and rocket attacks must end. An agreement must also be put in   place for the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza in order to   provide governance and services and, increasingly, security.
In Israel, the Foreign Secretary will speak to Prime Minister   Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Katz, calling for more to be done, more   quickly to significantly increase the flow of life-saving aid into Gaza.   He is also expected to raise UK concerns over the high number of   civilian causalities.
The Foreign Secretary will reiterate that more crossing points need   to be open for longer for aid deliveries to Gaza, including the port at   Ashdod and the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that water, fuel and   electricity must be restored during his meetings.
Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:
No-one wants to see this conflict go on a moment longer than   necessary. An immediate pause is now necessary to get aid in and   hostages out. The situation is desperate.
This week I am in the Middle East working with partners to help   build a plan to move from that pause to a sustainable, permanent   ceasefire without a return to hostilities.
Such a plan would require Hamas to agree to the   release of all hostages, Hamas to no longer be in charge of Gaza   launching rocket attacks at Israel, and an agreement in place for the   Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza in order to provide governance   and services and, increasingly, security.
The Foreign Secretary will also meet with President Abbas and will   highlight the UK's long-term support for a two-state solution so that   Israelis and Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace.
In Qatar, David Cameron will see first-hand UK-Qatar co-operation to   get more humanitarian aid into Gaza for those who need it most, and meet   counterparts to discuss how the two countries can work more closely   together to do even more.
He will also hold detailed talks on efforts to secure the safe   release of hostages, pressing the cases of British and dual nationals   through as many diplomatic channels possible.
Qatar has been a key mediator throughout the conflict to allow for   the release of hostages. It is important the UK continues to work with   Qatar, and others in the region, to secure a sustainable ceasefire and   the release of all further hostages held by Hamas.
The UK is working with both Qatar and Turkey to address regional   instability, seeking the safe return of hostages, working together to   tackle terrorism and support those affected by conflict.
In Turkey, the Foreign Secretary will meet Turkish Government leaders   to discuss regional security in the Middle East alongside a range of   other shared challenges. The UK and Turkey have a close partnership and   will continue our essential work on tackling terrorism and illegal   migration and shoring up support for NATO and Ukraine."

The United States and Iraq will start talks to end the U.S.-led international military coalition in Iraq and transition to a bilateral partnership, continuing a process that has been stalled by the Israel-Hamas war.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a statement Thursday saying the talks would begin ""in the coming days."" Last August, Iraq and the U.S. committed to the talks, which Austin said would allow a relationship between the two countries to build on the success of Iraq's campaign known as Defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or D-ISIS.
""U.S. military personnel are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve's mission to advise, assist, and enable the Iraqi security forces in their ongoing fight against ISIS. The United States remains committed to a secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,"" Austin said.
The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and assisting Iraqi security forces as they pursue the remnants of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or Daesh.
A separate statement from Iraq's Foreign Ministry described the talks as an effort to ""initiate the gradual and deliberate reduction"" of U.S. military advisors in Iraq.
The talks will ""formulate a specific and clear timetable that specifies the duration of the presence of international coalition advisors,"" it said.
But what impact the talks will have on the U.S. military footprint in Iraq is unclear.
While some Iraqi government statements seem to suggest a more rapid drawdown of U.S. forces, U.S. officials argue there is no rush.
""There's no timeline set,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said, while acknowledging the number of U.S. troops is ""something that this working group is going to take a look at.""
""It will certainly be part of the conversations as it goes forward,"" she said. ""But there are certain conditions that have to be met or certain factors that have to be met in order for both Iraq and the United States to feel that we can ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.""
The announcement on the high-level talks - expected to start sometime in the coming days, according to U.S. defense officials - comes just days after the U.S. launched a series of strikes against Iran-backed militias in Iraq. The U.S. blames them for scores of attacks against American forces in Iraq.
Militia officials have said they are carrying out the strikes in support of Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel. But some U.S. officials have characterized them as part of an ongoing push by Iran to evict the U.S. from the region.
There have also been increased tensions between Washington and Baghdad.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in early January that he was determined to ""put an end"" to the U.S.-led coalition to defeat IS in Iraq, following a U.S. airstrike that killed an Iran-backed militia leader in the heart of the Iraqi capital.
But U.S. officials Thursday denied attacks by the Iran-backed militias were in any way connected to the announcement of the talks.
""It's not connected to recent events,"" a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday, briefing on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the Pentagon.
""If anything, the militia attacks delayed our original plan,"" the official said. ""The plan was to proceed later in 2023. Obviously, events in recent weeks have caused everyone to have to attend to other business.""
The prospect of high-level talks dates back to August of last year, when Iraqi Defense Minister Thabit Muhammad al-Abbasi met with Defense Secretary Austin at the Pentagon.
At the time, U.S. officials envisioned eventually moving to what they described as a more normal bilateral defense relationship with Baghdad, acknowledging that it would result in a reduction of U.S. forces in Iraq as Iraq's military capabilities grew.
But multiple U.S. officials emphasized when and how that happens remains to be determined, according to U.S. officials, who played down any notion of an abrupt U.S. military pullout.
""Let me be clear. The HMC [Higher Military Commission] meeting is not a negotiation about the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq,"" the senior U.S. defense official told reporters during Thursday's briefing.
""Our Iraqi partners have assured us of their commitment,"" the official said. ""We are going to, together with our Iraqi partners, help determine the shape of the future U.S. military presence in Iraq and at the same time ensure an Iraqi-led enduring defeat of ISIS.""
""Beyond that, we won't speculate,"" the official said.
The arrangement to defeat the Islamic State terror group, with Iraqi forces in the lead since December 2021, has proven successful, according to the officials. U.S. estimates show IS ranks have been cut to fewer than 1,000 fighters in Iraq while the group's leadership there has been continually degraded by Iraqi forces.
Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse."

The United States hit Iranian-backed targets in Iraq and Yemen in a span of about two hours early Wednesday morning, striking a militant headquarters in Iraq and knocking out more missiles in Yemen that were ready to launch into international shipping lanes, according to the U.S. military.
U.S. military aircraft hit the Iranian-backed proxies in Iraq just after midnight local time in response to a series of attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in recent days.
U.S. officials said the airstrikes targeted three facilities in western Iraq used by Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups.
""These strikes targeted KH [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] capabilities,"" according to a statement from U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the region.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned, separately, that Washington is not ruling out additional strikes, if necessary.
""We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region,"" Austin said in a statement, adding, ""We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities.""
""We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks,"" he said.
The new U.S. strikes - targeting sites in the towns of al-Qaim and Jurf al Sakhar, and one other location in western Iraq - came shortly after Iranian-backed militants attacked Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq with one-way attack drones.
The base was also targeted on Saturday by a barrage of ballistic missiles launched from inside Iraq. While most of the missiles were shot down, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said those that landed on base caused traumatic brain injuries in four U.S. personnel.
More than 150 attacks on US forces
There have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, injuring at least 83 Americans in Iraq and Syria, a U.S. defense official told VOA. All but two have returned to duty.
About two hours after the attack in Iraq, the U.S. military stuck two anti-ship missiles in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen that were prepared to launch and posed an imminent threat to maritime vessels, according to U.S. Central Command. Another anti-ship missile had been taken out by U.S. forces on Tuesday, according to Ryder.
The anti-ship missile attacks were preceded by a series of strikes launched into Yemen on Tuesday by U.S. and British warplanes, backed by surface ships and submarines, to further degrade the capabilities of the Iranian-backed Houthi militants who have sought to carry out attacks against key shipping lanes in the Middle East.
U.S. defense officials said the strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.
The strike locations were intentionally selected to target weapons systems, not to amass casualties, a senior military official told reporters. The official assessed the underground storage facility had ""more advanced conventional weaponry"" in it than sites hit in the first round of strikes on Jan. 11.
UN leader urges 'all parties to step back'
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday urged ""all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict.""
Ryder told reporters in response to a question from VOA that the U.S. was ""not at war"" in the Middle East.
""Our goal here is to ensure the Red Sea is safe and secure for international shipping. That is our only goal,"" he added.
The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world's maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.
A U.S. defense official said Monday the decline in the number and the ferocity of the Houthis' maritime attacks was directly attributed to the reduction in their capabilities.
""That does not mean they have no more capability, but we definitely believe that has had an impact,"" another U.S. official said.
Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched 33 attacks on international shipping lanes, according to the Pentagon. The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.
Many of the Houthi attacks have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel."

SANAA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi group said it hit an American warship on Wednesday in the Gulf of Aden and the Bab al-Mandab strait, according to a video statement from the group's spokesman.s
""In support of Palestinian people and in response to American-British aggression against our country, we engaged today in a clash with several American navy destroyers and warships in the Gulf of Aden and Bab al-Mandab Strait while they were protecting two American commercial cargo vessels,"" Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in the statement.
The Houthi missiles made a ""direct hit"" on an American warship and forced the two American commercial vessels to ""retreat from entering the Red Sea,"" Sarea added.
The U.S. Central Command said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Houthis attacked a U.S.-flagged commercial ship with anti-ship missiles around 2 p.m. Sanaa time (1100 GMT).
It said the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, shot down two of the missiles and the third landed in the sea. It said there were no injuries or damage to the ship, which it identified as the M/V Maersk Detroit.
Tensions have been rising in the Red Sea, where the Houthis say their attacks on commercial vessels are in solidarity with the Palestinians, while the U.S. and Britain have been launching airstrikes on Houthi targets to deter them from disrupting maritime traffic.
The Houthis escalated their attacks on U.S. warships last week, saying they would strike any U.S. or British vessel in the area in retaliation for the airstrikes on their positions in Yemen."

Tehran, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has accused the United States of preventing the UN Security Council to stop the Israel genocide in the Gaza Strip and establish a ceasefire there.
Amir-Abdollahian's strong criticism for the US support for the Israeli crimes came during his address to the Security Council where foreign ministers of member states and other countries gathered to assess the situation in the Middle East, especially Palestine and the ongoing Israeli war there.
""The United States, instead of calling others to exercise restraint, should force the Israeli regime to stop the war, and Washington should try to get rid of the trap of the Zionist regime to drag it into a direct conflict,"" the top Iranian diplomat made the harsh comment on the US policy toward the Zionist regime.
Amir-Abdollahian reiterated his call for immediate end to the killing of innocent Palestinian civilians, especially women and children. ""War is not the solution and security cannot be achieved by resorting to force and committing genocide in Gaza"", he emphasized.
The Iranian foreign minister underlined that the killing of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot continue until the Zionist regime's so-called ""complete destruction of Hamas"" because that time will never come since the will of the Palestinian nation has not weakened in the last 80 years.
The full text of the Iranian Foreign Minister's speech at the Security Council meeting is as follows:
Mr. President,
I thank you for organizing this timely meeting.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, your Excellencies,
We have all gathered today in the Security Council in a situation where the occupying and apartheid regime of Israel does not observe any red line in the genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
Although under Article 24 of the United Nations Charter, the members of this organization have conferred the ""primary responsibility"" of ""prompt and effective action"" for the ""maintenance of international peace and security"" to the Security Council, the inability of this body to address the crimes of the Israeli regime and to hold it accountable is unacceptable.
The United States, as the practical supporter and main accomplice of the Israeli regime in its crimes, has prevented this body from effectively fulfilling its inherent duties in stopping the overt genocide of a nation and establishing a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
On the other hand, the US repeatedly expressed its grave concern about the spillover of tension in the region, and yet continues its full support to the Israeli regime's war machine and even violates the sovereignty of Yemen and practically expands the scope of the conflict. The US must bear the responsibility for its consequences.
Instead of calling on others to exercise restraint, the US must compel the Israeli regime to stop the war and pull itself out of the trap that the Israeli regime has set to drag the US into direct conflict.
Mr. President, your Excellencies,
We believe that the future of Palestine belongs to all Palestinians.
I stress that the killing of innocent civilians, especially, women and children must be stopped immediately. War is not the solution. Security cannot be achieved by resorting to the use of force and committing the crime of genocide in Gaza.
The killing of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot continue until the so-called ""total destruction of Hamas""; Because that time will never come and because, in the past 80 years, this nation's will of steel has not weakened.
Therefore, the Security Council must fulfill its legal and charter-based responsibility by ending its prolonged inaction and by adopting a decisive resolution.
This resolution should strongly demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, the immediate and complete withdrawal of Israel from Gaza, and a commitment to refrain from any efforts to relocate Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan.
Also exchange of prisoners of war remains the most important issue. This is the only solution to the current crisis.
I wish to emphasize that it is necessary to completely lift the human blockade of Gaza and ensure unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas in the north and south of Gaza.
I should also underscore the urgent need to provide the necessary facilities for the return of the people of Gaza to their own areas and the settlement of displaced and homeless people and the help of the international community for the reconstruction of infrastructure.
Furthermore, it is crucial to demand accountability for war crimes committed by Israel and ensure to bring the perpetrators to justice.
In this context, we support the recent action of the South African.
Today, some political ideas for the future of Palestine are discussed. In any idea, the leaders of the Palestinian groups and the Palestinian people should have the right to choose their own destiny.
Mr. President
The United States and the United Kingdom made a strategic mistake with the military attack on Yemen, which will result in the risk of further expanding the scope of the war.
We all consider maritime safety and security to be crucial for global trade and energy security. However, security is an interconnected concept. The course of developments shows that stopping the genocide in Gaza is the main key to the restoration of security to the region.
Netanyahu seeks his own political life in war, and the survival of the Israeli regime relies on regional crises and spilling over of conflict. To this end, the Israeli regime points fingers at Iran, using a tactic of shifting blame. Through the use of lies and disinformation, it cynically tries to divert international attention away from the ongoing genocide and massacres they commit with US support in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
But the Israeli regime cannot deny reality on the ground.  The Israeli regime is fully responsible for the atrocities in occupied Palestine, with its war crimes and genocide widely documented by the United Nations and other human rights institutions, marking it as the most recorded genocide in modern history.
In conclusion, I need to once again reiterate that the permanent solution to the Palestinian problem is only possible through holding a referendum with the participation of all Palestinians.
Thank you, Mr. President!

By Stephen Wright for BenarNews 2024.01.24 -- China and Nauru formally established diplomatic relations on Wednesday following the Pacific island nation's decision earlier this month to sever ties with Taiwan.
Nauru's foreign minister Lionel Aingimea held talks in Beijing with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and signed a joint communique on the resumption of diplomatic ties. The communique said that Nauru, an island of 10,000 people northeast of Papua New Guinea, recognizes that ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.""
""Today marks a new page of the relations between China and Nauru,"" Wang said, according to a video of the signing ceremony. ""Nauru recognises that there is only one China in the world.""
Nauru's move reduced Taiwan's diplomatic allies to 12 nations including the Vatican, Paraguay and Eswatini and followed a presidential election in Taiwan won by a candidate opposed by Beijing. Many nations still maintain significant relations with Taiwan through trade and other semi-official offices and its passport holders have visa-free travel to dozens of countries.
Following Nauru's Jan. 15 announcement, Taiwan's government alleged the diplomatic switch was engineered by China and called it ""retaliation against democratic values."" It said China used promises of aid to induce Nauru's decision.
The United States had said Nauru's severing of ties with Taiwan was its sovereign decision but also ""disappointing. A State Department statement warned that China's government ""often makes promises in exchange for diplomatic relations that ultimately remain unfulfilled.""
China's government has courted Pacific island nations for the past two decades as it seeks to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and gain allies in international institutions. Beijing regards Taiwan, a democracy and globally important tech manufacturing center, as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland.
Aingimea said Nauru, the world's third smallest nation by area after the Vatican and Monaco, hopes to boost its economic development as a result of diplomatic relations with China.
""We look forward to this new chapter of the relationship between Nauru and China,"" he said. ""It'll be built on strength, built on development strategy, it will have a synergy of policies, it will have good collaboration and shared governmental principles that both our countries enjoy.""
In recent years more than half of Nauru's government revenue has come from hosting Australia's offshore migrant detention center.
Its sole island is pockmarked by a phosphate mining industry that on paper made Nauru among the world's richest nations in the second half of last century.
The phosphate is now exhausted and Nauru turned to problematic money-making schemes such as selling passports and offshore banking that earned it international notoriety in the 1990s and 2000s.
Nauru had recognized China for several years in the 2000s but switched back to Taiwan following one of its frequent changes of leadership.
The Pacific island nations of Solomon Islands and Kiribati severed ties with Taiwan in 2019 and the central American country of Honduras ended diplomatic relations with Taiwan last year.
The Solomon Islands, in particular, has benefited from diplomatic relations with Beijing. China largely bankrolled the 24-nation Pacific Games that were held in the Solomon Islands capital Honiara in November and has significantly increased other aid to the country.
In the Pacific, Taiwan's remaining allies are the Marshall Islands and Palau - both allied to the U.S. - and Tuvalu, which is seeking more than U.S. $1.0 billion in climate-adaptation funding from the international community for land reclamation that would double the size of its most populated island.

ANKARA (Sputnik) - Turkiye's Grand National Assembly ratified the protocol on Sweden's accession to NATO on Tuesday, Turkish TRT Haber's broadcast showed.
The parliament's decision will come into force after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signs a corresponding decree, which will be published in the government's official journal. Should President Erdogan sign the decree, Hungary remains the only North Atlantic Alliance country that has not ratified Sweden's application to join.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had no problems with Finland and Sweden and that their accession to NATO did not pose an immediate threat. But the expansion of military infrastructure in these territories ""will cause a response,"" the president said.
""As for the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance: yes, this is a problem that is being created, in my opinion, quite artificially in the foreign policy interests of the United States. <...> Russia has no problems ... [with Sweden and Finland].... But the expansion of military infrastructure on the territory of this region will certainly cause our response,"" Putin said, stressing that the actions of the Scandinavian states could aggravate ""an already difficult situation in the sphere of international security.""

By RFA Burmese 2024.01.23 -- Myanmar's ethnic Arakan Army carried out a rocket attack on a naval base in Rakhine state's Kyaukphyu township, prompting a military artillery strike in response, causing more than 1,000 civilians to flee their homes, residents said Monday.
The attack, which took place at around 6 p.m. on Sunday, was the second this month on the Danyawaddy base, which lies adjacent to a Chinese-led deep sea project in a special economic zone for which Beijing had requested heightened security.
The Arakan Army, or AA, fired short-range rockets at the installation, according to a resident of Poke Taung village, near where the base is situated in Kyaukphyu.
""The rockets dropped into the targeted area, although the details of attack remain unclear,"" said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing security concerns. ""It was not a ground battle.""
The details of the attack on Sunday have not been disclosed, and neither the military nor the AA have issued a statement.
Pro-military groups wrote on the Telegram social media platform that the AA fired three short-range rockets at the naval base on Jan. 22, but none of them caused damage and the explosion areas are being cleared.
Artillery attacks from junta vessels in the Thanzit River in response to the attack forced more than 1,000 people to flee their homes in Si Maw, Shauk Chaung, and Saing Chon villages, residents told RFA.
The incident follows a Jan. 8 attack on the same base, part of the Kyaukphyu deep sea port complex and in a special economic zone that is currently being developed by China. The project was approved in 2023 by the junta and attempts to recruit locals for work have been met with controversy and distrust.
Fighting in Rakhine in December has already stalled progress on both the port and railroad, locals told RFA, and the junta and Beijing signed an addendum on Dec. 26 to speed up implementation of the project.
Attack may delay project
The latest attack could ""add further delays to the project,"" said a resident of Kyuakphyu, who also declined to be named citing fear of reprisal.
The resident went on to say that the rebel army is now in control of ""some of"" the special economic zone and that ""China will need to discuss plans to continue the project with the AA.""
Attempts by RFA to contact the Chinese embassy in Yangon by email and junta Deputy Information Minister Major General  Zaw Min Tun by telephone for comment on the attacks went unanswered Monday.
Another resident of Kyuakphyu told RFA that clashes are likely to increase in the township, and inhabitants of its urban areas have fled their homes in fear of arrest by the junta.
""We are concerned because the military has blocked both roads and waterways in Kyaukphyu,"" he said. ""They also arrested business owners and some others, so many have left their homes.""
Two months of conflict between the military and the AA has seen clashes escalate in Rakhine's Kyauktaw, Mrauk-U, Minbya, Pauktaw, and Rathedaung townships.

Tehran, IRNA -- US Central Command (CENTCOM) announced on Wednesday night that it targeted the positions of Iraq's Islamic Resistance in response to the group's recent attacks on an American bases and facilities in the Arab country.
CENTCOM wrote on its X social network on Wednesday morning that strikes on Islamic Resistance's positions were in response to attacks including the recent ones on Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq's western province of Anbar.
""These attacks targeted depots, rocket and missile training facilities, drone facilities, and the resistance group's headquarters"", the statement said.
Iraqi media reported earlier that the US attacked the positions of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of anti-terror fighters.
According to Iraqi media reports, the military college in Jarf al-Nasr and an area near the the Iraq-Jordan border were targeted.
Babol Province Medical Department also said that several ambulances have been dispatched to the site in Jarf al-Nasr and the emergency departments are also on standby.
Earlier, the Al-Mayadeen news network reported that at least five loud explosions were heard following the air strike on Jarf-al-Nasr.
According to Al Jazeera, the city of Al-Qaim in western Iraq was also targeted by the Americans.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has carried out more than a hundred attacks using rockets against US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria as well as hit some Israeli targets in retaliation for US support of Israel's bloody military campaign in the Gaza Strip.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The foreign ministers of the European Union member states have ""agreed in principle"" to establish maritime security operations in the Red Sea, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday.
""The Red Sea was high in our discussion, we agreed in principle to establish European Union maritime security operations and discuss the various options of these missions,"" Borrell told a press conference.
Back in November, 2023, the Houthis vowed to attack any Israel-linked ships until Tel Aviv halts the invasion of the Gaza strip.
In January, the US and the UK began airstrikes on Houthi positions in Yemen to degrade their fighting capabilities. Russia condemned both the Houthi actions in the Red Sea and the Western aggression against Yemen, characterizing the latter as ""another example of the Anglo-Saxons' distortion of UN Security Council resolutions and complete disregard for international law"".

GDZEB47VC6_DMYM0V85NQBLD9L,US Commission Troubled by Hindu Temple Opening on Ruins of Mosque in India,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/india/2024/india-240125-voa01.htm,"By Akmal Dawi January 25, 2024
The grand opening this week of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, India, has triggered a wave of both jubilation and criticism, reigniting long-simmering tensions over religious tolerance in the world's most populous democracy.
The temple, built on the disputed site of the demolished 16th century Babri Mosque, has drawn mixed reactions, with Hindu devotees celebrating its completion while Muslim groups and international observers express dismay.
""[We are] troubled by the recent construction and inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the site of the demolished Babri Mosque,"" Stephen Schneck, a member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, or USCIRF, told VOA in written comments.
""It highlights a concerning precedent regarding the security of places of worship in India, many of which remain damaged and destroyed, particularly in the aftermath of violence in Manipur, for example.""
Ethnic violence in Manipur left an estimated 175 people dead and hundreds of places of worship destroyed in May 2023.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC, a 57-member intergovernmental organization of Muslim-majority nations, has denounced what it calls the obliteration of Islamic landmarks in India.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly observed a fast and prayers for 11 days prior to the opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya city. The city has a population of 3 million people, including some 500,000 Muslims.
""Today our Lord Ram has come. After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived,"" Modi said in a Monday speech in which any mention of Babri Mosque was notably absent.
The mosque's 1992 destruction triggered widespread communal violence across India, claiming at least 2,000 lives.
Although India's Supreme Court approved construction of the Hindu temple in 2019, the country's secular constitution prevented government funding for the religious project, which ultimately received $360 million in private donations.
A new India
On Monday, Modi, who has faced accusations of promoting Hindu nationalism, used the term ""divine India"" to describe his long-term vision for the country.
""By moving ahead of building the temple, now we all take the oath of building a national, capable, successful, beautiful, and divine India,"" Modi told thousands of Hindu worshippers gathered for the consecration of the new temple.
Since Modi's rise to power in 2014, human rights groups and independent observers have warned about growing religious intolerance in the South Asian country.
USCIRF in 2023 called on the U.S. government to list India, along with Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria and Vietnam, among its Countries of Particular Concern for religious freedoms.
""USCIRF continues to express concern about the state of religious freedom in India,"" said Schneck. ""These actions will only continue to exacerbate existing tensions and violence against religious minorities.""
The glitzy opening of the Ram Temple has drawn considerable attention, not just for its religious significance but also as a potential factor in the May 2024 general elections. With Hindus constituting approximately 80% of India's 1.4 billion population, the temple holds symbolic importance for a large segment of the electorate.
There are also some 200 million Indian Muslims, nearly 28 million Christians and more than 20 million Sikhs.
Hindus for Human Rights, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization, expressed concerns that Modi's ruling party might be using Hinduism for political and electoral purposes.
""Modi is not a priest, so leading this ceremony for political gain is both technically and morally wrong. This weaponization of our religion tramples what's left of India's secular democratic values,"" the organization said in a statement.
""Some would say Ram Temple's construction will set off a firestorm. They should reconsider as Ram is energy, not fire. Ram is a solution, not a dispute,"" Modi said on Monday."

United Nations agencies warn the Gaza Strip is slipping into an ever more disastrous situation as the Israel-Hamas war continues unabated and hundreds of thousands of people suffering from a chronic lack of food and water face an acute risk of famine.
""We have more than half a million people in Gaza facing catastrophic food insecurity levels. The risk of famine increases each day as the conflict limits the delivery of life-saving aid to people in need,"" said Abeer Etefa, World Food Program senior communications officer and spokesperson for the Middle East and North Africa.
Speaking to journalists in Geneva on Tuesday from Cairo, Etefa said WFP has procured 21,000 tons of food supplies from across the region â enough for around 2 million people inside Gaza for one month.
""The problem is that all the food is on the border outside in Egypt, but not yet inside Gaza.""
Once this issue is resolved, she said, ""The biggest challenge is how to move supplies inside Gaza to get it to areas that are out of reach."" She said access and distributions were only possible in the south of Gaza, not in the north.
For the first time in six weeks, since a humanitarian pause allowed aid to get into Gaza, she said WFP recently was able to deliver 200 metric tons of food supplies for around 15,000 people in Gaza City.
Unfortunately, she said, ""All areas north of Wadi Gaza [wetlands] have been extremely difficult to reach because of the restricted access to the area.""
Israel has repeatedly said that humanitarian aid is entering Gaza but is being stolen by Hamas or is not being efficiently distributed. Israeli government spokesman Elon Levy said Tuesday there were ""no limitations on the admission of humanitarian aid.""
""International actors interested in seeing more aid in Gaza should send more,"" he said. ""We still have a problem that U.N. agencies are unable to distribute the aid as quickly as Israel is processing it.""
Etefa maintained that the threat of famine is a big fear, noting that a report by the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification has found devastating levels of food insecurity in Gaza.
""All the 2 million people in Gaza are in crisis ... and almost a fourth of these people, or more than half a million people, are in the worst stage of hunger, which is IPC five, which means that people are starving.""
She said virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat.
""We are seeing a very worrisome situation in terms of children's malnutrition. Of course, the shortage of water is making things worse because children get weaker with diarrhea. Pregnant women are not getting enough to eat, and this will impact the health of their babies when they are born,"" she said.
She noted that the shortage of food, clean water, and medical assistance is particularly severe in the northern areas, a situation confirmed by humanitarian workers in the area.
After several days of aborted missions, the World Health Organization reports that a convoy of much needed humanitarian supplies managed to enter northern Gaza on Monday.
WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said one of the convoys, mainly carrying fuel, was prevented from reaching Al-Shifa hospital by a desperate mob of hungry people.
""The people were holding it up as multiple times it was trying to move forward and trying to leave and trying to get onto the road because they were so desperate looking for food,"" he said.
""The team on the ground had to convince them that there was only fuel. They had to show them that there was nothing to eat for them, nor food for anyone else.""
He said the desperation seen on the ground also is apparent inside the hospital.
""We had grave reports of people who as they were waiting for surgeries were begging for water, begging for food,"" he said.
WFP spokeswoman Etefa said Gaza has ""the largest concentration of people in what looks like famine-like conditions anywhere in the world,"" adding that it was alarming to see how quickly this has happened.
She said, ""What is so concerning is to see how many months of conflict, of chaos"" it has taken other countries ""to get to this point.""
She said places like Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, or Sudan have gone through years of conflict before reaching the high level of hunger that Gaza has reached in fewer than 100 days.
""The risks and stakes are very high,"" she said. ""This is probably one of the conflicts that has the fastest deterioration rates in terms of food security."""

Sabrina Singh, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary
DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY SABRINA SINGH:  All right.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Just a few items here at the top, and then I'd be glad to take your questions.
Today, the department announced that the United States and the government of Iraq will start working group meetings of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission in the coming days, initiating a process the two sides committed to during the U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue in Washington, D.C. on August 7th through 8th on â in 2023.  During that August 2023 meeting, the U.S. and Iraq committed to start the HMC to discuss the coalition's mission to defeat ISIS will â that will transition on a timeline that considers three key factors: the threat from ISIS, operational and â and environmental requirements and the Iraqi Security Forces' capability levels.
Expert working groups of military and defense professionals will examine these three factors and advise the HMC on the most effective evolution of the De-ISIS Coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with coalition partners at all stages of the process.
Let me be clear: The HMC meeting is not a negotiation about the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.  The United States and the coalition are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to fight ISIS.  Our Iraqi partners have assured us of their commitment towards working together to shape this future on U.S. military presence and the enduring defeat of ISIS.  The HMC will enable the transition to an â an enduring bilateral security partnership between the U.S. and Iraq, building on the successes of the De-ISIS campaign in partnership with the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve.
The U.S. and Iraq have enjoyed a deep and productive partnership on security matters in the 10 years since the Iraqi government invited the United States and the coalition to fight ISIS, including the seven years since the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq.  The start of the HMC process ref- â reflects the evolving U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship and it underscores our commitment to deepen our security cooperation to advance stability within Iraq and the region.
And switching gears, as you've likely seen this week, Turkey's Parliament recently gave approval for Turkey to ratify the ascension â ascension protocol for Sweden.  As a highly-capable defense partner, we look forward to the prompt accession of Sweden as the 32nd member of NATO, as it will not only greatly strengthen the alliance, but it sends a clear message to Russia that we stand united against their unprovoked and illegal war of aggression in Ukraine.  We look forward to receiving Turkey's instrument of ratification and we look forward to Hungary's quick action on this, as well.
And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions.  Lita?
Q:  Thanks, Sabrina.  A couple things.  First, a quick follow-up on â on the Iraq thing.  So did you provide a date for the first talks?
MS. SINGH:  Not yet.  That's ongoing in discussions.  We don't have an exact date yet.
Q:  Or a broad â next month, this month â
MS. SINGH:  I â I believe I said in the topper in the coming days, but not â not an exact date yet.
Q:  So two things.
MS. SINGH:  Sure.
Q:  Austin â Secretary Austin, can you update us on his condition and if he is still working from home?  And secondly, can you â can you say whether or not the Defense Department is participating in any discussions on the Hill about Turkey and the potential sale of F-16s, and where that all stands?
MS. SINGH:  Sure.  So on the Secretary's condition, he continues to recover and recuperate at home.  He's been very active working remotely; as you saw, joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group remotely earlier this week.  When he returns to the Pentagon, I will certainly â we will certainly keep you updated on when his first full day back in the office will be or when he returns to the office generally.
In terms of discussions on the Hill, I would really refer you to State on that.  Turkey is a key ally, of course, and we're working towards a resolution on providing the F-16s.  But in terms of any discussions with the Hill, that's really being led by State, so I'd refer you to them.
Q:  But is DOD participating in anything like that at this moment?
MS. SINGH:  I'm not going to get into further conversations on what we've been discussing with the Hill.  We are, of course, in consultation with State, with the White House about the F-16s, but I don't have any more conversations to preview.
Great, Jen, yeah.
Q:  Can you rule out that the U.S. has planned to pull all U.S. troops out of Iraq?
MS. SINGH:  Well, as I said at the very beginning, this meeting, the HMC meeting is not a negotiation about the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq.  It is about the â what the future looks like for the U.S. and Iraqi bilateral relationship.  And one of the things that the HMC is going to consider are many â the three factors that I outlined at the beginning, which is the threat of ISIS, the operational and environmental requirements, and then of course, the Iraqi Security Forces' capability levels.
Yeah?
Q:  Can you â can you just update us on the Taiwan Strait?  I believe there was some tension with a â a U.S. warship being approached by the Chinese.
MS. SINGH:  So the USS John Finn conducted a Taiwan Strait transit on January 24th through waters where high seas, freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law.  The ship transited through a corridor in the strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state.  The transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle.  I don't have anything or any more details to provide at this time, just that the strait was successful.
(inaudible)?
Q:  So you mentioned the â the capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces.  What is the Pentagon's assessment of those capabilities currently?  Do they still need to â to partner with coalition forces to â to counter the threat of a potentially-resurgent ISIS, or could they go it alone, theoretically?
MS. SINGH:  Well, the ISF has been critical in our fight to defeat ISIS.  We know that.  And â and they've been a critical partner, and we, of course, in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government.
In terms of their own capabilities and â and addressing ISIS, we want to make sure that the threat that we saw 10 years ago is not the same threat that we face today, which is why we have entered into these â this HMC working group to address what the future, what the partnership, what the bilateral relationship looks like.  This is about the future and making sure that Iraq is set up for success in defending its own national security and sovereignty, and how the U.S. can support Iraq in doing that.
Great.  Catherine, yeah.  Welcome.
Q:  Yeah.  Catherine here, CBS News.
MS. SINGH:  Welcome.
Q:  I have a series of questions slightly off-topic â
MS. SINGH:  Yeah.
Q:  â about the K-2 Airbase.
MS. SINGH:  Okay.
Q:  A member of a military environmental testing team tells CBS News that yellowcake uranium was found.  This is someone who was there on the ground.  But the Department has consistently rejected the yellowcake claims.  How strong is your evidence?
MS. SINGH:  Yeah, so thanks, Catherine.  We're not aware of any survey or report confirming the presence of yellowcake at K-2 facilities, so I just have to leave it at that.
Q:  Right.  Well, we've just provided new records to the Defense Department from this environmental tester who was there on the ground.  Will you now consider these new records?
MS. SINGH:  Yeah, I'd have to take that question.
Q:  Okay.
MS. SINGH:  Great.
Q:  Just as a follow-up â
MS. SINGH:  Sure.
Q:  â before we move on, what we hear consistently from K-2 veterans is that they have to fight for acknowledgment that they were sent to a base that had toxic exposure and they're looking for some accountability, and they want to know why.
MS. SINGH:  Yeah, so thanks, Catherine, for the question.
The Secretary, at the very beginning of this administration, laid out one of his key priorities, which is taking care of our people.  That's something that the secretary has been committed to and that's, frankly, something that this administration stands by and is also very committed to making sure that our current enlisted members are taken care of, as well as our veterans.
Some of your questions, I would refer you to the VA to speak more broadly about.  You know, we do place a premium on providing quality military healthcare to our service members.  As you know, Congress has also provided ways for service members, for veterans to â
(CROSSTALK)
Q:  â they're questioning why it takes so long. They were deployed there in some cases two decades ago, and they're fighting for acknowledgment of their illnesses, many of which are not approved for benefits.
MS. SINGH:  Yeah, I completely understand.  We do have a registration portal for folks to go to to lodge some of their symptoms and â and what they experience.  And again, I know we're working with you on some of these items, so we will get back to you on that.  Great.
Yeah, Janne?
Q:  Thank you, Sabrina.  On North Korea, North Korea announced that cruise missile it launched this week was a test of a nuclear missile equipped with tactical nuclear warhead.  Does the â how does the U.S. assess this?
MS. SINGH:  Yeah, thanks, Janne, for the question.  Again, these are creating â these are similar actions that we've seen before from North Korea.  They destabilize the region.  We have urged very publicly for the DPRK to stop these actions, to stop these tests.
Our commitment to the Republic of Korea, to the â to the â to the area and to the region, remains ironclad, but we've been pretty forthcoming on â on how we feel about these tests.
Q:  Do you think â do you think North Korea actually has the capability to strike the United States?
MS. SINGH:  Yeah, I'm not going to get into any intelligence assessments.
Fadi?
Q:  (Inaudible) â
MS. SINGH:  Fadi â I'm going to go to Fadi here.  Yeah?
Q:  Thank you, Sabrina.  First question is you said that HMC meetings are not about negotiating the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq.  Is that because it's been mutually agreed upon with the Iraqi government not to discuss this issue, or is it because the U.S. is not willing to discuss it or the Iraqis didn't request?
MS. SINGH:  No, that's just not the purpose of these meetings.
Q:  So â so both sides are in agreement on not to raise that issue during those meetings?
MS. SINGH:  No, the â well, just to â just to, again, take a step back here, the purpose of these meetings â and it's â again, it's a working group â is to â is to look at what the â what the bilateral relationship between the United States and Iraq looks like now that the threat of ISIS from 10 years ago to today is very different.
And so part of the factors that we're taking into consideration â the ISF's capabilities, the operational environment, and then of course the threat of ISIS â those are all going to be part of these conversations, on exactly what â what our footprint looks like within Iraq, and that's what this working group is for.  There's no timeline set, and again, this is â these meetings are not about a negotiation or a withdrawal from Iraq.
Sure.
Q:  Two more question on two separate â
(CROSSTALK)
Q:  â the first one, Channel 12 in Israel reported today that a new batch of security assistance arrived in Israel and it includes F-35, F-15, and Apache.  Are you able to confirm this news?
MS. SINGH:  I am â I am not.  I haven't even seen those reports.
Q:  Thank you.  And then separately, there's â we've reported there's a leak from recording by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, where he said he â he expressed his anger to the U.S. government because of the renewal of the agreement about Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the host agreement.  Is the U.S. reviewing its presence in Qatar and its security relationship with the Qatari government?
MS. SINGH:  I am not going to comment on the Prime Minister's specific comments but we have a good relationship with Qatar.  In fact, the Secretary was just there in December, visiting that base.  So I have nothing new to announce in terms of any change to that relationship.  Great.
Yes, over here?
Q:  Hey.  Sam LaGrone with USNI News.
MS. SINGH:  Hey.
Q:  Just wanted to get a couple of points of clarification on the operations in the Red Sea â
MS. SINGH:  Yeah.
Q:  â so I understand the distinction.  So the â the merchant ship protection mission is known as Prosperity Guardian, and then the potential, like, strike mission, is that Poseidon Archer?  How are y'all dividing that up?  Who's responsible for what?  Can you give â
(CROSSTALK)
Q:  â because it's been â it's been kind of difficult to understand.
MS. SINGH:  Sure.  So Operation Prosperity Guardian is exactly that, it is looking at how this coalition together can help ensure freedom of navigation through the Red Sea, through the BEM, through the Gulf of Aden.  And so that is something that the Secretary officially launched in December when he was in Bahrain visiting there, and it is â it was â it's a multinational security initiative.
Operation â what you were referring to is â Operation Poseidon Archer is not a named department operation but it is something that CENTCOM has named in terms of multilateral strikes and dynamic strikes within Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen.
Q:  And is that ongoing?
MS. SINGH:  That â that is ongoing.  Yeah, of course.
Oren?
Q:  Just a very quick follow-up to Lita's first question on the Secretary.  You said you'd update us when the Secretary would come back full time but has he been back to the Pentagon at all since his release from the hospital?
MS. SINGH:  He has not.  And I'm sorry, I â what I meant to say was, like, I â it's not like he's coming for a half day or an hour or anything like that.  When he comes back to the Pentagon, whether it's for an hour, five minutes, a day, we will let you know.  Yeah, of course.
Yes, in the back here?
Q:  Thank you so much.  Robert Moore with ITV News.
MS. SINGH:  Hi.
Q:  We have a cameraman who was filming in Gaza earlier this week.  He â he filmed a very distressing scene that's gained a lot of traction online of a group of Palestinian men waving a white flag, trying to reach relatives, manifestly not a threat to anyone.  They came under fire from an Israeli position.  One man was killed, shot in the chest.  I â I wonder if the Pentagon â whether you have seen that video?  What your reaction to it is â it is?  And about what else â whether you would urge the IDF to investigate what appeared to be a â a calculated and unprovoked killing?
MS. SINGH:  I'm sorry, I have not seen the video, and I â so I can't speak to it.  I can't urge another entity to do something without seeing the video myself.
What I can say and what we continue to do and urge our Israeli partners is as they are conducting operations within Gaza, of course in accordance with the law of armed conflict, humanitarian laws, to preserve innocent civilians, protecting innocent civilian lives, and of course where there are people and refugees that have fled into humanitarian corridors.  So I'd have to leave it at that.
Q:  A follow-up â
MS. SINGH:  Sure.
Q:  â question if I may.  I mean, this â this â this campaign has now lasted, what, 110 days now.  You've repeatedly â from this podium and from the State Department, the White House, have repeatedly said you're urging the Israelis to be more calibrated in their approach.
Are you seeing any evidence that's being listened to, let alone being implemented on the ground, given the extraordinary number of civilian casualties we're still having 110 days into the campaign?
MS. SINGH: You know, we are seeing that the IDF has certainly pared back its operation within Gaza, they have pulled back brigades, they are â and I think they actually spoke to this as recently as a few weeks ago â conducting more targeted operations.
From the Secretary's level to other levels across this administration, there are near daily conversations with our counterparts in Israel about lessons learned that â that the Secretary himself has had through â when he was serving in Iraq and how we see this conflict ending.
So let me just finish for a sec. So again, we feel that the Israelis are â they have a really tough fight ahead of them. We know that. We are working with them to ensure that they can confidently meet the goals that they have laid out by going after Hamas leadership, but we have been very clear from the beginning that the preservation, the protection of innocent civilians is something that we value and something that Israel needs to uphold.
Q: So are you convinced they're actually listening and implementing the recommendations?
MS. SINGH: I think I answered already. I answered that question, yeah.
Ryo?
Q: Thank you, Sabrina. Two questions.
MS. SINGH: Sure.
Q: First, the White House said this morning that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida will make a state visit to Washington in April. So how do you see the progress on defense cooperation with Japan over the last three years? And what area will be the priority for the Pentagon moving ahead?
MS. SINGH: I saw the announcement today. That's very exciting. You know, for more visit â for more details on the Japanese prime minister's visit, I'd refer you to the White House. But of course, last year was a critical year in our alliance, and we look forward to building on that momentum, and that is another great time to do it when the visit happens I be- â I believe you said in April.
Yeah?
Q: Yeah. (inaudible) on Taiwan...
MS. SINGH: Sure.
Q: Admiral Aquilino said last that China will step up military pressure on Taiwan in response to the outcome of the presidential election in â in Taiwan. So is that assessment widely shared at the Pentagon?
MS. SINGH: So in terms of Admiral Aquilino's comments, I'd refer you to INDOPACOM to speak more to that. I will point out, at the same day that Admiral Aquilino said this, there were several centerline crossings by PRC jets. We are committed to the Taiwan Relations Act, and in fact, as I mentioned just yesterday, we completed a Taiwan Strait transit, so I'll leave it at that.
I'm going to come to the â go to the phones, and then I'll come back in the room here. Sorry. Lara Seligman, Politico?
Q: Hi, Sabrina. Thanks for doing this. A couple questions. First of all, there were some reports today that Putin has put out feelers that he's willing to negotiate on Ukraine, and I'm wondering if you can tell us, is DOD privy to any of that? And what is your response? And then I have follow-up.
MS. SINGH: Yeah, I've seen those reports. I don't have anything to add to them.
Q: OK. And then on the Russian plane that was shot down that was reported, I'm wondering if you have an update on that. There were some claims that U.S. weapons were used to take the plane down. Do you have a response?
MS. SINGH: Thanks, Lara. It's something that we're looking into. I â I don't have any more details. I've seen some of the reporting. In terms of responsibility, it's something that we're looking into, but I just don't have more details to share at this time.
Next question, we'll go to Jeff Schogol, Task & Purpose.
Q: Thank you. And I understand that this is a question you need take. Can we get an update on the number of troops in Iraq and Syria who have been diagnosed with TBI, the total number? I understand the CENTCOM's surgeon doesn't track it like this; that you specifically have to query this person to get that data. If you have â if you don't have that data, could you provide it, the most recent numbers?
MS. SINGH: Yeah, thanks, Jeff. I do not have those numbers in front of me, so I'm happy to take that question.
Great, we'll come back in the room. Yes?
Q: Thank you. The government of Iraq says ISIS is defeated and the coalition's job is over, and says we have to set a time â timetable for a phased withdrawal of troops at the end of mission of coalition forces. Do you think there is still the threat of ISIS that requires the coalition forces to remain in Iraq?
MS. SINGH: I don't think I saw in the statement that the Iraqi government put out that ISIS is completely gone. I think we know that the threat of ISIS has changed. I think that's what that statement acknowledged. The threat that was 10 years ago has certainly evolved, and that is because of our incredible partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces and our partnership with the coalition. It is because of that partnership that we were able to continue to push ISIS out of, you know, major cities, and they have become a very different type of organization that they were when this coalition formed.
In terms of â again, I'm happy to reiterate what I said at the top, but the HMC is a working group. It is considering three different factors as it moves forward into what does the rel- â the bilateral relationship between the United States and Iraq look like going forward? Again, we're in Iraq at the in- â in- â invitation of the Iraqi government. We're very proud of the work that we've done in conjunction with our partners and with the Iraqi Security Forces, and this working group is the next step to our na- â our bilateral relationship.
Yes?
Q: Thank you. Just staying on Iraq...
MS. SINGH: Sure.
Q: ... the â the Iraqi Defense Minister just pushed a statement on that meetings that you...
MS. SINGH: OK.
Q: ... talk about, the HMC. He says that this is â the meetings will start soon between the U.S. and Iraq in order to determine the withdrawal timing for the coalition forces and build cooperative relations. I hear from you that you said this is not about negotiation from the U.S. withdrawal. Why does two different statements about the HMC? The Iraqis says that it's about timing of the withdrawal, and you are saying this is not about that. OK. Has Iraq requested to you about your withdrawal from Iraq?
MS. SINGH: We've received no request from the government of Iraq to withdraw our forces. Again, the HMC, it's a working group to determine what our future looks like together with Iraq in terms of our bilateral relationships. There are factors that are being taken to consideration. As I mentioned, the threat of ISIS is very different from it was - from what it was 10 years ago.
And I just â I know there's a focus on this withdrawal. There is nothing new about these meetings. This is something that was announced in August in 2023 that we were going to start these meetings and start this conversation with Iraq. Whether that means what our footprint looks like in Iraq, and that's going to be determined on a variety of factors which I laid out at the top.
Q: And just staying on â on that, HMC. When you're talking about the Iraqi defense system, the â the Iraqi Defense Ministry and also, there are other forces inside Iraq. They are not part of the Iraqi Defense Minister â Ministry, but they're a part of the Iraqi defense system.
MS. SINGH: Yeah.
Q: I'm talking specifically about the Peshmerga Forces from the Kurdistan region of Iraq, and also, the Popular Mobilization Forces, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which is funded by the Iraqi government. Where are these two forces are standing in this meetings between you and the Iraqi government?
MS. SINGH: Again, this is in a meeting between the Iraqi government and the United States. I'm not going to get ahead of those conversations. As you mentioned, in a tweet from, I think it was the Defense Minister of Iraq, these meetings are going to come soon. They're going to start soon. I don't have a manifest or a roster of who's going to attend those meetings, and I'm going to wait until those meetings happen.
Q: (inaudible). Will â will the Peshmerga Forces and PMF will be part of these meetings or not?
MS. SINGH: Again, I'm going to â not going to read out who's participating just yet. This is an announcement today. When we have more to share, I'd be happy to share it.
Erin?
Q: When it was made public that North Korea started sending munitions to Russia, the Pentagon stated that North Korea would not make a big impact on the war. But now, you're seeing North Korea's missiles in Ukraine. Are you concerned about North Korea continuing to send larger amounts of munitions and prolonging the war even longer, especially when the U.S. at this moment cannot fund Ukraine?
MS. SINGH: Yes, we are very concerned about the relationship between Russia and the DPRK. We have said that from the beginning. We are concerned that Russia has to con- â I mean, it speaks to Russia that they have to con- â seek support when it comes to funding their own capabilities from countries like Iran, countries like the DPRK.
The continuing funding, the continuing support of these countries does prolong that war. That is something that we are concerned about, which is why we have committed to supporting Ukraine, but we can't do that without a supplemental being passed.
And so as I mentioned, I think, from this podium, we've not had a supplemental - we've not had a â I'm sorry â a presidential drawdown go out since December 27th. Earlier this week, the Secretary and the Chairman convened the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. That's a forum where allies and partners do come together to figure out what Ukraine needs, what are their urgent battle needs. Unfortunately, the United States has not been able to provide a package since December.
So we will continue to urge Congress, both publicly and privately in our meetings, to pass the supplemental.
Q: But in the beginning, it - you appeared to just downplay that North Korea was sending the munitions over there, that it wasn't that big of a deal at that time. Yes, it would prolong the war, but at that moment, it wasn't ...
MS. SINGH: I don't remember us saying it wasn't that big of a deal. I think it's a concern when other countries are providing Russia with munitions that are killing Ukrainians and innocent Ukrainian civilians. I think we've always said that's been a big concern of ours.
Q: And then have we seen any shipments â any more shipments going from Russia to â or from North Korea to Russia?
MS. SINGH: I don't have anything today to announce. We certainly know that there is a â we've seen a deepening of relationships between Russia and the DPRK, but I don't have any shipments or anything to â to announce today.
Yeah?
Q: I have a follow-up on what you just said on the supplemental. So if Congress fails to break a deal and get additional funding for Ukraine, what would that mean for Ukraine's ability to defend itself? And what message about American reliability would that send to the rest of the world?
MS. SINGH: Well, I think certainly it's concerning if we can't continue to support Ukraine. And I do think members of Congress on both sides of the aisle do understand the impact that it could have.
I will say though, and it's important, it's not just the United States supporting Ukraine right now. Our allies and partners have stepped up, in terms of training, in terms of funding and support. So it's not â it's not just the United States.
But the United States' support for Ukraine is incredibly important in showing a united message, not just to the European world, to â to Russia, but all around the world. Our support, as you've heard from the President himself â said â has said that it's unwavering and we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. I truly believe there are members of Congress and on both sides that believe that as well and want us â want to do the right thing and â and pass the supplemental. Yeah.
Yes? Oh hey, Missy, hello. Yeah, I didn't see you back there.
Q: Just a couple questions on Secretary Austin. I know â I can't remember if it was you or Pat responded to a question on this the other day but do you have any â said you were looking into it â but is there anything on the request for the Secretary to testify in the HASC? And do you have any comment on the congressional criticism, I think it was from Wicker, about the letters that â that DOD submitted about the timeline surrounding his hospitalization?
And then separately, on the â the DOD Inspector General report about UAP, said that there wasn't a comprehensive plan for dealing with UAP and that could pose a security threat. Any response to that?
MS. SINGH: Sure. Let me take the first ones at the top. So in terms of testifying, we're â our â our teams are working with the Hill to figure out â we always want to be responsive to Congress, we always want to ensure that we are getting answers back to, whether it be senators or members of Congress, in a timely manner.
I don't have an update for you on any hearing, of â of anything being scheduled, but we are certainly in touch with the staffs of those members who have requested that hearing, and when I have more to share, I'd be happy to do it.
And then in terms of the letters, again, we're always responding to Congress in - in a timely manner. We provided the details that we could in that letter, and I know our staffs have been in â in touch and the Secretary has been in touch also with members in both the House and Senate.
In terms of the UAP report, I â I'm sorry, I just have to take that question.
Lita, do you have one more and then we'll wrap up? Sure.
Q: ... quick clarification. Are you suggesting â and â and I â I'm really not looking for you to read the topper again ...
MS. SINGH: Sure.
Q: ... but are you suggesting ...
MS. SINGH: But I can ...
(Laughter.)
... if you want.
Q: ... understand â the size of the U.S. footprint in Iraq will not be an element at all in these discussions, or isn't it common sense that the size of the U.S. military footprint in Iraq will be part of these discussions as they go forward?
MS. SINGH: It will certainly be part of the conversations as it goes forward. As â not reading the topper again, but as I outlined at the very beginning, the threat of ISIS has changed, but there are certain conditions that have to be met or certain factors that have to be met in order for both Iraq and the United States to feel that we can ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.
And so that's what this working group is going to look at, and again, we're still there at the invitation of the Iraqi government and we're really proud of our partnership.
Q: I â understood. I think the â the term ""withdrawal of forces"" â I â I think just more broadly, the size of the U.S. footprint in Iraq is obviously part of all of this ongoing ...
MS. SINGH: Yeah.
Sure, Fadi, one â one last question and then we've got to wrap. Yeah?
Q: ... it's â it's getting more confusing now.
MS. SINGH: I don't think so.
Q: Yes ...
(CROSSTALK)
MS. SINGH: Sure.
Q: ... I was taught Arabic and French. But reducing the footprint will â entails withdrawing some of the forces, right?
MS. SINGH: So what Lita was asking is are these â like, is your footprint in Iraq part of these discussions? And what I said was that the threat of ISIS has changed and there are a number of factors that this working group is going to look at, one being how can we ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS?
Of course, conversations about our troop levels, that's something that this working group is going to take a look at, but right now, we are there at the invitation of the government, we are very proud of our partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, and we're really proud of the work that the coalition has done to ensure that defeat of ISIS remains.
OK, great. Thank you, everyone.
Q: Thank you.

China on Tuesday released a white paper on its legal framework and measures for counter-terrorism, which sums up the characteristics of its counter-terrorism efforts over the past decades and exploration of the path of law-based counter-terrorism work.
The seven-part white paper, which was released by the State Council Information Office on Tuesday, is titled ""China's Legal Framework and Measures for Counterterrorism."" In the foreword, it expounds on the necessity of counter-terrorism legal governance and outlines the framework for implementing counter-terrorism legal governance construction.
This white paper is China's first systematic exposition of the legal system and practice of its counter-terrorism work, which will help the outside world gain a comprehensive understanding of the country's counter-terrorism legislation and practices. It will also help dispel disinformation and refute rumors, especially on China's counter-terrorism efforts in its Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, analysts said.
In the main body, the white paper reviews the improvement of the legal framework concerning efforts in counter-terrorism in China, expounds on the clear provisions for determination and punishment of terrorist activities, shows how individuals' human rights have been protected in accordance with laws during the counter-terrorism work, and displays the achievements of China's efforts in fighting terrorism.
The white paper also presents cases to enhance readability.
The State Council Information Office has previously released several white papers relating to counter-terrorism work in China's Xinjiang region and they mainly focused on counter-terrorism, de-radicalization, human rights protection, and vocational education and training, showing the progress Xinjiang has made in terms of human rights protection, Li Changlin, a professor from the Human Rights Institute School of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times.
The white paper released on Tuesday is no longer limited to Xinjiang region, but focuses on the whole country, providing a more systematic exposition of China's counter-terrorism legal system, Li said.
The white paper emphasizes the substantive legal basis, operation and supervision mechanisms, rights protection mechanisms in handling terrorist activities, as well as the achievements China has made in conducting counter-terrorism work in accordance with the law, the expert said."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Explosions in Kiev and Kharkov cannot be considered as Russia's response to strikes on Donbass, as Russian forces do not target civilian objects, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, an air raid alert went off throughout Ukraine. Media reported a series of explosions in Kiev and the Dnepropetrovsk region. Explosions occurred in Kharkov and the city of Shostka in the Sumy region of Ukraine. Later, the mayor of Kharkov confirmed information about a series of explosions in the city.
""No, we cannot. We continue our special military operation, and our military does not hit social facilities and residential areas and does not hit civilians, unlike the Kiev regime. This is what fundamentally distinguishes our military from the military of the Kiev regime,"" Peskov told reporters when asked if the recent strikes on Kiev and Kharkov can be considered as Russia's response to the latest shelling of Donetsk.
Poland Will Not File Lawsuit Against Russia With ECHR Over Smolensk Plane Crash
In a separate development, Dmitry Peskov said thatRussia needs to study the official information regarding Poland's refusal to file a claim with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) regarding the plane crash near Russia's Smolensk in 2010.
""We do not know, we have seen such reports, we will need to get acquainted with the official information in this case,"" Peskov said, answering the question whether the Kremlin was satisfied with the outcome of the years-long proceedings on the tragedy.
On Monday, the Polish Foreign Ministry said that the country has officially refused to file a lawsuit against Russia.

24.01.2024  EEAS Press Team
The sixth high-level EU-Georgia Strategic Security Dialogue took place on 23 January in Brussels.
It reflected the strong level of commitment by both parties to take the cooperation forward in the field of foreign and security policy, in line with the EU-Georgia Association Agreement and the new strategic phase of EU-Georgia relations, following the decision of the European Council of December 2023 to grant the status of candidate country to Georgia.
The sides discussed the positive dynamics of and further priorities for cooperation in the fields of security and defence, including support for building Georgia's security resilience to address hybrid threats. The sides also exchanged views on promoting maritime security in the Black Sea, in line with the Strategic Compass.
The participants discussed the consequences of the conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008, and the potential for the peaceful conflict resolution efforts, including the reconciliation between the conflict-affected populations. The current situation in the occupied breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia was reviewed. Both sides stressed the necessity of the implementation of the EU-mediated 12 August 2008 ceasefire Agreement by Russia, and effective functioning of the Geneva International Discussions. They once again highlighted the important role of the EU Monitoring Mission in observing the implementation of the ceasefire Agreement and contributing to peace and security in Georgia, and underlined the necessity of ensuring the full implementation of its mandate throughout the whole territory of Georgia. The European Union reaffirmed its unwavering support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.
The EU and Georgia also exchanged views on foreign policy issues, including the repercussions of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, the situation in the South Caucasus, Middle East and the wider region, as well as cooperation in the field of security and defence. Against the backdrop of existing geopolitical context, they reaffirmed the shared interest of developing alternative transportation and energy supply routes including in the Black Sea through Georgia.
Deputy Secretary-General of the EEAS Enrique Mora, who co-chaired the meeting on the EU side, said: ""In   the context of persistent regional and global security challenges, the   meeting confirmed our resolve to continue our close cooperation on   security and defence. The EU continues to be fully committed to peaceful   conflict resolution in Georgia and we firmly support Georgia's   sovereignty and territorial integrity. The EU wants to actively   contribute to durable and comprehensive settlements of all conflicts in   the region. We welcome the decision of the European Council to grant the   status of candidate country to Georgia and we expect Georgia to further   increase its alignment on foreign policy, as an expression of its   strategic choice for EU membership"".
First Deputy Foreign Minister Lasha Darsalia, who co-chaired the meeting on the Georgian side, said: ""Since   gaining the EU membership candidate status last December, our relations   with the EU have moved to a new strategic phase. We shared concrete   ideas to enhance our cooperation in security and defence, as Georgia   remains a devoted security partner and ally to the EU in the wider   region. Naturally, we discussed Russia's illegal occupation, steps   towards incorporation of both regions into Russia's political, military,   economic, judicial, social and other spheres and daily provocations,   which continue to pose major security threat with humanitarian and human   rights implications. We emphasised the necessity of peaceful settlement   of the Russia-Georgia conflict and stressed the importance of increased   EU's resolved engagement and our joint efforts in this process"".
The high-level EU-Georgia Strategic Security Dialogue is held once a year and covers issues of common interest in the field of foreign and security policy, including Common Security and Defence Policy."
HGHS7Y2XAS_3CQ4NZHXQHDMO0E,China sends top diplomat to Pyongyang amid N Korea's economic woes,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2024/dprk-240125-rfa01.htm,"Sources hint that there are emerging signs of a potential leaders' summit between the two countries this year.
By Lee Jeong-Ho for RFA 2024.01.25 -- China sent its vice foreign minister to Pyongyang for a discussion that could set the stage for high-level bilateral engagements including a summit, as North Korea aims to concrete its relations with its regime backer in the face of its economic difficulties.
""A delegation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China headed by Sun Weidong, Vice Foreign Minister, arrived in Pyongyang via Sinuiju, on the 25th,"" North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said Friday.
""He was greeted at the border bridge by the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK and the minister of the embassy of the People's Republic of China in the DPRK,"" KCNA added, referring to North Korea's formal name.
The visit comes as China and North Korea mark the 75th anniversary of normalization of bilateral relations. The two countries last month vowed to use this occasion as an opportunity to further upgrade their cooperation in the fields of ""mutual interest.""
Separately, in December, North Korea's vice foreign minister Pak Myong Ho visited Beijing and met with Sun, as well as China's foreign minister Wang Yi.
The meeting was described by the North's state media as a platform where ""both sides exchanged views on strengthening and developing bilateral relations in 2024, marking the 75th anniversary of the establishment of North Korea-China diplomatic relations.""
The report added that the two sides will continue to discuss ways to enhance their ""mutual interest"" and ""strategic cooperation.""
Kim In-ae, South Korea's vice spokesperson for the unification ministry, said in a regular briefing Friday that Seoul saw Sun's visit as an extension of the December talks, indicating ongoing discussions to further boost cooperation between the two countries.
South Korea's government and parliamentary sources who are familiar with the development, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Radio Free Asia that there have been constant signs of a summit preparation between China and North Korea since last year.
Apart from China, North Korea has recently beefed up its efforts to enhance relations with Russia. In September, for instance, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a summit in Russia's Far East and agreed to upgrade their relations in all fields including economy, technology and military.
Since then, accusations have been made that Pyongyang and Moscow are engaged in arms trading, with Ukraine alleging that North Korean missiles have been used in Russia's aggression against Ukraine - a claim that both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied.
China, on the other hand, has kept a distance from the Pyongyang-Moscow cooperation so far, but this might change.
The sources who talked to RFA said Putin's possible visit to Pyongyang this year, as discussed during North Korea's foreign minister Choe Son Hui's visit to Moscow last week, may expedite a summit between China and North Korea, adding that China is likely to intervene in regional diplomacy to optimize its diplomatic interests.
Economic hardship
North Korea's economic struggles could be prompting Pyongyang to seek closer ties with regional allies.
Its leader Kim made a rare acknowledgement this week of the dire state of his country's economy, labeling the economic problem as a ""serious political issue.""
His government revealed the ""inability to provide even basic necessities such as food, groceries, and consumer goods to the local people,"" Kim said, adding that the ""overall local economy is currently in a very pitiful state, lacking even basic conditions.""
North Korea's economy contracted for the third consecutive year in 2022, according to the South's Statistics Korea report in December. The latest available data showed a 0.2% year-on-year drop in North Korea's GDP in 2022, following a 0.1 % decrease in 2021, and a 4.5 % contraction in 2020.
But the North's economic hardship may be eased this year, with support from its regime backers, according to the Korea Development Institute.
The Seoul-based think tank said in a report released earlier this month that North Korea's economy could experience a turnaround, contingent on economic support from China and Russia.
It also noted that resuming and expanding tourism cooperation with China and Russia is one of Pyongyang's prioritized economic goals for this year.
Pressure from Seoul
Besides economic difficulties, Pyongyang is also facing intensified diplomatic pressure from South Korea on the international stage.
Kim Gunn, South Korea's Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs, for instance, requested the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in raising international awareness about North Korea's human rights issues during his visit to Geneva on Thursday.
The South Korean envoy ""lamented North Korea's intensification of social control and oppression to support its military buildup at the expense of the economy and people's livelihoods,"" the South's foreign ministry said in a statement Friday, at his meeting with with the Acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif.
Separately, Kim Gunn also visited the E.U. headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday and emphasized the necessity of collective responses, proposing collaboration in blocking funding for North Korea's nuclear and missile development.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday announced sanctions against four high-ranking leaders of the Houthi militant group in Yemen, alleging that they lent support to the militia's recent attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
The sanctions were imposed together with Britain, according to a press release by the Department of the Treasury.
Those targeted by the sanctions, the release said, were the Houthi ""minister of defense,"" ""commander"" of the Houthi maritime forces, the Houthi ""coastal defense forces chief,"" and the ""director of procurement"" for the Houthi forces.
The Houthis' attacks ""on merchant vessels and their civilian crews lawfully transitting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden threaten to disrupt international supply chains and the freedom of navigation, which is critical to global security, stability, and prosperity,"" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson.
On Jan. 17, the United States re-designated the Houthis as a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist,"" reversing the Joe Biden administration's move at the outset of its term in February 2021 to revoke the designation in view of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen at the time.
The United States has since Jan. 12 launched multiple strikes against targets in Houthi-controlled areas Yemen, with Britain directly participating in some of them and other allies providing support."

Tehran, IRNA -- A Yemeni military source reported Saturday night an attack on a base near al-Hudaydah airport in the west of the country.
The source was cited as saying that two explosions hit the Al-Jabnah barracks near the airport but did not specify the cause of the incident.
Yemeni officials have yet released a report on this.
But US Central Command, CENTCOM, claimed on Saturday that as part of its efforts to protect shipping and prevent attacks on maritime vessels in the Red Sea, an airstrike was carried out against an anti-ship missile belonging to Yemen, off the Gulf of Aden.
Last month, the US president vowed to continue attacks on the Yemeni army and its allied Ansarullah Movement but admitted that the US and UK have so far failed to stop attacks on Israeli-bound ships in Red Sea despite attacks inside Yemen.
""When we say, will they stop the Houthis, the answer is no, and if we ask will they continue, the answer is yes"" Joe Biden stated earlier this week.
The US and the UK have attacked Yemen multiple times recently after a UN security council resolution on the Red Sea but in violation of international laws in order to protect Israeli interest.
The US has also put Yemen's Ansarullah Movement back on its so-called ""terrorism list"", sparking condemnations over Washington's unilateral move in the region and beyond.

By Lee Jeong-Ho for RFA 2024.01.24 -- North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un made a rare acknowledgement on the dire state of his country's economy, urging ruling party officials to take immediate action.
Speaking at the two-day party meeting, which began Tuesday, Kim labeled the economic problem as a ""serious political issue,"" saying that his government revealed the ""inability to provide even basic necessities such as basic foodstuffs, groceries, and consumer goods to the local people.""
""The overall local economy is currently in a very pitiful state, lacking even basic conditions,"" Kim said at a politburo plenary meeting, as cited by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency Thursday.
North Korean regimes consistently focus on their economy and food security, recognizing that economic performance is closely linked to the country's security and legitimacy.
Kim has been facing issues related to the economy and food shortages since he assumed power in 2012. These problems have been intensified recently amid climate change, the aftermath of COVID-19, and international sanctions.
North Korea's economy contracted for the third consecutive year in 2022, according to the South's Statistics Korea report in December. The latest available data showed a 0.2% year-on-year drop in North Korea's GDP in 2022, following a 0.1 % decrease in 2021, and a 4.5 % contraction in 2020.
Meanwhile, North Korea's agricultural production experienced a 4% year-on-year decline in 2022, totaling 4.5 million tons, according to the Statistics Korea report. Specifically, rice production saw a decrease of 3.8%, amounting to 2.07 million tons, which is approximately half of South Korea's rice production.
Sources inside North Korea told Radio Free Asia in May that as many as 30% of farmers in two northern provinces were unable to work on collective farms because they're weak from hunger.
Urging improvements in the economic situation, Kim scolded his party officials, urging them to take immediate action.
""Some policy guidance departments and economic institutions have been evading the reality of the situation and engaging in discussions without actively seeking realistic and revolutionary solutions to address this task.
""If we cannot effectively implement the party's economic development policies, we will never realize significant changes,"" Kim said.
A separate report by the South's Korea Development Institute (KDI) released in December, however, noted that there may be some ""tangible achievements"" in North Korea's economy this year, boosted by the resumption of tourism with China and strengthened economic cooperation with Russia.
""Currently, North Korea is in the midst of reviving its collaboration with China, including tourism and personnel exchanges. Moreover, the nation is strengthening its partnership with Russia to an unprecedented level,"" the KDI report said.
North Korea's primary economic objectives for 2024 would be centered around ""acquiring foreign currency to address the trade deficit, discovering new export opportunities, revitalizing and expanding tourism cooperation with China and Russia,"" the report said.

Joint media release with:
23 January 2024
Australia   has today used cyber sanctions powers on a Russian individual for his   role in the breach of the Medibank Private network.
This is the first use of Australia's autonomous cyber sanctions   framework and is a result of Australian Government efforts over the past   18 months to investigate and respond to this cyber incident.
In the attack, 9.7 million records were stolen. These records   included names, dates of birth, Medicare numbers, and sensitive medical   information. Some records were published on the dark web.
The Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Federal Police,   under Operation Aquila, together with other Commonwealth agencies and   international partners, have worked tirelessly to link Russian citizen   and cybercriminal Aleksandr Ermakov to the compromise of the Medibank   Private network and continue to pursue other leads.
The Australian Government has imposed a targeted financial sanction   and a travel ban on Aleksandr Ermakov. This sanction makes it a criminal   offence, punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment and heavy fines, to   provide assets to Aleksandr Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets,   including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments.
This announcement highlights the Albanese Government's commitment in the 2023â2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy to deter and respond to malicious cyber activity, including through the use of sanctions.
We encourage all Australians - including businesses - to be vigilant   about their cyber security arrangements to help make Australia a harder   target against increasing malicious cyber activity.
The Australian Government discourages businesses and individuals from   paying ransoms or extortion claims to cyber criminals. If you are asked   to pay a ransom you should:
Quotes attributable to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Richard Marles MP:
""In our current strategic circumstances we continue to   see governments, critical infrastructure, businesses and households in   Australia targeted by malicious cyber actors.
""The Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Federal Police   have worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those   responsible for the cyberattack on Medibank Private and to ensure   Australians are protected from malicious cyber activity.
""We continue to work with our friends and partners around the world   to ensure cyber criminals are held to account for their actions and we   will relentlessly pursue activities which disrupt their capability to   target Australians in the cyber space.""
Quotes attributable to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Penny Wong:
""The use of these powers sends a clear message - there are costs and consequences for targeting Australia and Australians.
""The Albanese Government will continue to hold cybercriminals to account.
""This is an incredible effort from our cyber and intelligence teams.   We are using all elements of our national power to make Australia more   secure at home and to keep Australians safe.""
Quotes attributable to the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP:
""The Australian Government condemns malicious cyber   activity, and we will work with our partners and do everything in our   power to punish individuals who attempt to perpetrate cyber crime in   this country.
""Through the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy, we are   hardening our defences and putting layers of protection around   Australians and Australian businesses. This includes working with   industry to break the ransomware business model.
""Our strong advice to businesses is never pay the ransom. Paying a   ransom does not guarantee sensitive data will be recovered, prevent it   from being sold or leaked online or prevent further attacks. It also   makes Australia a more attractive target for criminal groups."""

Yemen's Armed Forces fire ballistic missiles against American warships in the Gulf of Aden and Bab al-Mandab Strait in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have come under a genocidal US-backed war by the Israeli regime.
Cited by Yemen's al-Masirah television network, the forces reported striking the American warships, including a number of destroyers, with the projectiles on Wednesday as the vessels were providing protection for two American commercial vessels.
""Despite attempts by the warships to intercept them, our ballistic missiles have reached their targets successfully,"" the forces said, noting that an American warship was ""directly hit"" and the commercial vessels ""were forced to retreat.""
The entire development ""lasted for two hours,"" the announcement added.
Over the past month, the forces and Yemen's Ansarullah popular resistance movement have been staging many such strikes against Israeli vessels or those bound for the occupied Palestinian territories' ports.
The operations have been described as a response to the October 7-present war and siege that the Israeli regime has been waging against Gaza following an operation carried out by the Palestinian territory's resistance movements.
Around 25,700 Palestinians, some 70 percent of whom are women, children, and adolescents, have been killed in the brutal onslaught so far.
The United States and the UK have also conducted several missile attacks against Yemeni targets in response to the Yemeni strikes.
Concluding their announcement, the Yemeni Armed Forces vowed to continue their operations ""until the blockade against the Gaza Strip was lifted.""
They also pledged to continue ""taking all defensive measures to defend, and counter the US-British aggression"" against Yemen."

'Green terror,' worsening economy feared as external meddling continues: expert
By Yang Sheng Published: Jan 21, 2024 11:03 PM Updated: Jan 21, 2024 11:14 PM
The US' thinly-veiled policy of playing the so-called Taiwan card to support its geopolitical strategy of containing China is continuing after the regional election of Taiwan island with US lawmakers reportedly scheduling to go to the island.
Analysts said that there is nothing new about the US politicians' trip to the island, but it's still a provocative move against the one-China principle, and the Chinese mainland will take actions to respond based on the level of provocation made by the US and the Taiwan authorities.
Chinese experts said that the US will keep manipulating Taiwan politics but Washington is also being restrained as being overly provocative might cause the situation losing control, especially when the US is busy to deal with the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict at the same time in the year of US presidential election.
The Chinese mainland will try to safeguard the peace across the Taiwan Straits, and be well prepared to respond to all kinds of provocations, and to push forward the reunification process step by step in its own way, experts noted.
Continue manipulation
According to Japan's Nikkei on Sunday, a US bipartisan congressional delegation will go to the island of Taiwan to ""strengthen relationships with opposition party leaders,"" as well as the new regional leader-elect Lai, also the head of secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
Representative Ami Bera, top Democrat in the House subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, will join a group of lawmakers on a trip to Taipei soon. It is expected to be the first US congressional delegation to the island after the January 13 regional election. Bera said in an interview on Friday that the US congress members are going to send a message of ""welcome"" and ""congratulation"" to Lai, stressing the visit will demonstrate ""US support for island's democracy.""
However, many Taiwan residents reached by the Global Times said the election this time has failed to reflect the public opinion on the island because DPP's Lai got elected with merely 40 percent of the votes, and the reason why he got elected is that the opposition parties' candidates failed to unite, causing a division among the remaining 60 percent of the voters who wanted to end the DPP's ruling.
Chang Li-chi, from Taiwan island and currently a postdoctoral researcher at Huaqiao University in Xiamen, told the Global Times that ""the real public opinion in the island is to oppose the DPP's policy that has been causing tensions with the mainland in recent years, and also oppose the incompetence and corruption of the DPP authorities that has caused economic depression in the island.""
Since the island's problematic election system is under the manipulation and control of foreign interference forces and some local interest groups with pro-secessionist and anti-reunification stance, people in Taiwan are unable to effectively decide their own future, and they are very easy to be divided into different groups, so they are unable to make meaningful change to correct the wrong path of the DPP secessionists, Chang noted.
Some Taiwan residents who asked for anonymity due to the concern of political persecution by the DPP told the Global Times that the DPP being elected is not reflecting democracy at all, because the secessionist party has been pushing the ""Green Terror"" (green is the color of the DPP) in the island for a very long time, and this situation will only get worse in the coming years due to Lai being elected.
""Many of us are only doing very normal businesses in the mainland or have jobs to promote the cross-Straits people-to-people exchanges, but we will be targeted by the DPP authorities, they may label us 'spies' or 'proxies' that' are 'sponsored by the Communist Party of China,' and some of our families may get detained by the authorities, and some others fined heavily or barred from leaving the island,"" said a Taiwan resident who asked for anonymity.
No one in the island is able to challenge the ""Green Terror,"" said Taiwan analysts.
The US politicians and White House's so-called congratulations to Lai are nothing about democracy, but about manipulating the island to contain China, or in other words, to play ""the Taiwan card against China,"" experts said.
The US politicians from both Democrats and Republicans agree that they need to make the best use of ""the Taiwan card"" when competing with China as they have realized that there is very little time left for them to use this card against China, LÃ¼ Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.
According to Nikkei, Bera declined to give specific details about the trip, but the US politician noted the delegation plans to also meet with senior members of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP).
Although the DPP won the regional election, the opposition parties have got more seats in the legislative authority, and analysts said this situation will restrict Lai's secessionist policy to some extent, and this is also the reason why the US wants to strengthen engagement with the opposition parties to keep its manipulation over the politics of the island.
On one hand, the US doesn't want the DPP to be too provocative against the mainland, as this might force the mainland to take decisive action to solve the Taiwan question once and for all; on the other hand, the US also wants to divide the opposition parties and to make sure there is no political force able to effectively promote reunification progress with the mainland, experts said.
Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""the US actions and remarks from US officials on the Taiwan regional election so far have not surpassed what it has done in the past, but China will respond based on the extent of provocations [if the US side acts recklessly].""
Integrated development
""What the mainland needs to do at the moment is to further promote its own development, especially the high-quality development, and use this advantage to promote the reunification process in its own way, to build the bridges with individuals of Taiwan, as well as cities and counties governed by non-secessionist political parties on the island, to push the cross-Straits integration and co-development,"" said Li Fei, a professor at the Taiwan Research Center at Xiamen University.
The regional election result caused pessimistic atmosphere among the people from Taiwan who support the cross-Straits peace and cooperation, as the Taiwan compatriots reached by Global Times reporters in Xiamen, a hub for cross-Straits exchanges, said the future of Taiwan's economy and security are all in serious troubles.
But there is also good news for people of Taiwan who start up or get employed in the mainland, as well as Taiwan companies and individuals who have plans to seek opportunities from the mainland's market. Chinese mainland authorities have released sweeping guidelines to support East China's Fujian Province in exploring new paths for cross-Straits integrated development, outlining a flurry of specific measures to boost economic and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan region in a wide range of areas from services trade and small businesses to high-tech industrial clusters.
Li said this is a creative approach to bypass the obstacles set by DPP authorities and to build connection with Taiwan's individuals. When Taiwan's economy is very likely to face more troubles due to the cross-Straits tensions caused by secessionist DPP, more and more Taiwan people will decide to leave the island and the mainland would be a popular choice for them. This is also very important for the mainland to be prepared for post-reunification governance of the island.
Taiwan residents reached by the Global Times in Xiamen said that culture, local language and living environment in Fujian are actually very similar to those of Taiwan, and in cities like Xiamen, it's even more developed than many cities in Taiwan, adding that due to the huge market and advanced infrastructure in the mainland, as well as the mainland's rising soft power among the youth in Taiwan, they believe that more and more Taiwan youths will break the ideological bias and come to the mainland to see by their own eyes in the coming years."

ANKARA, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has approved the ratification of Sweden's membership in NATO, according to a protocol published in the country's official gazette on Thursday.
Erdogan published the law two days after the Turkish parliament passed the bill to approve Sweden's bid to join the Western military alliance.
Erdogan ""decided to publish the law adopted by the Turkish Grand National Assembly regarding Sweden's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty, and signed the presidential decree regarding Sweden's accession protocol to NATO and approved the relevant protocol,"" his office said.
The Turkish parliament voted on the bill after a debate in the Grand National Assembly on Tuesday night. A total of 346 lawmakers participated in the voting, with 287 votes in favor, 55 against, and four abstentions.
With TÃ¼rkiye's ratification, Hungary remains the only NATO member country that hasn't approved Sweden's application for NATO membership.
Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022. Their accession requires the unanimous approval of all members of NATO.
TÃ¼rkiye approved Finland's NATO bid in March last year but has slow-walked Sweden's accession, demanding the Nordic country further address Ankara's security concerns.
In October last year, Erdogan signed Sweden's NATO accession protocol and submitted it to the parliament for ratification.
The foreign affairs committee of the Turkish parliament approved Sweden's NATO bid following deliberation in December last year, in a key step to put it to a full parliamentary vote.
TÃ¼rkiye has been under pressure from the United States to approve Sweden's accession to NATO, but Ankara was holding up its ratification to press Washington to allow the sale of F-16 fighter jets."

Iran's foreign minister says the official visit by President Ebrahim Raeisi to Turkey and its results will mark ""the beginning of a new chapter"" in bilateral and regional cooperation between the two powerful neighbors.
Raeisi and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday oversaw in Ankara the signing of 10 joint cooperation documents in various fields including culture, media and communication, rail and air transportation, electricity, energy, economic and free trade zones.
""Bilateral agreements are within the framework of neighborhood and diversification policy on all dimensions of relations, including trade, investment, economic, customs, industry, expansion of border markets and free zones, cultural, tourism, border security and fighting terrorism,"" Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian wrote on X Thursday.
President Raeisi announced on Wednesday that Iran and Turkey have set a goal to boost their bilateral trade to $30 billion annually and expressed confidence in achieving this target, citing the capacities of both nations.
The Iranian president, who had been invited by Erdogan, emphasized Turkey's role as a key economic partner for Iran.
In a joint news conference, Raeisi said Iran and Turkey are two regional heavyweights which can work to settle regional and even international issues.
He said the two countries agreed to further boost their fight against the scourge of terrorism in the region.
Erdogan, for his part, said he discussed with his Iranian counterpart the need for cessation of Israel's ""inhumane"" attacks on Gaza and the urgency of just and permanent peace.
Both Turkey and Iran oppose the illegal US presence in Syria and have strongly condemned the ongoing Israeli genocide against the Palestinians."

One Israeli soldier has been killed and three more injured during the regime's ongoing genocidal war against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
In a statement released on Sunday, the Israeli military said that the 23-year-old reservist was killed in the south of the coastal sliver over the weekend. Three other soldiers were injured in the besieged Palestinian territory.
According to the regime, the latest fatality brings to at least 195 the number of Israeli troops killed on the ground in Gaza. However, Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says far more Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting in Gaza.
Figures released by the Israeli army showed 531 soldiers have been killed since the outbreak of the war on Gaza on October 7.
Despite its deadly and destructive campaign in Gaza, Israel has so far failed to achieve its main goals in the onslaught, namely destroying Hamas and securing the release of its captives through military means.
Israel suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Palestinian nation and resistance as they managed to incapacitate the regime in its bloody war on the besieged Gaza Strip.
In an unexpected turn of events, Dan Halutz, former Israeli military chief last month hinted that Israel had lost the war against the Palestinian resistance groups in the besieged Gaza Strip.
War with Lebanon's Hezbollah would be 'difficult': Israeli general
Israeli Reserve Major-General Eyal Ben-Reuven in remarks to Israel's Maariv newspaper said on Sunday that Israel's political leadership should tell the public that the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah is stronger than Hamas and that a war with it would be ""difficult"".
He also spoke about the possibility of starting a war against Lebanon.
A US intelligence assessment earlier this month said that it would be difficult for Israel to succeed against the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah if the situation in the region escalated further.
The Israeli regime has over the past months carried out airstrikes on various locations in Lebanon and Syria as it attempts to expand hostilities against the Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip to other fronts.
Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem over the weekend warned Israel against waging an all-out war on Lebanon. He said the regime should expect a ""strong slap in the face"" if it underestimates Hezbollah's defensive capabilities.
Stressing that Hezbollah will continue its strikes against the Israeli-occupied territories as long as the Gaza campaign lingers on, the Hezbollah official said Israel was the enemy of Palestine, Lebanon, the Arab world and Muslims.
On the 107th day of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, the death toll has risen to more than 25,000, predominantly comprising women and children.
Israel's aggression has also displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been under near-total blockade since the beginning of the onslaught."

I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians!
Briefly about the day.
In the morning I held a conference call. Reports from the military   and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, intelligence information, reports   from the regions on the elimination of the consequences of Russian   strikes. Odesa, Donetsk region... A separate topic is preparations for   the UN Security Council meeting in New York that are currently underway.   The Minister of Foreign Affairs reported on our work and contacts with   partners in this regard.
In the afternoon, I had a conversation with the President of   Slovenia. We discussed both bilateral issues and international   cooperation. Slovenia has become a member of the UN Security Council and   is an active participant in the processes in European institutions. We   discussed our cooperation at all levels. Of course, I provided   information on the battlefield situation and our current needs. First of   all, it is very important to maintain confidence in relations with our   partners, in particular in the European Union. I am grateful for the   understanding of the macro-financial situation and the necessity of   further unwavering support for Ukraine. This is the key signal the enemy   must see. Russia must feel that Europe maintains readiness to defend   its values and unity at all levels. We also discussed cooperation on the   Peace Formula with Mrs. President of Slovenia.
Of all the meetings today, I would like to mention a long meeting on   the results of various negotiations of our representatives in   Switzerland, primarily at the governmental level. Government officials,   the economic team of the Office. There were many agreements in Davos,   many meetings, including with international businesses. We have to   implement everything that was discussed as quickly as possible. Our   people, the Ukrainian society, need to see tangible results of our   foreign policy activities, as the social situation in Ukraine today is   largely based on the quality of implementation of international   agreements. Separately, the Prime Minister of Ukraine reported on the   negotiations with his Slovak counterpart. Ukraine is interested in   practical cooperation with our EU neighbors - in everything that   strengthens our nations, our economies, and provides jobs in our   countries.
And one more thing.
Our warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine. Today there is   something to honor them for. The special forces of the 1st and 3rd   separate assault squads ""Omega"".

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The scale of NATO exercises Steadfast Defender-2024 marks the final and irrevocable return of the alliance to the Cold War schemes to oppose Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Sputnik.
On Thursday, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe Gen. Christopher Cavoli said that the alliance would begin Steadfast Defender-2024, ""the largest NATO exercise in decades,"" next week. About 90,000 servicepeople will be involved in the drills, he added.
""These exercises are another element of the hybrid war unleashed by the West against Russia. The exercises of such scale - 90,000 servicepeople with the participation of 31 countries - mark the final and irrevocable return of NATO to the Cold War support schemes, when the military planning process, resources and infrastructure are being prepared for confrontation with Russia,"" Grushko said.
He also noted that the preparation for the exercises ""takes place in an artificially heated atmosphere of military psychosis.""
""Irresponsible statements about a possible war with Russia, for which European citizens 'should prepare,' were made by the German defense minister, the Swedish commander-in-chief and the chairman of the NATO Military Committee. The goal is clear: by demonizing Russia, intimidating the average person, to justify the unbridled increase in military spending and the completely failed policy of supporting the Kiev regime with the aim of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia. And at the same time, force the Europeans to join the arms race even more energetically, to the delight of the American military-industrial complex,"" Grushko said.

While the Maldives is set to host a Chinese research vessel in the coming days, the Indian Navy is closely monitoring the vessel, which could raise fresh concerns from New Delhi, according to media reports. Some Chinese experts consider that India's worries and hype over the Chinese research vessel for their ""military purposes"" reflects its hegemonic mentality as it perceives South Asia and the Indian Ocean as its sphere of influence.
Chinese research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 03 is en-route to Male, capital of the Maldives, Reuters reported on Monday, citing open source intelligence researcher Damien Symon's post on social media platform X. The report said the move is likely to raise concerns in India, which has previously viewed the presence of such vessels close to its shores including in Sri Lanka in 2022 as problematic.
India is now closely tracking the vessel as it entered the Indian Ocean through the Sunda Strait of Indonesia on Monday morning. It is expected to arrive in the Maldives by around the first week of February, the Times of India reported on Tuesday.
Indian media described the vessel as a ""dual-use"" ship that can map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.
The research vessel is expected to arrive in the Maldives after the country's president Mohamed Muizzu visited China in early January when the China-Maldives bilateral relations was upgraded to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. A number of cooperation documents were signed during Muizzu's visit, covering areas such as joint Belt and Road cooperation, economic and technological development, the blue economy, the digital economy, green development, infrastructure and livelihood assistance.
The current Muizzu administration is dissatisfied with India's infiltration into Maldivian internal affairs in terms of security and politics over the years. This is perceived by some in India as the Maldives leaning toward China and distancing itself from India, Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
""Against this backdrop, the passage of the Chinese research vessel further intensifies the suspicion of Indian officials toward the development of China-Maldives relations,"" he said.
India has previously conveyed to Sri Lanka its strong objections about such vessels. Sri Lanka has informed India that it will not allow any Chinese research vessel to dock at its ports or operate within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for one year, the Hindustan Times reported in December 2023. Some Indian media described it as a ""big win"" for India.
""The diplomatic actions India previously took to pressure Sri Lanka against the Chinese research vessel seem unlikely to work with the Muizzu government,"" Qian said, noting that India-Maldives relations are at a delicate juncture.
Muizzu clearly stated that the Maldives does not take sides in this matter and that mutual respect is needed in international relations. So India is cautious not to exert overt pressure on the Maldivian government, the expert noted.
This is not the first time that Chinese research vessel has docked in the Maldives. In 2016, the research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 01 was open to the public in November that year in Male, which was set to conduct surveys in the southern part of the Eastern Indian Ocean, covering physical oceanography and marine time meteorology, marine chemistry and water body biology as well as marine optics.
In February 2017, the Chinese ambassador to the Maldives met with a delegation from the research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 09, which docked in Male for the first time, paving the way for marine cooperation between the two countries.
India perceives South Asia and the Indian Ocean as its sphere of influence and is sensitive about China's presence in the Indian Ocean. It is a mix of an inflated yet sensitive hegemonic mentality toward the region, Tian Guangqiang, an assistant research fellow with the National Institute of International Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
India might express its serious concerns or protests to the Maldives through diplomatic channels, showing its displeasure, and it could also request reciprocal treatment for its naval ships or other vessels visiting the Maldives, Tian said. ""It could leverage pro-Indian political parties or forces within the Maldives to exert pressure, as well as using social media to propagate the so-called 'China threat' narrative.""
However, the Maldives might assert that such matters fall under its sovereign rights and are not open to Indian interference, although it might adopt a more balanced approach, he said."

Dear Ukrainians!
The 700th day of this war - a very difficult day.
First. I summoned Umerov, Zaluzhnyi, Shaptala, Budanov and Maliuk -   they reported on the situation with the aircraft and the exchange.
It is obvious that the Russians are messing with the lives of   Ukrainian captives, the feelings of their relatives, and the emotions of   our society.
All clear facts must be established. To the extent possible, given   that the aircraft crashed on Russian territory - beyond our control.
""Facts"" is the key word now.
I heard a report from the Commander-in-Chief and the General Staff on   the use of the Air Force. The Main Intelligence Directorate is   clarifying the fate of all captives. The Security Service of Ukraine is   investigating all the circumstances. I have instructed the Minister of   Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to provide our partners with the information   available to Ukraine. Our state will insist on an international   investigation.
Second. Today there were reports on the situation on the frontline - a   key focus area. Special attention was paid to Avdiivka, other positions   in Donetsk region, as well as the Kupyansk direction.
We are doing everything to strengthen our warriors.
Third. The U.S. Senate committee has adopted an important decision on   the confiscation of Russian assets, which is a completely fair step.   Russia must feel the real cost of its aggression the most, and we in   Ukraine are truly grateful to all those who are helping to find, freeze   and prepare the confiscation of assets of the Russian state and its   associates. I thank everyone in the U.S. Congress who cares about   protecting justice.
Fourth. I spoke with the German Chancellor. The topics are quite   obvious. I expressed gratitude for the relations we have achieved, for   the support and cooperation. It is very important that Germany   steadfastly and fundamentally defends Europe - freedom and stability on   our continent. The democratic system in Europe can only be preserved if   Germany continues to be a reliable defender of democracy.
We discussed further cooperation with Mr. Chancellor. In particular,   our defense - first and foremost, of course, protection against Russian   missiles and drones. Germany has already saved thousands of Ukrainian   lives. We are preparing new joint steps as well.
We also discussed the economy and political interaction at the level   of the entire European Union. In particular, this concerns the   macrofinancial sector.
I am also grateful to Olaf, to Mr. Chancellor, for his willingness to   work on a security agreement based on the corresponding G7 Declaration.
One more thing.
700 days of full-scale war - the war of these Russian savages against   Ukraine and life itself. Another Russian strike on Odesa - missiles,   ""Shahed"" drones. Shelling of Kherson and the region. Nikopol, Dnipro,   other cities of Dnipropetrovsk region. Our Donetsk region.
Ukraine has overcome a tremendous path, stood firm and must defend   itself. It must defend our people and the interests of our state.
I have just signed a decree to honor our warriors with state awards.   243 of our servicemen from different brigades - combat brigades. In   total, more than 69 thousand of our defenders from the Defense and   Security Forces of Ukraine have been awarded: Armed Forces, National   Guard, border guards, intelligence, police and other elements of our   defense forces. I am grateful to each and every one of them for their   fortitude.
Glory to our people!
Glory to Ukraine!"

Shenzhen TV: This year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil. On January 19, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Brazil. Can you share more about the highlights of Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Brazil and the outcomes and common understandings reached between the two sides at the meetings?
Wang Wenbin: During the past few days, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Brazil and Jamaica upon invitation.
During his visit to Brazil, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Brazilian President Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and chief adviser to the President Celso Amorim respectively. He also co-chaired the fourth China-Brazil Foreign Ministerial-Level Comprehensive Strategic Dialogue with Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira and jointly met the press. President Lula da Silva noted that since day one after Brazil established diplomatic relations with China, Brazil has publicly supported and adhered to the one-China principle and will stick to this position. Brazil is optimistic about China's development prospects, and hopes to draw on China's governance experience and enrich cooperation with China. Brazil shares high consensus on many major issues with China, and hopes to work with China to improve global governance and increase the collective strength of developing countries and their say in international affairs. The Brazilian side also noted that they look to hosting the G20 Leaders' Summit in Rio de Janeiro as an opportunity to enhance high-level exchange with China, boost bilateral ties and lead the friendship and cooperation between the two countries to another, more promising 50 years.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted that Brazil is the first developing country to establish a strategic partnership with China and the first major Latin American country to elevate the bilateral relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Relations with Brazil have always been a priority in China's diplomacy, and China firmly supports Brazil in accelerating economic and social development and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs. China stands ready to take the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to work with Brazil for another ""golden 50 years"" of bilateral ties. During the visit, the two sides reached a number of common understandings:
First, the two sides will jointly implement the important common understandings between the two presidents, enhance strategic mutual trust and keep understanding and supporting each other on issues related to our core interests and major concerns for the benefit of the two peoples. Second, the two sides will continue to advance mutually beneficial cooperation. China and Brazil work together in fields ranging from space to soybean. We will stay committed to the principle of openness, inclusiveness, and mutually beneficial cooperation, better synergize development strategies and elevate bilateral cooperation across the board to a new level. Third, the two sides will jointly strengthen cultural and people-to-people exchanges, enhance the public support of the China-Brazil friendship, offer visa facilitation to each other, and expand mutual interactions. Fourth, the two sides will jointly display the sense of responsibility as major countries and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We will strengthen communication and coordination, uphold the common interests of developing countries, promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and build a community with a shared future between China and Brazil, and between China and Latin America.
During his visit to Jamaica, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with and held talks with Prime Minister Andrew Holness and Foreign Ministerâ Kamina Johnson Smith respectively. The Jamaican side said it will stay committed to the one-China principle, put China-Jamaica relations front and center and strive for a robust China-Jamaica strategic partnership. China's modernization sets an example of high-quality development. Jamaica admires China's remarkable achievements and expects to draw from China's successful experience for more efficient and equitable development. Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that China upholds equality among all countries regardless of their size, greater democracy in international relations and non-interference in any other country's internal affairs, and will not strive for geopolitical rivalry or force other countries to pick sides. China respects Jamaica for choosing a system and lifestyle with its own characteristics, and supports Jamaica in upholding its sovereign independence and national dignity, and playing a more critical role in regional and international affairs. China expects to better align development strategies, expand cooperation on trade, investment, renewable energy, agriculture, digital economy, blue economy and other fields, and enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges with Jamaica.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to six countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean is a continuation of the 34-year tradition of making Africa the Chinese foreign minister's first overseas destination at the start of the year. It reflects that China, a member of the Global South, shares the same future through thick and thin with developing countries. China will stand on the side of justice and equity, and stand with developing countries, especially medium-sized and smaller countries. We will promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, build a community with a shared future for mankind with all countries, and make new contributions to the development and progress of humanity.
Associated Press of Pakistan: After Iran and Pakistan conducted strikes on each other's territory last week, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China is willing to play a constructive role to cool down the situation. I noticed that Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu had a phone call with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani last night, and Vice Minister Sun Weidong is visiting Pakistan. Is China mediating between Iran and Pakistan?
Wang Wenbin: China maintains close communication with Iran and Pakistan. I want to stress that Iran and Pakistan are friendly neighbors and both are good friends of China. China is committed to upholding regional and international peace and stability and supports Iran and Pakistan in continuing to bridge differences through dialogue and consultation. We would like to continue to play a positive and constructive role in improving the relations between Iran and Pakistan based on the needs of the two countries.
China News Service: During the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024 last week, the head of Switzerland Tourism said that they could learn from China, Switzerland wants to welcome Chinese visitors and both countries have winter tourism assets to share. ""Switzerland applying to join the tourism competition"" became a hot online topic in China. Do you have any comment on this?
Wang Wenbin: I also noted the reports. According to a report issued by the China Tourism Academy, as the second ice and snow season after the Beijing Winter Olympics, the 2023-2024 season is expected to see over 400 million ice and snow tourism trips across China, which will hit a record high, and ice and snow tourism revenue reaching RMB 550 billion. China's booming holiday consumption and thriving ice and snow economy provides powerful impetus for the global tourism market and demonstrates the strong vitality of Chinese economy.
As stressed by Premier Li Qiang in his special address at the opening ceremony of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024, China has a supersize market with rapidly unlocked demand. The Chinese market, with its vast space and growing depth, will play an important role in boosting aggregate global demand.
China sees lucid waters and lush mountains as invaluable assets. And winter tourism destinations have become popular around the world. This reflects Chinese tourists' growing spending power and demand for tourism. This also shows the conviction and confidence that China's economy will navigate through the choppy waters. It is also an opportunity for China, Switzerland and other countries to enhance mutually beneficial cooperation. We will keep exploring and unleashing market demand, provide broader space for boosting global trade and investment, and inject stronger impetus into the global economic recovery.
Nippon Television: According to our report, a group of North Korean IT technicians are doing business in the city of Beijing and earning foreign currency. Some analysts have pointed out that this may be a violation of UN Security Council sanctions. Do you have any comment for that?
Wang Wenbin: I am not aware of that. On implementing Security Council resolutions, China has always fulfilled our international obligations fully and in good faith.
Bloomberg: The recently reelected President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo said in his inaugural address that the details of the royalty for the Sicomines project will be renegotiated. That was discussed when he was here last year and when he met with Chinese leader. Can you confirm the details of this renegotiation of the royalty agreement? And can you give us the details about when that would be paid and how?
Wang Wenbin: I have no information on what you asked about. I'd refer you to competent authorities.
Ukrainian News Agency: Last week during the World Economic Forum in Davos, the need for direct dialogue between the leaders of Ukraine and China was mentioned many times. How can you comment on the prospects of such a dialogue, or perhaps, negotiations between the two countries' foreign ministers?
Wang Wenbin: China and Ukraine maintain smooth channels of communication and exchange views on issues of mutual interest. The two sides will continue to engage in exchanges in light of the needs in bilateral relations.
Reuters: Two US Congress committees dedicated to investigating security threats and risks posed by Beijing are looking into Swiss engineering group called ABB. They're looking into ABB's operations in China, particularly about the installation of ABB equipment by Chinese firm, Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC), onto ship-to-shore cranes that are bound for the US. These committees are seeking to clarify the relations between these two companies. How does the Ministry respond to this matter and has the Ministry reached out to ZPMC about this matter?
Wang Wenbin: It seems that the paranoia of some US politicians is getting worse.
I would like to ask these politicians: why do they keep blaming Chinese companies for threatening US national security even though they do not have any evidence? Why is it always the industrial champions of China who are being targeted as ""threats"" to US national security? Why does the US coerce other countries into banning Chinese companies when these countries do not feel threatened by Chinese products at all?â
From accusing Chinese IT manufacturers of leaving ""backdoor"" in their products to calling Chinese cranes ""Trojan horse"" that collect intelligence, and to blaming China-produced EV cells for harming US national security, some US politicians have been blowing up the bubble of ""China threat"", while exposing their real aim of suppressing China's development in the name of national security. For those US politicians, anything advanced from China can be a ""threat"" and must be stopped by all means; perhaps shirts and socks are the only type of Chinese exports that do not threaten the US. This is sheer bullying and hegemonism.
These politicians talk about rules and fair competition, but all they do is break the rules, play foul to kneecap competitors and deprive other countries of their legitimate right to development. These despicable moves should be condemned and rejected by the international community.
CCTV: There are foreign media comments saying that for some time, global talent are ""reluctant"" to work and live in Hong Kong, and even show a trend of ""talent drain."" What's the Foreign Ministry's comment?
Wang Wenbin: Such comments lack factual basis and respect for the fact that Hong Kong remains the hub of global talent. It is quite irresponsible to discredit Hong Kong's freedom and human rights situation, for it is gravely misleading for the public. The reality is that Hong Kong's strong appeal to global talent continues to grow. According to the Hong Kong SAR government, from mid-2022 to mid-2023, the net inflow of Hong Kong residents amounted to 174,000. There's no so-called ""talent drain"" in Hong Kong. From January to November in 2023, the SAR government received more than 200,000 applications under various talent schemes. Among them, over 120,000 applications have been approved and 80,000 talents have arrived in Hong Kong, which far exceeded the annual target of admitting at least 35,000 talents. Besides, the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland released the IMD World Talent Report 2023, which shows that Hong Kong ranks the second in Asia in terms of talent competitiveness. These numbers and facts fully show that Hong Kong remains a popular destination for global talent.
Hong Kong has entered a new stage in which the region has restored order and is set to thrive. People there are living a happy life and enjoying lawful rights and freedom. This has created an unprecedented environment and golden opportunities for both Chinese and foreign talent to live and thrive in Hong Kong. We believe that under ""One Country, Two Systems"", Hong Kong's unique advantage of enjoying the backing of the motherland and being open to the world will further strengthen. Hong Kong will further expand the progress it is making in economic and social endeavors. The region's appeal to global talent will only grow.
The Central Government of China will as always support the Hong Kong SAR in attracting global talent, building new advantages and welcoming world talent from all sectors to share in Hong Kong's development opportunities and open up a brighter future for Hong Kong.
Global Times: After the Independent National Electoral Commission of Comoros announced on January 16 that incumbent President Azali Assoumani won the first round of presidential election with 62.97 percent of the votes, protests have broken out in multiple places of the country, and the US, the EU and France have issued statements questioning the election result. What is China's comment on this?
Wang Wenbin: The presidential election is the internal affair of Comoros. China always upholds the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and respects the will and choice of the people of Comoros. As a good friend and good partner, China would like to see social stability in Comoros and continuity in its domestic and foreign policies, and hopes that relevant parties will express their aspiration through lawful means. The international community should play a constructive role, but not resort to interference. Otherwise it will only be counterproductive.
China stands ready to work with international partners to support Comoros in maintaining social stability and play a positive role in upholding peace and development in the region.
Bloomberg: You said in your earlier answer about Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Brazil that China supports Brazil in playing a greater role in regional affairs. Was there any discussion of the new government in Argentina as part of the discussion of Brazil's role in Latin American affairs and how China can assist with that?
Wang Wenbin: I just briefed you on Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Brazil. Taking this opportunity, I'd like to give you more details on China-Argentina relations.
China and Argentina are both major developing countries and important emerging markets, and we are each other's comprehensive strategic partners. In recent years, China and Argentina have been advancing Belt and Road cooperation. The two sides signed important cooperation documents, including the memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative and cooperation plan. We stand ready to work with Argentina to cement political mutual trust, enhance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, tap on our complementary advantages, deepen equal-footed and mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields and advance the sustained and steady growth of China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership. Meanwhile, China stands ready to work with Argentina to elevate the cooperation between China and Latin America."

BAGHDAD, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Two explosive-laden drones were shot down Tuesday by the air defense system at the Ayn al-Asad Airbase which houses U.S. troops in the western Iraqi province of Anbar.
An Iraqi army officer told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that the drones were shot down in the evening while attacking the airbase near the town of al-Baghdadi, some 190 km northwest of the capital Baghdad, without causing casualties.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iraqi Shiite militia, claimed responsibility for launching two booby-trapped drones toward the airbase.
The militia said in an online statement that its fighters had launched ""two separate drone attacks"" on the Ayn al-Asad Airbase, stressing that it will continue its attacks on the U.S. bases.
The drone attack is the latest of the armed group's retaliation actions against the U.S. forces amid the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza Strip, according to the statement.
On Saturday, about 20 rockets were launched toward the Ayn al-Asad Airbase. Most of the rockets were shot down except for one rocket that landed on an empty area inside the base, according to an Iraqi military source.
A soldier was wounded by the shrapnels of the rockets that were intercepted by the air defense system and exploded in the air, according to the source."
IL665YFZXU_3RKROF6PT45LH7V,Netanyahu Rejects Hamas' Call to End Gaza War,_,_,20240122,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240121-voa02.htm,"By VOA News January 21, 2024
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal Sunday by Hamas militants to end the war in Gaza that now is in its fourth month.
""In exchange for the release of our hostages,"" the Israeli leader said in a statement, ""Hamas demands the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists. And leaving Hamas intact."" ""I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,"" Netanyahu said.
Hamas on Sunday defended its October 7 terror attack on Israel but admitted to ""faults"" and called for an end to ""Israeli aggression"" in Gaza.
In its first public report on the attack that began the war, the militant group said it was a ""necessary step"" against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
In late November, in a deal brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages who were taken captive to Gaza during the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since that deal ended, Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure from within Israel and from some world leaders to secure the release of the 136 hostages who remain in captivity, perhaps two dozen of whom have died or been killed.
Some world leaders, but not U.S. President Joe Biden, have called for an immediate cease-fire in the fighting. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the initial attack, and, according to Hamas health officials, more than 25,000 in Gaza during Israel's counteroffensive, including civilians and militants.
Netanyahu in recent days has also taken a strong position against Palestinian statehood to stabilize the volatile Mideast and prevent the spread of the Israel-Hamas war throughout the region. Biden and other American officials have called for Palestinian statehood.
""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River,"" he said.
Biden on Friday said he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for the creation of an independent Palestinian state that could include a nonmilitarized government.
Netanyahu said that he has faced down ""international and internal pressures"" to change his position on Palestinian statehood.
""My insistence is what prevented for years the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have posed an existential danger to Israel,"" Netanyahu said.
British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News Sunday that it is ""disappointing"" to hear of Netanyahu's opposition to a Palestinian state at the end of the Israel-Hamas war.
""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution,"" Shapps said.
Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions."" Asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, ""No, it's not.""
Biden said he had spoken with Netanyahu on Friday, the first call the White House had in nearly a month with the Israeli leader.
Netanyahu's office said, ""In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""
Netanyahu is increasingly facing conflicting pressures at home.
Relatives of hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza protested outside his home Saturday, demanding his government take decisive steps to secure the release of their family members. They say they fear that escalating military activity further endangers the captives' lives.
Meanwhile, a divide over the direction of the war, now in its fourth month, is growing inside the Israeli Cabinet.
Former Israeli army chief Gadi Eisenkot, a member of the War Cabinet has said a cease-fire is the only way to secure the hostages' release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel's current strategy not to let up on Israel's war on Hamas militants until their destruction.
Netanyahu also is under heat from members of his right-wing governing coalition who want an all-out war against Hamas, while the U.S., Israel's main ally, is calling for restraint in Gaza to protect civilian lives.
The Israeli leader has said he will push for ""complete victory"" against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it.
Critics have accused him of preventing a Cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say Netanyahu is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition.
The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday the Gaza death toll is at 25,102, with about 70% of the victims being women and children. Health officials said 62,681 people have been wounded.
In the past 24 hours, the ministry said 178 Palestinians have been killed and 293 injured.
Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) has announced that it has launched an attack on a target controlled by the Israeli regime in Syria's Golan Heights.
The IRI said in a statement on Sunday that its fighters had used a drone to hit an Israeli regime position in the occupied Golan a day earlier.
The statement said the attack was to support the Palestinian people in Gaza and their resistance against the Israeli regime.
The IRI includes several paramilitary groups recognized by the Iraqi government as a legitimate force in the country's fight against terrorism.
Those groups have launched almost daily attacks on US and Israeli interests in Iraq, Syria and in the Israeli-occupied territories since the Israeli regime launched its aggression on Gaza in early October.

World Health Organization Director-General has said he is ""deeply concerned"" after Israeli forces stormed one hospital and put another under siege as they advanced deep into western Khan Younis in Gaza.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote in a post on social media on Monday that reports of continuous fighting in the vicinity of Al-Amal Hospital, and Monday raid at Al-Kheir Hospital in Gaza are ""deeply worrisome.""
""Not only do they put patients and people seeking safety within these facilities at risk, but they also prevent newly injured people outside the hospitals from being reached and receiving care. This must end,"" Tedros added.
On Monday, Israeli tanks and military vehicles advanced into Khan Younis, placed Al-Amal Hospital under siege, and stormed Al-Kheir Hospital, in Gaza's bloodiest fighting of the new year so far, cutting the wounded off from trauma care, Palestinian officials said.
The incursion comes as Israeli troops advance for the first time, into the Al-Mawasi district near the Mediterranean Coast, west of Khan Younis, the main city in southern Gaza.
After the troops stormed Al-Kheir hospital they arrested medical staff, Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra told Reuters.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said tanks had also surrounded another Khan Younis hospital, al-Amal, headquarters of the rescue agency, which had lost contact with its staff there.
According to Qudra at least 50 people were killed overnight in Khan Younis, and the siege of medical facilities meant dozens of dead and wounded were beyond the reach of rescuers.
""The Israeli occupation is preventing ambulance vehicles from moving to recover bodies of martyrs and the wounded from western Khan Younis,"" he said.
The PRCS on Tuesday also reported that the Israeli forces targeted its headquarters in Khan Younis with artillery shelling and gunfire from Israeli drones, preventing the rescue organization from reaching the wounded.
""Israeli Occupation targets the PRCS's headquarters in Khan Younis with artillery shelling on the fourth floor, coinciding with intense gunfire from Israeli drones, resulting in injuries among internally displaced individuals who sought safety on our premises,"" it said on X.
""We are deeply worried about what is happening around our hospital,"" said Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
According to Gazans, the intensity of the bombardments in southern Gaza since the commencement of the war in October was the most severe, encompassing air, land, and sea attacks.
Israel claims Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, which the Palestinian resistance movement and medical staff reject.
The Israeli military launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, which it now claims is the principal headquarters of the Hamas fighters.
Israeli minister of military affairs Yoav Gallant said on Monday that military operations will not only continue but will be expanded.
The majority of Gaza's population, of 2.3 million residents, is currently confined to Rafah, located to the south of Khan Younis, crowded into public buildings and makeshift camps, with shelters constructed of plastic sheets tied to wooden frames.
At least 25,295 Gazans have been killed since the war began on October 7, Gaza health authorities said in an update on Monday."

Assalam-o-Alaikum,   Welcome and good afternoon.
Today we will present details of a sophisticated and sinister Indian campaign of extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings inside Pakistan. We have credible evidence of links between Indian agents and assassination of two Pakistani nationals on Pakistani soil.
These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions. Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations.
Indian media and social media accounts immediately claimed and glorified these killings as successful retribution against ""enemies"" of India and projected their capacity to carry out these illegal acts. Potential assassins were recruited, using social media, talent spotters and fake Da'esh accounts.
There was complete compartmentalization of the various components of the operation with employment of teams of financiers, locators, and assassins. Elaborate exit plans were developed to obscure all potential tracks. At this stage, we are sharing information on two cases. A few other similar cases are under investigation and will be revealed in due course.
First case is that of the assassination of Shahid Latif. On 11 October 2023, a group of criminals assassinated Shahid Latif outside a mosque in the city of Sialkot. A detailed investigation revealed that an Indian agent, Yogesh Kumar, based in a third country orchestrated the assassination through criminals and terrorists.
Yogesh Kumar recruited Muhammad Umair, a labourer in that third country to act as a contact with local criminals in Pakistan to trace and assassinate Shahid Latif. The recruited local criminals were able to locate and trace Shahid Latif. However, the killers-for-hire were unable to carry out the execution.
After some failed attempts, Muhammad Umair was personally sent to Pakistan to carry out the assassination. Muhammad Umair organized a team of five target killers which after first failed attempt on 9 October 2023, succeeded in assassinating Shahid Latif on 11 October 2023.
Based on confessional statements and technical evidence, law enforcement authorities quickly apprehended the target killers, including Muhammad Umair, who was trying to flee the country on 12 October 2023. All those involved in reconnaissance and killing has been apprehended and is being tried in a court of law. We have evidence of transactions made in the process linking the entire chain to Indian agent Yogesh Kumar.
Second case is that of the assassination of Muhammad Riaz. Another Indian agent was involved in killing of another Pakistani national Muhammad Riaz, who was assassinated during Fajr prayer, in a mosque in Rawalakot on 8 September 2023. Law enforcement agencies tracked the killer Muhammad Abdullah Ali and apprehended him on 15 September 2023 while boarding a flight at Jinnah International Airport Karachi.
Interrogation revealed that Muhammad Abdullah Ali was recruited and guided by Indian agents Ashok Kumar Anand and Yogesh Kumar. Indian agents utilised social media app Telegram to recruit Muhammad Abdullah Ali, who was asked to locate Muhammad Riaz.
Muhammad Abdullah Ali received payments through middlemen based in a third country. He was also provided with weapons and ammunition. After a failed attempt on 7 September 2023, Muhammad Abdullah Ali succeeded in killing Muhammad Riaz on 8 September 2023.
The law enforcement authorities apprehended Muhammad Abdullah Ali and his supporters and facilitators from various cities of Pakistan. The case is being tried in a court of law. Based on confessional statements of Muhammad Abdullah Ali and technical evidence, the investigators quickly identified the facilitators in Pakistan as well as in third countries.
We have documentary, financial and forensic evidence of the involvement of the two Indian agents, who masterminded these assassinations. We are releasing the passport details of Yogesh Kumar and Ashok Kumar. We have also reached out to the governments of relevant third counties. And as I said earlier, there are a few other cases of similar gravity at various stages of investigation.
The conclusions one is forced to draw from these developments are as follows:-
ï    These cases reveal growing sophistication and brazenness of Indian sponsored terrorist acts inside Pakistan.
ï    They fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the United States. Clearly the Indian network of extra-judicial and extra-territorial killings has become a global phenomenon.
ï    Pakistan has remained a target of extra-judicial killings for some time now. We are now witnessing an increased sophistication in these operations as revealed in these two cases.
ï    It is critical to bring to justice the killers, their facilitators and financers involved in these assassinations. Indian agents need to face justice for its extra-judicial and extra- territorial killings in Pakistan and other countries.
ï    India's assassination of Pakistan nationals on Pakistani soil is violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a breach of the UN Charter. This violation of Pakistan sovereignty by India is completely unacceptable.
ï    India must be held accountable internationally for its blatant violation of international law.
ï    Pakistan remains committed to protecting its people and securing its sovereignty. Protection of Pakistanis and any foreign national on Pakistani soil is a high priority for the Government of Pakistan.
ï    India's reckless and irresponsible act calls into question India's reliability as a credible international player and its claims for enhanced global responsibilities.
I thank you all

IT6RG7CCY7_TAI26QWNVISSKJK,South Korea looks to EU and UN to boost pressure on North and China,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/rok/2024/rok-240123-rfa01.htm,"Seoul looks to Europe to counter Pyongyang saber-rattling and challenge Beijing on North Korean refugee issues.
By Lee Jeong-Ho for RFA 2024.01.23 -- South Korea has intensified its diplomatic efforts against North Korea and China, strengthening its alliance with the European Union in Brussels to counter threats from Pyongyang, while confronting Beijing at the United Nations over the repatriation of North Korean defectors.
Kim Gunn, South Korea's Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs, visited the E.U. headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday and emphasized the necessity of collaborative responses to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile threats, the South's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday.
Kim, who participated in the E.U. Political and Security Committee, strongly denounced the reported arms deal and technology cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow, calling them ""clear violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.""
The South Korean envoy also emphasized that the alleged Pyongyang-Moscow cooperation  illustrates the ""inseparable connection between the security of the Indo-Pacific region and Europe.""
Pyongyang has beefed up its efforts to bolster ties with key regime backers, notably Russia, indicating its intent to solidify its support network. For instance, Russian President Vladimir Putin met North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui in Moscow last week and vowed to closely collaborate on efforts to jointly deal with global security matters.
Choe's visit to Russia came amid accusations that Pyongyang and Moscow are engaged in arms trading, with Ukraine alleging that North Korean missiles have been used in Russia's aggression against Ukraine - a claim that both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied.
Referring to the alleged arms trade, Kim said that Seoul and Brussels must ""closely coordinate and take resolute actions against North Korea's unlawful activities that pose a significant threat to peace and stability in both the Korean Peninsula and Europe.""
In particular, the envoy proposed collaboration in blocking funding for North Korea's nuclear and missile development.
Earlier this month, South Korea imposed a new set of unilateral sanctions against North Korea, adding ships, such as the New Konk and Unica, which had already been sanctioned by the European Union in 2022, to its unilateral sanctions list. This move was widely seen as a move by Seoul to align its sanctions with international entities.
Hours after South Korea's diplomatic push in the E.U., North Korea launched a series of cruise missiles, according to the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
""North Korea launched several cruise missiles into the West Sea [Yellow Sea],"" the JCS said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Detailed specifications and other information are currently undergoing precise analysis by the authorities.""
Separately, in Geneva, South Korea escalated its diplomatic pressure on China, North Korea's biggest regime backer. During a U.N. review session, Seoul urged China to safeguard the human rights of North Korean defectors.
At the fourth Universal Periodic Review, or UPR, for China held under the auspices of the United Nations Human Rights Council, South Korean Ambassador Yun Seong-deok urged Beijing to provide North Korean defectors with the required protections and humanitarian support.
The UPR is a mechanism that requires each U.N. member state to undergo a peer review of its human rights record every four-and-a-half years.
Yun asked China to halt the forced repatriation of North Korean defectors and to consider establishing its own refugee law as part of efforts to adhere to the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, which sets out the rights of refugees and the international standards for their protection.
It was Seoul's first time to have raised the issue at the U.N. peer-review process against China.
Ahead of China's fourth UPR, Seoul sent written questions to Beijing to inquire about its stance on the issue of North Korean defectors.
China repatriated more than 500 North Koreans shortly after the Hangzhou Asian Games last year, multiple sources working to rescue North Koreans in China had told Radio Free Asia.

A commission made up of officials from the U.S. and Iraq will begin holding high-level talks in the coming days designed to advance the nations' shared goal of building an enduring security partnership, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III announced today.
The U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission aims to build upon joint commitments to regional security and Iraqi sovereignty outlined during the U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue held last year in Washington.
Previous discussions have focused on transitioning the U.S.-led mission by Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to a timeline that reflects the threat posed by the terrorist group, operational requirements and the Iraqi security forces' capabilities, Austin said.
During the upcoming meetings, military and defense experts will focus on the evolution of Iraq's campaign to defeat ISIS.
""The United States and Iraq have enjoyed a deep and productive partnership on security matters in the 10 years since the Iraqi government invited the United States and the coalition to fight ISIS, including the seven years since the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq,"" Austin said in a statement announcing the commencement of the forum.
He added that the discussions reflect the evolving U.S.-Iraq relationship outlined in the 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement between the two nations and ""underscores our commitment to deepen our security cooperation to advance stability within Iraq and the region.""
The secretary said the upcoming discussions are guided by a shared commitment to determine the most effective evolution of the mission to defeat ISIS, while ensuring that ISIS can never resurge.
In previewing the upcoming discussions, senior officials with the Defense and State departments further underscored the strength of the U.S.-Iraq relationship and the key role it has played in the mission to defeat ISIS.
""The partnership between CJTF OIR and the [Iraqi Security Forces] has been a decisive factor in the defeat of ISIS,"" a senior defense official said. ""The Iraqi Security Forces, the ISF, have been in the lead during the last several years of the campaign to defeat ISIS with CJTF OIR in support to advise, assist and enable our partner forces.""
The officials said over the past decade, ISIS, which once attracted tens of thousands of fighters across the region, has been significantly reduced in terms of size and capability.
""The ISF have made tremendous progress through cooperation with CJTF OIR,"" the official added. ""Ten years after the Iraqi government invited the United States and the rest of the coalition to defeat ISIS, and seven years after our collective territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq, we see a need to transition to a normal bilateral security cooperation relationship.""
The official emphasized that the discussions are not a negotiation about the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.
""The United States and the coalition are in Iraq at the invitation of their of the Iraqi government to fight ISIS,"" the official said. ""Our Iraqi partners have assured us of their commitment toward working together to shape this future US military presence and ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.
""Both nations remain committed to security cooperation, and our shared interest in regional stability,"" the official added. ""The United States and Iraq will continue to work together to shape future US military presence and ensure an Iraqi lead enduring defeat of ISIS."""

20240121
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - NATO's upcoming military exercise, Steadfast Defender 2024, raises the risk of unintended military confrontation and undermines security in Europe, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Sputnik on Sunday.
NATO announced Thursday that it would kick off exercise Steadfast Defender 2024 next week. The US-led alliance bills it as the largest NATO exercise in decades, with participation from some 90,000 troops from 31 allies and Sweden.
""Any event of this scale significantly increases the risk of military incidents and further destabilizes security. But European security is of little concern to the top NATO command, which is too busy trying to keep this tool of US influence relevant in the already lost war for the West's global dominance,"" Grushko said.
The senior diplomat added that Russia would not be intimidated by what he described as a provocative show of force. He said his country had everything it needed to ensure its security and defense capabilities.
The NATO exercise will run through May. NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, told reporters on Thursday that the allies planned to test out a conflict scenario against a ""near-peer adversary.""

Tehran, IRNA -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the UN Security Council that any discussion on the future of the Gaza Strip is useless without an immediate ceasefire there.
Addressing the 15-member council early Wednesday morning, Lavrov said the United States has failed all efforts and initiatives to stop the bloodshed in Gaza and has given Israel a ""blank check"" to punish the Palestinians en masse.
""To date, the Council has not mounted an appropriate response to the situation due to the position of the United States.  That country has blocked all efforts and initiatives geared towards ending the bloodshed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"", he said.
The whole world has witnessed that the West's ""continuous disregard"" for multilateral diplomacy ""every time"" has led to tragedy, the Russian Foreign Minister was quoted by Anadolu news agency.
Current assessments indicate that Gaza no longer appears to be habitable, Lavrov said, adding that ""the United States oscillates between vetoing resolutions about the ceasefire and calling for a reduction in the intensity of hostilities in Gaza.  This serves as a carte blanche for the ongoing collective punishment of Palestinians"".
He also expressed worry about the Israeli authorities' statements regarding the rejection of a two-state solution.
The top Russian diplomat also touched on tense situation on the border of Lebanon and the occupied territories, calling it ""explosive"".
Elesehere in his remarks, Lavrov strongly condemned the aggression of the United States and Britain against Yemen, saying their actions pose a direct threat to international peace.
The Russian foreign minister urged Security Council members to collectively work on creating an independent Palestinian state and asked them not to believe in words of the United States that ""everything is under control"".
He went on to call for a world order not based on Anglo-Saxon rules, but on international law with the United Nations playing a central role.

J0HVQUH6Q6_8617PPW6WVQSYER,"US Calls on Israel to Protect Patients, Hospital Staff in Gaza",_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240122-voa03.htm,"By VOA News January 22, 2024
The United States called for Israel to protect civilians in hospitals as Israeli forces pressed ahead in its fight against Hamas militants in Gaza, carrying out airstrikes Monday in the territory's northern, central and southern regions.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that while Israel has a right to defend itself, ""We expect them to do so in accordance with international law and to protect innocent people in hospitals, medical staff and patients as well, as much as possible.""
Reuters news agency reported that Israeli troops Monday stormed a hospital in Al-Mawasi district, west of the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra told the news agency that Israeli forces arrested medical staff at the hospital.
Israel has blamed Hamas for putting civilians in danger, saying the militant group intentionally operates in and around hospitals and has created a network of tunnels underneath.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others, also took about 240 people hostage.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 25,295 Palestinians have been killed in the war, many of them women and children. The ministry does not specify the number of civilians and Hamas fighters among the dead.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday that the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is ""seeding hate for generations.""
Borrell spoke ahead of separate talks EU ministers held Monday with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and the Palestinian Authority's top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
""We have in mind what Hamas is, what Hamas has done, and certainly we reject and we condemn,"" Borrell told reporters. ""But the peace and stability cannot be built only by military means, and not in this particular way of using military means.""
""The humanitarian situation could not be worse,"" Borrell said. ""There [are] no words to explain how the situation is, with hundreds of thousands without anything, without shelter, without food, without medicine and under the bombs.""
In fighting Monday, airstrikes were reported across the Gaza Strip, with intense battles in Khan Younis, the second-largest city in Gaza.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its ambulances were unable to reach the wounded in Khan Younis due to Israeli troops besieging the group's ambulance center.
Also Monday, groups of relatives of the Israeli hostages disrupted an Israeli parliamentary committee meeting, demanding lawmakers do more to free those still being held. The demonstration was the latest in a string of similar actions in recent days, including a protest Sunday near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence.
Netanyahu on Sunday rejected a proposal by Hamas to end the war.
""In exchange for the release of our hostages,"" the Israeli leader said in a statement, ""Hamas demands the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists. And leaving Hamas intact.""
""I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,"" Netanyahu said.
Hamas on Sunday defended its terror attack on Israel but admitted to ""faults"" and called for an end to ""Israeli aggression"" in Gaza.
In its first public report on the attack that began the war, the militant group said it was a ""necessary step"" against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
In late November, in a deal brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages who were taken captive to Gaza were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since that deal ended, Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure from within Israel and from some world leaders to secure the release of the 136 hostages who remain in captivity, perhaps two dozen of whom have died or been killed.
Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
President Museveni, thank you for your warm welcome.
I congratulate Uganda on its chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement.
This Movement began at a divided moment in history.
In the midst of the Cold War, its architects â leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Josip Broz Tito, Gamal Abdel Nasser and others â worked to advance cooperation.
Supporting countries as they travelled the path to full decolonization.
Boosting trade and economic development in the Global South.
And championing the pillars of peace â dialogue, diplomacy and co-operation.
We see clear convergence between the principles of the UN Charter and the Bandung principles of the Non-Aligned Movement.
And you have an important role at the United Nations.
As significant contributors to UN peacekeeping forces.
As supporters of our work to uphold the United Nations Charter, international law and human rights.
As champions of solidarity in times of crisis â including during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
And in your strong call for the elimination of nuclear weapons.
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
This Summit falls at another moment of deep division.   Geopolitical tensions are rising.
Democracy is eroding, while populism and extremism are increasing.
Our climate is breaking down.
Poverty and inequalities are rife.
And the developing world faces its weakest economic growth in decades.
And more countries than ever are struggling with debt distress or default.
Human rights, international law, the Geneva Conventions, and the UN Charter are being flouted with impunity.
And conflicts are raging and proliferating â from Sudan to Ukraine to Gaza.
Following the abhorrent Hamas attacks on 7 October, the wholesale destruction of Gaza and the number of civilian casualties caused by the Israeli army in such a short period are totally unprecedented during my mandate.
And this includes 152 of our own UN staff members â a heartbreaking tragedy for our organization, for their families, and for those they were serving in Gaza.
While humanitarian workers are doing their best to deliver relief, they face constant bombardments, daily dangers to themselves and their families, and the enormous constraints posed by damaged roads, communication blackouts and access denials.
Meanwhile, disease and hunger are deepening.
People are dying not only from bombs and bullets, but from lack of food and clean water, hospitals without power and medicine, and gruelling journeys to ever-smaller slivers of land to escape the fighting.
This must stop.
I will not relent in my call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.
And we must do all we can to prevent spillover of this conflict across the region â in the West Bank, across the Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon, and in Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea.
Excellencies,
The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable.
This would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security; exacerbate polarization; and embolden extremists everywhere.
The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all.
Excellencies,
Within this swirl of uncertainty and instability, I see new opportunities for countries and the Non-Aligned Movement to lead.
This meeting's theme points the way â ""Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence.""
But what does that mean in practical terms?
First â global affluence depends on peace.
Peace means focusing on prevention, dialogue and mediation to heal divisions and defuse conflicts.
This requires institutions that reflect today's world, not the world of 80 years ago.
The UN Security Council is a prime example.
The world's preeminent platform for resolving global disputes is paralyzed by geopolitical divisions that block effective solutions.
Your Movement has long highlighted the Council's systemic shortcomings and the need for reforms to make it truly effective and representative.
How can we accept that the African continent still lacks a single Permanent Member?
September's Summit of the Future is a unique opportunity to consider reforms to the institutions of global governance and promote ideas to re-build trust and strengthen multilateral cooperation.
The proposed New Agenda for Peace sets out a vision for preventing conflict, sustaining peace and advancing development.
It reflects our commitment to all human rights â civil, political, economic, social and cultural.
It includes initiatives around disarmament, tackling terrorism and transnational crime, and managing threats posed by lethal autonomous weapons and artificial intelligence.
And it calls for a new generation of peace operations â including peace enforcement and counter-terrorism operations â led by regional partners, notably the African Union, with a Security Council mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, supported by guaranteed funding, including through UN assessed contributions.
The Security Council's recent resolution on this issue is a major step forward â and one that your members, as well as I myself, have long advocated.
Second â peace requires sustainable development.
We are moving backwards in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  People are going hungry.
Communities lack access to health care, clean water, electricity and proper sanitation.
Families are struggling to make ends meet without social protection and safety nets.
And children are denied education.
Developing countries need resources to overcome these challenges.
And this requires immediate debt relief and re-channeling unused Special Drawing Rights.
It means reforming an outdated, unjust and unfair global financial system that favours its founders, mostly rich countries, and has proven unable to provide a global safety net, in particular to developing countries in distress.
It means all countries going the extra mile to allocate their budgets wisely â investing in education, health, nutrition and social protection systems.
And it means strengthening the social cohesion of societies, and upholding  fundamental human rights, recognizing the rights of minorities and standing up to all forms of discrimination.
At September's SDG Summit, world leaders adopted a political declaration that demonstrated clear support for an SDG Stimulus of $500 billion per year.
And they also supported our longstanding call for reform of the global financial architecture including the Bretton Woods System to better respond to the needs of developing countries, making it fully representative of today's global economy, and not the one that existed after the Second World War.
And at COP28, countries operationalized the long-awaited Loss and Damage Fund to support those countries most vulnerable to the devastation wrought by climate change.
But contributions so far have been minimal, and developed countries have not yet fulfilled many of their longstanding commitments on climate finance.
I urge the Non-Aligned Movement to hold leaders to keep these promises this year.
Excellencies,
Conflicts, poverty, inequality, geopolitical fragmentation and climate catastrophe are the result of choices the world makes â or fails to make.
Guided by the solutions being discussed here and the spirit of trust, understanding and solidarity that has infused the NAM from the start, I know we can tackle these challenges together, and make the right choices in the time ahead.
And I thank you."

25 January 2024
Thank you President, and I think USG DiCarlo for her briefing.
At the outset, President, let me express our full support for your handling of the Presidency. I do find it ironic that while the Russian representative chooses to lecture France on UN rules, as he has frequently lectured the UK on our organisation of meetings, his country continues to commit arguably the most egregious and flagrant violation of the UN Charter in this institution's history.
President, the UK regrets all loss of human life, wherever it occurs.
We fully support Ukraine's calm and measured response to this aircraft incident and agree that there is an urgent need to establish the facts, as President Zelenskyy has said.
Whilst it is too early to draw conclusions, one thing is clear: when President Putin made the decision to illegally invade Ukraine, he demonstrated his total disregard for the value of human life, including his own citizens. We would not be in this position, and incidents like this would not happen, if it were not for Russia's full-scale illegal invasion in February 2022.
A sovereign, independent Ukraine did not and does not pose a threat to Russia. Ukrainians want and deserve to live in peace and security, and without interference from their largest neighbour.
Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost in this war, including over 300,000 Russian soldiers dead and injured, and tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians killed.
Soon this pointless conflict will have lasted for two years. Russia can choose to end the bloodshed. It can withdraw all its military personnel from the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine. And, as a permanent member of this Council, it can uphold purposes and principles of the UN Charter.
Thank you."
JHR12YGAGV_E9QB3D8BLF1GSV1,Taiwan says it cherishes relations with Tuvalu amid warning ties at risk,ROC Central News Agency,_,20240122,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2024/taiwan-240121-cna02.htm,"ROC Central News Agency

Taipei, Jan. 21 (CNA) Taiwan cherishes its diplomatic ties with Tuvalu and is willing to continue to enhance relations with the Pacific ally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a statement Sunday.
The reaffirmation of the Taipei-Funafuti friendship came amid an envoy's latest warning that the island nation could soon follow Nauru's decision earlier this month to ditch Taipei for Beijing.
In a news article published on Jan. 19 by the Weekend Australian, Tuvalu Ambassador to the Republic of China (ROC) Bikenibeu Paeniu said ""sources from Tuvalu"" had told him that his country could follow Nauru and switch its diplomatic recognition to Beijing after its election on Jan. 26.
The former Tuvalu prime minister called on Australia and its allies and partners to closely watch the situation and to step up their support for his nation.
Asked to comment, MOFA reaffirmed Taiwan's strong bilateral cooperation with Tuvalu in various areas, including agriculture and fisheries, medicine and healthcare, information and communications, clean energy, and education and cultural exchanges, since the two countries established diplomatic links in 1979.
MOFA also said that after Taiwan's Vice President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸å¾·) of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected president on Jan. 13, Tuvaluan senior officials and politicians across party lines issued congratulatory messages to Lai, while sending reassurances that Tuvalu-Taiwan ties will remain strong.
The list included Governor General of Tuvalu Tofiga Falani, Prime Minister Kausea Natano, and Samuelu Teo, speaker of the parliament, the ministry added.
It went on to say that Taiwan's government will continue to cherish the countries' solid friendship and act to strengthen bilateral cooperation on various fronts based on the shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law.
Nauru announced on Jan. 15 that it was severing ties with the ROC, Taiwan's formal national designation, to recognize the People's Republic of China.
That left the ROC with 12 allies, including the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau in the Pacific region.
In The Australian report, Paeniu also said that Beijing had been highly active in Tuvalu since the latter's last election in late 2019.
A number of Chinese companies had offered to help the Pacific island nation -- which is facing an extreme risk of being submerged in the coming decades as sea levels rise -- with a US$400 million artificial island establishment project, according to the envoy.
The Chinese offer was rebuffed, but sources in Taipei told the Weekend Australian that a similar proposal has been made again in the lead-up to next week's election.
Following Nauru's Jan. 15 decision, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau all pledged to stick with Taiwan, according to MOFA.
The severing of ties between Taiwan and Nauru came two days after Lai was elected president. MOFA had accused China of plotting to poach the diplomatic ally of Taiwan as part of a calculated ""assault on democracy.""
Nauru was also the 10th diplomatic ally Taipei has lost to Beijing since President Tsai Ing-wen (è¡è±æ) took office in May 2016, due to deteriorating cross-Taiwan Strait relations.

JI49Z8SGFG_N8TJZNGTT5DEGVG,Iran urged to halt 'horrific wave of executions',_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2024/iran-240123-unnews01.htm,"23 January 2024 - The United Nations on Tuesday underlined its condemnation of capital punishment following Iran's execution of a young man who was sentenced to death in connection with widespread protests.
Mohammad Ghobadlou, 23, who reportedly had a mental health condition, was arrested in September 2022 for running over a policeman and killing him during a demonstration near the capital, Tehran.
Thousands of people nationwide took to the street after the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody earlier that month. She had been detained by Iran's morality police who accused her of wearing her headscarf improperly.
Mr. Ghobadlou was charged with ""corruption on earth"" and sentenced to death.
Against capital punishment
""We continue to stand against and condemn the use of the death penalty,"" said UN Spokesperson StÃ©phane Dujarric, responding to a reporter's question during his daily briefing from New York.
Four experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council also strongly condemned the execution of Mr. Ghobadlou, who had ""a long-term psychological disability"".
They issued a statement urging Iran to respect international law and stop the ""horrific execution"" of protestors.
Access to lawyers denied
""We are alarmed by reports of unfair trial proceedings in the case of Mr. Ghobadlou, as well as in other cases, which fell far short of due process and fair trial standards required by international human rights law by which Iran is bound,"" they said.
The rights experts also expressed serious concern over credible reports that people who were executed had been denied access to lawyers during their detention and trial.
""We are shocked that the authorities went ahead with the execution despite the fact that Mr. Ghobadlou and his lawyer had no information about the legal basis for the intended execution,"" the experts said.
'Unprecedented rise in executions'
They warned that at least four people are reportedly at imminent risk of execution in Iran, including two men in connection with the nationwide protests, while at least 15 others face the death penalty.
""We are dismayed by the unprecedented rise in executions in Iran and note that at least 834 people were executed in 2023, including eight people associated with the nationwide protests,"" the experts said. ""We urge the Iranian Government to stop this horrific wave of executions.""
The experts also called on the Government ""to take steps to ensure the independence of the judiciary and that all due process and fair trial standards required by international human rights law are strictly and unequivocally upheld in all capital cases.""
Furthermore, they urged the authorities to review the use and implementation of the death penalty and ensure that capital punishment is used only for the most serious crimes as defined by international law.
About Special Rapporteurs
The four Special Rapporteurs who issued the statement have individual mandates that cover the situation of human rights in Iran; extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; the independence of judges and lawyers; and the right to physical and mental health.
They were appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva and are neither UN staff nor are they paid for their work."

As Ukrainian forces struggle to fend off Russia's invasion with   dwindling supplies of rockets and other munitions, some supporters are   arguing that there is more the Biden administration could do to re-arm   them without waiting for long-delayed congressional approval.
The administration's request for $61.4 billion in new military   assistance is tied up in a partisan battle in Congress, where   Republicans have linked it to demands for a package of tough new   restrictions on migrants and asylum-seekers at America's southern   border.
But some Ukraine advocates point out that the administration still   has previously approved authority to ship $4.2 billion worth of weapons   to Ukraine from its own stockpiles.
The catch: Without a new bill passing Congress, there is no money to   replenish the American stockpile, leaving questions about U.S. military   readiness and the country's ability to respond to a crisis somewhere   else, such as Taiwan.
""There is no statutory requirement to replace equipment sent to   allies"" under the Presidential Drawdown Authority approved by Congress   in December 2022, Mark Cancian, a former Office of Management and Budget   defense specialist, told Bloomberg.
He suggested that in theory, the Department of Defense can send weapons and munitions to Ukraine without replenishment funds.
Money better spent in US, say critics
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said the U.S. military understands the   severity of Ukraine's needs, and that's why it is working with Congress   to win approval for the supplemental funding.
""While we do have that $4.2 billion in authority, we don't have the   funds available to replenish those stocks should we expend that,"" he   explained at a briefing this month. ""And with no timeline in sight, we   have to make those hard decisions.""
Critics of President Joe Biden's $61.4 billion supplemental funding   request, which would also include aid for Israel and Taiwan, have argued   that the money could be better spent at home and that the   administration's first priority should be securing the border with   Mexico, where record numbers of asylum-seekers have been crossing   illegally into the United States.
They have also called for greater transparency and accountability   concerning the $111 billion in weapons, equipment, humanitarian   assistance and other aid that has already been sent to Ukraine since   Russia's full-scale invasion almost two years ago.
Reducing US supply worth it, say some
Some Ukraine supporters, however, argue that the risks of allowing   Russia to gain ground on the battlefield because of Ukrainian supply   shortages outweigh the risks of allowing the U.S. stockpile to be   temporarily reduced.
""Certainly at the moment, it would seem to be that the greatest risk   is one of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin gaining some battlefield   successes, certainly killing more Ukrainian civilians, if not gaining   advantage on the front lines,"" said Scott Cullinane, director of   government relations at Razom, a U.S.-based Ukrainian diaspora   organization.
Cullinane told VOA Ukrainian he believes withholding military aid sends a message of American weakness.
""It creates doubts in the minds of our Ukrainian partners that the   U.S. is willing to stand with them and makes an opening for Putin to   think he can outweigh us by simply extending the war,"" he said.
Alexander Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who was the   director for European affairs at the National Security Council, also   believes the risk of reducing the U.S. weapons stockpile is overstated.
""The reality ... is that the traditional Republican hawks will continue   investing in the U.S. defense,"" the Ukrainian-born Vindman said in an   interview.
""They're not going to take risks to the U.S. defense, especially when   it undermines this almost antiquated perception that the Republican   Party is good for defense, is good for the defense industry and is   supportive of the military.""
Vindman added that even if the administration did send the $4.2   billion of weapons to Ukraine immediately, it would cover that country's   battlefield needs for no more than several weeks.
Michael Allen, a former special assistant to the president and senior   director at the National Security Council, argued that by not using its   remaining authority to help Ukraine, the Biden administration is   maintaining pressure on Congress to approve the full $61.4 billion   request.
""We want them to look at the funds that have been appropriated and   conclude that the Department of Defense is correct,"" he told VOA   Ukrainian. ""We need this urgently, so it's good that the administration   is very clear about where they are.""

Tehran, IRNA -- Iraq's National Security Adviser Qasim al-Arji has said that the US forces' attack on Popular Mobilization Forces was a violation of Iraq's sovereignty.
Targeting the PMF headquarters in Al-Qaem and Jurf Sakhar is an assault and a blatant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and does not help the situation calm down, Arji wrote in his X account on Wednesday
The US should put pressure to stop aggression against Gaza instead of targeting and bombing the headquarters of an Iraqi national institution, he added.
According to the Iraqi media, the military college in Jurf Sakhar and an area near Trebil crossing on the Iraq-Jordan border were targeted in the US attacks.
Earlier, Al-Mayadeen reported at least five loud explosions in Jurf Sakhar.

New York, IRNA -- US Central Command, CENTCOM, reported on Saturday brain injuries among its troops in a missile attack on the Ain al-Asad base in Iraq by a resistance group amid growing anti-American sentiment in the region over Washington's support for Israel's crimes against Palestinians.
CENTCOM issued a statement about the attack on the Ain al-Asad base located in western Iraq. ""On January 20, around 18:30 Baghdad time, several ballistic missiles and rockets were fired towards the airbase"".
""Most of the missiles were tracked by the air defense systems but some were hit the base and the damages are being assessed"", the statement said, adding that some soldiers also suffered brain injuries and are currently undergoing examinations.
An American official was quoted by media that based on initial assessments a US soldier sustained minor injuries in the attack on the airbase while an Iraqi security member was severely injured.
The US command in West Asia was prompt in leveling accusation against Iran despite the fact that Ain al-Asad as well as several other US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria have come under repeated missile and rocket attacks by Iraq's Islamic Resistance in recent months.
Western news agencies quoted a US military source and an Iraqi police official as saying that at least 12 missiles were fired at the military base in western Iraq.
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance of Iraq itself took responsibility for the attack and announced that it used a barrage of rockets to hit the US base.
Resistance groups in Iraq and elsewhere in the region have repeated warned the United States against it all-out support for the Israeli regime's genocidal war on the Gaza Strip. The Islamic Resistance had warned the United States that it would target American bases in the region in retaliation for its complicity in Israeli crimes against the Palestinians.
Iraqi resistance groups have targeted American bases in Iraq and Syria more than 100 times to make Americans realize that the cost of supporting the Israeli regime's massacre of the people in Gaza.
The Yemeni forces have also warned that they will continue military operations against Israeli or Israeli-linked ships and interests in the Red Sea until the regime stops its deadly aggression against Gaza.

Iran, Russia and Turkey have jointly stressed fighting against terrorism in all forms, slammed Israeli attacks in Syria and emphasized the leading role of Astana format talks in promoting a sustainable settlement to the Syrian crisis.
Delegations of the three guarantors made the remarks in a joint declaration adopted at the 21st international Astana meeting on Syria held in the Kazakh capital city of Astana on Wednesday.
The Iranian delegation was headed by Ali Asgar Haji, Senior Advisor for Political Affairs at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, while those of Russia and Turkey were led by Russian President Vladimir Putin's Special Envoy for Syria Aleksandr Lavrentiyev and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Ahmet Yildiz, respectively.
The trio ""expressed their determination to continue working together to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and stand against separatist agendas aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria and threatening the national security of the neighboring countries, including through cross-border attacks and infiltrations,"" the final communiquÃ© said.
They also ""emphasized the leading role of the Astana Process in promoting the lasting settlement of the Syrian crisis.""
Since the outbreak of Israel's brutal war on the besieged Gaza Strip in October 7, the occupying regime has significantly increased its cross-border attacks against Syria.
In response to such hostilities, Iran, Russia and Turkey also ""condemned all Israeli military attacks in Syria. Considered these actions as a violation of international law, international humanitarian law, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria, and recognized them as destabilizing and exacerbating tensions in the region and called for the ceasing of these attacks.""
The three guarantors also expressed concern over the negative impact of the Gaza war on the deterioration of the situation in Syria.
They ""underlined the importance of preventing the armed confrontation area from expanding and other states of the region from being dragged into the confrontation. Expressed deep concern over the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and stressed the need to end Israeli brutal onslaught against the Palestinians and sending humanitarian aid to Gaza. Called for the implementation of the UNGA Resolution A/ES/-10/L.27 (2023) demanding an immediate ceasefire and compliance by all parties with their obligations under international law.""
The trio also stressed that there could be no military solution in Syria, reaffirming their ""commitment to advancing a viable and long-term Syrian-led and UN-facilitated political process in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254.""
The Astana Format was launched in 2017 at the initiative of Iran, Russia and Turkey on how to reduce tensions and hostilities in war-torn Syria. Russia, Turkey, and Iran, as well as delegates from Syria's government, opposition and the United Nations take part in the 21st round of the Astana format talks.
Back in June last year, the Kazakh foreign ministry suggested ending meetings in Syria because the acute phase of the confrontation between Damascus and opposition was over. However, the Kazakh authorities decided to hold a fresh meeting by the collective appeal of Tehran, Moscow and Ankara."

Mr President,
Mr Secretary-General,
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are holding this meeting on the situation in the Middle East, first of all, the Palestinian question, at a truly critical moment. Immediate measures must be taken to bring about a ceasefire and stop the suffering of people in Palestine not just for major political reasons but also in the name of universal human morality. Likewise, steps must be taken to prevent further destabilisation in the other parts of the Middle East.
The Security Council has been unable to formulate an appropriate response to this crucial challenge. As you know, the reason for this is the stance of the United States, which is blocking all attempts and initiatives to halt the bloodshed in the occupied territories. We are shocked by the deviousness of US diplomats, who veto ceasefire resolutions and then demand a reduction in the intensity of fighting in Gaza. This obviously gives them carte blanche to continue with the collective punishment of the Palestinians.
Before this meeting, we undertook yet another attempt to coordinate a collective reaction of the Security Council to this situation. We submitted a draft statement by the council president demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. However, the United States and its allies have blocked that document, thereby confirming that saving Palestinian civilians is not a priority for them.
The humanitarian consequences of this policy are horrific. Nearly 30,000 civilians have been killed, including an enormous number of women and children. The northern part of Gaza has been razed to the ground and rendered uninhabitable. Internally displaced persons constitute 80 percent of the sector's population. It is a human tragedy that has no end.
The shortage of all basic necessities has reached an alarming level. I would like to draw your attention to an article published in The Jerusalem Post on January 5, 2024. The article, which was contributed by Professor Dorit Nitzan from Ben-Gurion University, previously a health emergencies coordinator at WHO, is based on assessments by environmental experts, including Israeli experts. They doubt that Gaza will be habitable after the conflict.
The bombing has caused an unprecedented contamination of groundwater, the coastal area and the atmosphere with a thick layer of debris and combustion products, destroyed hardware, munitions, chemicals, decomposing biomass (no matter how terrible this sounds), household waste and sewage waters. There are no natural sources of fresh water. The sewage infrastructure has been destroyed. According to experts, 22 percent of farmland in Gaza will never be restored. There have been tens of thousands of cases of diarrhoea, acute respiratory disease, scabies, skin rash and other diseases. The risk of epidemics has increased dramatically. The World Health Organisation has stated that the absence of unimpeded humanitarian access is the main obstacle hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid. The WHO has cancelled six scheduled humanitarian missions to the north of Gaza since the end of December 2023, because the requests it filed had been denied.
To alleviate the suffering of the people in Gaza, Russia and a number of other countries have sent tonnes of food, medical equipment and medicines to Gaza. We are providing support to the personnel of UN humanitarian bodies who are working on the ground there and, regrettably, often become victims of that war. About 150 UN aid workers have been killed. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who spoke about this recently, has described the loss as unprecedented in the history of the organisation's activities in conflict zones.
Promoting vicious ideas such as forcible relocation of Palestinians from places of their permanent residence is a matter of special concern.  This scenario is unacceptable and should not be implemented under any circumstances. The increasingly widespread violence employed by the Israeli Army and Jewish settlers on the West Bank of the Jordan River must be immediately halted. Any attempts to undermine the status quo of the Holy Sites in Jerusalem should also be ruled out.
Our Council's failure to take comprehensive measures has resulted in a situation where the current escalation of the conflict in Palestine has metastasised throughout the region. Once again, this is happening with the pernicious involvement of the United States and its allies, whose military presence in the Middle East, as in other parts of the Eurasian continent, is creating new and unacceptable risks to international security.  We strongly condemn the completely unjustified aggression against Yemen, which was launched without the UN Security Council's sanction and with Washington and London playing a leading role.  The actions carried out by the Anglo-Saxons pose a direct threat to international peace and undermine the world order based on the supremacy of universal international law and the central role of the United Nations, not on the ""rules"" of their own making. We also condemn the Israeli bombing attacks on Syria, including strikes deliberately targeting organisations that are legally present in the country at the invitation of its legitimate government. Political assassinations must be stopped. An explosive situation exists on the border between Lebanon and Israel.
It is clear that the unilateral use of force can only further aggravate the already difficult state of affairs in the Middle East. This situation has taken shape over time and reflects many years of history.  The reference is to the numerous invasions of independent states carried out by the Americans and their satellites, invasions that have led to hundreds of thousands of [civilian] casualties in Iraq, the collapse of statehood in Libya, a war in Syria, massive refugee flows, and an unprecedented surge of international terrorism, including on the African continent.
Terrorist acts in any form are unacceptable to Russia. We have strongly condemned the attacks on civilians in Israel on October 7, 2023. Unlike some of our Western colleagues, who apply double standards, we do not divide extremists into ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"" or ""friends"" and ""foes.""  We demand the release of all Gaza detainees, regardless of their ethnicity and origin.
Mr President,
More and more often these days, we hear calls, above all from Western representatives, for us to shift our focus away from the present time and onto ""the day after"" the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as if escalation in Gaza has stopped and the situation there no longer calls for the Security Council's attention. It is an example of crafty logic on the part of Western delegations. By blocking the much-needed efforts of the council to bring about a ceasefire, the United States and its allies would like to close this embarrassing page, which is making them accomplices in the slaughter of civilians in Gaza.
I would like to emphasise that the UN Security Council must continue to implement its mandate and call for a ceasefire. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the hostilities there will not flare up again. In the absence of this guarantee or unconditional implementation of the UN decisions on the establishment of a Palestinian state, all the deliberations about ""the day after"" are untimely and meaningless. The potential donors who could invest in the future restoration of Gaza are fully aware of this.
The following factors must be of paramount importance when we reach the stage of discussing the parameters of ""the day after.""
First, the consolidated will of the Palestinian people themselves. The Palestinians, who not had any chance of statehood in the past decades, deserve to see this matter finally settled. The first and most important condition for this is the unity of the Palestinian nation itself. We believe that our Palestinian brothers and sisters will display strategic wisdom and abandon the time-serving considerations and infighting, which are hindering national development. They themselves must decide what their future will be like, who will rule them and how they will do it. I believe our Western colleagues describe this as democracy. The enforcement of external decisions and ""social engineering"" solutions, which our Western colleagues like so much, are absolutely unacceptable in this case.
It is equally important to ensure that all external players are united in their positions, guided not by their political interests and plans in the region, trying to spread them through various Palestinian groups, but by the imperative necessity of finding a solution to that age-long conflict as soon as possible. Russia has submitted its proposals on ways to attain this goal. They can become a major element in a new effective mediation mechanism which will be trusted by both Palestinians and Israelis. We will continue working towards this.
The second key factor is the inviolability of the two-state formula for a Palestinian-Israeli settlement and the imperative of its early implementation. We have been seriously alarmed by the statements by Israeli leaders which have called it in question. We would also like to draw attention the extremely vague statements on this score made by senior officials of the US Department of State. It appears that Washington is again relying on its allegedly effective bilateral diplomacy, which has been absolutely disastrous, trying to ensure that the parameters of the Middle East settlement suit the United States before the November election and completely disregarding the long-term consequences of this.
We have seen this many times before. Every new round of Washington's arrogant one-sided policy in the Middle East and separate shuttle negotiations with regional players, accompanied by financial promises, leads to an increasingly bloody escalation. It has happened this time too. Washington started by burying the international quartet of intermediaries and is now blocking all international de-escalation efforts at the UN Security Council. The cynical and shortsighted policy of the American leaders has been demonstrated by President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who said a week before the October 7, 2023, attack that ""the Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.""
Colleagues (I am addressing my Western colleagues now), the whole world is waiting for you to realise that your stubborn neglect and outright sabotage of multilateral diplomacy have repeatedly led to tragic results.
It is obvious to Russia, as well as to the overwhelming majority of the international community, that the logic of confrontation on the Palestinian issue can only be overcome through joint efforts dictated primarily by the interests of the regional states. It is up to them to ultimately decide on its future. These budding positive processes have already been outlined: the China-assisted normalisation between Iran and Saudi Arabia; Syria rejoining the Arab League, and a new dialogue between Damascus and Ankara.
The goal of any international mediation is not to interfere in these processes, not to turn the region into a platform for geopolitical rivalry, but to create the most favourable external conditions for restoring trust between the parties involved.
This is what every Russian initiative for a Middle East settlement is about. After the acute phase of the current crisis is curbed, something which should be facilitated by the UN Security Council's joint call for a ceasefire, we propose convening consultations at the ministerial level to consolidate the key regional players' positions and on the basis of this, to develop practical steps towards restoring Palestinian unity.
At the next stage, an international conference on the Middle East settlement will need to be convened; the representatives who spoke before I did have also proposed this format. The goal is to proclaim a Palestinian state, and work out measures to ensure the reliable security of Israel and the normalisation of its relations with all Arab and Muslim countries in general. Russia proposed convening such a conference at a meeting here about 15 years ago. Hopefully, this idea will get the attention it deserves.
The broader idea of a collective security system in the Gulf area and in the Middle East, which would consolidate trust, transparency and guarantees of equal security for all countries in the region, remains on the table. As you know, Russia has specific proposals in this regard, which we have been discussing with all interested countries for a long time. The above is our vision of further steps. But again, the priority now is to achieve an immediate ceasefire.
In conclusion, I would like to call on Security Council members not to be lulled by the US assurances that they allegedly have everything under control and that they are addressing issues on the ground, and not to postpone the creation of a Palestinian state until better times. Not only is it important for the UN Security Council to reaffirm that there is no alternative to the existing international legal framework for this most pressing issue, but it is also necessary for it to outline specific ways and deadlines for taking action. These are not just obligations arising from UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, the Madrid Principles and other decisions. This is the moral imperative of the international community, and we call for it to be fulfilled.
Mr President,
Some of the delegations here thought it a good idea to just reel off the well-worn list of accusations against Russia in connection with the special military operation against the Nazi regime in Kiev. Colleagues, I leave these statements on your conscience, although I understand that your conscience has gone to sleep.
I would like to underscore a critical point. We have no right to allow the UN decisions to create a Palestinian state to be buried the same way as the 2015 Minsk Agreements, which were unanimously approved by the UN Security Council. France and Germany, which acted as guarantors, later admitted they never planned to implement them. Such criminal acts must not be allowed to happen again, this time against the Palestinian people."

The head of the religious council of Hezbollah resistance movement has soundly refuted Washington's allegations that it is opposed to the spillover of the Israeli war on Gaza Strip, stressing that the latest US military strikes across Yemen dispute the claims.
Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek denounced the hypocrisy and false claims of the United States as to its alleged attempts to prevent regional spillover from Gaza war, stressing that US statesmen are telling flat-out lies and dishonestly pretending to be pursuing such an objective.
""They (Americans) claim to be opposed to the expansion of war. The United States gives a message to Lebanon and other major playmakers that it is against the spread of Gaza Strip, at the same time as it strikes Yemen and other countries that hold pro-Palestine positions,"" the top Hezbollah official said.
Sheikh Yazbek also condemned the silence of Arab countries in the face of Israeli atrocities in Gaza.
""The Zionist enemy is perpetrating murders and crimes against women and children in Gaz. Whilst Arab countries do not support the oppressed Palestinian nation, African and other states are defending Gaza and its residents in international courts of law,"" he said.
On Monday, US and British forces launched strikes at eight different locations in Yemen, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, according to a joint statement signed by the six countries.
A senior US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said roughly 25 to 30 munitions were fired, including from warplanes launched from a US aircraft carrier.
Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched a devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after the territory's Palestinian resistance movements carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The relentless Israeli military campaign against Gaza has killed at least 25,490 people, around 70 percent of them women and children. Nearly 62,000 individuals have been wounded as well.
Reports revealed that Israeli shipping companies have already decided to reroute their vessels in fear of attacks by Yemeni forces.
Yemeni forces have also launched missile and drone attacks on targets in the Israeli-occupied territories after the regime's aggression on Gaza."

Thank you, President. I thank SRSG Salvador, Ms Waly, and Ms Hassan for their powerful briefings today. BINUH and their local partners continue to do vital work in Haiti in the toughest of circumstances. I also welcome the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Haiti and the Dominican Republic at our meeting, and the representatives of Kenya and Saint Lucia.
President, as we've heard from the briefers, the people of Haiti are suffering terribly. Killing, kidnapping and severe restriction of movement continue. There are disturbing accounts of the widespread use of sexual violence, including collective rape, against women and girls by gangs to instil fear in the population. Gangs forcibly recruited children and use access to food and water as a form of control.
We call on all political actors to put aside their differences for the common interest of the Haitian people and agree on a roadmap that commits all parties to working towards a return to sound, long-term governance. This is the only way to ensure stability and safety for Haitians for the long term. The UK welcomes support from the international community for these talks, particularly efforts from the CARICOM Eminent Persons Group.
The United Kingdom looks forward to the rapid deployment of the Multinational Security Support mission, and we thank Kenya for their leadership in stepping up to this task. We also welcome the engagement of Member States from CARICOM and beyond in this multinational effort to help the people of Haiti.
President, we recently welcomed the Council action in December which agreed new sanctions targeting those responsible for armed criminal violence in Haiti. We stand ready to work with all Council members to expand this list as a matter of urgency.
I thank you."

Many have already been displaced   multiple times and have nowhere else to go.
""Throughout the day and into the early evening, ambulances and our   own emergency teams were denied access to the site. When they finally   reached it last night, they were able to evacuate around 45 people. The   near collapse of the health system and the lack of trauma care in Khan   Younis city are making the humanitarian situation ever more intolerable   and intense.
""The shelter at the Khan Younis Training Centre has been besieged for five days, with repeated fatalities and injuries.
""This shelter has been impacted directly and indirectly by military   activity twenty-two times since 7 October 2023. Yesterday's strike was   the third direct hit on this compound. Buildings flying the UN flag have   been hit at least twice by tank fire, without warning.
""Civilian casualties and daily attacks on civilian infrastructure   indicate recurring failures by parties to the conflict to uphold the   fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: distinction,   proportionality, and precaution. Of note, UNRWA shares the location of   its shelters directly with the Israeli authorities and we had received   assurances that people inside them would be safe.
""We continue to call on all parties to take every precaution to   minimize harm and protect civilians and civilian objects, especially in   densely populated areas, and to protect hospitals, clinics, medical   personnel and UN premises in accordance with international law"".

Question: As you know, there's a presidential election in Ukraine is on the agenda.
Is there a presidential candidate, either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump, who you believe would be easier to deal with on the Ukraine issues?
Sergey Lavrov: Well, it's not to my knowledge that the presidential election in Ukraine is coming. I hear every now and then that UK, the United States are advising them to hold an election and that at least President Vladimir Zelensky several times publicly said that he cannot do this because of the Constitution. We are not meddling with domestic affairs, you know. To advise somebody to have elections when the Constitution does not allow - it is for the Bigger brother.
Question: There is a US presidential election coming up. Former President Trump said that if he were elected president, that the issue with the war and the special military operation would be over in 24 hours.
Have you had any chance to discuss this with former President Trump, or do you believe that the US would have some kind of secret idea on this?
Sergey Lavrov: No. We didn't have any chance to discuss anything like this with President Trump or with anybody else in the United States.
We didn't have a chance to discuss anything with the Americans because the current administration is not interested in having any dialogue except from time to time on issues of the detainees, exchanges and functioning of the two embassies in Washington and Moscow and the mission in New York.  But not on any policy matters.
I heard that President Vladimir Zelensky was reacting to the statement of President Donald Trump, which President Trump made repeatedly. It's not for the first time that he mentioned about 24 hours. But lately he said if I heard him right that even before inauguration he would be able to fix it.
Look, anybody who is sincerely interested in justice, including justice being established in the relations between Russia and Ukraine, which would involve, of course, stopping the Western policy of using Ukraine as an instrument of war against Russia,  we would be ready to listen.
President Vladimir Putin repeatedly said that it is not true when somebody is saying that Russia is against negotiations. Actually, Anthony Blinken said this in Davos a few days ago. It is not true. Russia was always emphasizing that any serious proposal which would include the discussion of the situation on the ground of the origin of this situation and of reaching a solution which would guarantee legitimate national interests of Russia and Ukrainian people. We would be ready to discuss. Actually almost two years ago in April 2022, a few weeks after the operation started, the Ukrainian side proposed a meeting. The Russian side agreed. There were several encounters in Belarus and later in Istanbul. And in Istanbul, early April 2022, we reached a deal, an agreement which was initialed. And as a sign of goodwill, the Ukrainians asked us to withdraw troops from Kiev, which we did, and two days later the agreement which was initialed and ready for signature was torn apart.
Question: By?
Sergey Lavrov: By Ukrainians. And the leader of the Ukrainian delegation in April 2022 in Istanbul, who is now the chief whip of Zelenskyi party in the Rada, Â«the Servant to the peopleÂ», Mr. Arakhamia. A couple of weeks ago, he gave an interview and he said Â«we were ready to signÂ», but then Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said Â«no, let's continue the military activitiesÂ».
Question: What would, what does a peace plan look like? You've rejected the Ukrainian peace plan. What's the ultimate goal? Would Russia were to prevail?
Sergey Lavrov: We did not reject the Ukrainian peace plan because the plan which was initialed by both Russians and Ukrainians in April 2022 was proposed by Ukrainian delegation.
Roughly it was no NATO, no military blocs, no military bases on Ukrainian soil, no military games on Ukrainian soil, unless all garant countries agreed.
And these garant countries included P5, China, Turkey, Germany, and the list was open to anybody who would like to join the club. And the guaranties which were written in the paper, which I repeat again was initialed, the guaranties were drafted basically along the lines of Article 4 and Article 5 of the Washington Treaty of NATO.
And the main thing was that the Ukrainians themselves bluntly stated in that paper that those guaranties would not cover Crimea and the east of Ukraine. And that the two countries would continue discussing whatever issues might be related to this kind of a deal.
This was ready for signature. Boris Johnson, as the leader of the Mr. Zelensky party, stated recently, told them Â«no, don't sign it, let's continue to fightÂ».
Question: Well, what is the ultimate goal of Russia? It's not a special military operation, it's been extended now for almost two years.
Sergey Lavrov: Well, for us, it's a special military operation. But we are encountering a real full-fledged war fought against us by the West with the hands and bodies of Ukrainian people.
The goal is very simple. We have been warning publicly since 2008, 2007 even that NATO expansion against all the promises given to Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev not to expand their lines, NATO expansion was going too far, five waves of expansion. And then NATO, I mean, the last moment at the end of 2020, found itself just on the borders of the Russian Federation.
Ukraine was pulled into North Atlantic Alliance. There were plans to build military bases on Ukrainian soil, including naval bases in the Sea of Azov, not to mention the Black Sea.
And the war against the east of Ukraine, which the Vladimir Zevenzky regime was fighting in violation of the Minsk agreements, was fueled by supply of weapons from the United States, from Britain, from Europe. And at the beginning of 2022, the fighting, the shelling and bombing by Ukrainian army of the east of their own country intensified ten times.
And this was the moment when we understood that the West rejected our proposals of December 2021 to sign the treaty on guaranties which would be ensuring everybody's security without expending any military bloc. This was rejected. We were told Â«none of your businessÂ».
Question: I have asked you, Mr. Minister, this question before, but since the war, the special military operation, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, NATO has practically doubled. And that is because many western countries...
Sergey Lavrov: Not doubled, I wouldn't say so.
Question: Well, Finland included.
Sergey Lavrov: Well, Finland.
Question: But it's much larger than it was, and therefore you have more NATO at your border than you had before. And much of the West believes that this is a violation, both 2014 and this intervention, of Ukrainian sovereignty.
Sergey Lavrov: The West has discredited itself completely. Frankly, if they believe in something, let them continue to live in these illusions.
We are fighting for our national legitimate interests, for the interests of the security of our country. It's just on our borders, not as Iraq was announced a threat to the United States, it's 10,000 miles from American shores.
Not like Yugoslavia, another 10,000 miles from the United States, was declared a threat.
Not like Libya, not like Syria, which were all officially called clear and direct threat to the United States' security and the security of its allies.
In our case, it was not across the ocean, it was just on our borders that NATO military infrastructure was built, aimed at the Russian Federation.
It was just on Ukrainian territory when they were planning to deploy INF, intermediate nuclear force, on land which was prohibited by the INF Treaty, which the Americans dropped from, and they wanted their hands to be free to put these types of weapons.
Question: What is the end game?
Sergey Lavrov: You have not listened by answer to the first question. I understand that it is boring that you want the end game.
Question: No. I'm happy to let you finish.
Sergey Lavrov: And the second key reason is that Ukraine, after the coup in 2014, the source of power of all those who have been running Ukraine since February 2014, was anti-constitutional, bloody coup. The coup leaders at that time, you might remember, they burned about 50 people alive in Odessa because these people didn't want to accept the results of the coup.
And to those territories which did not accept the coup like Crimea, which went for a referendum and voted to convert to Russia, and Donbass, which also didn't accept the coup rulers, the Putschists declared a war, war against their own people. And they were fighting the war against the east of Ukraine, populated mostly by ethnic Russians, citizens of Ukraine, yes, but they have been ethnic Russians.
Those parts of Ukraine, they have been discovered, they have been inhabited, developed, built ports, roads for hundreds and hundreds of years by the ancestors of those people, who the regime of Petr Poroshenko first and then by Vladimir Zelensky declared Â«inhumansÂ», Â«speciesÂ» and the Â«substancesÂ» who must be destroyed. Legislation was adopted to prohibit Russian education, Russian media.
All Russian books have been thrown out of the libraries like Adolph Hitler did with his books in Germany. And they publicly announced that all Russians would be exterminated, either physically or legally.
The ambassadors of Ukraine abroad, officials of regime, like the one in Kazakhstan, Mr. Petr Vrublevsky said: our main goal is to exterminate as many Russians as we can so that our kids would have less work to do. And never ever all this racist, racist legislation was giving rise to any reaction in the West.
Question: But how do you justify violating Ukraine's sovereignty? And what do you want in the end, a satellite state or a re-upping of the USSR?
Sergey Lavrov: The Ukrainian sovereignty was violated by the coup leaders who spat into the face of Germany, France, and Poland in February 2014, who tore apart the deal between the opposition and the president, which was witnessed and guaranteed by Germany, France, and Poland.
They spat into their face, they staged the bloody coup, they started hunting the president, they started hunting people from the opposition, and they declared immediately in February 2014 that their first act is to cancel the status of the Russian language in Ukraine. And the task number two was to throw military groups to storm the parliament in Crimea.
Question: Let me interrupt. Why is this West? Over 140 countries in the General Assembly voted to condemn this invasion as a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty? It's not just the West.
Sergey Lavrov: It is not important for us who was voting what way. I know how the Americans and the Brits and some Europeans are getting those votes. I have many friends in New York. When these resolutions were voted, I asked, why did they vote this way. And they told me, you know, being a bit ashamed, Â«you understand that I have worked here for ten years, my kids are in Stanford, and before the vote they came to me and said: don't forget about that your kids are studying, don't forget that your bank account is in such and such a bankÂ».
Question: Your attention is that most of these countries were pressured by the United States?
Sergey Lavrov: Not most, all of them. Whenever you talk to the United States and they mention democracy, you tell them, okay, democracy as you understand is that you dictate to each and every country what kind of political system they must have inside.
What about democracy in international relations? They're not interested at all. We remind them that the United Nations Charter said that the United Nations is based on sovereign equality of states.
Ukraine. For long years, we have been warning NATO that if you go that way, it will end not in a very good development. President Vladimir Putin was explaining many years before the operation started. During the night before the operation, he, I think, took half an hour to sum up the reasons why we were doing this.
Fine, the entire world heard. Next morning, the West condemned and said that this was invasion, annexation, violation of the United Nations charter, territorial integrity.
The rest of the world listened to President Vladimir Putin and listened to the West. And since they are sovereign countries and the UN is about respect for sovereign equality of states, all of them should have been left alone as grown-ups to decide what they heard from Vladimir Putin.
Question: I think you get pushback from most of these countries that they only wanted to vote against Russia's invasion because of pressure...
Sergey Lavrov: This time you didn't even apologize that you are interrupting me because I am answering your question.
Question: Yes.
Sergey Lavrov: For us, what is of crucial importance, that there is no single country in what we call Global South or World Majority except the Bahamas, which joined the anti-Russian sanctions. Not a single country from the Global South.
So when their hands are twisted, they might be inclined just to raise their hands during the vote, which does not have any legal meaning because General Assembly resolutions are recommendations. But my point is slightly more complicated.
Can you imagine that Switzerland prohibits the French language or German language?
Question: Yes, I can. But if it happens, under international law it still does not justify an invasion and a violation of sovereignty.
Sergey Lavrov: It's not about justifying the invasion. It's about how you treat yourself and how you are prepared to be treated. Are you ready to live through many years of humiliation? Everything Russian had been humiliated after the coup in 2014.
If Ireland, for example, prohibited English, you think London would say, well, we are angry, but this does not violate international law.
By the way, it does violate international law, human rights law, international humanitarian law. It says bluntly, there are several conventions on the rights of national minorities.
The funny thing is that the constitution of Ukraine, with all the laws cancelling everything Russian, having been already enforced. Take a look at it. It's on internet. Just read it. The state solely guarantees speaking and cultural, religious rights of the Russian and other national minorities living in Ukraine.
Question: This time I do apologize for interrupting, but I know your time is limited. Let me just ask you some specific questions. Right now there are reports that Russia is sharing rocket and nuclear technology with North Korea in exchange for munitions for the Ukraine war. Is that true?
Sergey Lavrov: Reports we have been hearing during all these years. We prefer to operate on the basis of facts. And the facts, which nobody can hide, is that the American, British and European military arsenals are busy on a daily basis pumping weapons in Ukraine.
Several months ago there were reports that Iran is selling some missiles to Russia and that these missiles were already noticed in Ukraine after they were fired, the remnants of those missiles were found.
Iran publicly and bluntly asked Ukrainians: can we come and take a look at those remnants and those debries of these missiles? It was several months ago. Nobody even remembers about those accusations.
Question: They provided some pictures. You're avoiding because there was Iran and there was North Korea.
Sergey Lavrov: There is no single proof in spite of the fact that in case of Iran there were demands from Tehran: please show to us what did you find. And I have no slightest doubt that the similar inability to prove anything would be in other cases.
Question: Well, they did have an exhibition of some of these drones here at the US mission to the UN.
Sergey Lavrov: Wait a second. Are you speaking about drones?
Question: Iranian drones in Ukraine.
Sergey Lavrov: Well, the Iranian drones near the United Missions in New York. I don't care about those Iranian drones. What we were accused of is that we used those drones to attack Ukraine. And there are elements of those drones which can prove it. And this was a lie. And if our friends from various countries who announced the strategic goal of defeating Russia in the battlefield, if they are so scrupulous about implementing resolutions of these two countries, where would they when in 2016 the Donald Trump administration said: Â«Resolution 2231 on Iranian nuclear program - go to hellÂ». I don't want to implement this. What about resolutions on the Golan Heights?
Question: Okay, we'll switch to Israel.
Sergey Lavrov: No. We can switch anywhere. You either defend the law including meticulous implementation of faulty Security Council resolutions, or you start pick and choose.
Question: All right. But can we go back to the question. Is North Korea sharing technology in exchange for relations?
Sergey Lavrov: In our relations with North Korea we don't violate any path of international law. And those who ask such question must answer our question first. If you have a proof, show it to us. We're not going to defend ourselves when we are without any proof are being accused of everything.
Â«We are ruining the Ukrainian sovereigntyÂ». Â«We are violating resolutions of the Security Council on Korea and IranÂ». Â«We are doing some other terrible thingsÂ».
A version was already floated that we have blown up the North Stream. This is a good thing. Terrorist attacks are prohibited by many international conventions.
North Stream pipelines having been blown up a year and a half ago. A few months after President Joe Biden publicly said: we will stop this project. And then you are not interested in this. You are interested in North Korea.
Question: Well, that's the most recent technology transfer that we've seen. Can you answer that question about North Korea?
Sergey Lavrov: The North Stream case is technology elimination. Destruction. If you are interested in technology, be interested in all parts of modern technology. Especially since the United States blown up these pipelines, European economy went down.
Question: Is there any chance, speaking of deals that have not continued, the Black Sea Grain Initiative? Any chance of getting that back on?
Sergey Lavrov: Again it's about being honest. I understand that the Western politicians are not giving you much chance in having these criteria in your interviews. But the original deal by Secretary General of the United Nations was a package. Ukrainian grain goes to the world markets and the route used by the Ukrainian grain is safe and secure. And parallel to this, Russian grain and fertilizers also go freely to the countries who need them.
The Ukrainian part of the deal was functioning very well. But even that, the Ukrainians tried to use for their benefit.
And the route which was identified for the ships, for these bulkers to go and which was announced secure was used to attack by sea drones, against the Russian naval and civilian ships. And this is well known. They used the peaceful waters which they declared peaceful, which the United Nations declared peaceful.
In the meantime, nothing happened to the Russian exports, including some 260 thousand tons of fertilizers who were stuck.
Question: The U.S. doesn't have sanctions on the fertilizers. It's just the incidental companies, the insurance companies, the shipping companies did not want to renew their agreement because Russia was attacking ships in the Red Sea.
Sergey Lavrov: The Red Sea? Russia attacking ships in the Red Sea?
Question: I'm sorry. In the Black Sea during the grain deal.
Sergey Lavrov: Russia was never attacking any Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea. There was a mechanism, including U.N., Russia, Ukraine and Turkey, for inspections. And yes, every ship was inspected. They were boarding the ship, they were seeing where it was moving and going back ashore.
Question: So why are you not continuing the deal?
Sergey Lavrov: Because the Ukrainians used these free secure passages to launch their weapons in the form of naval drones, which physically attacked and damaged several Russian ships and several parts of the Russian port.
Question: We will follow up on those allegations, but let's...
Sergey Lavrov: No. On this one, unlike on Iranian drones or North Korean drones, there are pictures and there are confirmations from independent experts.
And the second reason was that Secretary General Antonio Guterres was campaigning for this deal, saying that otherwise the needy countries would be in a disastrous situation, people would be dying.
So out of the entire amount of Ukrainian grain, which was shipped during the functioning of this scheme, only 3% went to the countries on the list of the World Food Program.
Question: Well, it was always supposed to be a commercial deal. Russia also had an upper crop of wheat that year, the first year of the deal.
Sergey Lavrov: You said that that always was supposed to be a commercial deal. I don't know to whom you were talking. We were talking to the author of the deal, Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who was telling us this is necessary for the neediest countries. And then, of course, when the bulk of this Ukrainian grain went to Europe, you know how the farmers in Europe revolted.
Question: Yes.
Sergey Lavrov: Because the Ukrainian grain was undercutting the competition and their competitive advantages.
Question: Yes, but they worked that part out.
Sergey Lavrov: But on the Russian part of the deal, of course, everybody knew that various companies were refusing to cooperate with Russia. Lloyd's quadrupled the insurance rates and so on and so forth.
But this was exactly the reason why Antonio Guterres volunteered to have a package. He said, help me with Ukraine and I will resolve these issues.
He was not able to do anything. It's only now some very unreliable mechanisms are being discussed.
My point, which you must hear, is about something which did not require anything. 190 thousand tons of Russian fertilizers were stuck in European Union ports. And when the owner of these fertilizers, the Russian company, learned about this, they said, look, I don't want this. I renounce my rights. This is now for the poor countries, for the UN World Food Programme to determine which countries must receive this for free. It was more than a year and a half ago. Only half of these tons of fertilizers managed to get to two or three African countries.
The World Food Programme was administering this exercise, but we were paying for deliveries. And the rest of this grain is still not able to reach the destination point.
Question: And so is there any way back to the deal?
Sergey Lavrov: Well, we insist that this deal must go through.
But the attitude of those who control various companies mentioned by you, the companies who are not really very eager to help the owners of these companies are key western countries, and everybody knows about this.
And the World Food Programme is led by an American citizen, a respectful American citizen, an influential American person. And she either cannot or doesn't want to do anything to resolve this very specific and not very difficult problem.
Question: All right. I'd like to talk about the Middle East quickly and about the U.S.-Russia relationship.
Sergey Lavrov: No, we're not interfering in the U.S. domestic affairs.
Question: Right. But are there better relations with former President Donald Trump than they have been with President Joe Biden? Do you think there is a shift that would come if President Donald Trump would be elected?
Sergey Lavrov: It's not for me. It's for the American people to decide. And I believe they're becoming more and more busy with the choice.
As for who is more promising for Russia. I don't believe that there is any difference, because the drive to ruin the Russian-American relations, the foundation of these relations, including all agreements on strategic stability, parity, mutual trust, inspections, transparency, and so on and so forth, confidence-building, all these started to be ruined by President George Bush Jr.
When he told President Vladimir Putin, that he is dropping from the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty because of Iran, and Korea. He said: Â«We need to really concentrate on not allowing them to get the bomb. This is not against RussiaÂ».
President Vladimir Putin said if it was not against us, then please understand that we still have to analyze what shape your missile defense program is going to take.
Question: Is all of this coming to a conclusion?
Sergey Lavrov: I always thought that the CBS correspondents are polite people.
Question: Well, I'm trying to... but I get a lot of questions.
Sergey Lavrov: But when President George Bush Jr. was dropping from ABM treaty, he told President Vladimir Putin: this is not against you, so whatever you do in return, I will not consider as being against us.
Very soon it was very obvious and became clear that Iran and North Korea had nothing to do with this missile defense being deployed in Europe and even in Asia. The deployment structure was clearly aimed at Russia and China, which brought this issue already in the global context, in the global strategic stability concept.
Then other treaties were destroyed, including intermediate nuclear force treaty. The land-based short-range and longer-range missiles were now allowed, because the Americans said they are not bound by this treaty. We said: if you deploy, we will have to do the same.
Now they started deploying this. And they treaty on the Open sky, allowing transparency, inspections by aircrafts over the territory of each other. It's no more.
And of course, START treaty has been suspended. It is expiring actually in two years.
It's impossible to understand how the Americans still try to tell us Â«okay we're enemies, we called you enemy, we said that you must be strategically defeated, but we still need to visit your strategic nuclear basesÂ». Because this treaty provides for the inspections. And then we said: Guys, read the treaty. It says that we are not enemies anymore. That transparency, confidence building, indivisible, security, mutual respect, when all this is back to your American narrative and behavior, come to us and we'll think about it.
Question: And before that, there's no return to these treaties?
Sergey Lavrov: Look. We have self-respect. When people bluntly say we have to defeat Russia, we have to humiliate Russia, we have to ignite the Russian people to throw President Putin out. And then they come: Â«please let us visit your nuclear baseÂ». Are these people sane?
Question: You think it's not sane?
Sergey Lavrov: Well, I think this superiority complex, impunity complex is getting too deep into their minds.
Question: Well, US and Russia have one of the most difficult relations in post-war history right now. How can you improve it?
Sergey Lavrov: We never spoiled these relations. We're not going to take any initiative, and going to run to Washington. Â«Uncle Sam, please forgive us. We were bad boysÂ». We have nothing to complain about.
Those who invented the Russian threat, those who ignored, huge amount of goodwill shown by President Vladimir Putin during his first two terms. They just said, okay, this guy is so nice - we will keep him in our pocket. Those who miscalculated everything, they must rethink.
Instead, we see the current generation of politicians in the United States having drawn just no single lesson from that unacceptable policies which the United States started to promote after the demise of the Soviet Union.
Question: And right now, there been an increase of Russian attacks on civilian targets in Kiev and around Ukraine. How do you explain that?
Sergey Lavrov: This was explained many times. From the very beginning of this conflict, we have been drawing the attention to the absolutely blind and deaf democratic community of nations called NATO, European Union, drawing their attention to the fact that Ukrainian Army, in violation of all norms of international humanitarian law, in violation of all rules of war, was deploying missile defense just in the living quarters, next to schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, and ordinary buildings. And the facts about the consequences of such reckless behavior have been presented many times.
Ukrainian Army with American, French, British, Czech Republic weapons, in the past few weeks continued to deliberately target civilian aims, destroyed dozens of civilian sites, and killed dozens of civilians, including kids and women.
The latest, on the 30th of December 2023, the city of Belgorod was attacked deliberately in the downtown area where no single site with any military installation has been located. And yesterday there was a civil attack against the city of Donetsk when the farmers' market and a series of stores, shops, were attacked. At least 25 people (because they're still looking for corpses) dead, dozens wounded. Kids, women. Any military expert, any honest observer, has confirmed already that this was a deliberate attack on non-military target.
I am sure that objective media outlets like CBS would not just leave this unnoticed and would ask questions about who and why was applying these barbarian methods of war.
It looks like when the U.S. and U.K. in February 1945 were bombing the city of Dresden with no military purpose, like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no military purpose, just level to the ground, so that they are frightened.
In Syria, the city of Raqqa was leveled by the Brits, Americans, and the French. In Iraq, the city of Mosul the same. So these barbarian methods of fighting your enemy is being now applied by the barbarians in Kiev. They have been well trained.
Question: Well, they are denying it.
Sergey Lavrov: Wait a second. it's impossible to deny. All the satelite images, all the eyewitnesses on the ground, the civilian part of the city, in Belgorod and the same in Donetsk. Farmers' market and food stores. Dozens of people. Sunday. People go shopping. And they strike.
Question: Well, we'll follow up.
Sergey Lavrov: Please don't forget.
Question: We'll follow. Can you answer a few questions on the Middle East.  What do you think is, what can happen next? What is your opinion of what should happen with Israel and the Hamas?
Sergey Lavrov: If in response to terrorist attacks, which we strongly condemn, like we condemn the attack on Israel civilians on the 7th of October 2023, if in response to these terrorist attacks, the international humanitarian norms would be ignored and the collective punishment means would be applied, then I am afraid, this is an invitation to more barbarian methods of fighting on both sides. On all sides. We are convinced.
You know, Mr. Antonio Guterres, when these unacceptable terrorist attacks happened on the 7th of October 2023, condemned them, but he said, but this happened not in a vacuum.
And he was chastised immediately by Israeli officials that he is supporting terrorists, terrorist methods, that the United Nations is a terrorist organization.
But he was right. Because for 75 years you have been, the General Assembly decided to have two states: Jewish state and Arab state in Palestine.
Question: Yes. But you are saying there is a context, as Secretary General Gutierres said, of the October 7th. I mean, there is no context, is there, for some barbarity like that?
Sergey Lavrov: There is no excuse for barbarity of the 7th of October 2023. But I don't think the fact that there is no excuse for this is an excuse for a carte blanche with no less barbarian means of fighting.
Question: Well, what would you propose? There used to be the Quartet of the US, EU, UN, and Russia.
Sergey Lavrov: The United States closed it. They didn't like any competition. They like monopolism. They monopolized, they usurped the political process. They were not a fair broker. And they were not promoting the creation of the Palestinian state.
After the 7th of October 2023 Israeli military commanders, some of the most radical people in the current government, were saying that Palestinians are all extremists. When in Gaza each of them reaches the age of three, by that time they are already extremists and terrorists. They were also called Â«animalsÂ».
By the way Ukrainian government officials also have the same Â«nicknamesÂ» for the people in Ukraine who live in the East and speak Russian.
Unless we insist on the creation of the Palestinian state on the basis of the United Nations decisions, this anger which has been present in Palestinian lives for decades and generation after generation, would reproduce more generations who would feel that they have been abandoned and they have been cheated upon, that the United Nations, everybody, unanimously. It's not a prediction. I am convinced that unless this injustice is corrected and the Palestinian state is created, the more violence would pop up every now and then in Palestine or in other parts of the Arab and Muslim world because the Arab and Muslim Â«streetÂ» is much more radical than the Arab and Muslim governments.
Question: And how worried are you that this conflict will expand? I mean, we now see the Red Sea and the Houthis, we see it all.
Sergey Lavrov: Ask the Americans. It's them who are expanding the conflict to the Red Sea, who started aggression against Yemen. We strongly call upon Israelis to stop attacking Syria, including airports of Damascus and Aleppo, which interrupts the delivery of humanitarian assistance, by the way, we call on them to stop political killings.
In Damascus, several officers of the Iranian Corps of Islamic revolution were hit by a missile, apparently Israeli. We certainly have to raise our voice not to allow pushing out Palestinians from their land and of course not to allow this land to turn into unlivable space. Like many environmental scientists are warning over it.
Question: Will you be meeting with the Iranian foreign minister when he's here?
Sergey Lavrov: Yes. We met with him not long ago.
Question: But he'll be here at the UN?
Sergey Lavrov: I will meet with him. So you believe it depends entirely on him or Iran?
Question: There appear to be a lot of Iranian attacks and support around the world.
Sergey Lavrov: I noticed also some Israeli attacks.
Question: Yes. So what would be your advice to the US president to resolve the crisis in the Middle East?
Sergey Lavrov: Stop the fighting. Don't use veto when a resolution is proposed to declare humanitarian ceasefire. You used vetoes twice. There is no reaction from the Security Council as regards to demand a ceasefire. And of course, don't drag on like your predecessors did for decades on creating the Palestinian state. Join others as an honest participant. Don't try to monopolize the process thinking only about how you can guarantee your own interests and not the interests of the Palestinian people."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Health Ministry in Gaza has said that the death toll from the Israeli regime's genocidal war against the Palestinians in the besieged territory has surpassed 25,000.
The ministry, run by the Hamas resistance movement, said on Sunday that at least 25,105 people have been killed and 62, 681 others wounded in Gaza since October 7.
Most of the casualties have been women and children, it added.
The ministry said that 178 Palestinians had lost their lives over the past 24 hours as Israeli forces pushed their offensive in southern Gaza and renewed bombardment in the north.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has reported that a staggering 1.9 million people, or over 80% of the population in Gaza, have been displaced across the enclave.
The Israeli regime waged its genocidal war against Gaza on October 7, after Hamas launched a surprise multi-pronged attack against the occupied territories, taking some 240 people including Israeli soldiers and settlers captive.

Minister Sikorski hoped for swift agreement on a further support package for Ukraine under the European Peace Facility and stressed the necessity to increase the production capacity of the European military industry.
Another point on the agenda were the expectations about the Commission's European Defence Industrial Strategy as a tool to increase the efficacy and the importance of Europe's arms industries in strengthening the EU's security. The talks also covered the initiative to create a separate fund for European defence. The head of the Polish MFA emphasised the need to strengthen the European defence industrial base, also in the context of ensuring the continuity of support for Ukraine.
Moreover, the officials discussed the defence initiatives that the European Commission has adopted so far, including the ammunition initiative to guarantee increased deliveries of artillery ammunition to Ukraine."

A UN expert has warned that Israel is ""intentionally"" starving Gazans and ""destroying"" its food system as the genocidal war continues incessantly for more than 100 days now.
Michael Fakhri, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food said in a post on social media on Monday that starving an entire population, what Israel is doing in Gaza amid the onslaught, is ""unprecedented.""
""It's unprecedented to make an entire civilian population go hungry this completely and quickly. Israel is destroying Gaza's food system. Israel is intentionally imposing a high rate of disease, prolonged malnutrition, dehydration and starvation by destroying civilian infrastructure,"" he wrote.
In a report last week the United Nations revealed that Gazans now make up 80 percent of all people facing famine or catastrophic hunger worldwide, what UN human rights experts called an ""unparalleled humanitarian crisis.""
""Currently every single person in Gaza is hungry, a quarter of the population are starving and struggling to find food and drinkable water, and famine is imminent,"" it said.
The report also voiced concerns over pregnant women who are not receiving adequate nutrition and healthcare, putting their lives at risk.
In addition, it said, all children under five - 335,000 - are at high risk of severe malnutrition as the risk of famine conditions continues to increase.
""A whole generation is now in danger of suffering from stunting,"" it warned.
It added that approximately 22 percent of agricultural land, including orchards, greenhouses, and farmland in northern Gaza, has been razed by Israeli forces.
Israel has reportedly destroyed approximately 70 percent of Gaza's fishing fleet, according to the report.
""Most bakeries are not operational, due to the lack of fuel, water, and wheat flour along with structural damage. Livestock are starving and unable to provide food or be a source of food. Meanwhile, access to safe water continues to diminish while the healthcare system has collapsed due to the wide-spread destruction of hospitals, significantly heightening the spread of communicable diseases.""
Before the current Israeli war, the UN said the 17-year Israeli all-out blockade on Gaza made approximately half of the people in Gaza food insecure and more than 80 percent reliant on humanitarian aid.
""Aid needs to be delivered to Gazans immediately and without any hindrance to prevent starvation,"" the UN report said.
The Zionist regime imposed a ""complete siege"" on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to 2.3 million Palestinians living there after the war erupted on October 7.
As Israeli attacks and battles rage across the Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials said the death toll from Israeli strikes since war broke out has passed 25,290."

Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says Israel's recent attacks on Syria and Lebanon are meant to divert the attention of the international community from the regime's ""disgraceful defeat"" in the Gaza war.
In a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in New York on Monday, Amir-Abdollahian denounced the illegal Israeli airstrikes, which have increased over the past few months, as a ""vicious attempt"" by the occupying entity to spread regional insecurity.
The top Iranian diplomat highlighted the resilience of the oppressed people of Gaza for more than 100 days and Israel's failure to achieve its declared objectives during the genocidal onslaught on the besieged Palestinian territory.
""The Zionist regime's recent acts of aggression against Syria and Lebanon are an attempt to divert the attention of the international community from the regime's disgraceful defeat as well as its frustration and helplessness in the battlefield. They are also a vicious attempt to spread instability and insecurity in the region,"" he added.
Amir-Abdollahian has travelled to New York to attend a UN Security Council (UNSC) meeting on ""the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question"".
Israel waged its brutal war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian Hamas resistance group carried out a historic operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.
However, 109 days into the genocidal offensive, Tel Aviv has failed to ""destroy Hamas"" and find Israeli captives in Gaza despite killing at least 25,295 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring 63,000 others.
The regime has also ramped up its airstrikes on Syria and Lebanon in the course of the war.
Referring to Russia's permanent membership in the UNSC, the Iranian foreign minister urged the country to play a more active role to bring an end to the Gaza war.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the level of Iran-Russia relations, expressing hope that the two countries will sign a long-term cooperation agreement during Russian President Vladimir Putin's future visit to Tehran.
Lavrov, for his part, voiced his contentment with bilateral relations and stressed the implementation of the deals inked so far.
He further blasted the US for blocking a UNSC resolution on the Gaza ceasefire and urged Arab countries to unite on the issue of Palestine.
In a social media post on Tuesday, Amir Abdollahian said, ""The martyrdom of more than 25,000 Palestinians, the wounding of tens of thousands and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as the expansion of regional instability, are the result of the genocide by the Israeli regime and its supporters."""

1. Key points
The Gaza Strip
As of 20 January 2024, the total number of UNRWA colleagues killed since the beginning of hostilities  is 151.
According to OCHA, telecommunication services in Gaza have been down   for the past seven days.  Signifcant disruption of telecommunication services prevents people in   Gaza from accessing lifesaving information or calling for frst   responders, and continues to impede humanitarian response.
As of 20 January, up to 1.7 million* people (over 75 per cent of the population)** have been displaced  across the Gaza Strip, some multiple times.*** Families are forced to move repeatedly in search of  safety. Following intense Israeli bombardments and fghting in Khan Younis and the Middle Areas in  recent days, a signifcant number of displaced people have moved again further south.
*This includes 1 million individuals residing in or near emergency shelters or informal shelters. As of October  12, approximately 160,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) were recorded in north Gaza and Gaza  governorates. The ability of UNRWA to provide humanitarian support and updated data in these areas has  been severely restricted. The ongoing hostilities, evacuation orders issued by Israeli Forces, and the constant  need for safer locations have resulted in people being displaced multiple times.
**UNRWA has reported in Situation Report 64 that up to 1.9 million IDPs are either residing in 154 UNRWA  shelters or near these shelters. Due to the continued escalation of fghting and evacuation orders, some  households have moved away from the shelters where they were initially registered.
*** There are instances where the same IDPs are registered in multiple shelters due to the fuid movement of  populations; hereafter, estimates are used for these shelters. UNRWA plans to conduct a more accurate count  of IDPs in shelters, including informal shelters, as soon as the security situation allows."

Tehran, IRNA -- Head of the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) Pirhossein Kolivand has urged the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to commit to its duties to help Gaza.
Speaking in a meeting on Monday with Manuel Bessler, âthe Vice President of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red âCrescent Societies (IFRC), Kolivand criticized the failure to send enough humanitarian shipments to Gaza after 100 days of war in the enclave.
He also urged the Red Cross to file a complaint against the Zionist regime in the International Criminal Court for preventing humanitarian aid.
The official said that the International Humanitarian Conference to Support Palestine (Gaza) which was held in Tehran on Sunday was a successful initiative.
The IRCS, as a member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, is eager to establish bilateral cooperation, he said.
Kolivand regretted the fact that the conflict in Gaza has dragged on, saying that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies should do its best to send Iran's humanitarian shipments to Gaza considering the principle of impartiality.
Meanwhile, Bessler said that the International Humanitarian Conference to Support Palestine (Gaza) was very fruitful, adding that the ICRC will seek to maintain cooperation with IRCS to help ease humanitarian burden on Gaza.

Echoing those concerns, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned in a tweet on X that in addition to the threat of being killed, Gazans faced a growing risk of disease, just as health services were collapsing.
Only 16 out of 36 hospitals ""are even partly functional"", Mr. Guterres said.
In another post on social media, UN emergency relief chief Martin Griffiths said on Tuesday that there had been ""no let-up in the atrocities"" inflicted in Gaza since 7 October when Israeli bombardment began in response to Hamas-led attacks in Israel that left some 1,200 dead and approximately 250 taken hostage.
More than 25,000 people have been reportedly killed ""including two mothers every hour"", Mr. Griffiths said, citing data from the Gaza health authority, while hospitals continue to be ""overcrowded, besieged and under fire, homes have been reduced to rubble...places of safety have become places of danger"".
Survival instinct
Reporting continuing ""massive displacement"" southwards from the Khan Younis area in response to intensified fighting since the start of the week, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said the new arrivals had now set up large plastic tents along the border fence separating Rafah in southern Gaza from Egypt.
In its latest situation update, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, said that escalating hostilities in the Khan Younis area on Monday had left dozens dead.
""The situation in general is deteriorating dramatically,"" said UNRWA spokesperson Adnan Abu Hasna. He noted that Rafah city was now home to 1.3 million people and ""absolutely unable to cope"" with such an influx, witnessed in person in Rafah on Tuesday by top officials Sigrid Kaag, the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, and Jamie McGoldrick, interim Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
Meningitis threat
Diseases such as meningitis and hepatitis C are spreading along with a doubling of the number of people with intestinal and skin diseases that threatens to push health services to breaking point, UNRWA's Mr. Hasna warned, adding that far more humanitarian relief needed to enter the Strip, where ""everyone is at risk...whether in Khan Younis or in Rafah"".
""There is absolutely no safe place, but we think that pushing more Palestinian residents to Rafah city is pushing things towards explosion.""
Education at a standstill
In a tweet on X on Wednesday - the International Day of Education - the UN agency reported that all of its schools in Gaza remain closed, and most are home to more than 1.2 million displaced Palestinians.
At least 340 internally displaced people have now been killed while seeking safety in UNRWA shelters and more than 1,100 injured, it said.
Three in four school buildings across the Strip have also sustained damage along with numerous institutions of higher education, UNWRA continued, noting that attacks on educational facilities and UN premises ""violate international humanitarian law"".
Since the start of the war, more than 625,000 students and 22,564 teachers in the enclave ""have been deprived of education and a safe place for over three months"", UNRWA stated.
As rocket fire continues to be reported from Gaza into Israel, the UN agency noted that ""thousands of learners and education personnel"" were among those killed.
In the West Bank, ""escalating violence"" has also disrupted access to lessons, UNRWA said, before repeating its call for an end to the conflict."
KARVJU2CHV_U1WBC0GU98J8LSI,Four Protesters In Russia's Bashkortostan Sent To Detention Over Rallies Supporting Activist,_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/01/russia-240122-rferl02.htm,"By Current Time, RFE/RL's Idel.Realities January 22, 2024
A court in Russia's Bashkortostan region has sent four activists to pretrial detention for at least two months over their participation in rallies last week to support the former leader of the banned Bashqort movement, Fail Alsynov, who was sentenced to four years in prison on a charge of inciting hatred, which he and his supporter have called politically motivated.
The Soviet district court in Bashkortostan's capital, Ufa, ruled on January 22 that Azat Mirzin, Dayan Valeyev, Rayat Davletbayev, and Vilyur Karachurin must stay in pretrial detention until at least March 17.
The four activists were charged with taking part in mass disorders. Three of them also were charged with attacking law enforcement officers.
The court also sentenced a fifth activist, Yuldash Timerbayev, to nine days in jail on a charge of organizing an unsanctioned public event for his online call for activists to rally in Ufa to protest Alsynov's imprisonment.
Last week, courts in Bashkortostan sentenced at least 17 activists to up to 15 days in jail for their participation in the rallies.
On January 21, another participant in the rallies, Dim Davletkildin, was charged with taking part in mass disorder.
The situation around Alsynov's trial got tense on January 15, when some 5,000 people gathered in front of a court building in the town of Baimak, where the verdict and sentence were expected to be announced. But the court postponed the announcement by two days to allow security forces to prepare for any reaction to the outcome of the controversial trial.
On January 17, thousands of supporters gathered again, and after Alsynov was sentenced to four years in prison, clashes broke out as police, using batons, tear gas, and stun grenades, forced the protesters to leave.
Local officials said later that 40 people, including 22 police, were injured in the violence.
Dozens of protesters were detained, and the Investigative Committee said those taken into custody in the January 17 unrest would face criminal charges for organizing and participating in mass unrest and using violence against police.
The charge against Alsynov stemmed from a speech he gave at a rally in April 2023 in the village of Ishmurzino in which he criticized the local government's plans to start mining gold near the village, saying the operation would bring in migrant laborers.
Investigators said Alsynov's speech ""negatively assessed people in the Caucasus and Central Asia, humiliating their human dignity."" Alsynov and his supporters have rejected the charge as politically motivated.
Despite the violent dispersal of the protesters on January 19 and the detention of scores of activists, hundreds of people gathered on January 20 on the central square in Ufa singing songs in the Bashkir language and dancing in circles as they tried to ward off police officers who monitored the event by saying they were just out walking on Ufa's Salavat Yulayev square. However, that gathering also ended with the detention of about a dozen activists.
On January 22, Fail Alsynov's brother, Idel Alsynov, said a bank account that had been opened to raise money to support Fail Alsynov's family was blocked.
Fail Alsynov has four children, including one infant.

A military strike killed at least 20 al-Shabab militants in central Somalia, regional and military officials said Thursday.
""Somali military forces, supported by international partners, conducted the airstrike in the town of Galhareri, targeting sites the militants used to manufacture improvised firearms, bombs and other explosives,"" Galmudug Regional Security Minister Mohamed Aden Gaboobe told VOA Somali. Galhareri is some 450 kilometers (280 miles) north of Mogadishu.
Gaboobe said the airstrike conducted late Wednesday also targeted Radio Andalus, al-Shabab's mouthpiece in Somalia.
A separate statement from the Somali National Army said more than 25 militants were killed in the strike, which destroyed a house where leaders of the group were meeting and a garage that was used to prepare car bombs.
Neither the military statement nor regional officials provided details on the international partners whose drones were involved the strike, but the U.S. Africa Command has often conducted such strikes in Somalia at the request of Somalia's federal government.
Last week, a U.S. airstrike killed three al-Shabab extremists in a remote area of Somalia, approximately 35 kilometers (22 miles) northeast of Kismayo.
""At the request of the Federal Government of Somalia, U.S. Africa Command conducted a collective self-defense airstrike with two engagements against the al-Shabab terrorist group on Jan. 21,"" said a statement from U.S. Africa Command Thursday. ""The initial assessment is that the U.S. airstrike killed three al-Shabab terrorists and that no civilians were injured or killed.""
In the past, Somali security officials said the United States is not the only country providing air support to government forces.
Security officials who requested that they not be identified because of the sensitivity of the operation told VOA Somali that Turkish drones were also providing air support to Somali forces.
Somali government forces supported by local clan fighters have been conducting operations in the Hirshabelle and Galmudug states since August 2022, freeing dozens of localities from al-Shabab.
Attending the inauguration ceremony for a Somali regional president Thursday, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud repeated his government's promise of a second phase of the offensive that will go after al-Shabab in southern Somalia, the group's traditional heartland, but he did not say when that would begin."

The trial in absentia of six former Belarusian law enforcement officers who left the country after taking the side of protesters in 2020 challenging the official results of a presidential election that named authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka the winner began behind closed doors on January 22.
Alyaksandr Azarau, Matsvey Kupreychyk, Ihar Loban, Andrey Astapovich, Uladzimer Zhyhar, and Aleh Talerchyk are being tried in the Minsk City Court on charges of inciting social hatred, plotting to forcibly seize power, and the creation of an extremist group.
Although the Belarusian authorities had said the trial would be open to the public, the court said some parts of it will be held behind closed doors, citing ""classified data.""
The charges stem from the defendants' role in the creation abroad of ByPol, a group uniting former law enforcement officers who support opposition politicians.
In August 2022, ByPol was designated a terrorist organization by Belarus's Supreme Court.
A year later, ByPol split into two groups -- ByPol and BelPol -- following disagreements within the organization and with the Belarusian opposition in exile led by Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya.
If convicted, the six former law enforcement officers may be sentenced in absentia to dozens of years in prison.
Thousands have been detained during countrywide protests over the election results and there have been credible reports of torture and ill-treatment by security forces. Several people died during the crackdown.
Lukashenka, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, has refused to negotiate with the opposition and many of its leaders have been arrested or forced to leave the country.
Also on January 22, the Vyasna human rights center said that the Brest regional court in the country's west sentenced local resident Alyaksandr Boyka to 2 1/2 years in prison for taking a video of unspecified military equipment and posting it on an unspecified online chat room.
Judge Dzmitry Karasinski sentenced Boyka after finding him guilty of taking part in an extremist group's activities.
Lukashenka has supported Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022 by allowing Russian troops to use Belarusian territory. Moscow also sent tactical nuclear weapons to be stationed in Belarus.

GAZA, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian death toll from the ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 25,900 since Oct. 7, 2023, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said on Thursday.
The Israeli army killed 200 Palestinians and wounded 370 others over the past 24 hours, the ministry said in a press statement.
It added that the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has wounded at least 64,110 Palestinians, noting that a large number of victims were still under the rubble as ambulance and civil defense crews could not reach them.
The Israeli army on Thursday ordered residents of the southern Khan Younis city to evacuate their homes in preparation for coming bombings.
Avichai Adraei, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said on social media platform X that ""to the residents of Khan Younis in the neighborhoods of Al-Nasr, Al-Amal, the city center and the camp, in blocks of 107-108-109-110-111-112, for your safety, you must move immediately to the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.""
Local sources said that more than 60,000 residents were under the threat of evacuation from Khan Younis, and many of them had already started evacuating to escape the expected Israeli operations in the area.
The city of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, has witnessed during the past two days an intensification of Israeli attacks, considered the fiercest since the fighting began on Oct. 7, 2023, according to eyewitnesses."

Kenya says it wants to promote peace in East Africa and has no problems with neighboring countries. At the same time, there are undeniable signs of diplomatic strains with at least four neighbors, including two that recently recalled their ambassadors from Nairobi.
Kenya's effort to assert itself as a regional political force and economic hub in eastern Africa is not going over well with some of its neighbors.
The Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan recalled their ambassadors after their governments accused Kenya of hosting and dealing with their countries' opposition groups in Nairobi.
Uganda, meanwhile, recently took Kenya to an East African court in Tanzania over an oil distribution dispute. The case is about Kenya not allowing Ugandan government oil marketers to operate within its borders. This comes after Uganda discontinued the previous open tender system for purchasing petroleum products from Kenya.
Also, Tanzania banned Kenya Airways flights from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam last week because Kenya allegedly denied permission for Tanzania's national carrier to operate cargo flights to Nairobi. The ban was lifted after discussions between the foreign affairs ministers of the two countries.
Kenyan Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Sunday that his country is ""not at war"" with its neighbors and wants to bring peace to the region.
""Some states are vulnerable, others are in conflict, and our president, William Samoei Ruto, is on the front line, making sure peace returns in these countries,"" said Mudavadi. ""He says the wars in those countries will affect our country too.""
Kenya has come under criticism from some Africans and its own citizens on how the government is handling engagement with other states.
International relations expert Kizito Sabala says the diplomatic spats are growing out of countries trying to counter Kenya's influence.
""There is always going to be a tug-of-war with what Kenya tries to do from the neighbors,"" Sabala said. ""But from my point of view, I don't think there is really something very serious to worry about. These are things that will continue to come as Kenya tries to assert itself as a regional power. And the other countries will try to find any leverage to use it in order to bring that down.""
Kenyan President Ruto, who came to power more than a year ago, has met several heads of state in Africa, including his neighbors, promising to help solve Africa's chronic problems of conflict and hunger, and to bring economic development.
Sabala says such assertiveness from a new leader will get pushback.
""They are reacting the way they are reacting because I think in Nairobi we have a new president who is very assertive and who seems to be projecting this to the region and therefore I think that in itself seems to be telling them, 'no, no, no, no, let's stop here,'"" Sabala said. ""But I think with the time they'll just get used to the way our president is doing things and that's fine. I don't think it's a big, big issue to worry about.""
Experts urge Kenya to handle the conflict in the Congo cautiously, especially regarding rebel groups that have contributed to the country's instability. They also want Kenya to refrain from taking sides in the Sudan conflict, which has pitted the country's armed forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against each other."
KNOWK48CWI_910B28M4MS7ING6,U.S. And Iran-Backed Huthis Engaged In High-Stakes Fight Tehran Wants To Avoid,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2024/iran-240125-rferl01.htm,"By Michael Scollon January 25, 2024
It is not only missiles that are being lobbed as U.S. and U.K. air strikes aim to stop the Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen from targeting ships in a key global trade route -- mutual threats of continued attacks are flying around, too.
The question is how far each side might go in carrying out their warnings without drawing Tehran into a broader Middle East conflict in defense of the Huthis, whose sustained attacks on maritime shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden led to its redesignation as a terrorist organization by Washington last week.
""Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea,"" the United States and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement following their latest round of air strikes on Huthi targets in Yemen on January 21. ""But let us reiterate our warning to [the] Huthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.""
The Huthis responded with vows to continue their war against what they called Israel's ""genocide"" of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.
""The American-British aggression will only increase the Yemeni people's determination to carry out their moral and humanitarian responsibilities toward the oppressed in Gaza,"" said Muhammad al-Bukhaiti, a senior Huthi political official.
""These attacks will not go unanswered and unpunished,"" said Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree.
On cue, the two sides clashed again on January 24 when the Huthis said they fired ballistic missiles at several U.S. warships protecting U.S. commercial vessels transiting the Bab al-Mandab Strait off the coast of Yemen. U.S. Central Command said three anti-ship missiles were fired at a U.S.-flagged container ship and that two were shot down by a U.S. missile destroyer while the third fell into the Gulf of Aden.
With the stage set for more such encounters, Iran's open backing and clandestine arming of the Huthis looms large. While continuing to state its support for the Huthis, Tehran has continued to deny directing their actions or providing them with weapons. At the same time, Iran has showcased its own advanced missile capabilities as a warning of the strength it could bring to a broader Middle East conflict.
The United States, emphasizing that the goal is to de-escalate tensions in the region, appears to be focusing on preventing the Huthis from obtaining more arms and funding. In addition to returning the Huthis to its list of terrorist groups, Washington said on January 16 that it had seized Iranian weapons bound for the Huthis in a raid in the Arabian Sea.
The United States and United Kingdom also appear to be focusing on precision strikes on the Huthis' military infrastructure while avoiding extensive human casualties or a larger operation that could heighten Iran's ire.
On January 24, the Pentagon clarified that, despite the U.S. strikes in Yemen, ""we are not at war in the Middle East"" and the focus is on deterrence and preventing a broader conflict.
""The United States is only using a very small portion of what it's capable of against the Huthis right now,"" said Kenneth Katzman, a senior adviser for the New York-based Soufan Group intelligence consultancy, and expert on geopolitics in the Middle East.
Terrorist Designation
The effectiveness of Washington's restoration on January 17 of the Huthis' terrorist organization label and accompanying U.S. sanctions -- which was removed early last year in recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen and to foster dialogue aimed at ending the Yemeni civil war involving the Huthis and the country's Saudi-backed government forces -- is ""marginal,"" according to Katzman.
""They don't really use the international banking system and are very much cut off,"" Katzman said. ""They get their arms from Iran, which is under extremely heavy sanctions and is certainly not going to be deterred from trying to ship them more weapons by this designation.""
But the strikes being carried out by the United States and the United Kingdom, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, are another matter.
The January 21 strikes against eight Huthi targets -- followed shortly afterward by what was the ninth attack overall -- were intended to disrupt and degrade the group's capabilities to threaten global trade. They were a response to more than 30 attacks on international and commercial vessels since mid-November and were the largest strikes since a similar coalition operation on January 11.
Such strikes against the Huthis ""have the potential to deter them and to degrade them, but it's going to take many more strikes, and I think the U.S. is preparing for that,"" Katzman said. ""You're not going to degrade their capabilities in one or two volleys or even several volleys, it's going to take months.""
The Huthis have significant experience in riding out aerial strikes, having been under relentless bombardment by a Saudi-led military collation during the nine-year Yemeni civil war, in which fighting has ended owing to a UN-brokered cease-fire in early 2022 that the warring parties recommitted to in December.
""They weathered that pretty well,"" said Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East defense analyst with the global intelligence company Janes.
""On the battlefield, airpower can still be fairly decisive,"" Binnie said, noting that air strikes were critical in thwarting Huthi offensives during the Yemeni civil war. ""But in terms of the Huthis' overall ability to weather the air campaign of the Saudi-led coalition, they did that fine, from their point of view.""
Since the cease-fire, Binnie said, the situation may have changed somewhat as the Huthis built up their forces, with more advanced missiles and aging tanks -- a heavier presence that ""might make them a bit more vulnerable.""
""But I don't think they will, at the same time, have any problem reverting to a lighter force that is more resilient to air strikes as they have been in the past,"" Binnie said.
Both Binnie and Katzman suggested that the Huthis appear willing to sustain battlefield losses in pursuit of their aims, which makes the group difficult to deter from the air.
The Huthis have clearly displayed their intent on continuing to disrupt maritime shipping in the Red Sea, which they claim has targeted only vessels linked to Israel despite evidence to the contrary, until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.
This has brought the Huthis' complicated relationship with Iran under intense scrutiny.
'Axis Of Resistance'
The Huthis have established themselves as a potent element of Iran's so-called ""axis of resistance"" against Israel and the United States, as well as against Tehran's regional archrival, Saudi Arabia.
But analysts who spoke to RFE/RL widely dismissed the idea that the Huthis are a direct Iranian proxy, describing the relationship as more one of mutual benefit in which the Huthis can be belligerent and go beyond what Tehran wants them to.
While accused by Western states and UN experts of secretly shipping arms to the Huthis and other members of the axis of resistance, Iran has portrayed the loose-knit band of proxies and partners and militant groups as independent in their decision-making.
The grouping includes the Iran-backed Hamas -- the U.S. and EU designated terrorist group whose attack on Israel sparked the war in the Gaza Strip -- and Lebanese Hizballah -- a Iranian proxy and U.S. designated terrorist group that, like the Huthis, has launched strikes against Israel in defense of Hamas.
""The success of the axis of resistance ... is that since Tehran has either created or co-opted these groups, there is more often than not fusion rather than tension,"" between members of the network and Iran, explained Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.
But the relationship is not simply about ""Iran telling its proxies to jump and them saying how high,"" Taleblu said. ""It's about Iran's ability to find and materially support those who are willing to or can be persuaded to shoot at those Tehran wants to shoot at.""
Iran's interest in a certain axis member's success in a given area and its perception of how endangered that partner might be, could play a crucial role in Tehran's willingness to come to their defense, according to Taleblu.
Middle East observers who spoke to RFE/RL suggested that it would take a significant escalation -- an existential threat to Tehran itself or a proxy, like Lebanese Hizballah -- for Iran to become directly involved.
""The Islamic republic would react differently to the near eradication of Hizballah which it created, versus Hamas, which it co-opted,"" Taleblu said. ""Context is key.""
""Iran is doing what it feels it can to try to keep the United States at bay,"" Katzman said, singling out the missile strikes carried out on targets this month in Syria, Iraq, and Pakistan that were widely seen as a warning to Israel and the United States of Tehran's growing military capabilities. Iran is ""trying to show support for the Huthis without getting dragged in.""
Iran is believed to have members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on the ground in Yemen. Tehran also continues to be accused of delivering arms to the Huthis, and at the start of the year deployed a ship to the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for the Huthis before withdrawing it after the U.S.-led coalition launched strikes in Yemen on January 11.
""So, they are helping,"" Katzman said, ""but I think they are trying to do it as quietly and as under the radar as possible.
A U.S.-led ground operation against the Huthis, if it came to that, could change Iran's calculations. ""Then Iran might deploy forces to help them out,"" Katzman said.

01/23/2024 10:01 PM
Washington, Jan. 22 (CNA) More than half of surveyed U.S. and Taiwan experts said they believed a cross-Taiwan Strait crisis was likely to occur in 2024, although there were mixed views on how exactly it would play out, a report released Monday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.
In the report, which involved surveying 52 U.S. and 35 Taiwanese cross-strait experts ahead of Taiwan's presidential election on Jan. 13, the American think tank said that about 67 percent of the U.S. experts and 57 percent of the Taiwan experts believed ""a Taiwan Strait crisis is likely in 2024.""
Such a crisis was defined as ""a situation similar to the 1995/1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis where there is a significant increase in cross-strait tension that is accompanied by at least a major PLA exercise aimed at coercing Taiwan and renewed Chinese threats to use force against the island"" in the report, titled ""Surveying the Experts: U.S. and Taiwan Views on China's Approach to Taiwan.""
The report said that the experts' pessimism is likely driven by a combination of factors, including assessments of potential negative People's Republic of China (PRC) responses to Taiwan's presidential elections, and the overall state of U.S.-China relations.
""Despite notable efforts by Washington and Beijing to stabilize relations, the bilateral relationship remains fundamentally focused on competition,"" the report said.
Citing the November 2023 summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping (ç¿è¿å¹³), the report said the meeting did not change that situation.
It pointed out that about 75 percent of U.S. experts and 66 percent of Taiwan experts in the survey said that the Biden-Xi meeting did not stabilize relations or significantly reduce the potential of a Taiwan Strait crisis.
When asked how Beijing would respond if Taiwan's favored presidential candidate failed to win, ""U.S. and Taiwan experts overwhelmingly assessed that Beijing would seek to improve cross-strait ties.""
""Only about 15 percent of U.S. experts and 17 percent of Taiwan experts believed China would maintain its existing coercive approach or increase coercion against China,"" the report said.
There was no consensus, however, on exactly how Beijing would alter its approach, the report added, citing the survey results that about 46 percent of the experts from Taiwan assessed Beijing would shift its approach unilaterally -- whether offering carrots or reducing coercive measures.
Meanwhile, 46 percent of U.S. experts believed that Beijing would act only after the new Taiwan leader showcased goodwill toward Beijing, the report said.
In addition, nearly half of the Taiwan experts believed that if Beijing saw the election result as unfavorable, its most escalatory move in 2024 would be ""coercive nonmilitary action.""
In contrast, U.S. experts worried about the potential of large-scale military exercises encircling Taiwan, but few thought China would quarantine, blockade, or invade the island.
The report said that most of the experts did not think recent efforts to manage U.S.-China tensions would impact the likelihood of a cross-strait crisis.
Concerning the next five years, the experts believed Beijing's most likely course of action would be a ""law enforcement-led quarantine"" of the island nation, the report said.
A ""quarantine"" refers to a law enforcement operation led by nonmilitary actors that is focused on limiting the flow of commercial goods into Taiwan, according to the report.
A more intense quarantine could involve some People's Liberation Army (PLA) assets and limited kinetic military action, however, experts believed it would not be the primary method, the report said.
Meanwhile, although Chinese leaders found Taiwan's election outcome unfavorable, only 27 percent of U.S. experts believed that China could execute an amphibious invasion given its current capabilities, and just 17 percent of Taiwan experts believed the same, the report showed.
The report explained that an amphibious invasion would require a much larger commitment of military forces than a quarantine or blockade -- a PLA-led operation to heavily restrict the flow of commercial goods and military activity around Taiwan -- and the operations involved would be more complicated, resulting in a lower likelihood of China going down that path.
The report further said that those surveyed likely factored in the likelihood of U.S. intervention in more intense types of cross-strait conflict, such as an invasion.
The report noted that nearly half of the experts from Taiwan believed that quarantine was a flexible option China could employ to pressure Taiwan, while the U.S. experts believed Beijing could execute a quarantine if it wanted to up the pressure on Taiwan without sparking a kinetic conflict.
Meanwhile, according to the report, most respondents believed a blockade alone would not be sufficient in forcing Taiwan to unify with China, but a third of the Taiwan experts worried a blockade could escalate into an invasion.
According to the report, the survey was conducted by the CSIS China Power Project between Nov. 28 and Dec. 15 in 2023, ahead of Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections which were held on Jan. 13, 2024.

KTE9EEGSKM_ZJ65NG8GWKYCD2Y,Sudan war 'a living nightmare for children': UNICEF Representative,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-unnews03.htm,"25 January 2024 - War in Sudan is putting the future of its 24 million youngest citizens at risk, the Representative of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in the country has warned.
""Sudan is experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions. It's a living nightmare for children,"" Mandeep O'Brien said this week in an interview with UN News.
Nearly 10 months have passed since clashes erupted between the Sudanese Army and a rival group known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), leaving14 million children in desperate need of lifesaving assistance.
Child displacement crisis
Ms. O'Brien said the fighting has sparked the world's largest child displacement crisis. More than 3.5 million boys and girls have fled their homes for safer locations, with some uprooted several times.
The bad news continues as more than 7.4 million young Sudanese do not have access to safe drinking water, putting them at risk of waterborne diseases, and nearly two million are in urgent need of lifesaving vaccines.
Sudan also has one of the highest rates of child malnutrition in the world. More than three million under-fives suffer from acute malnutrition, and 700,000 could die from its severest form unless they receive medical treatment.
Classrooms in the crosshairs
Furthermore, 19 million school-age children are not in the classroom, putting Sudan at risk of becoming one of the worst learning crises in the world.
""Imagine the future of this country if children are not being able to learn,"" Ms. O'Brien remarked. ""We estimate that if this continues, Sudan would be facing a $26 billion lifetime earning loss.""
Education is a powerful tool for building peace ""because when children are in classrooms, they feel safe, protected, and they can peacefully co-exist,"" she said.
""These are values that we shouldn't take for granted. These are values that have to be lived and practiced by children.""
Open schools, pay teachers
UNICEF has been pushing for Sudanese federal and state authorities to re-open schools, but Ms. O'Brien pointed to another barrier to education.
""For that to happen, teachers need to be paid,"" she said. ""Sadly, since the onset of this war, teachers and other frontline workers have not been paid their salaries, so this has to happen.""
In the interim, UNICEF and partners have been exploring practical solutions and ways to support the safe re-opening of schools where conditions allow, while also working to reach more young learners.
Expanding the 'learning loop'
""For huge numbers of kids who cannot go to school, who were not registered or enrolled in schools prior to the conflict, we're trying to bring as many kids as possible into the learning loop, into alternative ways of learning,"" she said.
To address their needs, UNICEF and partners have launched child-friendly spaces at gathering points for internally displaced people.
Known as makanna - Arabic for ""our place"" - these are locations where children can feel safe and protected while also continuing their education through e-learning and tried and tested low-cost digital solutions.
More than 850 makannas have been rolled out across Sudan, reaching more than 250,000 children who also receive psychosocial support to address trauma resulting from the war.
Vaccination campaigns
The conflict has also stretched Sudan's health system to its limits. UNICEF along with the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners continue to work with the authorities to provide urgently needed services amid disease outbreaks, in addition to carrying out child immunization campaigns.
Ms. O'Brien said they have vaccinated more than a million children against measles ""which is of great concern and is currently spreading as we speak"".
This week marked the start of a campaign to combat measles and rubella, launched with the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi). The aim is to vaccinate more than five million children in seven states by the end of the week and 15 million over the coming months.
Appeal for peace
Although fearing that Sudan risks becoming a forgotten crisis as conflict rages in Gaza and deepens in Ukraine, Ms. O'Brien underlined UNICEF's commitment to stay and deliver on the ground alongside partners.
Last year, they reached over 6.4 million children and families with urgently needed health supplies and screened more than five million under-fives for malnutrition, treating over 300,000 severe cases.
She appealed for more funding to meet the growing needs of children, women and families.
""Most importantly, we need all international and regional efforts to be joined up so that Sudan can find a political solution to this devastation,"" she said.""This war has to stop now. Sudan desperately needs peace."""

BEIJING (Sputnik) - The Chinese military escorted and monitored the USS John Finn that passed through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday along its entire route, Shi Yi, the spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said.
The US 7th Fleet said Wednesday that the USS John Finn transited through the Taiwan Strait on January 24 to demonstrate ""the United States' commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle.""
""The PLA Eastern Theater Command, in accordance with law and regulations, has organized forces to escort and monitor the US warship along its entire route,"" Shi said in a statement posted on Chinese social media WeChat.
Recently, US forces have ""repeatedly carried out provocative actions and maliciously undermined regional peace and stability,"" the statement said.
The Chinese military maintains high combat readiness to protect the country's sovereignty and security as well as regional stability, the spokesperson added.
Taiwan has been governed independently of mainland China since 1949. Beijing views the island as its province, while Taiwan â a territory with its own elected government â maintains that it is an autonomous country but stops short of declaring independence. Beijing opposes any official contacts of foreign states with Taipei and considers Chinese sovereignty over the island indisputable.

KY8DI3MJOR_YVINBZYPR3R6ST0,Russia Blames Ukraine For Gas Depot Blaze,_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240122-rferl03.htm,"By RFE/RL's Russian Service January 22, 2024
The Kremlin has blamed Ukraine for a blaze at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the Russian Baltic Sea port of Ust-Luga that broke out on January 21.
Asked about the fire, which led to the suspension of some operations at the terminal near Russia's border with Estonia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Ukraine was ""striking civil infrastructure, people.""
The fire at the terminal operated by the Russian energy company Novatak erupted following reports of drone sightings in the area.
The fire was caused by two explosions, state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti cited local officials as saying.
The agency said on January 21 that the fire had been contained to a 100-cubic-meter fuel depot at the terminal, located about 110 kilometers west of St. Petersburg.
Leningrad regional Governor Aleksandr Drozdenko said on Telegram that there were no casualties as a result of the blaze and that the local fire service and the Emergency Situations Ministry were involved in the effort to extinguish it.
The incident comes amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, which has been marked by frequent drone attacks by each side.
Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of targeting energy and other key infrastructure during the winter cold in an effort to break the Ukrainian people's will to fight following Moscow's unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Moscow claimed on January 19 that a Ukrainian drone attack had hit an oil depot in Russia's western Bryansk region. One day earlier, Russian officials claimed that an attempted attack on a Baltic Sea oil terminal was unsuccessful.
The Ukrainian Defense Ministry traditionally does not comment on or claim responsibility for attacks Moscow claims Kyiv has carried out on Russian territory.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III
Good morning, everyone. It's great to see you all again.
As you can tell, I'm joining from home today. I'm feeling good and looking forward to being back at the Pentagon very soon. And I'm grateful for all of your warm wishes.
So thanks for working across the time zones to join us for the 18th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.
We're eager to enter this new year with new energy.
And we're all here to reaffirm our support for a free, secure, and sovereign Ukraine, and to ensure that we continue to get Ukraine the capabilities that it needs, for the winter and beyond.
Ukraine is not alone.
Around the world, Ukraine's friends have stepped up to help Ukraine's brave troops resist Putin's aggression.
We've formed a historic international coalition, rooted in shared interests and common principles.
And the United States remains determined to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom.
I'm especially glad that we're joined today by my friend, Ukrainian Defense Minister Umerov.  Rustem, we're looking forward to hearing your report from the battlefield.
Ukraine's fight is important for all of our countries.
Ukraine's incredibly brave troops are continuing their battle against the Kremlin's invaders across a vast frontline in Ukraine's east and south, in bitter winter weather.
Ukraine's defenders continue to inflict significant losses on the Kremlin's forces.
Putin continues to sacrifice staggering numbers of Russian troops in his rash and reckless war of choice.
And Putin hopes that missiles and drones will demoralize the Ukrainian people, and break the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian military.
So I urge this group to dig deep to provide Ukraine with more lifesaving ground-based air-defense systems and interceptors.
And Ukraine has answered Putin's cruelty with courage and defiance. After almost two years of war, Ukraine's people and troops stand strong against Russian aggression and occupation.
Russia's military has been badly weakened and demoralized.
And Ukraine has taken back more than half of the sovereign territory grabbed by Russia since its unprovoked invasion.
So let's be clear. Our support for Ukraine's struggle against tyranny makes all of our countries more secure.
If we lose our nerve, if we flinch, if we fail to deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite even more bloodshed and chaos.
So a sovereign and secure Ukraine is critical to global security.
And we must not waver in our support for Ukraine.
On December 27th, the United States announced an additional $250 million package to help meet Ukraine's urgent security needs.
The package includes lifesaving air-defense munitions, air-defense system components, ammunition for HIMARS, anti-armor munitions, 155-millimeter and 105-millimeter artillery ammunition, and medical equipment.
The United States continues to work hard to monitor and account for U.S. security assistance delivered to Ukraine.
We have seen no credible evidence of the misuse or illicit diversion of American equipment provided to Ukraine.
What we do see is Ukraine using the capabilities that we've provided to defend itself against Russian aggression.
Now, I want to take a few minutes to commend the allies and partners who have risen to the moment, and announced important new long-term security assistance packages since we last met.
This includes significant announcements by Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Taken together, these commitments will amount to billions of dollars in additional military aid for Ukraine.
We must continue to focus both on Ukraine's immediate battlefield needs, and on helping Ukraine to strengthen, modernize, and sustain its defense forces for the long haul.
That's why the United States hosted the Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference in Washington last month, with the goal of ushering in a new era of cooperation to meet Ukraine's long-term security needs.
We remain committed to strengthening Ukraine's defense industrial base, both to intensify Ukraine's current fight and to boost its long-term deterrence.
And our allies and partners are working proudly beside us.
The members of this Contact Group have shown a profound and principled commitment to Ukraine's enduring security.
I'm especially grateful to our allies and partners for your commitment to leading this Contact Group's ""capability coalitions.""
That includes Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.
Together, our allies and partners have established six capability coalitions to support Ukraine's air force, ground-based air defenses, artillery, maritime security, de-mining, and information technology.
We've made impressive progress since our last meeting.
I'm proud that the United States is co-leading the artillery capability coalition, along with France, and also co-leading the air-force capability coalition, alongside Denmark and the Netherlands.
That's just another reminder of how much we can do when we come together.
The security of the entire international community is on the line in Ukraine's fight.
And I am more determined than ever to work with our allies and partners to support Ukraine, and to get the job done.
Thanks again for joining us.
And now I'll pass it back to Assistant Secretary Wallander, and we'll pause while our friends in the media depart.

UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) - Should the information that Western countries supplied weapons used in the downing of the IL-76 Russian military transport airplane is confirmed, they will be implicated as direct participants in this heinous act, Russian deputy envoy to the UNited Nations Dmitry Polyanskiy said.
""If this becomes confirmed, then these Western countries which supplied this weaponry, will become direct participants in this crime,"" Polyanskiy stressed during a meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday.
All available information about Ukraine downing the Russian IL-76 military transport airplane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war shows an act of premeditated assault, the diplomat emphasized.
""All of the information that we have today shows that we are dealing with a premeditated assault through crime,"" Polyanskiy told the meeting.
The Kiev regime goes against clear facts and does not take responsibility for downing the Il-76 plane, Polyanskiy highlighted.
""Everything that we have seen so far was a very primitive and cowardly attempt by the representatives of the Kiev authorities to go against the obvious facts and and not take responsibility for this and by doing this, they have got carried away in their lies and are now digging a greater and greater hole for themselves,"" the diplomat said.
Russia is also disappointed that representatives of international organizations pursue ""double standards"" and refuse to comment on the downing of the Il-76 airplane, he added.
Russia will do everything to ensure that all those responsible for the Il-76 crash are held accountable, the Polyanskiy stated.

The invading Israeli forces are still facing ""fierce resistance"" in Gaza, while more than three months of brutal aggression on the besieged Strip has caused a deep split in prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet, according to a British daily.
Netanyahu's cabinet is becoming increasingly isolated both domestically and internationally, said the report run by The Times on Sunday.
""Israeli forces are still facing fierce resistance in northern Gaza despite having claimed to be able to wind down operations in the area,"" it added.
The report said that the ability of Hamas to ""continue to put troops on the ground in Gaza City, the territory's capital,"" has raised questions about Israel's ""strategy for the war.""
It also highlighted that Joe Biden's administration is ""downgrading its expectations of the war's outcome.""
This comes after US intelligence sources said they believe the Israeli military may have killed about 5,000 to 6,000 Hamas fighters, according to reports in American media; however, the Israeli military claims to have killed 9,000 fighters.
""[That] is a disparity which also appears to reflect the deepening divide between Netanyahu's [cabinet], and the Biden administration,"" it said.
The report also stated that Israeli and the US claims that hundreds of fighters of the Hamas resistance movement were killed in the ongoing aggression ""has shown no signs of crippling its activities.""
The fighting in northern Gaza ""followed a series of incidents in which Hamas attempted to show it had a broad presence there"", the daily said, noting that that the resistance fighters continued to ""fire missiles into Israel from central Gaza, despite Israeli tanks on the ground.""
The Times said the prolonged fighting has also contributed to divisions in Netanyahu's war cabinet, as Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff and now a member of the opposition National Unity party, stressed that Netanyahu's war goal of the elimination of Hamas was unachievable.
""Whoever speaks of the absolute defeat and of it no longer having the will or the capability, is not speaking the truth,"" he said in an interview last week with Israeli television, adding ""That is why we should not tell tall tales.""
Eisenkot directly said the leadership is not telling the truth, the report said.
According to the report while Eisenkot and Benny Gantz, another former chief of staff, called for fresh elections in Israel within months, Netanyahu, however, insisted that there's not going to be elections while the occupying regime is at war.
The pressure mounted on Netanyahu from the opponents comes as the number of Israeli military personnel is reportedly approaching the 200 mark.
Netanyahu also faces pressure to secure the release of the remaining captives held in Gaza, but he still continues to reject Hamas offers to end the war and release captives.
In late November, a short-lived 7-day truce saw more than 100 Israeli captives freed in exchange for Palestinians held illegally in Israeli jails. Israel says more than 132 captives remain in Gaza.
The report says Netanyahu is caught between his right-wing allies, who are urging a full-scale occupation of Gaza; the Biden administration, which wants him to begin talks for a so-called two-state solution; and the opposition, along with much of Isarel, who want him to quit.
Israel launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.
Since the start of the offensive, the Tel Aviv regime has killed at least 25,105 Palestinians and injured more than 62,681 others.
Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under the rubble in Gaza, which is under ""complete siege"" by Israel."

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has launched its largest military exercise since the Cold War, with a US warship leaving the United States for transit across the Atlantic to alliance territory in Europe.
NATO has said some 90,000 troops from the United States and other allied nations are due to join the Steadfast Defender 2024 drills that started on Wednesday and will run through May and span from North America to NATO's eastern flank, close to the Russian border.
""Steadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order,"" said General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe.
Cavoli stated that during the military exercise, the alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via trans-Atlantic movement of forces from North America, focusing on the threat as a ""near-peer"" adversary.
The exercise is designed to simulate the 31-nation alliance's response to an attack from a rival like Russia. While NATO did not directly name Russia as the target behind the drills, its top strategic document identifies Russia as the most significant and direct threat to NATO members' security.
More than 50 ships, including aircraft carriers and destroyers, will take part in the war games, as well as more than 80 fighter jets, helicopters and drones and at least 1,100 combat vehicles, including 133 tanks and 533 infantry fighting vehicles.
""Today launched its biggest military exercise since 1988 with 90,000 personnel taking part in drills across the North Atlantic and Europe,"" Matthias Eichenlaub, a NATO spokesperson, said on X platform formerly Twitter.
During the second part of the Steadfast Defender exercise, a special focus will be on the deployment of NATO's quick reaction force to Poland on the alliance's eastern flank.
Other major locations of the drills will be the Baltic States, Germany, Norway and Romania, which are seen as most at risk from a potential Russian attack.
The exercise, the biggest since the 1988 Reforger drill during the Cold War, comes as NATO reinforce the defense of Europe after Russia's military operation on Ukraine began in 2022.
Russia has reacted to the military drill, calling it an ""irrevocable return"" of the alliance to Cold War schemes, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told the state RIA news agency in remarks published on Sunday.
Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO countries have sharply increased their military budgets. The countries have also been delivering billions of dollars worth of arms to Ukraine and have pledged to help Kiev militarily in its war against Moscow."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is caught up in infighting over a new bill to transfer Russian assets to Ukraine, Politico reported, citing two unnamed sources.
The committee has scheduled a mark-up session for Wednesday. Chairman Ben Cardin reportedly plans to suggest an amendment that could water down the bill, which was proposed by the top Republican Senator Jim Risch to transfer seized funds from Russia's Central Bank and other institutions to Ukraine for reconstruction needs.
Cardin's amendment seeks to permit asset transfer only upon the agreement of all G7 member nations, the report said on Monday. That would add extra complexity to an already dicey legal and logistical issue, the report said, citing two people familiar with the closed-door discussion.
Moscow has maintained that any attempt to confiscate its frozen assets would violate international law. The Russian Foreign Ministry has dismissed the freezing of Russian assets as theft.

Yemen's Ansarullah officials have ordered US and British nationals working for the United Nations and humanitarian organizations in the capital Sana'a to leave the country within a month.
Yemen's Foreign Ministry gave the order in a letter to Peter Hawkins, the UN's acting humanitarian coordinator in Yemen on Wednesday, after US and UK carried out a new round of military strikes across the country in response to attacks by Yemeni armed forces on Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea.
""The ministry ... would like to stress that you must inform officials and workers with US and British citizenships to prepare to leave the country within 30 days,"" the letter said.
The letter also instructed foreign organizations to not hire American and British citizens for Yemen's operations.
Mohammed Abdulsalam, the Ansarullah spokesman, confirmed the letter's authenticity to Reuters.
In a statement, the US embassy said it was aware of reports about the letter but ""cannot speak on behalf of the UN or humanitarian organizations in Yemen"" as to what they may have received from Ansarullah authorities.
The British embassy also noted that its staff had not yet been told to leave and the mission was in close contact with the UN on the issue.
On Monday, US and British forces launched strikes at eight different locations in Yemen, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, according to a joint statement signed by the six countries.
The strikes came as the Yemeni armed forces have been staging many such strikes against Israeli vessels or those bound for the occupied Palestinian territories' ports over the past month.
The operations have been described as a response to the Israeli regime's war on the besieged Gaza Strip.
So far, eight rounds of strikes over the past month have failed to stop attacks by Yemeni armed forces against shipping linked to the Israeli regime.
The Israeli regime waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's atrocities against Palestinians.
Since the start of the aggression, Israel has killed more than 25,700 Palestinians, mostly women and children.
The Israeli regime has also imposed a ""complete siege"" on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there."

Iran-backed Houthi militants launched new attacks Wednesday on merchant shipping in the Gulf of Aden, just hours after the United States carried out preemptive strikes to stave off what it said was an imminent attack on shipping lanes in the Red Sea.
U.S. Central Command, which overseas U.S. forces in the Middle East, said late Wednesday that a U.S. guided missile destroyer shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles aimed at the M/V Maersk Detroit, a U.S.-owned and operated container ship transiting the Gulf of Aden.
A third missile fell into the sea.
U.S. officials said that while the latest attack did not cause any injuries or damage to the container ship, it shows the Houthis are not ready to back down.
""If they don't stop, we will continue to take necessary action,"" Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told VOA in an interview Wednesday. ""But our goal here is not to see escalation. It's actually the opposite. It's to deescalate the situation and ensure that international shipping and mariners can transit this waterway safely.""
Hours before the latest attack Wednesday, the U.S. launched preemptive strikes in Houthi-controlled Yemen, destroying two anti-ship missiles allegedly set to target international shipping in the Red Sea.
The missiles ""presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region,"" according to a U.S. Central Command statement.
The latest round of U.S. preemptive strikes and Houthi attacks follow Monday's barrage by U.S. and British warplanes, ships and submarines aimed at degrading the ability of the Houthis to maintain their months-long assault on key shipping lanes in the region.
U.S. defense officials said Monday's strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.
""These precision strikes ... are in response to a series of illegal, dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions,"" the U.S. and Britain said in a statement at the time, noting the latest strikes were carried out with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
In a sign of continued tensions, the United Nations confirmed Wednesday that the Houthis, a U.S.-designated terror group, have given it one month to withdraw all U.S. and British staff from Houthi-controlled areas.
""What needs to be said is that any request or requirement for U.N. staff to leave â based solely on the nationality of that staff â is inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the U.N.,"" said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.
""It also, of course, impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to support all of the people of Yemen,"" he added.
The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world's maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.
Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 34 attacks on international shipping lanes, justifying them by saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.
But U.S. officials say many of the Houthi attacks have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel.
The rising tensions involving the U.S., its allies, other countries and the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen come as the U.S. also seeks to deter other Iran-backed groups in the region.
Early Wednesday, U.S. military aircraft hit Iran-backed proxies in western Iraq in response to a series of attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in recent days.
U.S. officials said the airstrikes targeted three facilities used by Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups in al-Qaim, Jurf al Sakhar, and one other location.
""These strikes targeted KH [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] capabilities,"" according to an initial statement from U.S. Central Command.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that early battle damage assessments have indicated the strikes were successful.
He also further described one of the targets as an intelligence facility.
The U.S. strikes in Iraq came after one by Iran-backed militants on Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq with one-way attack drones.
The base was also targeted Saturday by a barrage of ballistic missiles launched from inside Iraq. While most of the missiles were shot down, the Pentagon said those that landed on the base caused traumatic brain injuries in four U.S. personnel.
There have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, injuring at least 83 Americans, a U.S. defense official told VOA. All but two have returned to duty.

The United States has called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing actions and to return to diplomatic engagement following North Korea's firing of several cruise missiles into the waters off its western coast earlier on Wednesday.
""We find [the actions] incredibly dangerous,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA during a briefing on Wednesday, while declining to provide the U.S. assessment of North Korea's intentions.
This latest missile launch occurred just days after Pyongyang tested a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile, equipped with a hypersonic warhead, into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
""We harbor no hostile intent toward the DPRK and continue to be open to diplomacy without preconditions,"" Patel added. He was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is North Korea's official name.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sharply criticized South Korea, describing inter-Korean relations as a relationship between ""two states hostile to each other.""
A major monument in Pyongyang symbolizing the goal of reconciliation with South Korea has been demolished, according to news reports citing satellite imagery.
Earlier this month, Kim labeled South Korea as a ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy,"" stating that unification with South Korea was no longer possible.
This stance is viewed by some analysts as a departure from North Korea's longstanding objective of reunifying the Korean Peninsula under its control.
Pyongyang also continues to ignore Washington's offers for dialogue and remains averse to negotiating with Seoul.
U.S. officials have said they are disappointed by North Korea's continued rejection of dialogue and the escalation of its hostile rhetoric toward South Korea. The United States said inter-Korean cooperation is vital to achieving lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
""We are eager to engage in substantive discussions on identifying ways to not just manage military risk but create lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, as well as our continued stated goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Patel said Wednesday.
At the Pentagon, Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters on Tuesday that Washington has been very public in its commitment to working with allies and partners ""to deter and help stabilize the security of the region.""
The U.S., Japan and South Korea have reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK, in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The three countries also urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
North Korea last launched cruise missiles in September 2023. Two cruise missiles carrying mock nuclear warheads were fired toward the Yellow Sea at that time.
The two Koreas have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953. They remain technically at war as the Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

PRAGUE (Sputnik) - The Czech Republic will sign an agreement to purchase 24 fifth-generation F-35A Lightning II fighter jets from the United States by the end of March, Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova said on Sunday.
In September 2023, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said that Prague had decided to procure 24 F-35 fighter jets. He added that the first fighters would be delivered to the Czech Republic in 2031, while all 24 purchased units would be put into service in 2035.
""It will definitely be signed before the end of March or even earlier. We are now looking for a suitable form and a suitable date, including due to the illness of [US Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin,"" Cernochova told the CNN Prima NEWS broadcaster.
The broadcaster reported that Prague would pay the US 105.8 billion Czech korunas ($4.64 billion). Additional costs, including the construction of a new airfield, will amount to 43.8 billion korunas, the report said, adding that the total costs for the purchase and use of these aircraft by the Czech Republic for the period until 2069 will reach 322 billion korunas.
Currently, the Czech air force is armed with 14 JAS-39 Gripen fighters leased from Sweden, as well as 24 L-159 aircraft of its own production.
Maria Zakharova, an official spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, earlier noted that America's efforts to sell its own weapons ""have already damaged the global economy and affected the well-being of the population of many countries far beyond Europe.""

Envoys of Pakistan and Iran will return to their posts by the end of this week, Pakistan and Iran announced Monday.
The latest sign of de-escalation comes almost a week after Iran struck alleged terror targets inside Pakistan and Islamabad responded with counterstrikes against purported terror hideouts across the border. The strikes killed at least 11 civilians, 9 in Iran and 2 in Pakistan.
Amid unprecedented tensions Islamabad recalled its ambassador from Tehran last Wednesday and told the Iranian envoy, who was on a trip to his home country, to not return. Islamabad also suspended all high-level visits between the two countries.
Monday's press release, issued jointly by the foreign ministries of both the countries, said Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian will visit Pakistan on January 29 at his Pakistani counterpart Jalil Abbas Jilani's invitation.
In a phone call Friday, the top diplomats of both countries agreed to defuse tensions and reestablish full diplomatic ties.
Analysts VOA spoke to say that while smoothing over ruffled ties is necessary and welcome, Iran's unprovoked attack on Pakistan may have opened a Pandora's box in the region.
Messaging tool
Iran has said it was targeting Sunni separatist group Jaish al-Adl's hideouts on Pakistani soil.
Anti-state insurgents targeting Pakistan and Iran have been active along the 900-kilometer border between the two countries for years. They frequently mount deadly attacks against security forces.
The terrorist threat in the region has also expanded with hardline Sunni terrorist group Islamic State or IS targeting Shiite Muslims in both countries. The group claimed responsibility for twin blasts at an event near the tomb of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani on January 3. The blasts in southeastern Iranian city of Kerman killed more than 100 people.
While Pakistan acknowledges the IS presence in the country, the group has a bigger, highly organized structure in Afghanistan.
Washington-based security affairs expert Kamran Bokhari told VOA Iran's strikes were not necessarily a response to rising terrorism but meant to send a message to Washington in the context of the bloody Israel-Hamas war that has killed thousands in Gaza.
Since the war started last October, Washington has targeted Iranian proxies in the Middle East and the Red Sea while Tehran has struck U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria several times.
""They [militant hideouts in Pakistan] provided an excuse for Iran to do something different, which is basically to telegraph to the United States that look, we know that you are talking about a direct confrontation with us.... But, if you do that, then we have the capability to further expand this war,"" said Bokhari who serves as a senior director of Eurasian security and prosperity at the Newlines Institute.
Bokhari believes Tehran picked Pakistan, as it's a U.S. ally but mired in economic, political and security crises, and therefore, less likely to engage in a massive confrontation.
Pakistan's counterstrike marked the first time Iran faced a direct attack since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988.
While the Biden administration condemned the Iranian action, Bokhari thinks those in Washington who favor a direct confrontation with Tehran may say, ""We've never struck on Iranian soil. Now that the Pakistanis have done it, it sets a precedent.""
Islamabad-based security affairs expert Syed Muhammad Ali told VOA that while Pakistan and Iran managed to de-escalate quickly, any other country contemplating to attack Iran should not expect the same outcome.
""Even if it gives some ideas to some other countries, I think, they will have to factor in Iranian possible response options based on their own bilateral history and geostrategic convergences or divergences,"" Ali said.
Pressure tool
While Tehran and Islamabad work to normalize ties, some are concerned sectarian groups may be exploited as a pressure tool.
Pakistan has a history of sectarian violence as Saudi-funded Sunni and Iran-funded Shiite armed groups came head-to-head in the 90s. Targeted killings on sectarian basis still occur.
On Sunday Pakistani officials claimed apprehending a ""terrorist trained by a foreign country."" Authorities said he was getting support from a ""neighboring country"" and linked him to Zainabiyoun Brigade, an Iranian-backed militia.
""Pakistan is, both, being cautious not naming Iran, but also talking about perpetrators that may be linked with Iran,"" said Ayesha Siddiqa, a military affairs expert and senior fellow at King's College London.
Siddiqa said Pakistan and Iran have no choice but to continue to de-escalate tensions to avoid possible sectarian strife.
Shrinking space for militants
On Monday Pakistan armed forces' media wing announced the military killed seven ""terrorists"" in an operation near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Baluchistan. The statement did not specify which outfit the slain militants were from.
In Pakistan's counterstrike across the Iranian border, Islamabad claimed killing Baloch insurgents.
Ali told VOA he believes the space for anti-state actors that target Iran and Pakistan might shrink after last week's events.
However, he said military operations are only a part of Pakistan's multi-layered counterinsurgency strategy â that also relies on other incentives to encourage separatists to lay down arms."

The Russian Armed Forces have also liberated the village of Krakhmalnoye (Kharkov region) thanks to the successful actions of the 'Zapad' troops.
In addition, the Russian army repelled numerous attacks from Ukraine with the help of air and artillery.
For example, in the Donetsk region, Russian soldiers thwarted attacks by the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade and 5th Assault Brigade with artillery support. As a result, the enemy lost over 310 personnel, a tank, two armored vehicles, a D-20 howitzer and a Grad MLRS.
In the Kherson region, Russian forces used artillery, missiles and drones to destroy Ukrainian ammunition depots and hit a deployment point for foreign mercenaries.
The enemy forces also suffered losses in the Zaporozhye region.
""Russian troops, supported by artillery, defeated the personnel and equipment of the 117th mechanized brigade, the 128th mountain assault brigade, and the 3rd brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine near Zaporozhye's Verbovoye, Rabotino, Pyatikhatki and Nesteryanka settlements"".

Speech by Carlos Del Toro  Presented on 25 January 2024  Date Published 25 January 2024
LONDON
Good afternoon, everyone! It is wonderful to be with you here at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
This is my second visit to the United Kingdom as the United States' 78th Secretary of the Navy, and I cannot thank you enough for your warm welcome and the gracious hospitality my staff and I have received during our time here thus far.
Vice Admiral Connell, thank you for your kind introduction, for your decades of service in the Royal Navy, and for your commitment to a strong transatlantic alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
Although they are not present at today's event, I would be remiss if did not thank His Majesty's Ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce, the Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, and the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Benjamin Key, for their partnership and their friendship as we work together to strengthen the bonds that connect our maritime forces.
As I prepared for my remarks today, I noted that the mission of the Royal United Services Institute is to inform, influence, and enhance public debate to help build a safer and more stable world.
To that end, before I take your questions, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the global challenges we face today, the importance of the strong transatlantic relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States from a naval perspective, and how we are working alongside our British counterparts in support of a safer and more economically prosperous world.
Now, despite getting off to a rough start during the 18th and early 19th centuries, for over a century now, our two nations have stood side-by-side, defending our shared ideals of freedom, democracy, and prosperity in the face of totalitarian regimes and international acts of terrorism.
Today, while our alliance remains as strong as ever, the world around us continues to change at a lightning pace.
The Atlantic Ocean remains a vital conduit connecting not only our two nations, but dozens of countries across four continentsâboth through maritime trade and information passed through undersea data cables.
The Atlantic is one of the world's heaviest traveled oceans and the volume of commercial goods transiting its shipping lanes rivals that of the Pacific.
We are witnessing increased investments across multiple industrial sectors, including energy exploration, that will only increase its importance as a driver of international economic growth and prosperity.
However, future security in the Atlantic hinges on our ability to address our common challenges in the maritime domain.
These challenges include adapting to the effects of climate change, deterring piracy, combatting narcotics and human trafficking, and countering Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported Fishing.
We are committed to working with all of our Atlantic partners and alliesâacross Europe, Africa, as well as North, Central, and South Americaâto achieve lasting solutions that preserve our shared maritime economic resources.
And as we look across the Atlantic, it is imperative that we also give due attention to the increased activity in the Arctic region.
Last year, we welcomed Finlandâan Arctic nation and fellow member of the Arctic Councilâinto NATO, and we look forward to Sweden becoming a NATO member in the near future.
The Arctic region indeed represents the northern flank of our alliance, along waters where Russia's naval and commercial fleets are increasingly active.
Our world's changing climate brings with it increased access to shipping lanes that are normally frozen-over for long periods of time, as well as access to undersea resources for further exploration.
With this increased access comes increased competition, and given Russia's stance towards NATO, the alliance is rightfully wary of Moscow's intentions and actions in the region.
As the 2022 NATO Strategic Concept states, ""In the High North, Russia's capability to disrupt Allied reinforcements and freedom of navigation across the North Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance.""
With that statement as our guide, it is imperative that we ensure our approach to operating in the Arctic focuses on our combined resiliency in the region, and preserves our ability to freely maneuver in a contested maritime domain.
And along NATO's eastern flank, Russia's illegal war of aggression continues in Ukraine, and Moscow's withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative is negatively impacting food security around the worldâespecially in developing nationsâas it continues to imperil the safety of commercial ships sailing in and out of Ukrainian ports.
Since the outset of the conflict nearly two years ago, we have been proud to support our Ukrainian partnersâworking alongside the United Kingdom to ensure they have the material support and training required to reclaim their national and territorial sovereignty.
And I commend the United Kingdom on its recent announcement of an additional 2.5 billion poundsâroughly 3.2 billion U.S. dollarsâin military aid to our partners in Ukraine.
Your assistance to Ukraine during a pivotal time in their war with Russia complements the military and humanitarian aid packages they have already received from several NATO and EU nations, all of which are representative of our collective, continued support for Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression.
Stability in the Black Sea region is critical to the future stability of Europe, and we are committed to supporting Ukraine, our NATO allies, and our European partners in the face of Russian aggression.
However, it is important to recognize that Moscow isn't the only authoritarian regime waging a concerted campaign to challenge the freedom of the seasâa foundational principle of the rules-based system of international law that has brought us peace, prosperity, and stability since the end of World War II.
Iran, too, continues to interfere with merchant shipping in the Strait of Hormuz through a campaign of harassment and seizures with its para-naval forces.
Just two weeks ago, Iran seized a tanker in the Gulf of Oman.
More significantly, the Iranian-aligned Houthis continue to launch unprovoked attacks on civilian merchant ships sailing innocently through international waters in the Red Seaâone of the world's busiest waterways that accounts for more than 15% of the world's shipping traffic, connecting Europe and Asia.
Over 20 countries have now joined the United Kingdom and the United States in Operation Prosperity Guardian, aimed at protecting civilian ships and their crews from harm.
Six of our coalition navies' destroyersâincluding HMS Diamondâhave shot down scores of anti-ship cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and drones launched by the Houthis over the Red Sea.
Our ships and crews have performed with exemplary skill, represented by successful surface-to-air scorecards not seen at this scale in naval combat in decades.
What's more, our ships have also worked together to counter acts of piracy, and have responded to distress calls issued by merchant ships under siege.
Two weeks ago, following exhaustive diplomatic efforts to seek an end to the Houthi's attacks without further damage and bloodshed, the combined forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, supported by our Dutch, Canadian, Bahraini, and Australian allies, conducted our first round of joint strikes against more than 60 targets in portions of Houthi-controlled Yemen.
And earlier this week, we conducted a second round of joint U.S.-UK precision strikes against eight Houthi targetsâincluding underground storage sites and locations associated with the group's missile and air surveillance capabilitiesâwith the support of the same allies and partners.
These strikes are in direct response to Houthi actions that have demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice the innocent lives of civilian merchant mariners from several nations across the globe, threatening our collective freedom of navigation and the very economic security of our nations on some of the world's busiest international waterways.
Iranâthrough its Houthi proxiesâaims to impose real economic costs on the rest of the world by increasing shipping costs and maritime insurance ratesâas well as the time it takes goods to reach their intended ports.
Make no mistake, these costs aren't borne by Iran.  Rather, they are a burden on the everyday American, Briton, and European, and are paid for at the gas pump, at the grocery store, at the pharmacy, not to mention the delays in the shipping of everyday household items.
The Houthis' actions in the Red Sea are sending reverberations across the global economy, and are felt in almost every facet of our lives.
It is imperative that weânot just the U.S. and United Kingdom, but along with NATO and the European Unionâstand together and take the necessary diplomatic and military actions to bring an end to the Houthi's disruption of the free flow of maritime commerce.
We cannotâwill notâhesitate to counter those who threaten safe passage across our global maritime commons, even if it comes at a great cost.
Earlier this week, we suspended the search for two U.S. Navy SEALS we lost at-seaâPetty Officer First Class Christopher Chambers and Petty Officer Second Class Nathan Ingramâduring an interdiction of Iranian lethal aid to the Houthis.
We will honor these men and their ultimate sacrifice by continuing to counter Iran's malign actions in our shared maritime commons as they attempt to spread their influence across the region, and across the world.
Our collective defense of international maritime shipping during this period of conflict is one of just many examples of our commitment to maritime security in the Middle East and economic prosperity here in the UK, home in the United States, and around the world.
Combined Maritime Forcesâof which the Royal Navy's Commodore Mark Anderson serves as the deputy commanderâis a coalition of 39 nations focused on promoting security, stability, and prosperity across 3.2 million square miles of international waters.
The United Kingdom's leading role in this maritime coalition that addresses a range of concerns from piracy, terrorism, training, and security cooperation in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden is a recognition of the fact that our navies remain a critical element to upholding the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea for the benefit of all countries.
And equally as important to stability of our global maritime commons is the Royal Navy's increased presence throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
Renewed British engagement in this vital region could not come at a more pivotal time, as our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific with other like-minded nations is being challenged.
As many in this room are aware, the People's Republic of China continues to act aggressively, provocatively, and unsafely across the Indo-Pacific region, including in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.
The PRC's Navyâthe PLANâis just one part of the maritime force Beijing employs to advance its aggressive foreign policy, challenging the rules-based international order.
The PLAN, in concert with its Coast Guard and Maritime Militia, are conducting operations designed to force nations to submit to Beijing's excessive territorial claimsâsome of which have been challenged and ruled illegal by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.
Using these ""gray zone"" operations, the PRC is staking illegal maritime claims to offshore resources that threaten the peace, prosperity, and ecological stability of the world's oceans.
The PRC seeks to exploit its growing economic and military power to coerce its neighbors and threaten their interests while undermining our alliances and security partnerships.
In the face of the PRC's actions, we are committed to working with the Royal Navy, as well as the navies of our partners and allies throughout the Indo-Pacific, to build up the resiliency of relationships, enabling us to withstand its continued pattern of maritime aggression.
In support of the Royal Navy's renewed presence in the region, we were proud to operate alongside the HMS Queen Elizabeth during her maiden deployment to the Indo-Pacific in 2021, which included an embarked squadron of U.S. F-35s and USS The Sullivans (DDG 68) joining the strike group.
And since 2021, the Royal Navy's off-shore patrol vessels HMS Spey and HMS Tamar have been on a five-year deployment to the Indo-Pacificâsupported by rotational crewsâcarrying out security patrols aimed at countering narcotics, smuggling, and other illegal activities, while participating in exercises with our fellow maritime nations.
Beyond this sustained surface posture, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States are proud members of the AUKUS security partnershipâa generational opportunity announced in September 2021 and re-affirmed by President Biden, Prime Minister Sunak, and Prime Minister Albanese early last year in San Diego, California.
Pillar I of AUKUS is focused on enabling Australia's acquisition of a nuclear-powered, conventionally-armed submarine fleet for the Royal Australian Navy.
The class of submarines being developed under Pillar I, dubbed SSN-AUKUS, will combine the submarine and design technologies of our two nations to provide our Australian allies with a capable, lethal undersea deterrent capability, and will also enter into service in the Royal Navy as the follow-on to the Astute-Class SSNs.
We are grateful for the leading role that the British Submarine Industrial Base is playing in the design and construction of the initial hulls, as well as your commitment to training Australian civilians and Sailors to ensure this capability is leveraged effectively and in a sustainable manner.
It is critical that all three of our nations have healthy and resilient submarine industrial capabilities and capacity to ensure the success of SSN-AUKUS.
And efforts such as BAE Systems' submarine Skills Academy in Barrow are crucial to ensuring we have the workforce required for this monumental task.
As part of AUKUS, we will also begin deploying Virginia and Astute-Class submarines to Australia as a part of Submarine Rotational Force-West, based out of HMAS Stirling, providing a constant, forward presence of our undersea fleets.
Our presence at HMAS Stirling will be essential for developing vital skills necessary to establish, operate, and sustain the Royal Australian Navy's future nuclear-powered submarine fleet.
As President Biden noted, ""Our unprecedented trilateral cooperation is a testament to the strength of the longstanding ties that unite us and to our shared commitment of ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains free and open, prosperous and secure, defined by opportunity for allâa shared commitment to create a future rooted in our common values.""
And as we look towards the future of the Royal Navy's presence in the Indo-Pacific in support of our shared commitment, we look forward to the HMS Prince of Wales Carrier Strike Group's first deployment to the Pacific in 2025.
The United States Navy and Marine Corps are committed to working alongside the United Kingdom to contribute to the success of this deployment.
These types of operations are directly supported by key strategic bilateral partnership arrangements such as the recently renewed Statement of Intent on Enhanced Cooperation on Carrier Operations and Maritime Power Projection.
Last month, HMS Prince of Wales returned home to Portsmouth following three months of training off the East Coast of the United States, during which she and her crew conducted flight operations with our fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, validating the interoperability of our forces.
As a part of this deployment, I had the privilege of visiting her during a port visit to Norfolk, Virginia.
To say I was impressed by the ship and her crew would be an understatement, and my engagements with Captain Hewitt and his sailors reinforced in me the strength of the ties between our two navies, and indeed our two nations.
And it is my hope that our Sailors took advantage of this opportunity to strengthen the bonds that tie us togetherâwhether it was during operations at-sea or while on liberty.
We are further advancing the depth and breadth of our bilateral maritime partnership through the updated strategic ""Delivering Combined Seapower"" charter, signed in October onboard the HMS Prince of Wales by First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Key, our Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Franchetti, and our Commandant of the Marine Corps General Smith.
This agreement re-affirms that we are working closely on the common challenges we face, as well as our need to deliver capabilities that enhance our ability to operate together, such as re-arming and refueling sea.
As Admiral Sir Key stated at the signing ceremony, ""This Charter is testament to the enduring strength of the relationship between our navies and marines. By aligning our strategies and capabilities, we strengthen our ability to deter threats, respond to crises, and promote stability across the world's oceans.""
And as we examine how best to identify, experiment, adopt, and field new, advanced, capabilities into our fleets, we remain steadfast in our support of key Royal Navy programs.
For example, our team at Naval Reactors is working closely with their British counterparts on the design, build, and test of the nuclear propulsion plant to support the Royal Navy's future Dreadnought-class ballistic missile submarinesâa platform critical to the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrence posture.
We are also interested in learning from you, especially when it comes to improving fleet readiness.
BAE Systems Submarines in Barrow-in-Furnessâthe yard responsible for construction of the Dreadnought and SSN-AUKUS submarine classesâis a prime example through its use of Ship Lift, a cost-effective and flexible alternative to graving docks.
Ship Lift represents an innovative approach to fleet maintenance and construction, and we look forward to exploring how we can incorporate practices and capabilities such as this into our own fleet maintenance processes.
On the advanced capabilities front, our Office of Naval Research, through ONR-Globalâheadquartered here in Londonâand NavalX's London Tech Bridge, whose team I met with during my last trip, continue to drive partnerships between the U.S. and Royal Navies, allowing us to source technologies and accelerate the adoption of innovative capabilities.
From managing bilateral and multi-lateral research and development agreements to forging new relationships with industry and academia across the UK and throughout Europe, our ONR and NavalX teams are working tirelessly to deliver the cutting-edge technologies and capabilities to maintain their competitive advantages.
Everything we do togetherâfrom increasing the interoperability of our fleets, collaborating on next-generation platforms, developing advanced technologies and capabilitiesâwill be critical to the success of our navies in the decades to come.
In this era of intense maritime competition, our nations will continue to rely on our navies to project power and defend our shared interests on a global scaleâfrom the Black Sea to the Red Sea, and throughout the Indo-Pacific.
When I called for a new maritime statecraft in my address at Harvard University this past fall, I defined a core tenet of our approach as cooperation on shared challenges in the maritime domain with our international partners and allies.
Our nation's most prominent naval strategist, Alfred Thayer Mahan, argued that naval power begets maritime commercial power, and control of maritime commerce begets greater naval powerâan argument based on his study of the United Kingdom's rise to prominence as a seafaring nation.
While Mahan's writings have stood the test of time, we also recognize that comprehensive maritime powerâcommercial and navalâin today's era is built through strong relationships with like-minded countries who share our commitment to freedom of the seas, driving global economic prosperity.
It also requires consistent, robust investment on the part of the American and British people, and it is our responsibility, as we are currently doing so in the Red Sea and globally, to provide a significant return on that investment.
It is incumbent upon usâthe United Kingdom and the United States of America, two of the world's great maritime powersâto continue making investments, to continue working together, and to build our shared capacity and capabilities.
Now as never before, we must redouble our commitment to upholding the free and lawful use of the maritime commons on behalf of all nations.
As I conclude my remarks, I will end with a quote from Sir Winston Churchill:
""We have surmounted all the perils and endured all the agonies of the past. We shall provide against and thus prevail over the dangers and problems of the future, withhold no sacrifice, grudge no toil, seek no sordid gain, fear no foe. All will be well. We have, I believe, within us the life-strength and guiding light by which the tormented world around us may find the harbour of safety, after a storm-beaten voyage.""
Around the globe, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Arctic Circle to the southernmost stretches of the worldâthe United Kingdom and the United States of America proudly sail together so that ""Freedom's Torch"" will continue to shine brightly for all.
May God continue to grant our nations and our navies fair winds and following seas wherever we may sail.
Thank you."

Taipei, Jan. 24 (CNA) The convictions of retired military officers Lee Ching-hsien (ææ¶è³¢) and Yeh Jui-chang (èçç) have been finalized after their appeals were rejected by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
The Supreme Court did not immediately explain its decision on the appeals.
Yeh and Tsui Yi-sheng (å´æ²ç) were each sentenced by the Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Court in June 2022 to eight months in prison for violating the National Security Act, while Lee was given sentences of seven months, seven months and 14 months for multiple offenses.
Yeh and Lee appealed the verdict, and after the Supreme Court's rejection, Yeh's conviction and sentence are final while prosecutors still need to hold a hearing on combining the three sentences for Lee.
According to previous court findings, Tsui retired from the Taiwan Garrison Command (now the Armed Forces Reserve Command) as an intelligence officer in 1988.
Lee retired from the former Coast Guard Command as a commander in the Intelligence Division, while Yeh retired from the Coast Guard Administration as commander in the clerical division.
Tsui opened a business in China in 2004 and returned to Taiwan after closing it in 2013.
During his time in China, he was recruited by a state security organization in Shanghai and collected information for Chinese state security. He also introduced Lee to Chinese officials in 2007, the Supreme Court ruling said.
After being recruited, Lee engaged in activities that included developing networks, spying, and collecting confidential documents, the court found.
Tsui handed a four-page document titled ""Coast Guard Intelligence Collection Items"" and other confidential documents provided by Lee to Chinese officials in exchange for financial gains totaling 5,000 renminbi (NT$22,000).
Yeh was recruited by Lee in 2013. He returned to the Coast Guard Main Branch to collect secret documents from unsuspecting officers and transmitted them to China via Lee in exchange for NT$15,000.
Lee received a net total of nearly 14,000 renminbi for his efforts in the cases, according to the ruling.
Also on Wednesday, Hsin Peng-sheng (è¾æ¾ç), a former air defense artillery colonel chief of staff, was found guilty by the Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Court of attempting to develop a network for China, in violation of the National Security Act.
Hsin was sentenced to six months in prison, which can be commuted to a fine. The case can be appealed.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi says Tehran supports South Africa's ""smart and historic"" move to file a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over crimes against the Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Raeisi made the remarks in a meeting with South Africa's new Ambassador to Tehran Francis Molloy on Sunday as he received his credentials.
""South Africa's move in complaining about the crimes of the Zionist regime (Israel) is a historic, lasting and commendable action and the Islamic Republic of Iran supports this smart and wise action.""
Raeisi also hailed ""very good and advancing"" relations between the two countries and said no obstacle can hinder the promotion of ties.
The South African ambassador, for his part, vowed to take constructive steps to boost relations in order to serve the interests of the two nations and countries.
Nicaragua pursues 'humanitarian' stance on crimes of Israel
In a meeting with RamÃ³n Alberto Moncada Colindres, the new ambassador of Nicaragua to Tehran, on Sunday, Raeisi said Nicaragua pursues a humanitarian and justice-seeking stance on international issues, including Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people.
""If other countries have had such a position, the Zionist regime (Israel) and its supporters would not have dared to commit such crimes against the oppressed but strong Palestinian people.""
Raeisi underscored the importance of following up on the full implementation of the agreements reached between the two countries during his visit to Managua in June 2023.
Nicaragua's ambassador, for his part, said Tehran and Managua are making efforts to promote relations in various fields.
Cruel sanctions against Iran cannot hinder enhanced ties with Japan
In a meeting with Japanese new ambassador to Iran Toskada Tamaki on Sunday, Raeisi said Tehran plans to promote relations with Tokyo in various fields.
""Oppressive sanctions against the Islamic Republic should not and cannot create an obstacle in the path of the development of mutual relations as they have so far failed to bring any achievement for the United States,"" the president stated.
He said the US plays a role in every conflict in the world. ""From the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese people to today's crimes against the people of Gaza, the US plays a key role.""
The Japanese ambassador submitted his credentials to the Iranian president and said the two countries enjoy close and deep relations.
Iran determined to boost relations with Europe
In a meeting with Belgium's Ambassador to Tehran Michel Malherbe, the president said Iran sets no limits to enhanced relations with countries based on mutual trust and respect.
Raeisi said the United States has lost its credibility and reputation in the world given its full support for Israel.
Raeisi urged European countries to pursue their interests and relations independently of the United States.
US, Israel, certain European states root cause of terrorism
In a meeting with Burkina Faso's new Ambassador to Tehran Mohammadi Kaboureh, the Iranian president said the United States, Israel and certain European countries, which claim to fight terrorism, are the root cause of terror and main sponsors of terrorist groups.
Raeisi added that Iran is willing to deepen cooperation with African countries, including Burkina Faso.
Cooperation, cohesion among Muslim countries could end crimes of Israel
In a meeting with the new ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Tehran, Nijaz Äardaklija, the Iranian president said cooperation and cohesion among Muslim countries could stop the crimes of Israel.
Pointing to arrogant powers' hostility towards the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Raeisi said in the absence of interference against Muslims, including the Palestinians, Muslims would have been able to have a peaceful coexistence.
Äardaklija, for his part, said his country calls for the expansion of relations and constructive cooperation with Iran."

Polish MFA is deeply concerned over the reports from Belarus regarding another wave of massive searches and arrests among former prisoners of conscience and relatives of persons currently incarcerated by the regime on political grounds.
We strongly condemn systemic repressions of the Belarusian regime against its own society, including the detention of Maryna Adamovich, the wife of Mikalai Statkevich, a Belarusian opposition activist sentenced to 14 years in prison.
The human rights situation in Belarus has been aggravating. The increased pressure of Lukashenko's regime on the civil society and his political opponents over the past weeks aims to intimidate Belarusians, forcing them into silence or fleeing the country.
Since the rigged presidential election in 2020, thousands of people have been imprisoned and at least 1,400 political prisoners remain in detention. Conditions of detention of the regime's opponents are an abomination of humanity - the oppositionists serve their sentences in overcrowded cold cells, with limited access to health care and limited contacts with relatives.
Polish MFA constantly calls on the Minsk authorities to unconditionally release all political prisoners and stop repressions against its own society."

Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA) The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS John Finn transited the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, according to the U.S. Navy.
In a statement, the U.S. 7th Fleet said the John Finn's transit ""demonstrates the United States' commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle.""
The destroyer conducted a Taiwan Strait transit on Jan. 24 through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law, the 7th Fleet said.
""The ship transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state,"" the 7th Fleet added.
Later on Wednesday, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense confirmed that a southbound U.S. Navy ship had passed through the Taiwan Strait from the north.
The ministry said it was closely monitoring the waters and airspace around the Taiwan Strait as the ship was making the transit, and nothing unusual was observed.
The latest transit came as leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Taiwan Caucus, Republican Representative Mario Diaz Balart and Democratic Representative Ami Bera, visit Taipei, as a show of support after the country's Jan. 13 presidential and legislative elections.
While the Taiwan Strait is considered an area in which high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, transits by international military vessels often draw the ire of China, which has been trying to establish dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.
About an hour after Taiwan made the transit public, China criticized the U.S. for conducting and ""trumpeting"" the transit.
The People's Liberation Army (PLA) was on guard and monitoring the John Finn as it was making the transit and ""will deal with it according to the law,"" according to a statement issued by the PLA Eastern Theater Command.
The U.S. military has often engaged in ""provocative actions"" recently in an attempt to disrupt regional peace, and the Command will be on high alert at all times to uphold China's sovereignty and regional peace, according to the statement.

BELGRADE (Sputnik) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Wednesday he intended to buy two more Russian Ka-32 multipurpose helicopters for firefighting following a fire that broke out in a large Chinese indoor market in Belgrade earlier in the day.
The Serbian Interior Ministry said it had received a signal about a fire at the largest Chinese indoor market in Serbia, located in the municipality of New Belgrade on the left bank of the Sava river, at about 7 a.m. (06:00 GMT). The fire eventually engulfed the entire market, with smoke spreading across New Belgrade and being visible from other parts of the city.
The fire was located by 10 a.m. A total of 76 firefighters took part in extinguishing it, using 25 fire engines and three helicopters, one of which was a Russian-made Ka-32. The helicopters dropped 71 tonnes of water on the fire in 37 sorties.
""We now have two Kamovs [Ka-32s]. If we have enough money, we will buy two more within two years, and then we will become a serious power in firefighting, not only in the Balkans, but also in the southeastern Europe,"" Vucic told reporters during his visit to the Multifunctional Center for Creativity and Innovation Lozionica in Belgrade.
The first Ka-32 was supplied to Serbia in October 2022, while the second one was delivered in September 2023, the president said.
""I am not happy with what happened today, but people could see what we have. For the first time we showed one of the two Kamovs we had purchased, as well as two H145s [twin-engine light utility helicopters manufactured by Airbus],"" Vucic said.
Chinese Ambassador to Belgrade Li Ming visited the site of the incident earlier in the day and thanked the Serbian authorities for their ""quick engagement in a difficult moment,"" the Radio Television of Serbia reported.
In August 2021, another fire broke out at this indoor market. Serbian firefighters battled the blaze for seven hours with 50 vehicles, and the fire was finally extinguished within a few days.
Local residents assume that today's fire broke out in one of the market's catering outlets, as it had previously caught fire due to faulty wiring.

Tehran, IRNA -- Spokesman for Yemen's Ansarullah Movement, Mohammed Abdul-Salam, has called on countries in West Asia not allow their government and people to be the victims of US deception.
Abdul-Salam cautioned the regional countries about the false claims being propagated by the US administration against Yemen's actions in the Red Sea.
""We target Israeli ships or ships heading to ports in occupied Palestine in support of the Palestinian nation and in order to put pressure on the apartheid Zionist regime to end its attacks on Gaza"", Abdul-Salam emphasized on his official telegram page.
He underlined that America should also stop running away from its responsibility for stopping Israel's genocidal war on Gaza.
""We once again make it clear that Yemen adheres to the principle of self-defense, will never allow the violation of our country's sovereignty and will never turn a blind eye to any aggression against Yemen"", the Ansarullah spokesman said with reference to a series aerial attacks carried by the US and Britain on Yemen under the pretext of the Arab country's actions in the Red Sea.
He said that the US is trying to divert public opinion from the current events in the Red Sea, adding that Yemen will keep targeting Israeli ships or other vessels heading to occupied Palestinian ports.
Ansarullah has categorically censured the Israeli aggression against the besieged territory that has claimed tens of thousands of innocent lives and ""destroyed everything in Gaza.""
During the past weeks, the Yemeni army has targeted over two dozen Israeli-bound commercial vessels and oil tankers in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab strait in support of the Palestinians in Gaza. The Yemeni army has already defied US threats, saying such attack will continue as long as the Zionist regime keeps spilling the blood of the Palestinians.

SOUDA BAY, Crete -- The Bataan Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), comprised of the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5), Harpers Ferry-class dock landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) and San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS Mesa Verde (LPD 19), along with the embarked 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)) arrived in Souda Bay, Crete, Jan. 20 and 21, for a regularly scheduled port visit following the completion of a large scale MEU(SOC) exercise Odyssey Encore in Greece alongside the 32nd Hellenic Marine Brigade.
While in port, the Bataan ARG and 26th MEU(SOC) team will conduct routine maintenance following several months of distributed operations and activities within the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operations since July 2023.
""The last six months has showcased the value, utility, and operational flexibility a forward-deployed ARG and MEU(SOC) provide in terms of campaigning and crisis response,"" said Col. Dennis ""Dolf"" Sampson, commanding officer of the 26th MEU(SOC). ""Our recent MEU(SOC) Exercise ""Odyssey Encore"" and the integrated training with the Hellenic 32nd Marine Brigade and Hellenic SOF was essential to sustaining our operational capabilities and readiness across the MEU(SOC) Marine Air-Ground Task Force. This port visit will provide an opportunity to conduct normal required maintenance and inspections of our vehicles and equipment prior to getting underway for the next phase in our deployment. More so, it will provide the Marines and Sailors with some quality, well-earned liberty and an opportunity to enjoy the local culture in Crete.""
Souda Bay marks the second port visit for majority of the Sailors and Marines of the Bataan ARG and 26th MEU(SOC) to the U.S. Naval Force Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) area of responsibility following their re-aggregation in the Mediterranean, Dec. 28. During this visit they will have the opportunity to explore Souda Bay, participate in community relations projects and cultural excursions hosted by each ship's Morale, Welfare and Recreation committees.
""This is my last port visit as I depart the Bataan after six years, and I am looking forward to seeing historical places from 1,000 years ago,"" said Aviation Boatswain's Mate (Fuel) 2nd Class Gerald Labtis. ""I will cherish and treasure every bit of it.""
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, NAVEUR-NAVAF operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command areas of responsibility. U.S. 6th Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations."

THE HAGUE (Sputnik) - The Netherlands, following the NATO chief's statement that the alliance does not see an immediate threat from Russia, will send three MQ-9 Reaper drones to the bloc's eastern border in Romania in February to monitor Russia's military activity, Dutch newspaper Parool reported.
This will be the first time that unmanned aircraft of the Dutch air force will be deployed abroad, according to the report.
The Dutch armed forces purchased four MQ-9 Reaper drones from the United States in 2021, but they have remained primarily in the Caribbean on the Dutch island of Curacao since then. There, they took part in tests and allegedly proved their enormous value, especially while spying on drug trafficking groups, the report read.
After nearly two years in the Caribbean, the drones are now ready to begin collecting intelligence on NATO's eastern border, the news outlet reported.
Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said in a letter to the country's parliament that the aim of this mission is ""to prevent possible misunderstandings and escalation.""
The drones will stay in Romania for six months, but if necessary, the term can be extended for another six months, according to the report. The costs of the mission will amount to 14 million euros ($15.1 million).
Earlier, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that that the alliance does not currently see an immediate threat from Russia against any of its allies.

On January 22, 2024, in New York, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on the sidelines of the ministerial open debates at the UN Security Council on the situation in the Palestinian territories.
The ministers had a comprehensive exchange of opinions on the current agenda in the Middle East and expressed their support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and securing conditions for humanitarian assistance to the residents of the enclave. They expressed general concern about the tensions in the Red Sea, which escalated abruptly as a result of the irresponsible use of force by the United States and several associated countries against Yemen.
The ministers discussed a broad range of issues on the bilateral agenda, with a focus on implementing the agreements reached at the highest level, including the talks between the presidents of Russia and Iran in Moscow on December 7, 2023. They stressed their mutual readiness to continue building up mutually beneficial practical cooperation across all priority areas.
The parties once again confirmed their adherence to the fundamental principles of Russia-Iran relations and the UN Charter, including non-interference in domestic affairs, mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity in its entirety."

Air strikes and diplomatic sparring between Iran and Pakistan have raised difficult questions for China and its influence in the region amid growing fears the upheaval sweeping across the Middle East could spread.
Since the tit-for-tat strikes on January 16 and 18 against militant and separatist groups, Islamabad and Tehran have signaled they want to de-escalate the situation and that their foreign ministers will hold talks in Pakistan on January 29.
But the attacks have exposed the fine line between peace and conflict in the region and put the spotlight on China, a close partner of both countries, to see if it can use its sway to ramp down tensions and avoid a conflict that would jeopardize Beijing's economic and geopolitical interests in the region.
""For China, the stakes are high and they really can't afford for things to get any worse between Iran and Pakistan,"" Abdul Basit, an associate research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told RFE/RL.
China has tens of billions of dollars of investments in Iran and Pakistan and both countries are high-level partners that benefit from Chinese political and economic support.
Following the missile-strike exchange, China's Foreign Ministry called for calm and said it would ""play a constructive role in cooling down the situation,"" without giving details.
Beijing is now expected to step up its engagement to head off another crisis in the region, in what analysts say is yet another test for China's influence after recently hitting its limit with the war in Gaza, shipping attacks in the Red Sea by Iranian-backed Huthi militants, and the growing instability across the Middle East these events have caused.
""We're yet to see anything really concrete where China has stepped in to solve an international crisis,"" Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute, told RFE/RL. ""[But] China has a reputational image at stake where it's presenting itself as the alternative to the United States, even though assumptions about how powerful it really is in the Middle East are now being scrutinized.""
What's Going On Between Iran And Pakistan?
The Iranian strikes in Pakistan were part of a series of similar attacks launched by Iran that also hit targets in Iraq and Syria.
In Pakistan, Tehran said it was targeting the Sunni separatist group Jaish al-Adl with drones and missiles in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan Province. Jaish al-Adl operates mostly in Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan Province but is also suspected to be in neighboring Pakistan. The group claimed responsibility for a December 15 attack on a police station in southeastern Iran that killed 11 officers.
In response, Islamabad said its military conducted air strikes in Sistan-Baluchistan targeting the Baloch Liberation Front and the Baloch Liberation Army, two separatist groups believed to be hiding in Iran.
The exchange of strikes was followed by Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and blocking Tehran's ambassador to Islamabad from returning to his post.
On January 21, the Counterterrorism Department in Pakistan's southwestern Sindh Province announced it had arrested a suspect in a 2019 assassination attempt on a top Pakistani cleric who is a member of the Zainebiyoun Brigade, a militant group allegedly backed by Iran.
But since the strikes on each other's territory, Iran and Pakistan have cooled their rhetoric and signaled that they intend to de-escalate, echoing sentiment through official statements that the neighbors are ""brotherly countries"" that should pursue dialogue and cooperation.
Basit says this stems largely from the fact that the countries see themselves spread too thin in dealing with a host of pressing foreign and domestic issues.
Tehran has grappled with a series of attacks across the country, including a January 3 twin bombing that killed more than 90 people, and is engaged across the region directly or through groups that it backed such as Yemen's Huthis and Lebanon's Hizballah.
The tit-for-tat attacks, meanwhile, come as Pakistan is embroiled in an economic crisis and prepares to hold high-stakes elections on February 8, the first since former Prime Minister Imran Khan was removed in a vote of no confidence in April 2021, setting off years of escalating political turmoil.
""Between the economy, elections, and always-present tensions with India that could grow, Pakistan simply can't afford another front,"" Basit said.
Islamabad and Tehran are now pushing to cool down the situation, though Basit adds that the situation remains tense. ""There is peace and calm now, but the animosity is ongoing,"" he said.
How Much Leverage Does China Have?
Following a week of tensions, China has leverage to push for a diplomatic settlement to the dispute, although experts say Beijing may be reluctant to intervene too publicly.
""China looks to be quite measured here in its response and that raises some questions about where China stands in using its influence,"" Basit said. ""China knows it can influence the situation, but Beijing also usually shies away from situations like this because they worry that if they try and fail, then the West will look at it differently.""
Beijing raised expectations in March 2023 it would play a larger political role in the Middle East when it brokered a historic deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Michael Kugelman, the director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute, says China's willingness to be a mediator shouldn't be underplayed. ""It looks like the Pakistanis and the Iranians had enough in their relationship to ease tensions themselves,"" he told RFE/RL. ""But China was willing to do the Iran-Saudi deal, which is a more fraught relationship to get involved in. So, they might be relieved now, but that doesn't mean they won't step up if needed.""
China also holds other cards if it needs to calm the situation between Iran and Pakistan.
As China's ""iron brother,"" Islamabad has a close partnership with Beijing, with cooperation ranging from economic investment to defense. Pakistan is the largest buyer of Chinese weapons and is also home to the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship series of infrastructure projects within China's Belt and Road Initiative.
CPEC is part of Beijing's efforts to connect itself to the Arabian Sea and build stronger trade networks with the Middle East.
A centerpiece of the venture is developing the port of Gwadar in Balochistan, which would strengthen shipping lanes to the region, particularly for energy shipments from Iran.
For Tehran, China is a top buyer of sanctioned Iranian oil, and Beijing signed a sprawling 25-year economic and security agreement with Iran in 2021.
Arho Havren says that given both Iran and Pakistan's economic dependence on China, Beijing will do all it can, should tensions rise, but will likely do so behind the scenes. ""China [is unlikely] to take a stronger public stake in the conflict, but will instead use its back-channels,"" Arho Havren said.
What Comes Next?
While the situation between Iran and Pakistan is moving towards de-escalation, the recent tensions highlight the often tenuous footing of regional rivalries that China's ambitions to lead the Global South rest upon.
Both Pakistan and Iran are members of the Beijing-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which also includes India, Russia, and Central Asia (minus Turkmenistan). The SCO has been an important part of Beijing's bid for leadership across parts of Asia and the Middle East while looking to bring together countries to work together on economic and security issues.
China has invested in growing the bloc and is in discussion to add more countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Belarus, but further conflict between its members could derail those moves and damage the SCO's credibility.
Arho Havren says Beijing will still have to grapple with the lack of trust between Islamabad and Tehran and is facing similar issues elsewhere in the Middle East as it walks a tightrope between simultaneously raising its international influence and limiting any diplomatic exposure that could hurt its reputation.
""Cooperation may be easy, but the relations between the countries in the region are complex, and China's journey [in the Middle East] is still in its beginning,"" she said.

The United States and the United Kingdom have carried out a new round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen as the Iran-aligned armed group continues to target commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who control much of Yemen, have attacked dozens of ships in the major waterway since November, disrupting international maritime trade and raising concern about the impact on the global economy.
The US and UK said they had carried out eight strikes, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, targeting a Houthi underground storage site as well as missile and surveillance capabilities. These precision strikes are intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities that the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners, the joint statement said. Grant Shapps, Britain's defense secretary, said that the attacks are another blow to the Houthis' ability to threaten global trade, and that Britain will continue to support regional stability throughout the Middle
The US Central Command also stated, ""The attacks were aimed at areas in Yemen controlled by the Houthis who routinely attack international trade ships and ships of the US Navy, and are intended to damage the ability of the Houthis to continue their attacks."" The targets included missile systems and launchers, air defense systems, radars and weapons storage facilities.""
Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip witnessed difficult hours as a result of it being subjected to an unprecedented and intense Israeli bombardment that left more than 160 martyrs and wounded, amid explosions and Israeli attempts to penetrate the western axis of the city, and fierce clashes waged by the resistance that led to the killing of at least three occupation officers and the injury of dozens of others. At a time when the occupation army announced the expansion of its operations in Khan Yunis and spoke of 7 brigades operating underground and above ground, the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) said that Israel had committed a new crime against the displaced by bombing 5 shelter centers in the governorate. This resulted in dozens of martyrs and wounded.
Israeli media confirmed the killing and wounding of more than 20 officers and soldiers in the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, and Likud Party Minister Tali Gottliff called on the army to issue an official statement clarifying this news.
Israeli sources told Axios ""Israel"" has presented The Palestinian Resistance with a plan through Qatari and Egyptian mediators that includes up to two months of a pause in the war as part of a multi-phase settlement that would also involve the release of all remaining captives in Gaza.  The proposal would have a pause of up to two months but had no mention of a permanent ceasefire, as the Israeli genocidal war against the Strip has claimed the lives of 25,295 Palestinians with the number of injuries reaching a staggering 63,000 since October 7.
Brett McGurk, President Biden's assistant, visited Egypt on Sunday and will then go to Qatar for discussions aimed at making progress in the negotiations to free Israeli captives while disregarding the thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
Israeli officials told Axios they are awaiting a response from Hamas regarding the potential deal, which includes the release of all remaining captives and a return of the bodies of those who have died.  The officials explained the first phase would involve the release of women and men over the age of 60, and captives with serious medical conditions.
The next steps would entail the release of female IOF troops, non-military individuals under the age of 60, Israeli male troops, and bodies of captives. The Israeli occupation and Hamas would agree on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released, followed by separate discussions on the identities of these detainees, according to the Israeli proposal.
Additionally, the idea involves redeploying the IDF such that some are relocated out of Gaza's key population centers, as well as enabling Palestinian people to gradually return to Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip when the accord is executed. According to Israeli authorities, the plan clearly states that Israel would neither agree to halt the war nor free all 6,000 Palestinian inmates held in Israeli jails, which are among the main conditions of the resistance to initiate any captives exchange agreement.
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich believes that the claim that Israeli captives in Gaza can be released and then ""Israel"" could go back to fighting and eliminate Hamas is ""science fiction."" The Knesset Channel quoted Smotrich as saying that he would not agree to a deal that includes a ceasefire with Hamas, adding: ""You can say that releasing the captives and going back to fighting and eliminating Hamas is science fiction."" It is worth noting that Smotrich and Israeli Police Minister Itamar Ben Gvir always urge in their extremist statements to continue fighting and continue the war with the declared aim of destroying the Gaza Strip.
Former Israeli Reserve General Yitzhak Brick has said that Israel will not be able to achieve its main war objectives of ending Hamas and its political and military capabilities or retrieving the captives, and this failure would impose on the occupation entity paying a very heavy price. US National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby told reporters earlier that US President Joe Biden ""still believes in the promise and the possibility of a two-state solution.""
The mother of Israeli soldier Ron Sherman (19 years old), who was detained by the Palestinian resistance in the  Gaza Strip , accused the Israeli army of deliberately killing her son during the assassination of the commander of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades  - the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) -  Ahmed Al-Ghandour  in Jabalia, north of sector last November. Sherman's mother said that the army knew where her son and two other hostages were being held with him, but the army chose to sacrifice him to eliminate the commander of the Hamas Northern Brigade.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz called for the opening of an independent investigation into the killing of three Israeli detainees with poison gas thrown by the Israeli army inside a tunnel in Gaza, according to what the mother of one of the detainees said. The newspaper asked, ""Did the Israeli army use poison gas in Gaza to kill people in the tunnels? And if it used such a tactic, is this legal under the laws of war to which Israel is bound?"" It continued, ""Are the lives of the hostages taken into account when making decisions about the tunnels?""

Operational Update   		        		    	Al Jazeera military and strategic expert, Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi, said that the method of managing the battle in the northern Gaza Strip differed significantly, as the defensive approach of the resistance became based on lone wolves undertaking the task of monitoring and passing information to reach movement and fire, while he described the Israeli-discovered tunnel in Khan Yunis in the south as for public service purposes.  Al-Duwairi explained that the first approach was based on large-scale attacks by pushing the Israeli  forces deep into Gaza City, but now the number has become limited at its highest level and is estimated at a brigade.   	He pointed out that the battle now boils down to a battle of movement, as the Israelis  seek to make incursions, and the speed of its movement depends on the corresponding measures taken by lone wolves distributed over more than one region. He pointed out that the mission of these wolves is to distract the invading Israeli  forces by distributing their members in a systematic manner consistent with the nature of the land, as areas have been prepared for luring and killing, adding that if the occupation forces stop and retreat, they will be closed in, and if they advance, they will be confronted.   	Regarding what was reported by the Israeli newspaper ""Yedioth Ahronoth"", 130 Israeli commanders and officers who participated in the Gaza war sent a letter to the Council of Ministers and the Chief of Staff, in which they demanded rejecting the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip before the return of the prisoners. Al-Duwairi described the step as an ""immoral barter.""   	Al-Duwairi explained that the message expresses the state of crisis that the IDF has reached, and includes the conviction that it will not be able to defeat the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) militarily, stressing that the process of systematic displacement is still at the core of Israeli plans.   	Al-Duwairi believes that the satellite images - which were broadcast by Al-Jazeera and showed small numbers of Israeli vehicles on the Gaza coastal strip - have limited implications and do not portend any future step, because they did not depict the positioning of the Israeli  army in the main areas. The military expert stated that the main body of the Israeli  forces is located in the areas not covered by the pictures, as he said that it was supposed to focus on the Gaza Valley area, where there are two brigades, and which is a concentration area for forces, as well as the eastern area of Gaza City.   	As for the video published by the Israeli  army about a tunnel it discovered in Khan Yunis in the south, which it claimed was used to detain prisoners, Al-Duwairi described the tunnel as having good finishes, but it is classified as public service tunnels and not combat and strategic tunnels. He added that this discovered tunnel does not lead to a network of branched tunnels that were built according to specific standards, and in which certain types do not overlap with other types, while he said that the Israeli march, which was controlled by the Al- Qassam Brigades - the military wing of Hamas - will be used in reverse engineering to develop the Al-Zawari and Ababil marches.   	Regarding what was reported by the Israeli media that the form of the battle in the Gaza Strip will change, Al-Duwairi pointed out that in the ongoing wars (the World War - the Vietnam War - the Afghanistan War - the Iraq War) it was necessary to make a change in the plans to fit the changes on the ground. He stressed that the Israeli  army suffered an intelligence, operational and tactical failure in Gaza, as failure was the title of the Israeli intelligence work system despite the huge size of the forces in the Gaza Strip, pointing out that the goals of the war were not achieved, stressing that the military is the one who determines the change in the form of the battle.   	As for expectations for the future of the Gaza battles, Al-Duwairi revealed that war is one of the means of politics, and the one who controls the pace of the battles is the political decision, and the military implements the political decision, which in turn seeks to prolong the war.     The Al- Quds Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement - broadcast scenes that it said were from the artillery attack on Israeli enemy concentrations, soldiers and vehicles on the frontlines of the advance in the center of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip. The video stated that after controlling an Autel Evo Max 4t reconnaissance aircraft, Al-Saraya fighters carried out an artillery take-up operation based on the important information they obtained from the controlled aircraft.   In the video broadcast by Al Jazeera, Al Saraya showed scenes from the plane, which it said was used to create three-dimensional flight paths, equipped with a laser finder to determine coordinates with high accuracy, and equipped with a high-resolution thermal imaging camera. It contains a GPS device. It also showed scenes from the aerial survey from the controlled plane and from field monitoring after analyzing the aerial survey coordinates, in addition to scenes from enemy helicopters landing to evacuate the dead and wounded.   Commenting on the scenes shown by Al Jazeera, the military and strategic expert, Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi, suggested that the plane from which the Al-Quds Brigades obtained important information did not go down, but was descended in order to obtain information. Al-Duwairi mentioned - in his daily military analysis - that the landing operation provided more than one benefit to the Palestinian resistance, first that it provided information about the locations of the  Israeli  army forces, and that the areas identified by this plane were bombed with mortars, in addition to that the resistance will benefit from these planes. In developing its capabilities for drones and others.     Fighter jets of the Air Force attacked terrorist infrastructure and observation posts of the terrorist organization Hezbollah in the area of the villages of Laida and Itarun in southern Lebanon. In addition, the IDF attacked a military structure of the organization in the Majdal Salem area. Fighter jets of the Air Force attacked a military building in the Maroon al-Ras area where terrorists from the terrorist organization Hezbollah were staying. After the attack on the building, many sub-explosions can be seen, indicating the invention of weapons on the spot. In addition, three observation posts and a military structure of the Hezbollah terrorist organization were attacked in the areas of Marvin, Shehin, Taiba and Tir-Kharfa in southern Lebanon. Also, IDF forces attacked several other areas in southern Lebanon.     The fighters of the 401st Brigade combat team destroyed a training post of the terrorist organization Hamas in Derj Tupah. The outpost had, among other things, a facility for training in an underground route, a simulator for firing mortars and a swimming pool for training in preparation for a naval raid.    		  In the battle in which the late Major David Alfasi, the late Major Ilay Levy and the late Captain Eyal Meborech Toito fell, another soldier from the 202nd Battalion, the Parachute Brigade was seriously injured. In addition, two fighters in the 603rd Engineering Battalion, 'Saar Megolan' formation (7), were seriously injured in a battle in the southern Gaza Strip. The injured were evacuated to receive medical treatment at the hospitals, their families were informed.     In recent weeks, the Kafir brigade combat team has been operating in the Khan Yunis region. During the fighting, the forces eliminated dozens of terrorists, raided dozens of terrorist infrastructures and took control of Hamas headquarters. In recent days, the battle team of the Kafir Brigade has been operating in the Kasbah in Khan Yunis in the 'Bnei Suhila' neighborhood. The forces located in the Kasbah many weapons, weapons, explosives, grenades, cartridges and rockets. In one of the raids, a home lathe that was used to create weapons was found and destroyed.   ""During the fighting, we searched considerable areas in the area of ??the Kasbah and the neighborhoods and the other locations,"" described Major General Duchifat, Lt. Col. Sahar, ""We found a military base, we found a lot of enemy infrastructure, we destroyed them all. The fighting was carried out with quite a few professional engineering forces, which In partnership, we destroyed shafts, destroyed underground infrastructure, and eliminated terrorists.""   The brigade combat team began to operate with the beginning of the maneuver in the northern area of the Gaza Strip in the neighborhood of Shajaiya and then in the south in Khan Yunis. This is the first time that the brigade is maneuvering in cooperation with the armored, air and engineering forces, working shoulder to shoulder in face-to-face battles against terrorists, above and below ground.   The fighters of the Kafir Brigade's combat team left the Gaza Strip last night for several days to refresh and improve their skills and were replaced by other forces in Khan Yunis, after which the brigade will continue operational activity according to the assessment of the situation.   As part of the activity of the battle team of the 'Yiftah' brigade in the center of the Gaza Strip, a terrorist squad that approached the forces was eliminated. Later, a number of terrorists were identified who tried to ambush the fighters in the area and in further cooperation with the Air Force, the fighters directed an aircraft that eliminated the terrorists.   In the north of the Gaza Strip, forces from the 5th Brigade Combat Team identified a squad of armed terrorists. The fighters responded by firing and killed one terrorist, directed an Air Force aircraft that killed the rest of the terrorists and a fighter plane that destroyed the military building where the squad was operating.       		    		    The Palestinian resistance confirmed the targeting of members of the Israeli army in various locations in the Gaza Strip, and Israeli Radio said that the army deepened and expanded its operations in Khan Yunis, south of the Strip. The Al -Qassam Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) - broadcast images showing an Israeli spy drone, which it said it had captured in an intelligence operation in the northern Gaza Strip.   Pictures obtained by Al Jazeera showed scenes of battles fought by Al-Qassam on the outskirts of Gaza City, and showed the brigades targeting Israeli soldiers and vehicles in the Al-Daraj and Al-Tuffah neighborhoods. The Al- Quds Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement - said that its fighters targeted, with a ""Badr 1"" missile, a gathering of  Israeli  soldiers east of the Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip. The brigades also bombed with mortar shells a site where  Israeli  soldiers are stationed, east of the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza City, and targeted an Israeli military vehicle with an RPG shell in the center of Khan Yunis.   For his part, Al Jazeera's correspondent confirmed that the resistance is confronting the  Israeli  forces with machine guns in the Sheikh Radwan and Al-Nasr neighborhoods in Gaza City, and said that violent clashes are taking place southwest of the city following an attempt by the Israeli forces to advance. The  Israeli  army announced the killing of two soldiers in battles yesterday in the Gaza Strip, bringing the total number of its deaths to 532 since the seventh of last October.   On the other hand, Israeli Radio said that the army deepened and expanded its operations in Khan Yunis, and explained that there are 7 brigades active underground and above ground in the region.   The Battle of Khan Yunis is approaching its third month without the Israeli army being able to tighten its control over the governorate, which the  Israeli  army commanders see as the most important militarily center for the resistance.   The  Israeli  forces published - earlier - pictures showing a tunnel that they said was housing prisoners in Khan Yunis, and the video clip showed the path of a tunnel extending hundreds of meters and a number of rooms, and the  Israeli  army spokesman, Daniel Hagari, announced - on Saturday - that the army had found this tunnel underneath. One of the houses in Khan Yunis, confirming that they had obtained evidence indicating that it was used to detain Israeli kidnappers at different periods, adding that the depth of the tunnel reached 20 meters, and included 5 cells and a central courtyard.   More than 50 days after the start of its ground invasion, Israeli vehicles reach the vicinity of Al-Amal Hospital, west of Khan Yunis, and Nasser Hospital, the main hospital there. As for eastern Khan Yunis, the clashes and artillery shelling did not subside for nearly two months of fighting.   Bani Suhaila was the second point of the ground incursion, specifically from the Al-Fokhari area, where Israeli vehicles entered under heavy fire cover and fire belts that burned everything, and continued their march until they reached Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Yunis. Israeli forces also penetrated from the Zinna area and from the New Abasan side until the areas east of Khan Yunis were completely separated from the areas west of the governorate. After separating Khan Yunis from the central areas of the Gaza Strip and isolating the eastern areas of the governorate from its west, Israeli forces move to completely separate Khan Yunis from Rafah, south of Gaza.   The Israeli army says that in Khan Yunis it is fighting above and below the ground, but it seems surprised by the ferocity of the resistance on the fighting fronts there, which is what Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy indicated by saying that they are fighting an enemy that has been preparing for a very long time to defend itself in a very organized manner, and that the fighting is taking place in a very complex geographical area.     The Hebrew media described what happened in Khan Yunis as a difficult event, explaining that an explosion rocked two buildings with soldiers inside. The ""Journalists Without Censorship"" channel said on ""Telegram"": ""Friends, there is a difficult event unfolding in Gaza. We write very carefully. Two buildings exploded with our force inside them. One of the buildings collapsed on a reserve battalion. So far there are definitely 8 dead, and 10 missing who have not been confirmed."" ""Identify any one of them, and 6 are trapped."" The city of Khan Yunis is witnessing violent bombardment in conjunction with the Israeli armys attempts to penetrate the city center, and the Palestinian factions confirm their continued confrontation with the army forces. The Hebrew media also described this day inside the Gaza Strip as the most brutal since the outbreak of the war.   The ""Al-Qassam Brigades"" announced on Monday that it targeted four Israeli ""Merkvah"" tanks with an ""Al-Yassin 105"" shell, and targeted an infantry force with an anti-personnel shell, leaving them dead and wounded. Al-Qassam also targeted an Israeli ""D9"" bulldozer with a ""Tandum"" shell. West of the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip.   In recent days, fighting has escalated significantly in the areas of central and southern Gaza Strip, especially in the refugee camps in central Gaza and the city of Khan Yunis, and Israeli warplanes are launching violent raids on Khan Yunis amid ground forces trying to advance deeper into it.   For their part, the Palestinian resistance factions continue their fierce fighting against the Israeli army, and announced several times during the day the killing and destruction of Israeli vehicles in the areas of the incursion into Khan Yunis.     The New York Times reported that American, British and European officials are putting pressure on Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip through the port of Ashdod. The newspaper quoted sources as saying that US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken raised this issue earlier in January during negotiations with representatives of the Israeli authorities in Tel Aviv.   According to the Western plan, the goods will be delivered from Cyprus to the port of Ashdod, and from there they will be transported to the Kerem Shalom checkpoint and to Gaza, with the aim of having a practical alternative to aid supplies via Egypt that meets Israels requirements regarding verification procedures. The newspaper indicated that the most that was achieved in this direction was Israel's agreement to allow the supply of flour to the Palestinian population via Ashdod. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, has stated on more than one occasion that the capacity of the Kerem Shalom and Rafah inspection crossings is not sufficient to meet the needs of the residents of the Palestinian Strip and solve the humanitarian catastrophe.     The Times of Israel newspaper quoted the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as categorically denying Foreign Minister Yisrael Katzs offer to displace the residents of Gaza to an artificial island, and said that what the minister offered was to build a port for Gaza on an artificial island. Media reports quoted the Israeli minister during his meeting with his counterparts in the European Union to discuss the next day after the war on Gaza, as saying on Monday: We presented the idea of an artificial island that would be an alternative homeland for the Palestinians.   The minister said that the island would be 5 kilometers from the coast of Gaza, and a port and airport could be established on it to be a commercial center similar to Singapore, as he put it. He added that Israel will control what enters and exits the island and connects it to the mainland via two bridges. Sources told Al Jazeera that some European ministers expressed their concern about this Israeli perception of displacing the Palestinians. Many ministers in Benjamin Netanyahu 's government had spoken since the beginning of the war on Gaza about the displacement of Palestinians from the Strip, and one of them said that what we are witnessing now is the ""Gaza Nakba.""     		    		  Al Jazeera's correspondent reported that the Israeli  forces continued their nightly arrest campaigns in the cities and towns of the occupied West Bank, arresting a number of young Palestinians, and others were injured as a result of being shot or subjected to severe beatings. The Israeli  forces stormed the town of Kafr Ain, north of Ramallah in the West Bank, and wounded a young Palestinian man with live ammunition during the storming operation. Local Palestinian platforms published video clips documenting the Israeli forces raiding the home of prisoner Rami Barghouti during their storming of the town.   		  Israeli  forces stormed the town of Beitunia, west of Ramallah, and local Palestinian accounts circulated scenes of the Israeli  forces' incursion into the town, and also stormed the towns of Al-Mazraa Al-Sharqiya and Silwad, east of Ramallah. The Israeli forces also stormed the town of Zawata, west of the city of Nablus in the West Bank. Local Palestinian platforms published video clips documenting this raid. They also stormed the town of Sebastia in Nablus, as well as the western neighborhood of the town of Beita, south of Nablus.   		  In Tulkarm , a young Palestinian man was shot by the Israeli forces during their storming of the Shweika suburb, north of the city. The young man was in his car trying to avoid the foot force that was patrolling the suburb, but they opened fire on him and hit him with two bullets, which led to his car swerving and colliding with an electricity pole. In Jenin, in the northern West Bank, two young Palestinians were injured after being severely beaten by Israeli  soldiers in the town of Yaabad, southwest of the city. Foot soldiers from the Israeli army also stormed the village of Faqoua, northeast of Jenin, according to local sources.   		  Also in Jenin, Al Jazeera's correspondent said that Palestinian resistance fighters opened fire on the Israeli military checkpoint in Al-Jalama, north of the city. He added that the Israeli forces stormed the village of Al-Jalama, north of Jenin, after the military checkpoint came under fire, and launched a massive combing operation to search for the resistance fighters. Meanwhile, confrontations and clashes broke out in the town of Nahalin, west of Bethlehem, where the Israeli army fired live bullets and tear gas bombs at Palestinian homes, closed shops, and sent military reinforcements to the town after Palestinian youths repelled the intrusion.   		  Palestinian accounts on social media showed video clips documenting the Israeli  forces storming of the town of Beit Ummar, north of the city of Hebron , in the southern West Bank. Al Jazeera's correspondent said that the Israeli forces also stormed the city of Al-Dhahiriya, south of Hebron, amid live bullets, and raided a number of homes, and also stormed the Al-Aroub camp, north of Hebron. The Israeli  forces also stormed the Shuafat camp, north of occupied Jerusalem , and arrested a young man from the camp. Local Palestinian platforms published a video clip documenting the arrest of the young man.   		  The Israeli police, accompanied by municipal crews and a military bulldozer, stormed the town of Silwan on Sunday afternoon, deployed in the Al-Thawri neighborhood, closed the road leading to it, and began demolishing the wall of the house without notifying the family. The Israeli forces arrested 15 Palestinians, including freed prisoners, in an operation that continued until yesterday, Sunday, in various parts of the West Bank. Among the detainees were 3 young men from the Shweiki family in the Al-Thawri neighborhood, south of Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem. The Israeli forces beat the young men while they were trying to demolish a wall surrounding their house under the pretext of opening a street surrounding the neighborhood.   		    		    		  The Lebanese Hezbollah announced the killing of two of its members and bombed several Israeli military sites. The Israeli army responded by bombing towns and villages in the south, while the majority of residents of northern Israel expressed their fear of returning to their homes. A party statement mourned Ali Saeed Yahya from the town of Taybeh in southern Lebanon, and had previously mourned Sameh Asaad Asaad, from the town of Kafr Kila in the south, who were killed in confrontations with the Israeli army in southern Lebanon, raising the number of party members killed since October 8. /Last October to 146.   		  In the context of the confrontations between Hezbollah and the Israeli army, the party said that its members targeted an Israeli army force in the Israeli Abu Dajj Heights with appropriate weapons. Hezbollah had announced, in two previous separate statements, that its members had targeted an Israeli force in the vicinity of the Zarit barracks with missile weapons, at midnight yesterday, Sunday. He also announced that his members targeted a gathering of Israeli soldiers in the vicinity of the monk site, opposite the town of Aita al-Shaab in southern Lebanon, with appropriate weapons and achieved a direct hit. The party stated that it repelled an attack by Israeli forces off the southern border, at a time when they intended to strike targets inside Lebanese territory.   		  On the other hand, the Israeli army targeted residential buildings in several towns and villages in southern Lebanon with air strikes and artillery shelling using phosphorus shells. The official Lebanese news agency reported that Israeli artillery targeted the town of Kafr Kila with phosphorous shells , amid a sweeping operation with machine guns from Metulla towards the town. It pointed out that the Israeli raid on the town of Taybeh caused major damage to the towns high school, and the high school director and members of the educational staff survived the bombing.   		  It indicated that an Israeli drone fired a missile at a residential room inside an agricultural project in the Abel al-Qamh locality, outside the town of Wazzani, without recording any casualties. An Israeli drone also fired a missile behind the ""Khiam Detention Center"" in the town of Khiam, south of Lebanon, and artillery bombed Al-Awaida Hill from the Taibe side. The agency said that this afternoon, Israeli warplanes carried out an air attack, targeting with an air strike the home of the citizen S. Yaghi in the town of Tayr Harfa, firing two air-to-surface missiles at him, causing significant damage.   		  It is noteworthy that the Israeli bombing caused the displacement of more than 83,000 Lebanese from their homes, according to data from the International Organization for Migration. The border areas in southern Lebanon have witnessed increasing security tension and an exchange of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army since the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip , where 200 people were killed on the Lebanese side, including 146 from Hezbollah and 25 civilians, including 3 journalists and two paramedics, in addition to a Lebanese soldier and 20 fighters. From the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the Islamic Jihad Movement.   		  On the Israeli side, it was announced that only 9 soldiers and 6 civilians were killed, knowing that Israel imposes military censorship on this information and no independent party can verify the accuracy of these numbers.    		  In a related context, an Israeli academic study showed that about 60% of the settlers who were evacuated from the northern regions feared returning to their homes. While about 40% of those who remained in their homes confirmed that they experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms without receiving organized psychological support from the state, according to what was reported by Israeli Channel 13. The study also showed that post-traumatic feelings increased three times among the residents of the Eastern Galilee, compared to the period before the Al-Aqsa Flood battle .   		  The publication of the study coincided with the announcement that the Israeli army was preparing a plan for the possible shelter of about 100,000 people on the northern border. The Israeli Walla website reported that the aforementioned shelter plan comes in preparation for their evacuation in light of the possible escalation. In turn, the mayor of Haifa said that the city's residents should stock up on food in the event of a war with Lebanon.   		  The deteriorating situation among Israelis in the north prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant to stress that even if Hezbollah stops its operations, Israel will not stop until the security situation on the northern border changes. Galant added, during his meeting with French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, that war with Hezbollah would be harsh on Israel and devastating for Hezbollah and Lebanon, as he put it.     	Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant hosted French Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu at the Ministry of Defense headquarters in Tel Aviv. On the northern front, he expressed gratitude to Minister Lecornu for France's commitment to altering the security dynamics in southern Lebanon. Of particular importance is the effort to push Hezbollah forces away from the border, reducing potential threats to Israel.	""A war in the north will be challenging for Israel, but devastating for Hezbollah and Lebanon. Israel will not cease fire until it can guarantee the safe return of the northern communities to their homes, following a change in the security situation along the border, Gallant declared in the meeting.     		    		       Against the background of the ongoing tensions on the northern border and the reports of an Israeli proposal for a unilateral ceasefire - the Lebanese media is in a frenzy. The editor of a newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah commented yesterday (Monday) morning on the reports about the proposal of senior officers in the north and wrote that ""things are moving towards a big war"". In the meantime, in the political system in Lebanon that does not belong to Hezbollah, there is harsh criticism of the conduct that leads to war in the country.   ""It is true that Hezbollah does not want to start a large-scale war, but that does not mean at all that it is willing to pay high prices in exchange for not entering the war,"" wrote Ibrahim Al-Amin, the editor of the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with the terrorist organization, in his article. ""This is an inevitable reaction, even if it leads to things rolling towards a major war. Therefore, the ball is back in Israel's court.""   ""The war will stop if it stops its aggression in Gaza,"" he continued. ""Otherwise, she has no choice but to exist together with the existing reality in Lebanon and the other resistance fronts. She is the one who will bear the responsibility for what will happen if she continues her stubbornness."" In his words, the editor responded to the reports published in recent days, according to which senior officers proposed to create a ""new equation"" with Hezbollah, and to initiate a unilateral 48-hour ceasefire, and if Hezbollah does not abide by it - Israel will launch an extensive campaign in the framework of which it will attack thousands of the organization's targets south of the river Litani.  In the Lebanese newspaper A-Diyar, they commented on the report and wrote that it was: ""trapped and failed from the beginning"". According to the sources in the newspaper, Hezbollah's position is ""clear and decisive"", and the organization's Secretary General Nasrallah announced that the only option is to end the war in Gaza. ""Israel violates the sovereignty in Lebanon, so the responsibility falls on both sides""   Even in the political system on behalf of Hezbollah, they responded to the reports by canceling them. ""The enemy sends threats and messages in many ways, but we are fully prepared for any possibility,"" said Hassan Fadlallah, a member of the Lebanese parliament on behalf of Hezbollah. ""All the options are on the agenda. Everything that Israel offers will not change the equation and our choice is to continue the resistance. The equation is to stop the aggression in Gaza in order to open doors to other matters.""   Other politicians in Lebanon who are not from Hezbollah, criticized the conduct of the army in the country which allowed tensions to rise. ""Hezbollah decided to open a front in support of Gaza and violated Resolution 1701,"" said the chairman of the Lebanese Phalange Party, Sami Al-Jamail. The solution is for Lebanon to restore its sovereignty and enforce the implementation of Resolution 1701 with the deployment of the army along the entire border in cooperation with UNIFIL.   ""The Unity of the Arenas is a violation of the Lebanese people's right to self-determination, and this is evidence that there is a 'team' that decides on behalf of the Lebanese that all of Lebanon should be part of a regional war led by Iran,"" he added. The chairman of the Christian Lebanese Forces party, Samir Jaja, also referred to the failed conduct of the army in the country. ""Lebanon is in the eye of the storm,"" he said. ""If the Lebanese army were deployed along the southern border, we would prevent Lebanon and its inhabitants from what is happening now"".           		    		    The field escalation continues between the Israeli forces and the Lebanese Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon, while the Israeli targeting circle appears to be expanding day after day until it exceeds a few kilometers north of the Litani River. The IDF focused its precise operations and assassinated prominent figures in Hezbollahs field cadre, most notably Hussam Tawil (Hajj Jawad), one of the leaders of the Al-Radwan Force, who was assassinated on January 8, 2024.   The  IDF  also withdrew from the Gaza Strip all elements of the 36th Division, which includes the Golani Brigade , the 188th Brigade, and the 7th Brigade of the Armored Corps, Artillery and Engineering Corps. The military correspondent for the Wala website, Amir Bouhbut, linked this to the  IDF s efforts to maintain the efficiency of the forces in light of the threats on the northern front. With Lebanon."" Although Hezbollah is balancing between maintaining the level of deterrence without going to open war, the repercussions of the  Al-Aqsa Flood  operation last October 7 reinforce the  IDFs fears of a repeat of the event on its northern front, and thus lead it towards more and more confrontation.   Talk about a possible confrontation between Hezbollah and the Israel raises many questions, perhaps the most prominent of which are related to the dangers that Tel Aviv fears during any confrontation in the north at the operational and strategic levels.   In a research paper entitled The Day After the War, the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies believes that this confrontation would impose on  Israel new and more difficult challenges than those it experienced in its ongoing war on Gaza, or in previous confrontations with Hezbollah, which will affect The nature of war if it breaks out.   Iran has exploited its growing influence in Iraq and Syria to enhance the traditional capabilities of the axis of resistance, independent of its nuclear capabilities. In recent years, this axis has become a cohesive alliance of entities with great military capabilities, spearheaded by Hezbollah and working in integrated coordination with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.   Hezbollah is considered one of the most powerful quasi-governmental organizations in the world, and in the last decade it has acquired large and diverse fire capabilities. The Institute for National Security Studies estimates Hezbollah's stock of missiles at about 150,000 short-, medium- and long-range missiles, which can cover almost all of occupied Palestine.   This threat has increased recently as a result of Hezbollah's efforts to develop a precision missile project, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea missiles, and attack drones, some of which Hezbollah revealed through its war media. The Israeli newspaper ""Jerusalem Post"" spoke of ""serious tactical errors"" that contributed to the success of Hezbollah's attacks since the start of the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" battle. It mentioned, among other things, the dilemma of anti-armor guided missiles, which the party has begun to use as a sniper weapon, while the Iron Dome is unable to intercept them, as they fly at a low altitude and in a straight line towards the target.   On the other hand, the  IDF sought to stop the growth of Hezbollah's power through the ""battle between wars"" strategy, by targeting its warehouses and supply lines through Iraq and Syria. It also focused on the assassination of the figures active in this project, most notably Sayyed Radhi Mousavi, one of the senior generals of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , who was assassinated in Damascus last month, followed by the assassination of Al-Quds Force intelligence official Haj Sadiq and his deputy in an Israeli raid on a residential building in the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus a few days ago. But it seems that this strategy has not yet prevented the party from developing and accumulating its capabilities.   Hezbollah has also made efforts to develop its ground attack options by raising the efficiency of the Radwan Force, an elite, well-trained division that includes thousands of fighters, according to the BBC. Al-Radwan gained great experience as a result of its participation alongside the Assad regime in confronting the factions of the Syrian revolution.   Despite the  IDF's discovery and destruction of many tunnels along the northern front during Operation Northern Shield in January 2019, the main mission of the ""Radwan"" fighters - according to the BBC article - is to enter the Galilee, where its main focus is, This is similar to what the Qassam elite did in the Al-Aqsa Flood. In January 2023, Hezbollah's Combat Information Unit published training scenes of the party's fighters simulating their infiltration into the occupied territories.   Iran's presence near the Syrian border with occupied Palestine, through its advisors and groups loyal to it, constituted a major strategic change. Despite the repeated targeting within the battle between wars, which enabled Israel to undermine Irans efforts to establish military bases in the Syrian arena, it did not prevent it from deploying surface-to-surface missile batteries and attack drones, as well as dozens of Iranian advisors and tens of thousands of fighters loyal to it. According to Farzin Nadimi, a researcher specializing in Iranian affairs at the Washington Institute for Studies.   This coincided with efforts made by Hezbollah, also with Iranian support, to establish sites on the outskirts of the Syrian Golan , and to form local groups affiliated with it. As well as other groups affiliated with the Palestinian resistance, which are likely behind some of the missile and drone attacks on the Golan Heights last December.   Israel fundamentally fears a multi-front war, which would involve simultaneous fighting in near and far arenas. In its war on Gaza, the  IDF is able to determine the battle axes, its primary and secondary fronts, determine its priorities, and distribute attention and resources. But in a large-scale war, he will find it difficult to control the borders and duration of the war, and if open war breaks out in the north, he will not be able to prevent Axis of Resistance groups stationed in other arenas from joining the battle.   In such a confrontation, Hezbollah, for example, will try to operate from the Syrian Golan, and pro-Iranian groups may then intervene in Syria and perhaps in western Iraq as well. In these circumstances, Iran may try to drag the Syrian regime into the fighting as well. This scenario is taken into account by the  IDF, as it conducted ground maneuvers north of the Golan Heights in July 2023, that is, 3 months before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation!   Another major challenge that Israel will face in the next war, according to the Institute for National Security Studies, is the threat posed by Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies against the Israeli home front as well, where it is expected to suffer widespread damage, at least in the first phase of the war. This damage includes Israel's vital capabilities, by striking, for example, the main  Israeli  army installations (headquarters, air force bases, reserve force mobilization centers), strategic infrastructure and vital services (sea and air ports, energy, water and transportation facilities). In addition to targeting the headquarters of the  Israeli  government, economic facilities and population centers, such tactics will aim to undermine the Israelis sense of security and ability to remain in the occupied territories.   Israel may resort to steps that are both proactive and cautious, especially since the field failure in Gaza cost its army a lot at all levels. In the face of these challenges, it will primarily maintain its current strategy to delay and disrupt the accumulation of power by Hezbollah in Lebanon and other Iranian proxies in Syria through the battle between wars. However, the failure of diplomatic efforts raises the possibility of launching a military operation inside Lebanon to reduce the level of threat posed by Hezbollah, while risking the situation deteriorating into a broader war.   On 18 January 2924, the Washington Post quoted  Israeli  Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as confirming to his American counterpart, Lloyd Austin, that Israel is approaching the point of decision-making in Lebanon as long as Hezbollah continues its attacks in the northern border region. He stressed the  Israeli  commitment to returning the settlers of the north to their homes. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority also said that Tel Aviv informed Washington that it would carry out military action in Lebanon unless the Radwan Force was removed from the border.   Despite many rational calculations that are supposed to keep Israel away from such steps, the internal crisis that Netanyahu, his government, and the leaders of the  Israeli  army are going through may push them towards reckless steps, which they believe may give them certain achievements to compensate for their failure in Gaza.     		    		    The ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" showed scenes of it launching a drone towards the port of Ashdod in Israel. The military media of the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" published a video clip showing ""scenes of it launching a drone towards the usurping Zionist entity... the port of Ashdod."" This came after the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" issued a statement in which it said that it attacked ""the port of Ashdod in the occupied territories, with drones, and the Islamic Resistance confirms its continued destruction of enemy strongholds.""   The ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" announced that ""for the third time on Monday,"" its fighters attacked the American ""Coneco"" base in Syria with missiles. Earlier, the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" confirmed that it had attacked ""a military target in the occupied Golan with drones."" It also indicated in November that it had targeted the Israeli city of Eilat. The resistance factions in Iraq had warned the United States that it would increase the number of armed operations in Syria and Iraq , in response to Washingtons continued provision of military assistance to the Israeli army, which is killing civilians in the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon.   The ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" targets American military sites and bases in Syria and Iraq, against the backdrop of the war launched by the Israeli army on the Gaza Strip and the American support that Israel receives. US Department of Defense spokesman Patrick Ryder also previously announced that the number of attacks on US military bases in Iraq and Syria has reached 130 attacks since October 17, 2023, indicating that US military bases in Iraq were subjected to 53 attacks, while bases in Syria were subjected to 77 attacks.       		      National Interest magazine said that the world is wondering how the Houthis in Yemen will respond to the series of devastating strikes launched by the United States and Britain on their targets to deter their attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. Will they, for example, target the American naval base in Djibouti?   In a report by Emily Milliken, the magazine recalled the US-British attacks aimed at weakening the Houthis capabilities and acting as a deterrent to future attacks, suggesting that the Houthis will remain able to launch naval attacks, and that these strikes will encourage them to intensify their attacks on the United States, Israel and their allies in the short term.   Shortly after the raid on the radar site, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdel Salam said that the American attack would not deter the group from targeting ships linked to Israel. Another Houthi official said that the group had drawn up a list of targets that included American bases in the region, which could include American bases in Saudi Arabia. Jordan, the Emirates, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Syria.   However, one of the obvious targets was not mentioned, which is the US Navy base Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, although it is located 80 miles from Yemen, and it is the primary base for US African Command (AFRICOM) operations in the Horn of Africa, and hosts about 4,000 soldiers from the United States. The United States and allied countries, and it has been used for operations against the Houthis for years. In addition to the Camp Lemonnier base, the Houthis - who claim to have a liquid-fueled missile with a range of up to 1,200 miles - can target the nearby Chabelle Airport, where the army has operated Predator and Reaper drones since their transfer from Lemonnier in 2013.   However, if there is something that keeps Djibouti safe from Houthi attacks - according to the writer - it is its governments fierce support for Palestine since the Al- Aqsa Flood operation on the seventh of last October and long before the attack, as the Prime Minister confirmed that Djibouti will not allow the United States The United States has decided to deploy missile launchers in the country or use it as a base for operations against the Houthis, because it considers the group's naval attacks to be ""legitimate relief for the Palestinians."" Moreover, Djibouti announced that it is reluctant to participate in the US-led naval coalition in Operation Prosperity Sentinel to fight the Houthis, and was one of the five countries that called on the International Criminal Court last November to investigate Israeli war crimes in the Palestinian territories.    Maps   All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.   	  	But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.  	Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.   	Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.            Bystanders     European Union foreign policy official Josep Borrell intends to present a plan to establish a Palestinian state, in light of Netanyahu and his ministers statements over the past few days rejecting the two-state solution . At the same time, Borrell said that the way Israel is trying to destroy Hamas is wrong and will not succeed, as he put it.   For her part, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said - before attending the European ministerial meeting - that the two-state solution is the only solution to the ongoing conflict, as she put it. She added: All those who say they do not want to hear anything about such a solution have offered no alternative, and also called for an urgent humanitarian halt to the war in Gaza.  On the other hand, the foreign ministers of Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Secretary-General of the Arab League are participating in meetings in Brussels on the sidelines of the European Union foreign ministers meeting. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi denounced the Israeli government's ""extremist racist agenda"" and said it defies the world by refusing to accept a two-state solution to end the conflict. He added, in his statements to reporters, that ""the only way out of this tragedy is the two-state solution... They are challenging the entire international community, and it is time for the world to take a stand.""  			    The European Union's diplomatic corps sent a discussion paper to member states proposing a road map for peace between the Palestinians and Israel in light of the ongoing aggression against the Gaza Strip for more than 3 months. The distribution of the internal document drawn up by Brussels' foreign affairs arm came ahead of the monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers on Monday, which this time was attended by the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the Secretary-General of the Arab League.  The meeting's talks focused mainly - according to statements by Union officials - on the repercussions of the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" battle launched by the Palestinian resistance on settlements in the Gaza Strip on October 7, the ongoing Israeli war on the Strip since that date, and other files such as the Ukraine war. The 12-point plan calls for a preparatory conference for peace organized by the European Union, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the League of Arab States, while also inviting the United States and the United Nations to participate in its holding.  The conference will be held ""even if the Israelis or Palestinians refuse to participate."" But the document also indicates that both parties will be consulted at every step of the talks as delegates seek to develop a peace plan. It is unrealistic to assume that Israelis and Palestinians will participate directly in bilateral peace negotiations in the near future, the document stated. Instead, the EU proposed parallel talks with the United States, the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League, and the document threatened consequences against Israel if it refused to participate.  The document, which was distributed to European capitals, says that the Palestinians will need a renewed political alternative to Hamas , while the Israelis will need to find the political will to participate in meaningful negotiations towards a two-state solution. According to the document, Therefore, it is the responsibility of external actors such as the European Union to assist the parties to the conflict by paving the way for comprehensive peace.  The proposed peace plan stressed that ""there is no comprehensive and reliable solution other than the establishment of an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel."" It added, ""One of the core elements of the peace plan must be the development of strong security guarantees for Israel and the future independent state of Palestine, conditional on full mutual diplomatic recognition and integration of both Israel and Palestine into the region.""  The internal document indicated that the Union would move forward with peace talks to end the war in the Gaza Strip even without Israels participation. The document says EU member states must be prepared to ""identify the consequences they intend to attach to participation or non-participation in the peace plan."" The document did not mention what these consequences are, at a time when the European Union has several potential aspects of influence.  The European Union is a major provider of economic aid to the Palestinians, and has a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Israel that includes a free trade zone. Some officials privately suggested that this could be used to influence Tel Aviv, according to Reuters.    Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, participated in a meeting hosted by the European Union foreign ministers in Brussels in the presence of Josep Borrell, the High Representative for European Foreign Policy, and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.  Aboul Gheit, said that the meeting  between the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, with the foreign ministers of the European Union, confirmed the existence of a great convergence of views. Aboul Gheit: There is a great convergence of views with the European Union regarding the rapid transition to a political path to a two-state solution""Axios"": Biden seeks to normalize Israeli-Saudi relations on the condition of establishing a Palestinian state  In his account on the X platform, Ahmed Aboul Gheit wrote after the meeting: The meeting today between the (foreign) ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and the Secretary-General, with the foreign ministers of the European Union, confirmed the existence of a great convergence of views, not only about the necessity of... Stopping the Israeli war on Gaza, but also about the necessity of a rapid transition to a political path that leads to the implementation of the two-state solution without wasting years as happened in the past. We will need more dialogue at different levels to reach the required Arab-European consensus.  The official spokesman for the Secretary-General, Jamal Rushdi, stated that the meeting addressed the necessity of working immediately to stop the aggressive Israeli war on the Gaza Strip and deal with the effects of the humanitarian catastrophe that the residents of the Strip are experiencing. The spokesman explained that the meeting witnessed broad agreement between the Arab and European sides that the two-state solution remains the only way to settle the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and that every attempt to delay the implementation of this solution or evade it exposes the security and stability of the region to danger.  The spokesman added that Aboul Gheit, along with the Arab ministers, listened to some serious European ideas for launching a credible peace process based on the two-state solution, and reaching a final settlement based on implementing this solution, by ending the occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. The spokesman quoted Aboul Gheit as saying that many European ideas contain positive aspects regarding the political horizon required to end the conflict, and that what is required now is to combine words with action, calling on European countries to take a necessary initial step, which is to recognize the Palestinian state.  In a related context, Rushdi explained that Aboul Gheit met on the sidelines of the European meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tiani, where the latter listened to the vision of the Secretary-General of the Arab League for the situation in Gaza and the necessity of stopping the war and launching a political path leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The two parties also expressed their deep concern. Regarding the state of escalation in the region, especially in the Red Sea.    Axis of Resistance   Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian commented on the possibility of the Gaza war expanding amid the tensions that the region has witnessed recently, such as the mutual bombing with Pakistan and the tense situation in southern Lebanon and in the Red Sea. In an interview with CNN, the interviewer said: In a previous interview we conducted with you on October 29... you said that you do not want the war to expand and do not want escalation. Since then, Hezbollah has launched attacks against Israel, and the Houthis are attacking... Ships in the Red Sea. You attacked Iraq , and you attacked Pakistan . It certainly seems that the actions of Iran and its allies do not indicate that you are trying to prevent this war from expanding. It seems that you are encouraging escalation.  Hussein Amir Abdullahian replied, saying: I agree with you...in West Asia now we are witnessing the expansion of the crisis and tensions, but the roots of these tensions are not what happened on October 7th. Hamas is a Palestinian liberation group fighting against the occupation in order to liberate the lands of Palestine. The occupiers, they carried out an operation... Of course we do not approve of the killing of women and children anywhere in the world, but I want to tell you that the roots of that are not what happened on October 7th... The roots of that go back 75 years when the Israeli regime occupied Palestine, Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation. He added: ""We warned that if the attacks, war crimes and genocide against Gaza and the West Bank do not stop, the war will expand and become more comprehensive, and this does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion.""  Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian confirmed that ""the activity of Iranian military advisors in combating terrorism and securing the region will continue strongly."" This is after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard confirmed the killing of 5 Iranian military advisors in Syria, the fifth of whom died of his wounds following the Israeli attack on Saturday morning on Damascus. The Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip and clashes between the Israeli army and Hamas continue for the 118th day, in light of a humanitarian and health catastrophe in the Strip.    Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said the Zionist regime has resorted to blind assassination attacks to compensate for its failure in achieving the objectives of the war on Gaza. In a meeting in Tehran on Sunday, Amirabdollahian and the head of the parliamentary friendship group of Kuwait and Iran, Marzouq Al-Hubaini, discussed a range of regional issues and bilateral cooperation.  The Iranian foreign minister praised the position and role of the Kuwaiti parliament and government in supporting the oppressed Palestinian nation. Evaluating the current developments and events in Gaza, he pointed to the continuation of the Zionist regime's criminal actions in killing women, children, and the defenseless people of Palestine. ""Although the Zionist enemy has destroyed Gaza on a large scale and martyred tens of thousands of people, it has not achieved any of its goals. So, it tries to compensate for its failure by resorting to blind terrorist actions,"" Amirabdollahian noted, the Foreign Ministrys website reported.  			    The Israeli regimes crimes against Iran wont go unpunished, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Asked about the Israeli assassination of Iranian military advisers in Syria, Kanaani said at a presser on Monday, The usurping Zionist regimes crimes against the Iranian government have never gone and wont go unpunished. The spokesman warned that Iran will respond to the Israeli crimes in its own way.  Dismissing the Israeli prime ministers threat of military action against Iran, he said such rhetoric reveals the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and the degree of the threats that it poses to regional and world security. The essence of this (Israeli) regime is in contradiction to peace. This regime has always tried to seize every opportunity to promote insecurity in the region and the world, he stated. The spokesman refuted Netanyahus hollow rhetoric, reaffirmed Irans right to respond to the threats, and said the Zionist regime had better think about survival from the quagmire of Gaza.			     Allied for Democracy Israeli officials and analysts agree - in their discussions of the repercussions of the war on the Gaza Strip - in their rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state, in a position identical to the position of their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who contradicted the American desire in this context.   	Gideon Sa'ar, a minister in the War Council, spoke of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying, ""It is not possible to establish a demilitarized Palestinian state unless Israel has security control, as it does in the West Bank and intends to do in the Gaza Strip."" He added in a discussion session on Israeli Channel 14, The lands that we hand over to the Palestinians will become a base for aggression against Israel. The minister revealed that when he took the decision to unite between his New Hope party and the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz,  they had a clear agreement to reject the establishment of a state. Palestinian.  	According to Michael Sheams, a political affairs correspondent for Channel 11, the Prime Minister is using the story of the Palestinian state as a kind of political campaign, stressing that large sectors of Israelis oppose the establishment of this state. Gil Tamari, Channel 13's international news editor, explained that US President Joe Biden bypasses Netanyahu, and directly tells the Israeli public, ""I'm offering you a dream plan,"" which means, ""You get a big reward now and you pay the price at some point in the future.""  	He added, ""What is the return? Complete normalization with Saudi Arabia and 6 additional Muslim countries, and an unprecedented security umbrella that Israel will enjoy? The price will be a declaration of intent that will lead to a future path to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be demilitarized and without an army."" He commented, saying, ""This is what the Americans are proposing to the Israeli public because they realize that Netanyahu is not a partner.""  	As for the journalist on Channel 12, he believed that even if Gantz (a minister in the War Council) became prime minister, it would be difficult for him to provide the American president with a response other than that offered by Netanyahu, which is that the chances of establishing a Palestinian state are non-existent. Netanyahu had previously revealed that he had informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any post-war scenario in Gaza, contrary to the American desire.    		            		  		  		  		  According to Arab observers and experts, Benjamin Netanyahu s government failed to neutralize Israels economy and spare it losses like previous wars, especially since the area that caused the Al-Aqsa flood battle ( the Gaza envelope ) is responsible for supplying the Israeli economy with about 75% of the agricultural crops that the occupation needs, but the war It transformed it from an agricultural area into a closed military area.  The Jordanian economist, Dr. Amer Al-Shobaki, painted a bleak picture of the reality and future of the Israeli economy in light of the continuation of the war on the Gaza Strip. He said in his interview with Al-Jazeera Net that the total direct and indirect economic losses of the occupation in its war - which it has been waging against Gaza since the seventh of last October - It reached 165 billion dollars.  Al-Shoubaki added that what is announced by Israel is a small part of the real military losses. The operational cost of this war has reached 280 million dollars per day, the equivalent of 28 billion dollars in the first 100 days of the battle, in addition to the cost of the military vehicles that the resistance announced had been destroyed. Which exceed a thousand armored vehicles and tanks, and these are military losses that the occupation has not announced yet.    Al-Shoubaki summarizes the occupations losses in its war on Gaza as emptying many sectors of Israeli workers, so that they become reserve soldiers in the Israeli army, and their number exceeds 300 thousand employees working in various vital sectors, the most important of which is the technology sector, which supplies Israel with half of its exports, and this sector has suffered losses exceeding 20 billion dollars. Foreign investments became idle as a result of the war on Gaza, causing huge losses, reaching $15 billion, which takes a long time to recover, in addition to stopping the tourism sector, which was damaged - according to what was announced - by 75%, and this sector was generating approximately 20%. Billion dollars to the Israeli treasury annually.  Sheltering and compensating families displaced as a result of the war in the Gaza Strip and in the northern border areas with Lebanon, whose number is estimated at one million settlers, currently living in 280 hotels. This requires huge sums of no less than $10 billion, and compensating them for their commercial and industrial losses that they suffered as a result of the war. Compensating and treating war-wounded civilians and war-wounded soldiers, in addition to compensating the families of dead soldiers, treating the wounded and disabled as a result of the war, and compensating those whose homes were damaged as a result of being hit by Palestinian resistance missiles and Hezbollah missiles, which increases additional costs to the occupation treasury. In the short and long term.  The migration of more than 400,000 Israelis - so far - who hold dual nationalities to the European and American continents, which is reflected in a decrease in government and taxpayer revenues. The loss of Palestinian labor in the construction sector in the territories occupied in 1948, and the flight of Thai labor in agricultural facilities around the Gaza Strip for fear of war, which adds new burdens to the Israeli economy, as a result of the complete cessation of this vital sector.  The navigation crisis continues in the Red Sea, with the Houthi group preventing ships coming towards Israel, or Israeli ones, from sailing through Bab al-Mandab, which has stopped maritime traffic in the Israeli port of Eilat by 95%. The occupation has also become dependent on ships coming from the Mediterranean, which has raised the cost of shipping and caused a sharp rise in the prices of consumer goods and vehicle prices within the occupying state.  The chief economist of the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Shmuel Abramson, expected that the economy would contract by 1.5% if the war on Gaza continued until the end of the current year, after he had expected growth of 2.7% for the year 2024 before the start of the war, according to a report carried by the Israeli economic newspaper Globes.  Economic expert Hossam Ayesh did not stray far from Al-Shoubaki, as he confirmed that Israel did not plan for its war on the Gaza Strip to extend for more than 100 days, because the occupation suffered huge losses on the economic level due to the war, and entered into a real dilemma as a result of the high debts it needs to spend on. Military operations, in addition to its suffering from a severe budget deficit due to the decline in revenues, which means that its credit rating declined from stable to negative, with expectations that it will face a government deficit of 5.3% during the years 2023 and 2024, given the large defense spending imposed by the war.  Ayesh told Al Jazeera Net: ""The economic, military and technological damage incurred by the occupation during the past 100 days exceeded 100 billion dollars, adding that the more the war increased, the greater the percentage of loss."" He continues that the technology sector, which represents the backbone of the Israeli economy - due to its superiority in this field - has begun to decline, noting that tax revenues related to this sector have declined by 80%. Ayesh said, ""The Israeli military reserve called up a large portion of the workers in this sector, accompanied by the state of uncertainty resulting from this war, and all of this has caused particularly heavy losses.""  Earlier, the Accountant General of the Israeli Finance Department, Eli Rotenberg, expected that the proportion of public debt would increase to 62.1% of the gross domestic product in 2023 as a result of the financial repercussions of this war, after expectations indicated a decline of 1% on an annual basis to 59% before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation. According to Globes newspaper. Official data also showed that the budget deficit is expected to rise from 2.25% to 6.6% of GDP during the current year.  According to these data, the financial impact of the war is estimated at about 150 billion shekels ($40.25 billion) for the period 2023-2024, assuming the war ends in the first quarter of this year.  The economic expert, Ayesh, pointed out that the Netanyahu government is hiding the truth about its economic losses in order not to disrupt the course of the battle in the Gaza Strip. However, the Western media - especially the American ones - recently published the truth about the losses that the occupation has incurred since more than 100 days of aggression against the Gaza Strip. This comes - according to Ayesh - despite the fact that Israels budget for the year 2023 - before the war - amounted to 130 billion dollars, which is the largest budget in its history. However, with the outbreak of the war, it was forced to approve an additional budget of 8.1 billion dollars, to meet the wars military needs. Which will lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.7% of GDP last year, then to 5% in 2024.  He explained that although the Central Bank of Israel allocated $45 billion to protect the shekels exchange rate, its value deteriorated, recording the longest series of losses in 39 years, while the Central Banks loss amounted to $7.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves. It is noteworthy that the Governor of the Central Bank of Israel had estimated the cost of the war on Gaza at about 210 billion shekels ($56 billion) for defense and compensation for those displaced from their homes in the south, due to Palestinian resistance operations, or the north, due to the missiles targeting them from Lebanon.    		  		  		  The  center-left French newspaper Liberation, a newspaper of record in France, said that protests are increasing in Israel 3 and a half months after the start of the war on Gaza , and that the opposition has begun its preparations in conjunction with calls from more Israelis to hold early elections in the hope of ousting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The newspaper - in a report by its correspondent from Tel Aviv, Nicolas Roger - began by criticizing former General Gadi Eisenkot - a member of the war cabinet - publicly and surprisingly of Netanyahus policies, saying: What is happening in Gaza today is that the goals of the war have not been achieved, those who talk about... The complete defeat of Hamas . They are not telling the truth. He added, No, when the journalist asked him, Are the decision makers honest with the public?  Eisenkot's comments sparked some criticism, but the former chief of staff cannot be touched, because his son and nephew were killed in Gaza, and he is more capable than others - as the correspondent believes - of understanding the reality and repercussions of Israeli military actions. Therefore, when Eisenkot says that elections are necessary in the coming months, it is a clear message that the opposition will not wait for the end of the war, which will be long - as Netanyahu promised - to force the country to go to the polls.  The correspondent explained that the Prime Minister is trapped in what appears to be a growing turmoil reminiscent of the months preceding last October 7, from protests by hostage families in front of his house to thousands of people demanding his departure in the streets of Tel Aviv, in addition to the torrent of criticism of the new budget.  On the main street that surrounds Tel Aviv from the east, new billboards say, We need elections, in a campaign that appears expensive and of unknown origin. In the background - as the reporter sees - there are veterans who participated in the demonstrations against judicial reform and a number of people from Technology.  Ronen Koehler of the Brothers in Arms leadership believes that there is no point in the campaign as long as Benny Gantz is still in government, adding, What we want is to rebuild the democratic space by encouraging our members to join civil life. Our liberal secular values ??must return. To the forefront and fight for the hearts of Israelis. It is an ambitious project - according to the correspondent - and it is almost ideal to reverse what the extreme Israeli settler right has done over the past 15 years to the point that, although it represents only 5% of the population - as Kohler insists - it has become the one that determines the content of political debate, even in times of war.  As for Netanyahu and his partners, they launched their election campaigns early last December, while the opposition was very late, despite the great anger at Netanyahu, whose opinion polls indicate his loss every time, even though he is the only one who proposes a simple and coherent project for the next day, according to the correspondent. He confirms that there is no going back. To the world before October 7, and therefore no concessions to the Palestinians who are being killed in Gaza.  The reporter concluded that Benny Gantz is the one who will become prime minister if the elections are held today, and he will be at the head of a warlike right-wing government without a clear political project, which indicates that the Israeli opposition still believes that getting rid of Netanyahu will change everything, and that this is the key to a new beginning.     While the Guardian newspaper ruled out the success of attempts to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) and its leaders in the Gaza Strip , the Independent newspaper wrote about clear rifts between Israel and its allies, the United States and Britain. As part of their coverage of developments in the war in the Gaza Strip, international newspapers and magazines focused on the ongoing debate regarding the future of the Gaza Strip, and the disputes it creates between Israel and its allies, in addition to US-Iranian relations in light of the current developments.  While ruling out the success of attempts to eliminate Hamas and its leaders, an article in The Guardian newspaper expects that Israel's plans regarding the future of the Strip will lead to the movement's continued activity, ""which may shift to other arenas that Hamas has been avoiding, and thus its danger will not diminish."" The author of the article believes that ""the most realistic solution is to think about how to integrate Hamas into the authority that governs Gaza after the war, instead of thinking about eradicating it.""  For its part, The Independent newspaper focused on the ""clear rifts"" between Israel and its allies the United States and Britain, which are reflected in officials' statements regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. The newspaper wrote that the rifts come at a time when the voices of thousands of Israelis are rising, demanding the liberation of those detained by the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and the holding of new elections, and amid clear divisions within the War Council over the future of the conflict and post-war plans in Gaza.  For its part, other newspapers and magazines discussed the issue of US-Iranian relations, as The Economist magazine wrote that the attacks and assassinations bring the two countries closer to war. The magazine expects that pressure will increase on US President Joe Biden ""to respond to Iran and its agents in the Middle East so that America does not appear weak... He then risks entering a new war in the election year."" In the same context, Le Monde newspaper published a lengthy investigation in which it stated that the United States, along with other powers, is today paying the price for its neglect of the Houthis growing capabilities, so that they have turned today into active players in the conflict in the Middle East.        Writer Owen Jones in The Guardian newspaper said that Western political and media elites are complicit in the Gaza nightmare , and that they have lost the last vestiges of moral authority forever. The writer explained that US President Joe Biden gave a specific answer last week in the statement he issued on the occasion of the 100th day since the start of the current terror, in which he showed his true sympathy with the plight of the prisoners of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and with their shocked families, but he did not issue a response. There is no mention of the Palestinians about him.  However, the lack of interest by politicians and the media in concealing their contempt for Palestinian life will have major consequences, even though it is not a new thing, as the writer believes; If the powerful countries of the world had not so impudently ignored three quarters of a million Palestinians who were expelled from their homes 76 years ago, with about 15,000 of them violently killed, the seeds of this bitter harvest would not have been sown today.  Owen Jones wondered how many people knew that 234 Palestinians were killed last year, just before October 7, by Israeli forces in the West Bank alone. He continued that if there was some value to the lives of Palestinians, perhaps decades of occupation, siege, illegal settlement, apartheid, violent repression and mass massacres would not have occurred.  Some may have expected that after this deadly massacre, the dam would eventually collapse, because violently killing 10,000 children, amputating legs, or removing the kidneys of others without anesthesia would arouse strong feelings, just as performing caesarean sections without anesthesia and the death of premature infants due to low blood pressure. Body heat and diarrhea would provoke unstoppable disgust.  Although predictions that a quarter of Gaza's population might die within a year due to Israel's destruction of the health care system alone should lead to a loud call to end this injustice, no one has taken action. According to the writer, underestimating the value of Palestinian life is not a hypothetical matter, but rather a statistical fact, as a new study of coverage in major American newspapers says that Israeli deaths are mentioned at a rate of 16 times more than Palestinian deaths, and that human terms such as mother or husband were used much less often to describe Palestinians, while emotional terms such as ""massacre"" were used for Israeli victims.  All of this will have a profound impact, as the writer sees; We must forget any future Western claims regarding human rights and international law, because a large part of the world views this self-justification with contempt, and considers it merely a trick to advance the strategic interests of countries that have become rich at the expense of the rest of the world, after centuries of colonialism characterized by genocide and pigeons. Recent bloodshed such as the Iraq War, and even arming and supporting Israel as it engages in mass murder in Gaza.  He continued that Western political and media elites should not panic about the condition of other countries, but rather about the moral collapse occurring in their countries, because the refusal to treat the Palestinians as human beings has made todays nightmare inevitable, and has permanently torn apart the moral claims used to justify Western hegemony over the world. Consequences that will not be understood until it is too late.      A report on the British University of Portsmouth website confirmed that former US President Donald Trump's victory for a second term in the upcoming presidential elections will mean a return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan ""America First."" The report explained that if Trump wins a second term in the upcoming presidential elections , it is unlikely that Joe Biden will continue attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza, as Trump has been a long-time ally of Israel and has become the first American president to officially and controversially recognize Jerusalem as its capital. In 2017.  It added that Trump will return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan America First, which means withdrawing from military spending and paying attention to internal affairs, which means stopping the free flow of money and weapons from the United States and its proxy wars in Ukraine. A potential Republican candidate winning a second term would have disastrous effects on international diplomacy, according to Le Monde columnist Sylvie Kaufmann: The G7 and NATO summits will once again turn into unpredictable circus moments.   The report added, In continuation of the focus of his first presidency, Trump pledged to transfer thousands of American troops stationed abroad, FBI agents, and Drug Enforcement Administration officials to address the migration crisis on the Mexican border, and this will not only affect the American military presence in various parts of the world. ""It will also have a devastating impact on Mexico, which will have to deal with an increasingly problematic border with the United States.""  The report continued, ""One important difference this time is that Trump and his allies have been planning his next term since he left the White House. He will be surrounded exclusively by his loyalists, will be free from any constrained rational voices, and will be more organized than his first term, so he is unlikely to continue... Trump and Biden's attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza.  The report noted, ""Although much of the concern is focused on Trump's potential re-election, his two main rivals for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, have identified support for aggressive immigration policies and support for Israel as key goals if they win.""    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th was 198, and 534 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of October. Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	     	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address

Al Jazeera military and strategic expert, Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi, said that the method of managing the battle in the northern Gaza Strip differed significantly, as the defensive approach of the resistance became based on lone wolves undertaking the task of monitoring and passing information to reach movement and fire, while he described the Israeli-discovered tunnel in Khan Yunis in the south as for public service purposes.  Al-Duwairi explained that the first approach was based on large-scale attacks by pushing the Israeli  forces deep into Gaza City, but now the number has become limited at its highest level and is estimated at a brigade.
He pointed out that the battle now boils down to a battle of movement, as the Israelis  seek to make incursions, and the speed of its movement depends on the corresponding measures taken by lone wolves distributed over more than one region. He pointed out that the mission of these wolves is to distract the invading Israeli  forces by distributing their members in a systematic manner consistent with the nature of the land, as areas have been prepared for luring and killing, adding that if the occupation forces stop and retreat, they will be closed in, and if they advance, they will be confronted.
Regarding what was reported by the Israeli newspaper ""Yedioth Ahronoth"", 130 Israeli commanders and officers who participated in the Gaza war sent a letter to the Council of Ministers and the Chief of Staff, in which they demanded rejecting the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip before the return of the prisoners. Al-Duwairi described the step as an ""immoral barter.""
Al-Duwairi explained that the message expresses the state of crisis that the IDF has reached, and includes the conviction that it will not be able to defeat the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) militarily, stressing that the process of systematic displacement is still at the core of Israeli plans.
Al-Duwairi believes that the satellite images - which were broadcast by Al-Jazeera and showed small numbers of Israeli vehicles on the Gaza coastal strip - have limited implications and do not portend any future step, because they did not depict the positioning of the Israeli  army in the main areas. The military expert stated that the main body of the Israeli  forces is located in the areas not covered by the pictures, as he said that it was supposed to focus on the Gaza Valley area, where there are two brigades, and which is a concentration area for forces, as well as the eastern area of Gaza City.
As for the video published by the Israeli  army about a tunnel it discovered in Khan Yunis in the south, which it claimed was used to detain prisoners, Al-Duwairi described the tunnel as having good finishes, but it is classified as public service tunnels and not combat and strategic tunnels. He added that this discovered tunnel does not lead to a network of branched tunnels that were built according to specific standards, and in which certain types do not overlap with other types, while he said that the Israeli march, which was controlled by the Al- Qassam Brigades - the military wing of Hamas - will be used in reverse engineering to develop the Al-Zawari and Ababil marches.
Regarding what was reported by the Israeli media that the form of the battle in the Gaza Strip will change, Al-Duwairi pointed out that in the ongoing wars (the World War - the Vietnam War - the Afghanistan War - the Iraq War) it was necessary to make a change in the plans to fit the changes on the ground. He stressed that the Israeli  army suffered an intelligence, operational and tactical failure in Gaza, as failure was the title of the Israeli intelligence work system despite the huge size of the forces in the Gaza Strip, pointing out that the goals of the war were not achieved, stressing that the military is the one who determines the change in the form of the battle.
As for expectations for the future of the Gaza battles, Al-Duwairi revealed that war is one of the means of politics, and the one who controls the pace of the battles is the political decision, and the military implements the political decision, which in turn seeks to prolong the war.
The Al- Quds Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement - broadcast scenes that it said were from the artillery attack on Israeli enemy concentrations, soldiers and vehicles on the frontlines of the advance in the center of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip. The video stated that after controlling an Autel Evo Max 4t reconnaissance aircraft, Al-Saraya fighters carried out an artillery take-up operation based on the important information they obtained from the controlled aircraft.
In the video broadcast by Al Jazeera, Al Saraya showed scenes from the plane, which it said was used to create three-dimensional flight paths, equipped with a laser finder to determine coordinates with high accuracy, and equipped with a high-resolution thermal imaging camera. It contains a GPS device. It also showed scenes from the aerial survey from the controlled plane and from field monitoring after analyzing the aerial survey coordinates, in addition to scenes from enemy helicopters landing to evacuate the dead and wounded.
Commenting on the scenes shown by Al Jazeera, the military and strategic expert, Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi, suggested that the plane from which the Al-Quds Brigades obtained important information did not go down, but was descended in order to obtain information. Al-Duwairi mentioned - in his daily military analysis - that the landing operation provided more than one benefit to the Palestinian resistance, first that it provided information about the locations of the  Israeli  army forces, and that the areas identified by this plane were bombed with mortars, in addition to that the resistance will benefit from these planes. In developing its capabilities for drones and others.

The forces located in the Kasbah many weapons, weapons, explosives, grenades, cartridges and rockets. In one of the raids, a home lathe that was used to create weapons was found and destroyed.
""During the fighting, we searched considerable areas in the area of ??the Kasbah and the neighborhoods and the other locations,"" described Major General Duchifat, Lt. Col. Sahar, ""We found a military base, we found a lot of enemy infrastructure, we destroyed them all. The fighting was carried out with quite a few professional engineering forces, which In partnership, we destroyed shafts, destroyed underground infrastructure, and eliminated terrorists.""
The brigade combat team began to operate with the beginning of the maneuver in the northern area of the Gaza Strip in the neighborhood of Shajaiya and then in the south in Khan Yunis. This is the first time that the brigade is maneuvering in cooperation with the armored, air and engineering forces, working shoulder to shoulder in face-to-face battles against terrorists, above and below ground.
The fighters of the Kafir Brigade's combat team left the Gaza Strip last night for several days to refresh and improve their skills and were replaced by other forces in Khan Yunis, after which the brigade will continue operational activity according to the assessment of the situation.
As part of the activity of the battle team of the 'Yiftah' brigade in the center of the Gaza Strip, a terrorist squad that approached the forces was eliminated. Later, a number of terrorists were identified who tried to ambush the fighters in the area and in further cooperation with the Air Force, the fighters directed an aircraft that eliminated the terrorists.

The Battle of Khan Yunis is approaching its third month without the Israeli army being able to tighten its control over the governorate, which the  Israeli  army commanders see as the most important militarily center for the resistance.
The  Israeli  forces published - earlier - pictures showing a tunnel that they said was housing prisoners in Khan Yunis, and the video clip showed the path of a tunnel extending hundreds of meters and a number of rooms, and the  Israeli  army spokesman, Daniel Hagari, announced - on Saturday - that the army had found this tunnel underneath.

Israeli forces also penetrated from the Zinna area and from the New Abasan side until the areas east of Khan Yunis were completely separated from the areas west of the governorate. After separating Khan Yunis from the central areas of the Gaza Strip and isolating the eastern areas of the governorate from its west, Israeli forces move to completely separate Khan Yunis from Rafah, south of Gaza.
The Israeli army says that in Khan Yunis it is fighting above and below the ground, but it seems surprised by the ferocity of the resistance on the fighting fronts there, which is what Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy indicated by saying that they are fighting an enemy that has been preparing for a very long time to defend itself in a very organized manner, and that the fighting is taking place in a very complex geographical area.

For their part, the Palestinian resistance factions continue their fierce fighting against the Israeli army, and announced several times during the day the killing and destruction of Israeli vehicles in the areas of the incursion into Khan Yunis.
The New York Times reported that American, British and European officials are putting pressure on Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip through the port of Ashdod. The newspaper quoted sources as saying that US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken raised this issue earlier in January during negotiations with representatives of the Israeli authorities in Tel Aviv.
According to the Western plan, the goods will be delivered from Cyprus to the port of Ashdod, and from there they will be transported to the Kerem Shalom checkpoint and to Gaza, with the aim of having a practical alternative to aid supplies via Egypt that meets Israels requirements regarding verification procedures. The newspaper indicated that the most that was achieved in this direction was Israel's agreement to allow the supply of flour to the Palestinian population via Ashdod. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, has stated on more than one occasion that the capacity of the Kerem Shalom and Rafah inspection crossings is not sufficient to meet the needs of the residents of the Palestinian Strip and solve the humanitarian catastrophe.
The Times of Israel newspaper quoted the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as categorically denying Foreign Minister Yisrael Katzs offer to displace the residents of Gaza to an artificial island, and said that what the minister offered was to build a port for Gaza on an artificial island. Media reports quoted the Israeli minister during his meeting with his counterparts in the European Union to discuss the next day after the war on Gaza, as saying on Monday: We presented the idea of an artificial island that would be an alternative homeland for the Palestinians.
The minister said that the island would be 5 kilometers from the coast of Gaza, and a port and airport could be established on it to be a commercial center similar to Singapore, as he put it. He added that Israel will control what enters and exits the island and connects it to the mainland via two bridges. Sources told Al Jazeera that some European ministers expressed their concern about this Israeli perception of displacing the Palestinians. Many ministers in Benjamin Netanyahu 's government had spoken since the beginning of the war on Gaza about the displacement of Palestinians from the Strip, and one of them said that what we are witnessing now is the ""Gaza Nakba.""

The Israeli Walla website reported that the aforementioned shelter plan comes in preparation for their evacuation in light of the possible escalation. In turn, the mayor of Haifa said that the city's residents should stock up on food in the event of a war with Lebanon.
The deteriorating situation among Israelis in the north prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant to stress that even if Hezbollah stops its operations, Israel will not stop until the security situation on the northern border changes. Galant added, during his meeting with French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, that war with Hezbollah would be harsh on Israel and devastating for Hezbollah and Lebanon, as he put it.
Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant hosted French Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu at the Ministry of Defense headquarters in Tel Aviv. On the northern front, he expressed gratitude to Minister Lecornu for France's commitment to altering the security dynamics in southern Lebanon. Of particular importance is the effort to push Hezbollah forces away from the border, reducing potential threats to Israel.	""A war in the north will be challenging for Israel, but devastating for Hezbollah and Lebanon. Israel will not cease fire until it can guarantee the safe return of the northern communities to their homes, following a change in the security situation along the border, Gallant declared in the meeting.
Against the background of the ongoing tensions on the northern border and the reports of an Israeli proposal for a unilateral ceasefire - the Lebanese media is in a frenzy. The editor of a newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah commented yesterday (Monday) morning on the reports about the proposal of senior officers in the north and wrote that ""things are moving towards a big war"". In the meantime, in the political system in Lebanon that does not belong to Hezbollah, there is harsh criticism of the conduct that leads to war in the country.
""It is true that Hezbollah does not want to start a large-scale war, but that does not mean at all that it is willing to pay high prices in exchange for not entering the war,"" wrote Ibrahim Al-Amin, the editor of the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with the terrorist organization, in his article. ""This is an inevitable reaction, even if it leads to things rolling towards a major war. Therefore, the ball is back in Israel's court.""
""The war will stop if it stops its aggression in Gaza,"" he continued. ""Otherwise, she has no choice but to exist together with the existing reality in Lebanon and the other resistance fronts. She is the one who will bear the responsibility for what will happen if she continues her stubbornness."" In his words, the editor responded to the reports published in recent days, according to which senior officers proposed to create a ""new equation"" with Hezbollah, and to initiate a unilateral 48-hour ceasefire, and if Hezbollah does not abide by it - Israel will launch an extensive campaign in the framework of which it will attack thousands of the organization's targets south of the river Litani.  In the Lebanese newspaper A-Diyar, they commented on the report and wrote that it was: ""trapped and failed from the beginning"". According to the sources in the newspaper, Hezbollah's position is ""clear and decisive"", and the organization's Secretary General Nasrallah announced that the only option is to end the war in Gaza. ""Israel violates the sovereignty in Lebanon, so the responsibility falls on both sides""
Even in the political system on behalf of Hezbollah, they responded to the reports by canceling them. ""The enemy sends threats and messages in many ways, but we are fully prepared for any possibility,"" said Hassan Fadlallah, a member of the Lebanese parliament on behalf of Hezbollah. ""All the options are on the agenda. Everything that Israel offers will not change the equation and our choice is to continue the resistance. The equation is to stop the aggression in Gaza in order to open doors to other matters.""
Other politicians in Lebanon who are not from Hezbollah, criticized the conduct of the army in the country which allowed tensions to rise. ""Hezbollah decided to open a front in support of Gaza and violated Resolution 1701,"" said the chairman of the Lebanese Phalange Party, Sami Al-Jamail. The solution is for Lebanon to restore its sovereignty and enforce the implementation of Resolution 1701 with the deployment of the army along the entire border in cooperation with UNIFIL.
""The Unity of the Arenas is a violation of the Lebanese people's right to self-determination, and this is evidence that there is a 'team' that decides on behalf of the Lebanese that all of Lebanon should be part of a regional war led by Iran,"" he added. The chairman of the Christian Lebanese Forces party, Samir Jaja, also referred to the failed conduct of the army in the country. ""Lebanon is in the eye of the storm,"" he said. ""If the Lebanese army were deployed along the southern border, we would prevent Lebanon and its inhabitants from what is happening now"".
The field escalation continues between the Israeli forces and the Lebanese Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon, while the Israeli targeting circle appears to be expanding day after day until it exceeds a few kilometers north of the Litani River. The IDF focused its precise operations and assassinated prominent figures in Hezbollahs field cadre, most notably Hussam Tawil (Hajj Jawad), one of the leaders of the Al-Radwan Force, who was assassinated on January 8, 2024.
The  IDF  also withdrew from the Gaza Strip all elements of the 36th Division, which includes the Golani Brigade , the 188th Brigade, and the 7th Brigade of the Armored Corps, Artillery and Engineering Corps. The military correspondent for the Wala website, Amir Bouhbut, linked this to the  IDF s efforts to maintain the efficiency of the forces in light of the threats on the northern front. With Lebanon."" Although Hezbollah is balancing between maintaining the level of deterrence without going to open war, the repercussions of the  Al-Aqsa Flood  operation last October 7 reinforce the  IDFs fears of a repeat of the event on its northern front, and thus lead it towards more and more confrontation.
Talk about a possible confrontation between Hezbollah and the Israel raises many questions, perhaps the most prominent of which are related to the dangers that Tel Aviv fears during any confrontation in the north at the operational and strategic levels.
In a research paper entitled The Day After the War, the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies believes that this confrontation would impose on  Israel new and more difficult challenges than those it experienced in its ongoing war on Gaza, or in previous confrontations with Hezbollah, which will affect The nature of war if it breaks out.
Iran has exploited its growing influence in Iraq and Syria to enhance the traditional capabilities of the axis of resistance, independent of its nuclear capabilities. In recent years, this axis has become a cohesive alliance of entities with great military capabilities, spearheaded by Hezbollah and working in integrated coordination with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
Hezbollah is considered one of the most powerful quasi-governmental organizations in the world, and in the last decade it has acquired large and diverse fire capabilities. The Institute for National Security Studies estimates Hezbollah's stock of missiles at about 150,000 short-, medium- and long-range missiles, which can cover almost all of occupied Palestine.
This threat has increased recently as a result of Hezbollah's efforts to develop a precision missile project, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea missiles, and attack drones, some of which Hezbollah revealed through its war media. The Israeli newspaper ""Jerusalem Post"" spoke of ""serious tactical errors"" that contributed to the success of Hezbollah's attacks since the start of the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" battle. It mentioned, among other things, the dilemma of anti-armor guided missiles, which the party has begun to use as a sniper weapon, while the Iron Dome is unable to intercept them, as they fly at a low altitude and in a straight line towards the target.
On the other hand, the  IDF sought to stop the growth of Hezbollah's power through the ""battle between wars"" strategy, by targeting its warehouses and supply lines through Iraq and Syria. It also focused on the assassination of the figures active in this project, most notably Sayyed Radhi Mousavi, one of the senior generals of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , who was assassinated in Damascus last month, followed by the assassination of Al-Quds Force intelligence official Haj Sadiq and his deputy in an Israeli raid on a residential building in the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus a few days ago. But it seems that this strategy has not yet prevented the party from developing and accumulating its capabilities.
Hezbollah has also made efforts to develop its ground attack options by raising the efficiency of the Radwan Force, an elite, well-trained division that includes thousands of fighters, according to the BBC. Al-Radwan gained great experience as a result of its participation alongside the Assad regime in confronting the factions of the Syrian revolution.
Despite the  IDF's discovery and destruction of many tunnels along the northern front during Operation Northern Shield in January 2019, the main mission of the ""Radwan"" fighters - according to the BBC article - is to enter the Galilee, where its main focus is, This is similar to what the Qassam elite did in the Al-Aqsa Flood. In January 2023, Hezbollah's Combat Information Unit published training scenes of the party's fighters simulating their infiltration into the occupied territories.
Iran's presence near the Syrian border with occupied Palestine, through its advisors and groups loyal to it, constituted a major strategic change. Despite the repeated targeting within the battle between wars, which enabled Israel to undermine Irans efforts to establish military bases in the Syrian arena, it did not prevent it from deploying surface-to-surface missile batteries and attack drones, as well as dozens of Iranian advisors and tens of thousands of fighters loyal to it. According to Farzin Nadimi, a researcher specializing in Iranian affairs at the Washington Institute for Studies.
This coincided with efforts made by Hezbollah, also with Iranian support, to establish sites on the outskirts of the Syrian Golan , and to form local groups affiliated with it. As well as other groups affiliated with the Palestinian resistance, which are likely behind some of the missile and drone attacks on the Golan Heights last December.
Israel fundamentally fears a multi-front war, which would involve simultaneous fighting in near and far arenas. In its war on Gaza, the  IDF is able to determine the battle axes, its primary and secondary fronts, determine its priorities, and distribute attention and resources. But in a large-scale war, he will find it difficult to control the borders and duration of the war, and if open war breaks out in the north, he will not be able to prevent Axis of Resistance groups stationed in other arenas from joining the battle.
In such a confrontation, Hezbollah, for example, will try to operate from the Syrian Golan, and pro-Iranian groups may then intervene in Syria and perhaps in western Iraq as well. In these circumstances, Iran may try to drag the Syrian regime into the fighting as well. This scenario is taken into account by the  IDF, as it conducted ground maneuvers north of the Golan Heights in July 2023, that is, 3 months before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation!
Another major challenge that Israel will face in the next war, according to the Institute for National Security Studies, is the threat posed by Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies against the Israeli home front as well, where it is expected to suffer widespread damage, at least in the first phase of the war. This damage includes Israel's vital capabilities, by striking, for example, the main  Israeli  army installations (headquarters, air force bases, reserve force mobilization centers), strategic infrastructure and vital services (sea and air ports, energy, water and transportation facilities). In addition to targeting the headquarters of the  Israeli  government, economic facilities and population centers, such tactics will aim to undermine the Israelis sense of security and ability to remain in the occupied territories.
Israel may resort to steps that are both proactive and cautious, especially since the field failure in Gaza cost its army a lot at all levels. In the face of these challenges, it will primarily maintain its current strategy to delay and disrupt the accumulation of power by Hezbollah in Lebanon and other Iranian proxies in Syria through the battle between wars. However, the failure of diplomatic efforts raises the possibility of launching a military operation inside Lebanon to reduce the level of threat posed by Hezbollah, while risking the situation deteriorating into a broader war.
On 18 January 2924, the Washington Post quoted  Israeli  Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as confirming to his American counterpart, Lloyd Austin, that Israel is approaching the point of decision-making in Lebanon as long as Hezbollah continues its attacks in the northern border region. He stressed the  Israeli  commitment to returning the settlers of the north to their homes. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority also said that Tel Aviv informed Washington that it would carry out military action in Lebanon unless the Radwan Force was removed from the border.
Despite many rational calculations that are supposed to keep Israel away from such steps, the internal crisis that Netanyahu, his government, and the leaders of the  Israeli  army are going through may push them towards reckless steps, which they believe may give them certain achievements to compensate for their failure in Gaza.
The ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" showed scenes of it launching a drone towards the port of Ashdod in Israel. The military media of the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" published a video clip showing ""scenes of it launching a drone towards the usurping Zionist entity... the port of Ashdod."" This came after the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" issued a statement in which it said that it attacked ""the port of Ashdod in the occupied territories, with drones, and the Islamic Resistance confirms its continued destruction of enemy strongholds.""
The ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" announced that ""for the third time on Monday,"" its fighters attacked the American ""Coneco"" base in Syria with missiles. Earlier, the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" confirmed that it had attacked ""a military target in the occupied Golan with drones."" It also indicated in November that it had targeted the Israeli city of Eilat. The resistance factions in Iraq had warned the United States that it would increase the number of armed operations in Syria and Iraq , in response to Washingtons continued provision of military assistance to the Israeli army, which is killing civilians in the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon.
The ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" targets American military sites and bases in Syria and Iraq, against the backdrop of the war launched by the Israeli army on the Gaza Strip and the American support that Israel receives. US Department of Defense spokesman Patrick Ryder also previously announced that the number of attacks on US military bases in Iraq and Syria has reached 130 attacks since October 17, 2023, indicating that US military bases in Iraq were subjected to 53 attacks, while bases in Syria were subjected to 77 attacks.
National Interest magazine said that the world is wondering how the Houthis in Yemen will respond to the series of devastating strikes launched by the United States and Britain on their targets to deter their attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. Will they, for example, target the American naval base in Djibouti?
In a report by Emily Milliken, the magazine recalled the US-British attacks aimed at weakening the Houthis capabilities and acting as a deterrent to future attacks, suggesting that the Houthis will remain able to launch naval attacks, and that these strikes will encourage them to intensify their attacks on the United States, Israel and their allies in the short term.
Shortly after the raid on the radar site, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdel Salam said that the American attack would not deter the group from targeting ships linked to Israel. Another Houthi official said that the group had drawn up a list of targets that included American bases in the region, which could include American bases in Saudi Arabia. Jordan, the Emirates, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Syria.
However, one of the obvious targets was not mentioned, which is the US Navy base Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, although it is located 80 miles from Yemen, and it is the primary base for US African Command (AFRICOM) operations in the Horn of Africa, and hosts about 4,000 soldiers from the United States. The United States and allied countries, and it has been used for operations against the Houthis for years. In addition to the Camp Lemonnier base, the Houthis - who claim to have a liquid-fueled missile with a range of up to 1,200 miles - can target the nearby Chabelle Airport, where the army has operated Predator and Reaper drones since their transfer from Lemonnier in 2013.
However, if there is something that keeps Djibouti safe from Houthi attacks - according to the writer - it is its governments fierce support for Palestine since the Al- Aqsa Flood operation on the seventh of last October and long before the attack, as the Prime Minister confirmed that Djibouti will not allow the United States The United States has decided to deploy missile launchers in the country or use it as a base for operations against the Houthis, because it considers the group's naval attacks to be ""legitimate relief for the Palestinians."" Moreover, Djibouti announced that it is reluctant to participate in the US-led naval coalition in Operation Prosperity Sentinel to fight the Houthis, and was one of the five countries that called on the International Criminal Court last November to investigate Israeli war crimes in the Palestinian territories.

Maps   All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.   	  	But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.  	Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.   	Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.

Bystanders     European Union foreign policy official Josep Borrell intends to present a plan to establish a Palestinian state, in light of Netanyahu and his ministers statements over the past few days rejecting the two-state solution . At the same time, Borrell said that the way Israel is trying to destroy Hamas is wrong and will not succeed, as he put it.   For her part, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said - before attending the European ministerial meeting - that the two-state solution is the only solution to the ongoing conflict, as she put it. She added: All those who say they do not want to hear anything about such a solution have offered no alternative, and also called for an urgent humanitarian halt to the war in Gaza.  On the other hand, the foreign ministers of Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Secretary-General of the Arab League are participating in meetings in Brussels on the sidelines of the European Union foreign ministers meeting. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi denounced the Israeli government's ""extremist racist agenda"" and said it defies the world by refusing to accept a two-state solution to end the conflict. He added, in his statements to reporters, that ""the only way out of this tragedy is the two-state solution... They are challenging the entire international community, and it is time for the world to take a stand.""  			    The European Union's diplomatic corps sent a discussion paper to member states proposing a road map for peace between the Palestinians and Israel in light of the ongoing aggression against the Gaza Strip for more than 3 months. The distribution of the internal document drawn up by Brussels' foreign affairs arm came ahead of the monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers on Monday, which this time was attended by the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the Secretary-General of the Arab League.  The meeting's talks focused mainly - according to statements by Union officials - on the repercussions of the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" battle launched by the Palestinian resistance on settlements in the Gaza Strip on October 7, the ongoing Israeli war on the Strip since that date, and other files such as the Ukraine war. The 12-point plan calls for a preparatory conference for peace organized by the European Union, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the League of Arab States, while also inviting the United States and the United Nations to participate in its holding.  The conference will be held ""even if the Israelis or Palestinians refuse to participate."" But the document also indicates that both parties will be consulted at every step of the talks as delegates seek to develop a peace plan. It is unrealistic to assume that Israelis and Palestinians will participate directly in bilateral peace negotiations in the near future, the document stated. Instead, the EU proposed parallel talks with the United States, the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League, and the document threatened consequences against Israel if it refused to participate.  The document, which was distributed to European capitals, says that the Palestinians will need a renewed political alternative to Hamas , while the Israelis will need to find the political will to participate in meaningful negotiations towards a two-state solution. According to the document, Therefore, it is the responsibility of external actors such as the European Union to assist the parties to the conflict by paving the way for comprehensive peace.  The proposed peace plan stressed that ""there is no comprehensive and reliable solution other than the establishment of an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel."" It added, ""One of the core elements of the peace plan must be the development of strong security guarantees for Israel and the future independent state of Palestine, conditional on full mutual diplomatic recognition and integration of both Israel and Palestine into the region.""  The internal document indicated that the Union would move forward with peace talks to end the war in the Gaza Strip even without Israels participation. The document says EU member states must be prepared to ""identify the consequences they intend to attach to participation or non-participation in the peace plan."" The document did not mention what these consequences are, at a time when the European Union has several potential aspects of influence.  The European Union is a major provider of economic aid to the Palestinians, and has a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Israel that includes a free trade zone. Some officials privately suggested that this could be used to influence Tel Aviv, according to Reuters.    Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, participated in a meeting hosted by the European Union foreign ministers in Brussels in the presence of Josep Borrell, the High Representative for European Foreign Policy, and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.  Aboul Gheit, said that the meeting  between the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, with the foreign ministers of the European Union, confirmed the existence of a great convergence of views. Aboul Gheit: There is a great convergence of views with the European Union regarding the rapid transition to a political path to a two-state solution""Axios"": Biden seeks to normalize Israeli-Saudi relations on the condition of establishing a Palestinian state  In his account on the X platform, Ahmed Aboul Gheit wrote after the meeting: The meeting today between the (foreign) ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and the Secretary-General, with the foreign ministers of the European Union, confirmed the existence of a great convergence of views, not only about the necessity of... Stopping the Israeli war on Gaza, but also about the necessity of a rapid transition to a political path that leads to the implementation of the two-state solution without wasting years as happened in the past. We will need more dialogue at different levels to reach the required Arab-European consensus.  The official spokesman for the Secretary-General, Jamal Rushdi, stated that the meeting addressed the necessity of working immediately to stop the aggressive Israeli war on the Gaza Strip and deal with the effects of the humanitarian catastrophe that the residents of the Strip are experiencing. The spokesman explained that the meeting witnessed broad agreement between the Arab and European sides that the two-state solution remains the only way to settle the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and that every attempt to delay the implementation of this solution or evade it exposes the security and stability of the region to danger.  The spokesman added that Aboul Gheit, along with the Arab ministers, listened to some serious European ideas for launching a credible peace process based on the two-state solution, and reaching a final settlement based on implementing this solution, by ending the occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. The spokesman quoted Aboul Gheit as saying that many European ideas contain positive aspects regarding the political horizon required to end the conflict, and that what is required now is to combine words with action, calling on European countries to take a necessary initial step, which is to recognize the Palestinian state.  In a related context, Rushdi explained that Aboul Gheit met on the sidelines of the European meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tiani, where the latter listened to the vision of the Secretary-General of the Arab League for the situation in Gaza and the necessity of stopping the war and launching a political path leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The two parties also expressed their deep concern. Regarding the state of escalation in the region, especially in the Red Sea.    Axis of Resistance   Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian commented on the possibility of the Gaza war expanding amid the tensions that the region has witnessed recently, such as the mutual bombing with Pakistan and the tense situation in southern Lebanon and in the Red Sea. In an interview with CNN, the interviewer said: In a previous interview we conducted with you on October 29... you said that you do not want the war to expand and do not want escalation. Since then, Hezbollah has launched attacks against Israel, and the Houthis are attacking... Ships in the Red Sea. You attacked Iraq , and you attacked Pakistan . It certainly seems that the actions of Iran and its allies do not indicate that you are trying to prevent this war from expanding. It seems that you are encouraging escalation.  Hussein Amir Abdullahian replied, saying: I agree with you...in West Asia now we are witnessing the expansion of the crisis and tensions, but the roots of these tensions are not what happened on October 7th. Hamas is a Palestinian liberation group fighting against the occupation in order to liberate the lands of Palestine. The occupiers, they carried out an operation... Of course we do not approve of the killing of women and children anywhere in the world, but I want to tell you that the roots of that are not what happened on October 7th... The roots of that go back 75 years when the Israeli regime occupied Palestine, Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation. He added: ""We warned that if the attacks, war crimes and genocide against Gaza and the West Bank do not stop, the war will expand and become more comprehensive, and this does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion.""  Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian confirmed that ""the activity of Iranian military advisors in combating terrorism and securing the region will continue strongly."" This is after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard confirmed the killing of 5 Iranian military advisors in Syria, the fifth of whom died of his wounds following the Israeli attack on Saturday morning on Damascus. The Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip and clashes between the Israeli army and Hamas continue for the 118th day, in light of a humanitarian and health catastrophe in the Strip.    Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said the Zionist regime has resorted to blind assassination attacks to compensate for its failure in achieving the objectives of the war on Gaza. In a meeting in Tehran on Sunday, Amirabdollahian and the head of the parliamentary friendship group of Kuwait and Iran, Marzouq Al-Hubaini, discussed a range of regional issues and bilateral cooperation.  The Iranian foreign minister praised the position and role of the Kuwaiti parliament and government in supporting the oppressed Palestinian nation. Evaluating the current developments and events in Gaza, he pointed to the continuation of the Zionist regime's criminal actions in killing women, children, and the defenseless people of Palestine. ""Although the Zionist enemy has destroyed Gaza on a large scale and martyred tens of thousands of people, it has not achieved any of its goals. So, it tries to compensate for its failure by resorting to blind terrorist actions,"" Amirabdollahian noted, the Foreign Ministrys website reported.  			    The Israeli regimes crimes against Iran wont go unpunished, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Asked about the Israeli assassination of Iranian military advisers in Syria, Kanaani said at a presser on Monday, The usurping Zionist regimes crimes against the Iranian government have never gone and wont go unpunished. The spokesman warned that Iran will respond to the Israeli crimes in its own way.  Dismissing the Israeli prime ministers threat of military action against Iran, he said such rhetoric reveals the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and the degree of the threats that it poses to regional and world security. The essence of this (Israeli) regime is in contradiction to peace. This regime has always tried to seize every opportunity to promote insecurity in the region and the world, he stated. The spokesman refuted Netanyahus hollow rhetoric, reaffirmed Irans right to respond to the threats, and said the Zionist regime had better think about survival from the quagmire of Gaza.			     Allied for Democracy Israeli officials and analysts agree - in their discussions of the repercussions of the war on the Gaza Strip - in their rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state, in a position identical to the position of their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who contradicted the American desire in this context.   	Gideon Sa'ar, a minister in the War Council, spoke of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying, ""It is not possible to establish a demilitarized Palestinian state unless Israel has security control, as it does in the West Bank and intends to do in the Gaza Strip."" He added in a discussion session on Israeli Channel 14, The lands that we hand over to the Palestinians will become a base for aggression against Israel. The minister revealed that when he took the decision to unite between his New Hope party and the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz,  they had a clear agreement to reject the establishment of a state. Palestinian.  	According to Michael Sheams, a political affairs correspondent for Channel 11, the Prime Minister is using the story of the Palestinian state as a kind of political campaign, stressing that large sectors of Israelis oppose the establishment of this state. Gil Tamari, Channel 13's international news editor, explained that US President Joe Biden bypasses Netanyahu, and directly tells the Israeli public, ""I'm offering you a dream plan,"" which means, ""You get a big reward now and you pay the price at some point in the future.""  	He added, ""What is the return? Complete normalization with Saudi Arabia and 6 additional Muslim countries, and an unprecedented security umbrella that Israel will enjoy? The price will be a declaration of intent that will lead to a future path to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be demilitarized and without an army."" He commented, saying, ""This is what the Americans are proposing to the Israeli public because they realize that Netanyahu is not a partner.""  	As for the journalist on Channel 12, he believed that even if Gantz (a minister in the War Council) became prime minister, it would be difficult for him to provide the American president with a response other than that offered by Netanyahu, which is that the chances of establishing a Palestinian state are non-existent. Netanyahu had previously revealed that he had informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any post-war scenario in Gaza, contrary to the American desire.    		            		  		  		  		  According to Arab observers and experts, Benjamin Netanyahu s government failed to neutralize Israels economy and spare it losses like previous wars, especially since the area that caused the Al-Aqsa flood battle ( the Gaza envelope ) is responsible for supplying the Israeli economy with about 75% of the agricultural crops that the occupation needs, but the war It transformed it from an agricultural area into a closed military area.  The Jordanian economist, Dr. Amer Al-Shobaki, painted a bleak picture of the reality and future of the Israeli economy in light of the continuation of the war on the Gaza Strip. He said in his interview with Al-Jazeera Net that the total direct and indirect economic losses of the occupation in its war - which it has been waging against Gaza since the seventh of last October - It reached 165 billion dollars.  Al-Shoubaki added that what is announced by Israel is a small part of the real military losses. The operational cost of this war has reached 280 million dollars per day, the equivalent of 28 billion dollars in the first 100 days of the battle, in addition to the cost of the military vehicles that the resistance announced had been destroyed. Which exceed a thousand armored vehicles and tanks, and these are military losses that the occupation has not announced yet.    Al-Shoubaki summarizes the occupations losses in its war on Gaza as emptying many sectors of Israeli workers, so that they become reserve soldiers in the Israeli army, and their number exceeds 300 thousand employees working in various vital sectors, the most important of which is the technology sector, which supplies Israel with half of its exports, and this sector has suffered losses exceeding 20 billion dollars. Foreign investments became idle as a result of the war on Gaza, causing huge losses, reaching $15 billion, which takes a long time to recover, in addition to stopping the tourism sector, which was damaged - according to what was announced - by 75%, and this sector was generating approximately 20%. Billion dollars to the Israeli treasury annually.  Sheltering and compensating families displaced as a result of the war in the Gaza Strip and in the northern border areas with Lebanon, whose number is estimated at one million settlers, currently living in 280 hotels. This requires huge sums of no less than $10 billion, and compensating them for their commercial and industrial losses that they suffered as a result of the war. Compensating and treating war-wounded civilians and war-wounded soldiers, in addition to compensating the families of dead soldiers, treating the wounded and disabled as a result of the war, and compensating those whose homes were damaged as a result of being hit by Palestinian resistance missiles and Hezbollah missiles, which increases additional costs to the occupation treasury. In the short and long term.  The migration of more than 400,000 Israelis - so far - who hold dual nationalities to the European and American continents, which is reflected in a decrease in government and taxpayer revenues. The loss of Palestinian labor in the construction sector in the territories occupied in 1948, and the flight of Thai labor in agricultural facilities around the Gaza Strip for fear of war, which adds new burdens to the Israeli economy, as a result of the complete cessation of this vital sector.  The navigation crisis continues in the Red Sea, with the Houthi group preventing ships coming towards Israel, or Israeli ones, from sailing through Bab al-Mandab, which has stopped maritime traffic in the Israeli port of Eilat by 95%. The occupation has also become dependent on ships coming from the Mediterranean, which has raised the cost of shipping and caused a sharp rise in the prices of consumer goods and vehicle prices within the occupying state.  The chief economist of the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Shmuel Abramson, expected that the economy would contract by 1.5% if the war on Gaza continued until the end of the current year, after he had expected growth of 2.7% for the year 2024 before the start of the war, according to a report carried by the Israeli economic newspaper Globes.  Economic expert Hossam Ayesh did not stray far from Al-Shoubaki, as he confirmed that Israel did not plan for its war on the Gaza Strip to extend for more than 100 days, because the occupation suffered huge losses on the economic level due to the war, and entered into a real dilemma as a result of the high debts it needs to spend on. Military operations, in addition to its suffering from a severe budget deficit due to the decline in revenues, which means that its credit rating declined from stable to negative, with expectations that it will face a government deficit of 5.3% during the years 2023 and 2024, given the large defense spending imposed by the war.  Ayesh told Al Jazeera Net: ""The economic, military and technological damage incurred by the occupation during the past 100 days exceeded 100 billion dollars, adding that the more the war increased, the greater the percentage of loss."" He continues that the technology sector, which represents the backbone of the Israeli economy - due to its superiority in this field - has begun to decline, noting that tax revenues related to this sector have declined by 80%. Ayesh said, ""The Israeli military reserve called up a large portion of the workers in this sector, accompanied by the state of uncertainty resulting from this war, and all of this has caused particularly heavy losses.""  Earlier, the Accountant General of the Israeli Finance Department, Eli Rotenberg, expected that the proportion of public debt would increase to 62.1% of the gross domestic product in 2023 as a result of the financial repercussions of this war, after expectations indicated a decline of 1% on an annual basis to 59% before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation. According to Globes newspaper. Official data also showed that the budget deficit is expected to rise from 2.25% to 6.6% of GDP during the current year.  According to these data, the financial impact of the war is estimated at about 150 billion shekels ($40.25 billion) for the period 2023-2024, assuming the war ends in the first quarter of this year.  The economic expert, Ayesh, pointed out that the Netanyahu government is hiding the truth about its economic losses in order not to disrupt the course of the battle in the Gaza Strip. However, the Western media - especially the American ones - recently published the truth about the losses that the occupation has incurred since more than 100 days of aggression against the Gaza Strip. This comes - according to Ayesh - despite the fact that Israels budget for the year 2023 - before the war - amounted to 130 billion dollars, which is the largest budget in its history. However, with the outbreak of the war, it was forced to approve an additional budget of 8.1 billion dollars, to meet the wars military needs. Which will lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.7% of GDP last year, then to 5% in 2024.  He explained that although the Central Bank of Israel allocated $45 billion to protect the shekels exchange rate, its value deteriorated, recording the longest series of losses in 39 years, while the Central Banks loss amounted to $7.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves. It is noteworthy that the Governor of the Central Bank of Israel had estimated the cost of the war on Gaza at about 210 billion shekels ($56 billion) for defense and compensation for those displaced from their homes in the south, due to Palestinian resistance operations, or the north, due to the missiles targeting them from Lebanon.    		  		  		  The  center-left French newspaper Liberation, a newspaper of record in France, said that protests are increasing in Israel 3 and a half months after the start of the war on Gaza , and that the opposition has begun its preparations in conjunction with calls from more Israelis to hold early elections in the hope of ousting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The newspaper - in a report by its correspondent from Tel Aviv, Nicolas Roger - began by criticizing former General Gadi Eisenkot - a member of the war cabinet - publicly and surprisingly of Netanyahus policies, saying: What is happening in Gaza today is that the goals of the war have not been achieved, those who talk about... The complete defeat of Hamas . They are not telling the truth. He added, No, when the journalist asked him, Are the decision makers honest with the public?  Eisenkot's comments sparked some criticism, but the former chief of staff cannot be touched, because his son and nephew were killed in Gaza, and he is more capable than others - as the correspondent believes - of understanding the reality and repercussions of Israeli military actions. Therefore, when Eisenkot says that elections are necessary in the coming months, it is a clear message that the opposition will not wait for the end of the war, which will be long - as Netanyahu promised - to force the country to go to the polls.  The correspondent explained that the Prime Minister is trapped in what appears to be a growing turmoil reminiscent of the months preceding last October 7, from protests by hostage families in front of his house to thousands of people demanding his departure in the streets of Tel Aviv, in addition to the torrent of criticism of the new budget.  On the main street that surrounds Tel Aviv from the east, new billboards say, We need elections, in a campaign that appears expensive and of unknown origin. In the background - as the reporter sees - there are veterans who participated in the demonstrations against judicial reform and a number of people from Technology.  Ronen Koehler of the Brothers in Arms leadership believes that there is no point in the campaign as long as Benny Gantz is still in government, adding, What we want is to rebuild the democratic space by encouraging our members to join civil life. Our liberal secular values ??must return. To the forefront and fight for the hearts of Israelis. It is an ambitious project - according to the correspondent - and it is almost ideal to reverse what the extreme Israeli settler right has done over the past 15 years to the point that, although it represents only 5% of the population - as Kohler insists - it has become the one that determines the content of political debate, even in times of war.  As for Netanyahu and his partners, they launched their election campaigns early last December, while the opposition was very late, despite the great anger at Netanyahu, whose opinion polls indicate his loss every time, even though he is the only one who proposes a simple and coherent project for the next day, according to the correspondent. He confirms that there is no going back. To the world before October 7, and therefore no concessions to the Palestinians who are being killed in Gaza.  The reporter concluded that Benny Gantz is the one who will become prime minister if the elections are held today, and he will be at the head of a warlike right-wing government without a clear political project, which indicates that the Israeli opposition still believes that getting rid of Netanyahu will change everything, and that this is the key to a new beginning.     While the Guardian newspaper ruled out the success of attempts to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) and its leaders in the Gaza Strip , the Independent newspaper wrote about clear rifts between Israel and its allies, the United States and Britain. As part of their coverage of developments in the war in the Gaza Strip, international newspapers and magazines focused on the ongoing debate regarding the future of the Gaza Strip, and the disputes it creates between Israel and its allies, in addition to US-Iranian relations in light of the current developments.  While ruling out the success of attempts to eliminate Hamas and its leaders, an article in The Guardian newspaper expects that Israel's plans regarding the future of the Strip will lead to the movement's continued activity, ""which may shift to other arenas that Hamas has been avoiding, and thus its danger will not diminish."" The author of the article believes that ""the most realistic solution is to think about how to integrate Hamas into the authority that governs Gaza after the war, instead of thinking about eradicating it.""  For its part, The Independent newspaper focused on the ""clear rifts"" between Israel and its allies the United States and Britain, which are reflected in officials' statements regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. The newspaper wrote that the rifts come at a time when the voices of thousands of Israelis are rising, demanding the liberation of those detained by the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and the holding of new elections, and amid clear divisions within the War Council over the future of the conflict and post-war plans in Gaza.  For its part, other newspapers and magazines discussed the issue of US-Iranian relations, as The Economist magazine wrote that the attacks and assassinations bring the two countries closer to war. The magazine expects that pressure will increase on US President Joe Biden ""to respond to Iran and its agents in the Middle East so that America does not appear weak... He then risks entering a new war in the election year."" In the same context, Le Monde newspaper published a lengthy investigation in which it stated that the United States, along with other powers, is today paying the price for its neglect of the Houthis growing capabilities, so that they have turned today into active players in the conflict in the Middle East.        Writer Owen Jones in The Guardian newspaper said that Western political and media elites are complicit in the Gaza nightmare , and that they have lost the last vestiges of moral authority forever. The writer explained that US President Joe Biden gave a specific answer last week in the statement he issued on the occasion of the 100th day since the start of the current terror, in which he showed his true sympathy with the plight of the prisoners of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and with their shocked families, but he did not issue a response. There is no mention of the Palestinians about him.  However, the lack of interest by politicians and the media in concealing their contempt for Palestinian life will have major consequences, even though it is not a new thing, as the writer believes; If the powerful countries of the world had not so impudently ignored three quarters of a million Palestinians who were expelled from their homes 76 years ago, with about 15,000 of them violently killed, the seeds of this bitter harvest would not have been sown today.  Owen Jones wondered how many people knew that 234 Palestinians were killed last year, just before October 7, by Israeli forces in the West Bank alone. He continued that if there was some value to the lives of Palestinians, perhaps decades of occupation, siege, illegal settlement, apartheid, violent repression and mass massacres would not have occurred.  Some may have expected that after this deadly massacre, the dam would eventually collapse, because violently killing 10,000 children, amputating legs, or removing the kidneys of others without anesthesia would arouse strong feelings, just as performing caesarean sections without anesthesia and the death of premature infants due to low blood pressure. Body heat and diarrhea would provoke unstoppable disgust.  Although predictions that a quarter of Gaza's population might die within a year due to Israel's destruction of the health care system alone should lead to a loud call to end this injustice, no one has taken action. According to the writer, underestimating the value of Palestinian life is not a hypothetical matter, but rather a statistical fact, as a new study of coverage in major American newspapers says that Israeli deaths are mentioned at a rate of 16 times more than Palestinian deaths, and that human terms such as mother or husband were used much less often to describe Palestinians, while emotional terms such as ""massacre"" were used for Israeli victims.  All of this will have a profound impact, as the writer sees; We must forget any future Western claims regarding human rights and international law, because a large part of the world views this self-justification with contempt, and considers it merely a trick to advance the strategic interests of countries that have become rich at the expense of the rest of the world, after centuries of colonialism characterized by genocide and pigeons. Recent bloodshed such as the Iraq War, and even arming and supporting Israel as it engages in mass murder in Gaza.  He continued that Western political and media elites should not panic about the condition of other countries, but rather about the moral collapse occurring in their countries, because the refusal to treat the Palestinians as human beings has made todays nightmare inevitable, and has permanently torn apart the moral claims used to justify Western hegemony over the world. Consequences that will not be understood until it is too late.      A report on the British University of Portsmouth website confirmed that former US President Donald Trump's victory for a second term in the upcoming presidential elections will mean a return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan ""America First."" The report explained that if Trump wins a second term in the upcoming presidential elections , it is unlikely that Joe Biden will continue attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza, as Trump has been a long-time ally of Israel and has become the first American president to officially and controversially recognize Jerusalem as its capital. In 2017.  It added that Trump will return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan America First, which means withdrawing from military spending and paying attention to internal affairs, which means stopping the free flow of money and weapons from the United States and its proxy wars in Ukraine. A potential Republican candidate winning a second term would have disastrous effects on international diplomacy, according to Le Monde columnist Sylvie Kaufmann: The G7 and NATO summits will once again turn into unpredictable circus moments.   The report added, In continuation of the focus of his first presidency, Trump pledged to transfer thousands of American troops stationed abroad, FBI agents, and Drug Enforcement Administration officials to address the migration crisis on the Mexican border, and this will not only affect the American military presence in various parts of the world. ""It will also have a devastating impact on Mexico, which will have to deal with an increasingly problematic border with the United States.""  The report continued, ""One important difference this time is that Trump and his allies have been planning his next term since he left the White House. He will be surrounded exclusively by his loyalists, will be free from any constrained rational voices, and will be more organized than his first term, so he is unlikely to continue... Trump and Biden's attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza.  The report noted, ""Although much of the concern is focused on Trump's potential re-election, his two main rivals for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, have identified support for aggressive immigration policies and support for Israel as key goals if they win.""    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th was 198, and 534 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of October. Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	     	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
European Union foreign policy official Josep Borrell intends to present a plan to establish a Palestinian state, in light of Netanyahu and his ministers statements over the past few days rejecting the two-state solution . At the same time, Borrell said that the way Israel is trying to destroy Hamas is wrong and will not succeed, as he put it.
For her part, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said - before attending the European ministerial meeting - that the two-state solution is the only solution to the ongoing conflict, as she put it. She added: All those who say they do not want to hear anything about such a solution have offered no alternative, and also called for an urgent humanitarian halt to the war in Gaza.
On the other hand, the foreign ministers of Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Secretary-General of the Arab League are participating in meetings in Brussels on the sidelines of the European Union foreign ministers meeting. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi denounced the Israeli government's ""extremist racist agenda"" and said it defies the world by refusing to accept a two-state solution to end the conflict. He added, in his statements to reporters, that ""the only way out of this tragedy is the two-state solution... They are challenging the entire international community, and it is time for the world to take a stand.""
The European Union's diplomatic corps sent a discussion paper to member states proposing a road map for peace between the Palestinians and Israel in light of the ongoing aggression against the Gaza Strip for more than 3 months. The distribution of the internal document drawn up by Brussels' foreign affairs arm came ahead of the monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers on Monday, which this time was attended by the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the Secretary-General of the Arab League.
The meeting's talks focused mainly - according to statements by Union officials - on the repercussions of the ""Al-Aqsa Flood"" battle launched by the Palestinian resistance on settlements in the Gaza Strip on October 7, the ongoing Israeli war on the Strip since that date, and other files such as the Ukraine war. The 12-point plan calls for a preparatory conference for peace organized by the European Union, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the League of Arab States, while also inviting the United States and the United Nations to participate in its holding.
The conference will be held ""even if the Israelis or Palestinians refuse to participate."" But the document also indicates that both parties will be consulted at every step of the talks as delegates seek to develop a peace plan. It is unrealistic to assume that Israelis and Palestinians will participate directly in bilateral peace negotiations in the near future, the document stated. Instead, the EU proposed parallel talks with the United States, the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League, and the document threatened consequences against Israel if it refused to participate.
The document, which was distributed to European capitals, says that the Palestinians will need a renewed political alternative to Hamas , while the Israelis will need to find the political will to participate in meaningful negotiations towards a two-state solution. According to the document, Therefore, it is the responsibility of external actors such as the European Union to assist the parties to the conflict by paving the way for comprehensive peace.
The proposed peace plan stressed that ""there is no comprehensive and reliable solution other than the establishment of an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel."" It added, ""One of the core elements of the peace plan must be the development of strong security guarantees for Israel and the future independent state of Palestine, conditional on full mutual diplomatic recognition and integration of both Israel and Palestine into the region.""
The internal document indicated that the Union would move forward with peace talks to end the war in the Gaza Strip even without Israels participation. The document says EU member states must be prepared to ""identify the consequences they intend to attach to participation or non-participation in the peace plan."" The document did not mention what these consequences are, at a time when the European Union has several potential aspects of influence.
The European Union is a major provider of economic aid to the Palestinians, and has a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Israel that includes a free trade zone. Some officials privately suggested that this could be used to influence Tel Aviv, according to Reuters.
Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, participated in a meeting hosted by the European Union foreign ministers in Brussels in the presence of Josep Borrell, the High Representative for European Foreign Policy, and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.  Aboul Gheit, said that the meeting  between the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, with the foreign ministers of the European Union, confirmed the existence of a great convergence of views. Aboul Gheit: There is a great convergence of views with the European Union regarding the rapid transition to a political path to a two-state solution""Axios"": Biden seeks to normalize Israeli-Saudi relations on the condition of establishing a Palestinian state
In his account on the X platform, Ahmed Aboul Gheit wrote after the meeting: The meeting today between the (foreign) ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan and the Secretary-General, with the foreign ministers of the European Union, confirmed the existence of a great convergence of views, not only about the necessity of... Stopping the Israeli war on Gaza, but also about the necessity of a rapid transition to a political path that leads to the implementation of the two-state solution without wasting years as happened in the past. We will need more dialogue at different levels to reach the required Arab-European consensus.
The official spokesman for the Secretary-General, Jamal Rushdi, stated that the meeting addressed the necessity of working immediately to stop the aggressive Israeli war on the Gaza Strip and deal with the effects of the humanitarian catastrophe that the residents of the Strip are experiencing. The spokesman explained that the meeting witnessed broad agreement between the Arab and European sides that the two-state solution remains the only way to settle the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and that every attempt to delay the implementation of this solution or evade it exposes the security and stability of the region to danger.
The spokesman added that Aboul Gheit, along with the Arab ministers, listened to some serious European ideas for launching a credible peace process based on the two-state solution, and reaching a final settlement based on implementing this solution, by ending the occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders. The spokesman quoted Aboul Gheit as saying that many European ideas contain positive aspects regarding the political horizon required to end the conflict, and that what is required now is to combine words with action, calling on European countries to take a necessary initial step, which is to recognize the Palestinian state.
In a related context, Rushdi explained that Aboul Gheit met on the sidelines of the European meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tiani, where the latter listened to the vision of the Secretary-General of the Arab League for the situation in Gaza and the necessity of stopping the war and launching a political path leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The two parties also expressed their deep concern. Regarding the state of escalation in the region, especially in the Red Sea.


Axis of Resistance   Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian commented on the possibility of the Gaza war expanding amid the tensions that the region has witnessed recently, such as the mutual bombing with Pakistan and the tense situation in southern Lebanon and in the Red Sea. In an interview with CNN, the interviewer said: In a previous interview we conducted with you on October 29... you said that you do not want the war to expand and do not want escalation. Since then, Hezbollah has launched attacks against Israel, and the Houthis are attacking... Ships in the Red Sea. You attacked Iraq , and you attacked Pakistan . It certainly seems that the actions of Iran and its allies do not indicate that you are trying to prevent this war from expanding. It seems that you are encouraging escalation.  Hussein Amir Abdullahian replied, saying: I agree with you...in West Asia now we are witnessing the expansion of the crisis and tensions, but the roots of these tensions are not what happened on October 7th. Hamas is a Palestinian liberation group fighting against the occupation in order to liberate the lands of Palestine. The occupiers, they carried out an operation... Of course we do not approve of the killing of women and children anywhere in the world, but I want to tell you that the roots of that are not what happened on October 7th... The roots of that go back 75 years when the Israeli regime occupied Palestine, Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation. He added: ""We warned that if the attacks, war crimes and genocide against Gaza and the West Bank do not stop, the war will expand and become more comprehensive, and this does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion.""  Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian confirmed that ""the activity of Iranian military advisors in combating terrorism and securing the region will continue strongly."" This is after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard confirmed the killing of 5 Iranian military advisors in Syria, the fifth of whom died of his wounds following the Israeli attack on Saturday morning on Damascus. The Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip and clashes between the Israeli army and Hamas continue for the 118th day, in light of a humanitarian and health catastrophe in the Strip.    Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said the Zionist regime has resorted to blind assassination attacks to compensate for its failure in achieving the objectives of the war on Gaza. In a meeting in Tehran on Sunday, Amirabdollahian and the head of the parliamentary friendship group of Kuwait and Iran, Marzouq Al-Hubaini, discussed a range of regional issues and bilateral cooperation.  The Iranian foreign minister praised the position and role of the Kuwaiti parliament and government in supporting the oppressed Palestinian nation. Evaluating the current developments and events in Gaza, he pointed to the continuation of the Zionist regime's criminal actions in killing women, children, and the defenseless people of Palestine. ""Although the Zionist enemy has destroyed Gaza on a large scale and martyred tens of thousands of people, it has not achieved any of its goals. So, it tries to compensate for its failure by resorting to blind terrorist actions,"" Amirabdollahian noted, the Foreign Ministrys website reported.  			    The Israeli regimes crimes against Iran wont go unpunished, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Asked about the Israeli assassination of Iranian military advisers in Syria, Kanaani said at a presser on Monday, The usurping Zionist regimes crimes against the Iranian government have never gone and wont go unpunished. The spokesman warned that Iran will respond to the Israeli crimes in its own way.  Dismissing the Israeli prime ministers threat of military action against Iran, he said such rhetoric reveals the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and the degree of the threats that it poses to regional and world security. The essence of this (Israeli) regime is in contradiction to peace. This regime has always tried to seize every opportunity to promote insecurity in the region and the world, he stated. The spokesman refuted Netanyahus hollow rhetoric, reaffirmed Irans right to respond to the threats, and said the Zionist regime had better think about survival from the quagmire of Gaza.			     Allied for Democracy Israeli officials and analysts agree - in their discussions of the repercussions of the war on the Gaza Strip - in their rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state, in a position identical to the position of their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who contradicted the American desire in this context.   	Gideon Sa'ar, a minister in the War Council, spoke of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying, ""It is not possible to establish a demilitarized Palestinian state unless Israel has security control, as it does in the West Bank and intends to do in the Gaza Strip."" He added in a discussion session on Israeli Channel 14, The lands that we hand over to the Palestinians will become a base for aggression against Israel. The minister revealed that when he took the decision to unite between his New Hope party and the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz,  they had a clear agreement to reject the establishment of a state. Palestinian.  	According to Michael Sheams, a political affairs correspondent for Channel 11, the Prime Minister is using the story of the Palestinian state as a kind of political campaign, stressing that large sectors of Israelis oppose the establishment of this state. Gil Tamari, Channel 13's international news editor, explained that US President Joe Biden bypasses Netanyahu, and directly tells the Israeli public, ""I'm offering you a dream plan,"" which means, ""You get a big reward now and you pay the price at some point in the future.""  	He added, ""What is the return? Complete normalization with Saudi Arabia and 6 additional Muslim countries, and an unprecedented security umbrella that Israel will enjoy? The price will be a declaration of intent that will lead to a future path to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be demilitarized and without an army."" He commented, saying, ""This is what the Americans are proposing to the Israeli public because they realize that Netanyahu is not a partner.""  	As for the journalist on Channel 12, he believed that even if Gantz (a minister in the War Council) became prime minister, it would be difficult for him to provide the American president with a response other than that offered by Netanyahu, which is that the chances of establishing a Palestinian state are non-existent. Netanyahu had previously revealed that he had informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any post-war scenario in Gaza, contrary to the American desire.    		            		  		  		  		  According to Arab observers and experts, Benjamin Netanyahu s government failed to neutralize Israels economy and spare it losses like previous wars, especially since the area that caused the Al-Aqsa flood battle ( the Gaza envelope ) is responsible for supplying the Israeli economy with about 75% of the agricultural crops that the occupation needs, but the war It transformed it from an agricultural area into a closed military area.  The Jordanian economist, Dr. Amer Al-Shobaki, painted a bleak picture of the reality and future of the Israeli economy in light of the continuation of the war on the Gaza Strip. He said in his interview with Al-Jazeera Net that the total direct and indirect economic losses of the occupation in its war - which it has been waging against Gaza since the seventh of last October - It reached 165 billion dollars.  Al-Shoubaki added that what is announced by Israel is a small part of the real military losses. The operational cost of this war has reached 280 million dollars per day, the equivalent of 28 billion dollars in the first 100 days of the battle, in addition to the cost of the military vehicles that the resistance announced had been destroyed. Which exceed a thousand armored vehicles and tanks, and these are military losses that the occupation has not announced yet.    Al-Shoubaki summarizes the occupations losses in its war on Gaza as emptying many sectors of Israeli workers, so that they become reserve soldiers in the Israeli army, and their number exceeds 300 thousand employees working in various vital sectors, the most important of which is the technology sector, which supplies Israel with half of its exports, and this sector has suffered losses exceeding 20 billion dollars. Foreign investments became idle as a result of the war on Gaza, causing huge losses, reaching $15 billion, which takes a long time to recover, in addition to stopping the tourism sector, which was damaged - according to what was announced - by 75%, and this sector was generating approximately 20%. Billion dollars to the Israeli treasury annually.  Sheltering and compensating families displaced as a result of the war in the Gaza Strip and in the northern border areas with Lebanon, whose number is estimated at one million settlers, currently living in 280 hotels. This requires huge sums of no less than $10 billion, and compensating them for their commercial and industrial losses that they suffered as a result of the war. Compensating and treating war-wounded civilians and war-wounded soldiers, in addition to compensating the families of dead soldiers, treating the wounded and disabled as a result of the war, and compensating those whose homes were damaged as a result of being hit by Palestinian resistance missiles and Hezbollah missiles, which increases additional costs to the occupation treasury. In the short and long term.  The migration of more than 400,000 Israelis - so far - who hold dual nationalities to the European and American continents, which is reflected in a decrease in government and taxpayer revenues. The loss of Palestinian labor in the construction sector in the territories occupied in 1948, and the flight of Thai labor in agricultural facilities around the Gaza Strip for fear of war, which adds new burdens to the Israeli economy, as a result of the complete cessation of this vital sector.  The navigation crisis continues in the Red Sea, with the Houthi group preventing ships coming towards Israel, or Israeli ones, from sailing through Bab al-Mandab, which has stopped maritime traffic in the Israeli port of Eilat by 95%. The occupation has also become dependent on ships coming from the Mediterranean, which has raised the cost of shipping and caused a sharp rise in the prices of consumer goods and vehicle prices within the occupying state.  The chief economist of the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Shmuel Abramson, expected that the economy would contract by 1.5% if the war on Gaza continued until the end of the current year, after he had expected growth of 2.7% for the year 2024 before the start of the war, according to a report carried by the Israeli economic newspaper Globes.  Economic expert Hossam Ayesh did not stray far from Al-Shoubaki, as he confirmed that Israel did not plan for its war on the Gaza Strip to extend for more than 100 days, because the occupation suffered huge losses on the economic level due to the war, and entered into a real dilemma as a result of the high debts it needs to spend on. Military operations, in addition to its suffering from a severe budget deficit due to the decline in revenues, which means that its credit rating declined from stable to negative, with expectations that it will face a government deficit of 5.3% during the years 2023 and 2024, given the large defense spending imposed by the war.  Ayesh told Al Jazeera Net: ""The economic, military and technological damage incurred by the occupation during the past 100 days exceeded 100 billion dollars, adding that the more the war increased, the greater the percentage of loss."" He continues that the technology sector, which represents the backbone of the Israeli economy - due to its superiority in this field - has begun to decline, noting that tax revenues related to this sector have declined by 80%. Ayesh said, ""The Israeli military reserve called up a large portion of the workers in this sector, accompanied by the state of uncertainty resulting from this war, and all of this has caused particularly heavy losses.""  Earlier, the Accountant General of the Israeli Finance Department, Eli Rotenberg, expected that the proportion of public debt would increase to 62.1% of the gross domestic product in 2023 as a result of the financial repercussions of this war, after expectations indicated a decline of 1% on an annual basis to 59% before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation. According to Globes newspaper. Official data also showed that the budget deficit is expected to rise from 2.25% to 6.6% of GDP during the current year.  According to these data, the financial impact of the war is estimated at about 150 billion shekels ($40.25 billion) for the period 2023-2024, assuming the war ends in the first quarter of this year.  The economic expert, Ayesh, pointed out that the Netanyahu government is hiding the truth about its economic losses in order not to disrupt the course of the battle in the Gaza Strip. However, the Western media - especially the American ones - recently published the truth about the losses that the occupation has incurred since more than 100 days of aggression against the Gaza Strip. This comes - according to Ayesh - despite the fact that Israels budget for the year 2023 - before the war - amounted to 130 billion dollars, which is the largest budget in its history. However, with the outbreak of the war, it was forced to approve an additional budget of 8.1 billion dollars, to meet the wars military needs. Which will lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.7% of GDP last year, then to 5% in 2024.  He explained that although the Central Bank of Israel allocated $45 billion to protect the shekels exchange rate, its value deteriorated, recording the longest series of losses in 39 years, while the Central Banks loss amounted to $7.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves. It is noteworthy that the Governor of the Central Bank of Israel had estimated the cost of the war on Gaza at about 210 billion shekels ($56 billion) for defense and compensation for those displaced from their homes in the south, due to Palestinian resistance operations, or the north, due to the missiles targeting them from Lebanon.    		  		  		  The  center-left French newspaper Liberation, a newspaper of record in France, said that protests are increasing in Israel 3 and a half months after the start of the war on Gaza , and that the opposition has begun its preparations in conjunction with calls from more Israelis to hold early elections in the hope of ousting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The newspaper - in a report by its correspondent from Tel Aviv, Nicolas Roger - began by criticizing former General Gadi Eisenkot - a member of the war cabinet - publicly and surprisingly of Netanyahus policies, saying: What is happening in Gaza today is that the goals of the war have not been achieved, those who talk about... The complete defeat of Hamas . They are not telling the truth. He added, No, when the journalist asked him, Are the decision makers honest with the public?  Eisenkot's comments sparked some criticism, but the former chief of staff cannot be touched, because his son and nephew were killed in Gaza, and he is more capable than others - as the correspondent believes - of understanding the reality and repercussions of Israeli military actions. Therefore, when Eisenkot says that elections are necessary in the coming months, it is a clear message that the opposition will not wait for the end of the war, which will be long - as Netanyahu promised - to force the country to go to the polls.  The correspondent explained that the Prime Minister is trapped in what appears to be a growing turmoil reminiscent of the months preceding last October 7, from protests by hostage families in front of his house to thousands of people demanding his departure in the streets of Tel Aviv, in addition to the torrent of criticism of the new budget.  On the main street that surrounds Tel Aviv from the east, new billboards say, We need elections, in a campaign that appears expensive and of unknown origin. In the background - as the reporter sees - there are veterans who participated in the demonstrations against judicial reform and a number of people from Technology.  Ronen Koehler of the Brothers in Arms leadership believes that there is no point in the campaign as long as Benny Gantz is still in government, adding, What we want is to rebuild the democratic space by encouraging our members to join civil life. Our liberal secular values ??must return. To the forefront and fight for the hearts of Israelis. It is an ambitious project - according to the correspondent - and it is almost ideal to reverse what the extreme Israeli settler right has done over the past 15 years to the point that, although it represents only 5% of the population - as Kohler insists - it has become the one that determines the content of political debate, even in times of war.  As for Netanyahu and his partners, they launched their election campaigns early last December, while the opposition was very late, despite the great anger at Netanyahu, whose opinion polls indicate his loss every time, even though he is the only one who proposes a simple and coherent project for the next day, according to the correspondent. He confirms that there is no going back. To the world before October 7, and therefore no concessions to the Palestinians who are being killed in Gaza.  The reporter concluded that Benny Gantz is the one who will become prime minister if the elections are held today, and he will be at the head of a warlike right-wing government without a clear political project, which indicates that the Israeli opposition still believes that getting rid of Netanyahu will change everything, and that this is the key to a new beginning.     While the Guardian newspaper ruled out the success of attempts to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) and its leaders in the Gaza Strip , the Independent newspaper wrote about clear rifts between Israel and its allies, the United States and Britain. As part of their coverage of developments in the war in the Gaza Strip, international newspapers and magazines focused on the ongoing debate regarding the future of the Gaza Strip, and the disputes it creates between Israel and its allies, in addition to US-Iranian relations in light of the current developments.  While ruling out the success of attempts to eliminate Hamas and its leaders, an article in The Guardian newspaper expects that Israel's plans regarding the future of the Strip will lead to the movement's continued activity, ""which may shift to other arenas that Hamas has been avoiding, and thus its danger will not diminish."" The author of the article believes that ""the most realistic solution is to think about how to integrate Hamas into the authority that governs Gaza after the war, instead of thinking about eradicating it.""  For its part, The Independent newspaper focused on the ""clear rifts"" between Israel and its allies the United States and Britain, which are reflected in officials' statements regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. The newspaper wrote that the rifts come at a time when the voices of thousands of Israelis are rising, demanding the liberation of those detained by the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and the holding of new elections, and amid clear divisions within the War Council over the future of the conflict and post-war plans in Gaza.  For its part, other newspapers and magazines discussed the issue of US-Iranian relations, as The Economist magazine wrote that the attacks and assassinations bring the two countries closer to war. The magazine expects that pressure will increase on US President Joe Biden ""to respond to Iran and its agents in the Middle East so that America does not appear weak... He then risks entering a new war in the election year."" In the same context, Le Monde newspaper published a lengthy investigation in which it stated that the United States, along with other powers, is today paying the price for its neglect of the Houthis growing capabilities, so that they have turned today into active players in the conflict in the Middle East.        Writer Owen Jones in The Guardian newspaper said that Western political and media elites are complicit in the Gaza nightmare , and that they have lost the last vestiges of moral authority forever. The writer explained that US President Joe Biden gave a specific answer last week in the statement he issued on the occasion of the 100th day since the start of the current terror, in which he showed his true sympathy with the plight of the prisoners of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and with their shocked families, but he did not issue a response. There is no mention of the Palestinians about him.  However, the lack of interest by politicians and the media in concealing their contempt for Palestinian life will have major consequences, even though it is not a new thing, as the writer believes; If the powerful countries of the world had not so impudently ignored three quarters of a million Palestinians who were expelled from their homes 76 years ago, with about 15,000 of them violently killed, the seeds of this bitter harvest would not have been sown today.  Owen Jones wondered how many people knew that 234 Palestinians were killed last year, just before October 7, by Israeli forces in the West Bank alone. He continued that if there was some value to the lives of Palestinians, perhaps decades of occupation, siege, illegal settlement, apartheid, violent repression and mass massacres would not have occurred.  Some may have expected that after this deadly massacre, the dam would eventually collapse, because violently killing 10,000 children, amputating legs, or removing the kidneys of others without anesthesia would arouse strong feelings, just as performing caesarean sections without anesthesia and the death of premature infants due to low blood pressure. Body heat and diarrhea would provoke unstoppable disgust.  Although predictions that a quarter of Gaza's population might die within a year due to Israel's destruction of the health care system alone should lead to a loud call to end this injustice, no one has taken action. According to the writer, underestimating the value of Palestinian life is not a hypothetical matter, but rather a statistical fact, as a new study of coverage in major American newspapers says that Israeli deaths are mentioned at a rate of 16 times more than Palestinian deaths, and that human terms such as mother or husband were used much less often to describe Palestinians, while emotional terms such as ""massacre"" were used for Israeli victims.  All of this will have a profound impact, as the writer sees; We must forget any future Western claims regarding human rights and international law, because a large part of the world views this self-justification with contempt, and considers it merely a trick to advance the strategic interests of countries that have become rich at the expense of the rest of the world, after centuries of colonialism characterized by genocide and pigeons. Recent bloodshed such as the Iraq War, and even arming and supporting Israel as it engages in mass murder in Gaza.  He continued that Western political and media elites should not panic about the condition of other countries, but rather about the moral collapse occurring in their countries, because the refusal to treat the Palestinians as human beings has made todays nightmare inevitable, and has permanently torn apart the moral claims used to justify Western hegemony over the world. Consequences that will not be understood until it is too late.      A report on the British University of Portsmouth website confirmed that former US President Donald Trump's victory for a second term in the upcoming presidential elections will mean a return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan ""America First."" The report explained that if Trump wins a second term in the upcoming presidential elections , it is unlikely that Joe Biden will continue attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza, as Trump has been a long-time ally of Israel and has become the first American president to officially and controversially recognize Jerusalem as its capital. In 2017.  It added that Trump will return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan America First, which means withdrawing from military spending and paying attention to internal affairs, which means stopping the free flow of money and weapons from the United States and its proxy wars in Ukraine. A potential Republican candidate winning a second term would have disastrous effects on international diplomacy, according to Le Monde columnist Sylvie Kaufmann: The G7 and NATO summits will once again turn into unpredictable circus moments.   The report added, In continuation of the focus of his first presidency, Trump pledged to transfer thousands of American troops stationed abroad, FBI agents, and Drug Enforcement Administration officials to address the migration crisis on the Mexican border, and this will not only affect the American military presence in various parts of the world. ""It will also have a devastating impact on Mexico, which will have to deal with an increasingly problematic border with the United States.""  The report continued, ""One important difference this time is that Trump and his allies have been planning his next term since he left the White House. He will be surrounded exclusively by his loyalists, will be free from any constrained rational voices, and will be more organized than his first term, so he is unlikely to continue... Trump and Biden's attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza.  The report noted, ""Although much of the concern is focused on Trump's potential re-election, his two main rivals for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, have identified support for aggressive immigration policies and support for Israel as key goals if they win.""    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th was 198, and 534 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of October. Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	     	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian commented on the possibility of the Gaza war expanding amid the tensions that the region has witnessed recently, such as the mutual bombing with Pakistan and the tense situation in southern Lebanon and in the Red Sea. In an interview with CNN, the interviewer said: In a previous interview we conducted with you on October 29... you said that you do not want the war to expand and do not want escalation. Since then, Hezbollah has launched attacks against Israel, and the Houthis are attacking... Ships in the Red Sea. You attacked Iraq , and you attacked Pakistan . It certainly seems that the actions of Iran and its allies do not indicate that you are trying to prevent this war from expanding. It seems that you are encouraging escalation.
Hussein Amir Abdullahian replied, saying: I agree with you...in West Asia now we are witnessing the expansion of the crisis and tensions, but the roots of these tensions are not what happened on October 7th. Hamas is a Palestinian liberation group fighting against the occupation in order to liberate the lands of Palestine. The occupiers, they carried out an operation... Of course we do not approve of the killing of women and children anywhere in the world, but I want to tell you that the roots of that are not what happened on October 7th... The roots of that go back 75 years when the Israeli regime occupied Palestine, Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation. He added: ""We warned that if the attacks, war crimes and genocide against Gaza and the West Bank do not stop, the war will expand and become more comprehensive, and this does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion.""
Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian confirmed that ""the activity of Iranian military advisors in combating terrorism and securing the region will continue strongly."" This is after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard confirmed the killing of 5 Iranian military advisors in Syria, the fifth of whom died of his wounds following the Israeli attack on Saturday morning on Damascus. The Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip and clashes between the Israeli army and Hamas continue for the 118th day, in light of a humanitarian and health catastrophe in the Strip.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said the Zionist regime has resorted to blind assassination attacks to compensate for its failure in achieving the objectives of the war on Gaza. In a meeting in Tehran on Sunday, Amirabdollahian and the head of the parliamentary friendship group of Kuwait and Iran, Marzouq Al-Hubaini, discussed a range of regional issues and bilateral cooperation.
The Iranian foreign minister praised the position and role of the Kuwaiti parliament and government in supporting the oppressed Palestinian nation. Evaluating the current developments and events in Gaza, he pointed to the continuation of the Zionist regime's criminal actions in killing women, children, and the defenseless people of Palestine. ""Although the Zionist enemy has destroyed Gaza on a large scale and martyred tens of thousands of people, it has not achieved any of its goals. So, it tries to compensate for its failure by resorting to blind terrorist actions,"" Amirabdollahian noted, the Foreign Ministrys website reported.
The Israeli regimes crimes against Iran wont go unpunished, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Asked about the Israeli assassination of Iranian military advisers in Syria, Kanaani said at a presser on Monday, The usurping Zionist regimes crimes against the Iranian government have never gone and wont go unpunished. The spokesman warned that Iran will respond to the Israeli crimes in its own way.
Dismissing the Israeli prime ministers threat of military action against Iran, he said such rhetoric reveals the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and the degree of the threats that it poses to regional and world security. The essence of this (Israeli) regime is in contradiction to peace. This regime has always tried to seize every opportunity to promote insecurity in the region and the world, he stated. The spokesman refuted Netanyahus hollow rhetoric, reaffirmed Irans right to respond to the threats, and said the Zionist regime had better think about survival from the quagmire of Gaza.

Allied for Democracy Israeli officials and analysts agree - in their discussions of the repercussions of the war on the Gaza Strip - in their rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state, in a position identical to the position of their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who contradicted the American desire in this context.   	Gideon Sa'ar, a minister in the War Council, spoke of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying, ""It is not possible to establish a demilitarized Palestinian state unless Israel has security control, as it does in the West Bank and intends to do in the Gaza Strip."" He added in a discussion session on Israeli Channel 14, The lands that we hand over to the Palestinians will become a base for aggression against Israel. The minister revealed that when he took the decision to unite between his New Hope party and the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz,  they had a clear agreement to reject the establishment of a state. Palestinian.  	According to Michael Sheams, a political affairs correspondent for Channel 11, the Prime Minister is using the story of the Palestinian state as a kind of political campaign, stressing that large sectors of Israelis oppose the establishment of this state. Gil Tamari, Channel 13's international news editor, explained that US President Joe Biden bypasses Netanyahu, and directly tells the Israeli public, ""I'm offering you a dream plan,"" which means, ""You get a big reward now and you pay the price at some point in the future.""  	He added, ""What is the return? Complete normalization with Saudi Arabia and 6 additional Muslim countries, and an unprecedented security umbrella that Israel will enjoy? The price will be a declaration of intent that will lead to a future path to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be demilitarized and without an army."" He commented, saying, ""This is what the Americans are proposing to the Israeli public because they realize that Netanyahu is not a partner.""  	As for the journalist on Channel 12, he believed that even if Gantz (a minister in the War Council) became prime minister, it would be difficult for him to provide the American president with a response other than that offered by Netanyahu, which is that the chances of establishing a Palestinian state are non-existent. Netanyahu had previously revealed that he had informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any post-war scenario in Gaza, contrary to the American desire.    		            		  		  		  		  According to Arab observers and experts, Benjamin Netanyahu s government failed to neutralize Israels economy and spare it losses like previous wars, especially since the area that caused the Al-Aqsa flood battle ( the Gaza envelope ) is responsible for supplying the Israeli economy with about 75% of the agricultural crops that the occupation needs, but the war It transformed it from an agricultural area into a closed military area.  The Jordanian economist, Dr. Amer Al-Shobaki, painted a bleak picture of the reality and future of the Israeli economy in light of the continuation of the war on the Gaza Strip. He said in his interview with Al-Jazeera Net that the total direct and indirect economic losses of the occupation in its war - which it has been waging against Gaza since the seventh of last October - It reached 165 billion dollars.  Al-Shoubaki added that what is announced by Israel is a small part of the real military losses. The operational cost of this war has reached 280 million dollars per day, the equivalent of 28 billion dollars in the first 100 days of the battle, in addition to the cost of the military vehicles that the resistance announced had been destroyed. Which exceed a thousand armored vehicles and tanks, and these are military losses that the occupation has not announced yet.    Al-Shoubaki summarizes the occupations losses in its war on Gaza as emptying many sectors of Israeli workers, so that they become reserve soldiers in the Israeli army, and their number exceeds 300 thousand employees working in various vital sectors, the most important of which is the technology sector, which supplies Israel with half of its exports, and this sector has suffered losses exceeding 20 billion dollars. Foreign investments became idle as a result of the war on Gaza, causing huge losses, reaching $15 billion, which takes a long time to recover, in addition to stopping the tourism sector, which was damaged - according to what was announced - by 75%, and this sector was generating approximately 20%. Billion dollars to the Israeli treasury annually.  Sheltering and compensating families displaced as a result of the war in the Gaza Strip and in the northern border areas with Lebanon, whose number is estimated at one million settlers, currently living in 280 hotels. This requires huge sums of no less than $10 billion, and compensating them for their commercial and industrial losses that they suffered as a result of the war. Compensating and treating war-wounded civilians and war-wounded soldiers, in addition to compensating the families of dead soldiers, treating the wounded and disabled as a result of the war, and compensating those whose homes were damaged as a result of being hit by Palestinian resistance missiles and Hezbollah missiles, which increases additional costs to the occupation treasury. In the short and long term.  The migration of more than 400,000 Israelis - so far - who hold dual nationalities to the European and American continents, which is reflected in a decrease in government and taxpayer revenues. The loss of Palestinian labor in the construction sector in the territories occupied in 1948, and the flight of Thai labor in agricultural facilities around the Gaza Strip for fear of war, which adds new burdens to the Israeli economy, as a result of the complete cessation of this vital sector.  The navigation crisis continues in the Red Sea, with the Houthi group preventing ships coming towards Israel, or Israeli ones, from sailing through Bab al-Mandab, which has stopped maritime traffic in the Israeli port of Eilat by 95%. The occupation has also become dependent on ships coming from the Mediterranean, which has raised the cost of shipping and caused a sharp rise in the prices of consumer goods and vehicle prices within the occupying state.  The chief economist of the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Shmuel Abramson, expected that the economy would contract by 1.5% if the war on Gaza continued until the end of the current year, after he had expected growth of 2.7% for the year 2024 before the start of the war, according to a report carried by the Israeli economic newspaper Globes.  Economic expert Hossam Ayesh did not stray far from Al-Shoubaki, as he confirmed that Israel did not plan for its war on the Gaza Strip to extend for more than 100 days, because the occupation suffered huge losses on the economic level due to the war, and entered into a real dilemma as a result of the high debts it needs to spend on. Military operations, in addition to its suffering from a severe budget deficit due to the decline in revenues, which means that its credit rating declined from stable to negative, with expectations that it will face a government deficit of 5.3% during the years 2023 and 2024, given the large defense spending imposed by the war.  Ayesh told Al Jazeera Net: ""The economic, military and technological damage incurred by the occupation during the past 100 days exceeded 100 billion dollars, adding that the more the war increased, the greater the percentage of loss."" He continues that the technology sector, which represents the backbone of the Israeli economy - due to its superiority in this field - has begun to decline, noting that tax revenues related to this sector have declined by 80%. Ayesh said, ""The Israeli military reserve called up a large portion of the workers in this sector, accompanied by the state of uncertainty resulting from this war, and all of this has caused particularly heavy losses.""  Earlier, the Accountant General of the Israeli Finance Department, Eli Rotenberg, expected that the proportion of public debt would increase to 62.1% of the gross domestic product in 2023 as a result of the financial repercussions of this war, after expectations indicated a decline of 1% on an annual basis to 59% before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation. According to Globes newspaper. Official data also showed that the budget deficit is expected to rise from 2.25% to 6.6% of GDP during the current year.  According to these data, the financial impact of the war is estimated at about 150 billion shekels ($40.25 billion) for the period 2023-2024, assuming the war ends in the first quarter of this year.  The economic expert, Ayesh, pointed out that the Netanyahu government is hiding the truth about its economic losses in order not to disrupt the course of the battle in the Gaza Strip. However, the Western media - especially the American ones - recently published the truth about the losses that the occupation has incurred since more than 100 days of aggression against the Gaza Strip. This comes - according to Ayesh - despite the fact that Israels budget for the year 2023 - before the war - amounted to 130 billion dollars, which is the largest budget in its history. However, with the outbreak of the war, it was forced to approve an additional budget of 8.1 billion dollars, to meet the wars military needs. Which will lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.7% of GDP last year, then to 5% in 2024.  He explained that although the Central Bank of Israel allocated $45 billion to protect the shekels exchange rate, its value deteriorated, recording the longest series of losses in 39 years, while the Central Banks loss amounted to $7.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves. It is noteworthy that the Governor of the Central Bank of Israel had estimated the cost of the war on Gaza at about 210 billion shekels ($56 billion) for defense and compensation for those displaced from their homes in the south, due to Palestinian resistance operations, or the north, due to the missiles targeting them from Lebanon.    		  		  		  The  center-left French newspaper Liberation, a newspaper of record in France, said that protests are increasing in Israel 3 and a half months after the start of the war on Gaza , and that the opposition has begun its preparations in conjunction with calls from more Israelis to hold early elections in the hope of ousting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The newspaper - in a report by its correspondent from Tel Aviv, Nicolas Roger - began by criticizing former General Gadi Eisenkot - a member of the war cabinet - publicly and surprisingly of Netanyahus policies, saying: What is happening in Gaza today is that the goals of the war have not been achieved, those who talk about... The complete defeat of Hamas . They are not telling the truth. He added, No, when the journalist asked him, Are the decision makers honest with the public?  Eisenkot's comments sparked some criticism, but the former chief of staff cannot be touched, because his son and nephew were killed in Gaza, and he is more capable than others - as the correspondent believes - of understanding the reality and repercussions of Israeli military actions. Therefore, when Eisenkot says that elections are necessary in the coming months, it is a clear message that the opposition will not wait for the end of the war, which will be long - as Netanyahu promised - to force the country to go to the polls.  The correspondent explained that the Prime Minister is trapped in what appears to be a growing turmoil reminiscent of the months preceding last October 7, from protests by hostage families in front of his house to thousands of people demanding his departure in the streets of Tel Aviv, in addition to the torrent of criticism of the new budget.  On the main street that surrounds Tel Aviv from the east, new billboards say, We need elections, in a campaign that appears expensive and of unknown origin. In the background - as the reporter sees - there are veterans who participated in the demonstrations against judicial reform and a number of people from Technology.  Ronen Koehler of the Brothers in Arms leadership believes that there is no point in the campaign as long as Benny Gantz is still in government, adding, What we want is to rebuild the democratic space by encouraging our members to join civil life. Our liberal secular values ??must return. To the forefront and fight for the hearts of Israelis. It is an ambitious project - according to the correspondent - and it is almost ideal to reverse what the extreme Israeli settler right has done over the past 15 years to the point that, although it represents only 5% of the population - as Kohler insists - it has become the one that determines the content of political debate, even in times of war.  As for Netanyahu and his partners, they launched their election campaigns early last December, while the opposition was very late, despite the great anger at Netanyahu, whose opinion polls indicate his loss every time, even though he is the only one who proposes a simple and coherent project for the next day, according to the correspondent. He confirms that there is no going back. To the world before October 7, and therefore no concessions to the Palestinians who are being killed in Gaza.  The reporter concluded that Benny Gantz is the one who will become prime minister if the elections are held today, and he will be at the head of a warlike right-wing government without a clear political project, which indicates that the Israeli opposition still believes that getting rid of Netanyahu will change everything, and that this is the key to a new beginning.     While the Guardian newspaper ruled out the success of attempts to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) and its leaders in the Gaza Strip , the Independent newspaper wrote about clear rifts between Israel and its allies, the United States and Britain. As part of their coverage of developments in the war in the Gaza Strip, international newspapers and magazines focused on the ongoing debate regarding the future of the Gaza Strip, and the disputes it creates between Israel and its allies, in addition to US-Iranian relations in light of the current developments.  While ruling out the success of attempts to eliminate Hamas and its leaders, an article in The Guardian newspaper expects that Israel's plans regarding the future of the Strip will lead to the movement's continued activity, ""which may shift to other arenas that Hamas has been avoiding, and thus its danger will not diminish."" The author of the article believes that ""the most realistic solution is to think about how to integrate Hamas into the authority that governs Gaza after the war, instead of thinking about eradicating it.""  For its part, The Independent newspaper focused on the ""clear rifts"" between Israel and its allies the United States and Britain, which are reflected in officials' statements regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. The newspaper wrote that the rifts come at a time when the voices of thousands of Israelis are rising, demanding the liberation of those detained by the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and the holding of new elections, and amid clear divisions within the War Council over the future of the conflict and post-war plans in Gaza.  For its part, other newspapers and magazines discussed the issue of US-Iranian relations, as The Economist magazine wrote that the attacks and assassinations bring the two countries closer to war. The magazine expects that pressure will increase on US President Joe Biden ""to respond to Iran and its agents in the Middle East so that America does not appear weak... He then risks entering a new war in the election year."" In the same context, Le Monde newspaper published a lengthy investigation in which it stated that the United States, along with other powers, is today paying the price for its neglect of the Houthis growing capabilities, so that they have turned today into active players in the conflict in the Middle East.        Writer Owen Jones in The Guardian newspaper said that Western political and media elites are complicit in the Gaza nightmare , and that they have lost the last vestiges of moral authority forever. The writer explained that US President Joe Biden gave a specific answer last week in the statement he issued on the occasion of the 100th day since the start of the current terror, in which he showed his true sympathy with the plight of the prisoners of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and with their shocked families, but he did not issue a response. There is no mention of the Palestinians about him.  However, the lack of interest by politicians and the media in concealing their contempt for Palestinian life will have major consequences, even though it is not a new thing, as the writer believes; If the powerful countries of the world had not so impudently ignored three quarters of a million Palestinians who were expelled from their homes 76 years ago, with about 15,000 of them violently killed, the seeds of this bitter harvest would not have been sown today.  Owen Jones wondered how many people knew that 234 Palestinians were killed last year, just before October 7, by Israeli forces in the West Bank alone. He continued that if there was some value to the lives of Palestinians, perhaps decades of occupation, siege, illegal settlement, apartheid, violent repression and mass massacres would not have occurred.  Some may have expected that after this deadly massacre, the dam would eventually collapse, because violently killing 10,000 children, amputating legs, or removing the kidneys of others without anesthesia would arouse strong feelings, just as performing caesarean sections without anesthesia and the death of premature infants due to low blood pressure. Body heat and diarrhea would provoke unstoppable disgust.  Although predictions that a quarter of Gaza's population might die within a year due to Israel's destruction of the health care system alone should lead to a loud call to end this injustice, no one has taken action. According to the writer, underestimating the value of Palestinian life is not a hypothetical matter, but rather a statistical fact, as a new study of coverage in major American newspapers says that Israeli deaths are mentioned at a rate of 16 times more than Palestinian deaths, and that human terms such as mother or husband were used much less often to describe Palestinians, while emotional terms such as ""massacre"" were used for Israeli victims.  All of this will have a profound impact, as the writer sees; We must forget any future Western claims regarding human rights and international law, because a large part of the world views this self-justification with contempt, and considers it merely a trick to advance the strategic interests of countries that have become rich at the expense of the rest of the world, after centuries of colonialism characterized by genocide and pigeons. Recent bloodshed such as the Iraq War, and even arming and supporting Israel as it engages in mass murder in Gaza.  He continued that Western political and media elites should not panic about the condition of other countries, but rather about the moral collapse occurring in their countries, because the refusal to treat the Palestinians as human beings has made todays nightmare inevitable, and has permanently torn apart the moral claims used to justify Western hegemony over the world. Consequences that will not be understood until it is too late.      A report on the British University of Portsmouth website confirmed that former US President Donald Trump's victory for a second term in the upcoming presidential elections will mean a return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan ""America First."" The report explained that if Trump wins a second term in the upcoming presidential elections , it is unlikely that Joe Biden will continue attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza, as Trump has been a long-time ally of Israel and has become the first American president to officially and controversially recognize Jerusalem as its capital. In 2017.  It added that Trump will return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan America First, which means withdrawing from military spending and paying attention to internal affairs, which means stopping the free flow of money and weapons from the United States and its proxy wars in Ukraine. A potential Republican candidate winning a second term would have disastrous effects on international diplomacy, according to Le Monde columnist Sylvie Kaufmann: The G7 and NATO summits will once again turn into unpredictable circus moments.   The report added, In continuation of the focus of his first presidency, Trump pledged to transfer thousands of American troops stationed abroad, FBI agents, and Drug Enforcement Administration officials to address the migration crisis on the Mexican border, and this will not only affect the American military presence in various parts of the world. ""It will also have a devastating impact on Mexico, which will have to deal with an increasingly problematic border with the United States.""  The report continued, ""One important difference this time is that Trump and his allies have been planning his next term since he left the White House. He will be surrounded exclusively by his loyalists, will be free from any constrained rational voices, and will be more organized than his first term, so he is unlikely to continue... Trump and Biden's attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza.  The report noted, ""Although much of the concern is focused on Trump's potential re-election, his two main rivals for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, have identified support for aggressive immigration policies and support for Israel as key goals if they win.""    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th was 198, and 534 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of October. Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	     	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Israeli officials and analysts agree - in their discussions of the repercussions of the war on the Gaza Strip - in their rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state, in a position identical to the position of their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who contradicted the American desire in this context.
Gideon Sa'ar, a minister in the War Council, spoke of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying, ""It is not possible to establish a demilitarized Palestinian state unless Israel has security control, as it does in the West Bank and intends to do in the Gaza Strip."" He added in a discussion session on Israeli Channel 14, The lands that we hand over to the Palestinians will become a base for aggression against Israel. The minister revealed that when he took the decision to unite between his New Hope party and the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz,  they had a clear agreement to reject the establishment of a state. Palestinian.
According to Michael Sheams, a political affairs correspondent for Channel 11, the Prime Minister is using the story of the Palestinian state as a kind of political campaign, stressing that large sectors of Israelis oppose the establishment of this state. Gil Tamari, Channel 13's international news editor, explained that US President Joe Biden bypasses Netanyahu, and directly tells the Israeli public, ""I'm offering you a dream plan,"" which means, ""You get a big reward now and you pay the price at some point in the future.""
He added, ""What is the return? Complete normalization with Saudi Arabia and 6 additional Muslim countries, and an unprecedented security umbrella that Israel will enjoy? The price will be a declaration of intent that will lead to a future path to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be demilitarized and without an army."" He commented, saying, ""This is what the Americans are proposing to the Israeli public because they realize that Netanyahu is not a partner.""
As for the journalist on Channel 12, he believed that even if Gantz (a minister in the War Council) became prime minister, it would be difficult for him to provide the American president with a response other than that offered by Netanyahu, which is that the chances of establishing a Palestinian state are non-existent. Netanyahu had previously revealed that he had informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any post-war scenario in Gaza, contrary to the American desire.
According to Arab observers and experts, Benjamin Netanyahu s government failed to neutralize Israels economy and spare it losses like previous wars, especially since the area that caused the Al-Aqsa flood battle ( the Gaza envelope ) is responsible for supplying the Israeli economy with about 75% of the agricultural crops that the occupation needs, but the war It transformed it from an agricultural area into a closed military area.
The Jordanian economist, Dr. Amer Al-Shobaki, painted a bleak picture of the reality and future of the Israeli economy in light of the continuation of the war on the Gaza Strip. He said in his interview with Al-Jazeera Net that the total direct and indirect economic losses of the occupation in its war - which it has been waging against Gaza since the seventh of last October - It reached 165 billion dollars.
Al-Shoubaki added that what is announced by Israel is a small part of the real military losses. The operational cost of this war has reached 280 million dollars per day, the equivalent of 28 billion dollars in the first 100 days of the battle, in addition to the cost of the military vehicles that the resistance announced had been destroyed. Which exceed a thousand armored vehicles and tanks, and these are military losses that the occupation has not announced yet.
Al-Shoubaki summarizes the occupations losses in its war on Gaza as emptying many sectors of Israeli workers, so that they become reserve soldiers in the Israeli army, and their number exceeds 300 thousand employees working in various vital sectors, the most important of which is the technology sector, which supplies Israel with half of its exports, and this sector has suffered losses exceeding 20 billion dollars. Foreign investments became idle as a result of the war on Gaza, causing huge losses, reaching $15 billion, which takes a long time to recover, in addition to stopping the tourism sector, which was damaged - according to what was announced - by 75%, and this sector was generating approximately 20%. Billion dollars to the Israeli treasury annually.
Sheltering and compensating families displaced as a result of the war in the Gaza Strip and in the northern border areas with Lebanon, whose number is estimated at one million settlers, currently living in 280 hotels. This requires huge sums of no less than $10 billion, and compensating them for their commercial and industrial losses that they suffered as a result of the war. Compensating and treating war-wounded civilians and war-wounded soldiers, in addition to compensating the families of dead soldiers, treating the wounded and disabled as a result of the war, and compensating those whose homes were damaged as a result of being hit by Palestinian resistance missiles and Hezbollah missiles, which increases additional costs to the occupation treasury. In the short and long term.
The migration of more than 400,000 Israelis - so far - who hold dual nationalities to the European and American continents, which is reflected in a decrease in government and taxpayer revenues. The loss of Palestinian labor in the construction sector in the territories occupied in 1948, and the flight of Thai labor in agricultural facilities around the Gaza Strip for fear of war, which adds new burdens to the Israeli economy, as a result of the complete cessation of this vital sector.
The navigation crisis continues in the Red Sea, with the Houthi group preventing ships coming towards Israel, or Israeli ones, from sailing through Bab al-Mandab, which has stopped maritime traffic in the Israeli port of Eilat by 95%. The occupation has also become dependent on ships coming from the Mediterranean, which has raised the cost of shipping and caused a sharp rise in the prices of consumer goods and vehicle prices within the occupying state.
The chief economist of the Ministry of Finance in Israel, Shmuel Abramson, expected that the economy would contract by 1.5% if the war on Gaza continued until the end of the current year, after he had expected growth of 2.7% for the year 2024 before the start of the war, according to a report carried by the Israeli economic newspaper Globes.
Economic expert Hossam Ayesh did not stray far from Al-Shoubaki, as he confirmed that Israel did not plan for its war on the Gaza Strip to extend for more than 100 days, because the occupation suffered huge losses on the economic level due to the war, and entered into a real dilemma as a result of the high debts it needs to spend on. Military operations, in addition to its suffering from a severe budget deficit due to the decline in revenues, which means that its credit rating declined from stable to negative, with expectations that it will face a government deficit of 5.3% during the years 2023 and 2024, given the large defense spending imposed by the war.
Ayesh told Al Jazeera Net: ""The economic, military and technological damage incurred by the occupation during the past 100 days exceeded 100 billion dollars, adding that the more the war increased, the greater the percentage of loss."" He continues that the technology sector, which represents the backbone of the Israeli economy - due to its superiority in this field - has begun to decline, noting that tax revenues related to this sector have declined by 80%. Ayesh said, ""The Israeli military reserve called up a large portion of the workers in this sector, accompanied by the state of uncertainty resulting from this war, and all of this has caused particularly heavy losses.""
Earlier, the Accountant General of the Israeli Finance Department, Eli Rotenberg, expected that the proportion of public debt would increase to 62.1% of the gross domestic product in 2023 as a result of the financial repercussions of this war, after expectations indicated a decline of 1% on an annual basis to 59% before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation. According to Globes newspaper. Official data also showed that the budget deficit is expected to rise from 2.25% to 6.6% of GDP during the current year.
According to these data, the financial impact of the war is estimated at about 150 billion shekels ($40.25 billion) for the period 2023-2024, assuming the war ends in the first quarter of this year.
The economic expert, Ayesh, pointed out that the Netanyahu government is hiding the truth about its economic losses in order not to disrupt the course of the battle in the Gaza Strip. However, the Western media - especially the American ones - recently published the truth about the losses that the occupation has incurred since more than 100 days of aggression against the Gaza Strip. This comes - according to Ayesh - despite the fact that Israels budget for the year 2023 - before the war - amounted to 130 billion dollars, which is the largest budget in its history. However, with the outbreak of the war, it was forced to approve an additional budget of 8.1 billion dollars, to meet the wars military needs. Which will lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit to 3.7% of GDP last year, then to 5% in 2024.
He explained that although the Central Bank of Israel allocated $45 billion to protect the shekels exchange rate, its value deteriorated, recording the longest series of losses in 39 years, while the Central Banks loss amounted to $7.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves. It is noteworthy that the Governor of the Central Bank of Israel had estimated the cost of the war on Gaza at about 210 billion shekels ($56 billion) for defense and compensation for those displaced from their homes in the south, due to Palestinian resistance operations, or the north, due to the missiles targeting them from Lebanon.
The  center-left French newspaper Liberation, a newspaper of record in France, said that protests are increasing in Israel 3 and a half months after the start of the war on Gaza , and that the opposition has begun its preparations in conjunction with calls from more Israelis to hold early elections in the hope of ousting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The newspaper - in a report by its correspondent from Tel Aviv, Nicolas Roger - began by criticizing former General Gadi Eisenkot - a member of the war cabinet - publicly and surprisingly of Netanyahus policies, saying: What is happening in Gaza today is that the goals of the war have not been achieved, those who talk about... The complete defeat of Hamas . They are not telling the truth. He added, No, when the journalist asked him, Are the decision makers honest with the public?
Eisenkot's comments sparked some criticism, but the former chief of staff cannot be touched, because his son and nephew were killed in Gaza, and he is more capable than others - as the correspondent believes - of understanding the reality and repercussions of Israeli military actions. Therefore, when Eisenkot says that elections are necessary in the coming months, it is a clear message that the opposition will not wait for the end of the war, which will be long - as Netanyahu promised - to force the country to go to the polls.
The correspondent explained that the Prime Minister is trapped in what appears to be a growing turmoil reminiscent of the months preceding last October 7, from protests by hostage families in front of his house to thousands of people demanding his departure in the streets of Tel Aviv, in addition to the torrent of criticism of the new budget.
On the main street that surrounds Tel Aviv from the east, new billboards say, We need elections, in a campaign that appears expensive and of unknown origin. In the background - as the reporter sees - there are veterans who participated in the demonstrations against judicial reform and a number of people from Technology.
Ronen Koehler of the Brothers in Arms leadership believes that there is no point in the campaign as long as Benny Gantz is still in government, adding, What we want is to rebuild the democratic space by encouraging our members to join civil life. Our liberal secular values ??must return. To the forefront and fight for the hearts of Israelis. It is an ambitious project - according to the correspondent - and it is almost ideal to reverse what the extreme Israeli settler right has done over the past 15 years to the point that, although it represents only 5% of the population - as Kohler insists - it has become the one that determines the content of political debate, even in times of war.
As for Netanyahu and his partners, they launched their election campaigns early last December, while the opposition was very late, despite the great anger at Netanyahu, whose opinion polls indicate his loss every time, even though he is the only one who proposes a simple and coherent project for the next day, according to the correspondent. He confirms that there is no going back. To the world before October 7, and therefore no concessions to the Palestinians who are being killed in Gaza.
The reporter concluded that Benny Gantz is the one who will become prime minister if the elections are held today, and he will be at the head of a warlike right-wing government without a clear political project, which indicates that the Israeli opposition still believes that getting rid of Netanyahu will change everything, and that this is the key to a new beginning.
While the Guardian newspaper ruled out the success of attempts to eliminate the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) and its leaders in the Gaza Strip , the Independent newspaper wrote about clear rifts between Israel and its allies, the United States and Britain. As part of their coverage of developments in the war in the Gaza Strip, international newspapers and magazines focused on the ongoing debate regarding the future of the Gaza Strip, and the disputes it creates between Israel and its allies, in addition to US-Iranian relations in light of the current developments.
While ruling out the success of attempts to eliminate Hamas and its leaders, an article in The Guardian newspaper expects that Israel's plans regarding the future of the Strip will lead to the movement's continued activity, ""which may shift to other arenas that Hamas has been avoiding, and thus its danger will not diminish."" The author of the article believes that ""the most realistic solution is to think about how to integrate Hamas into the authority that governs Gaza after the war, instead of thinking about eradicating it.""
For its part, The Independent newspaper focused on the ""clear rifts"" between Israel and its allies the United States and Britain, which are reflected in officials' statements regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. The newspaper wrote that the rifts come at a time when the voices of thousands of Israelis are rising, demanding the liberation of those detained by the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and the holding of new elections, and amid clear divisions within the War Council over the future of the conflict and post-war plans in Gaza.
For its part, other newspapers and magazines discussed the issue of US-Iranian relations, as The Economist magazine wrote that the attacks and assassinations bring the two countries closer to war. The magazine expects that pressure will increase on US President Joe Biden ""to respond to Iran and its agents in the Middle East so that America does not appear weak... He then risks entering a new war in the election year."" In the same context, Le Monde newspaper published a lengthy investigation in which it stated that the United States, along with other powers, is today paying the price for its neglect of the Houthis growing capabilities, so that they have turned today into active players in the conflict in the Middle East.
Writer Owen Jones in The Guardian newspaper said that Western political and media elites are complicit in the Gaza nightmare , and that they have lost the last vestiges of moral authority forever. The writer explained that US President Joe Biden gave a specific answer last week in the statement he issued on the occasion of the 100th day since the start of the current terror, in which he showed his true sympathy with the plight of the prisoners of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and with their shocked families, but he did not issue a response. There is no mention of the Palestinians about him.
However, the lack of interest by politicians and the media in concealing their contempt for Palestinian life will have major consequences, even though it is not a new thing, as the writer believes; If the powerful countries of the world had not so impudently ignored three quarters of a million Palestinians who were expelled from their homes 76 years ago, with about 15,000 of them violently killed, the seeds of this bitter harvest would not have been sown today.  Owen Jones wondered how many people knew that 234 Palestinians were killed last year, just before October 7, by Israeli forces in the West Bank alone. He continued that if there was some value to the lives of Palestinians, perhaps decades of occupation, siege, illegal settlement, apartheid, violent repression and mass massacres would not have occurred.  Some may have expected that after this deadly massacre, the dam would eventually collapse, because violently killing 10,000 children, amputating legs, or removing the kidneys of others without anesthesia would arouse strong feelings, just as performing caesarean sections without anesthesia and the death of premature infants due to low blood pressure. Body heat and diarrhea would provoke unstoppable disgust.
Although predictions that a quarter of Gaza's population might die within a year due to Israel's destruction of the health care system alone should lead to a loud call to end this injustice, no one has taken action. According to the writer, underestimating the value of Palestinian life is not a hypothetical matter, but rather a statistical fact, as a new study of coverage in major American newspapers says that Israeli deaths are mentioned at a rate of 16 times more than Palestinian deaths, and that human terms such as mother or husband were used much less often to describe Palestinians, while emotional terms such as ""massacre"" were used for Israeli victims.
All of this will have a profound impact, as the writer sees; We must forget any future Western claims regarding human rights and international law, because a large part of the world views this self-justification with contempt, and considers it merely a trick to advance the strategic interests of countries that have become rich at the expense of the rest of the world, after centuries of colonialism characterized by genocide and pigeons. Recent bloodshed such as the Iraq War, and even arming and supporting Israel as it engages in mass murder in Gaza.
He continued that Western political and media elites should not panic about the condition of other countries, but rather about the moral collapse occurring in their countries, because the refusal to treat the Palestinians as human beings has made todays nightmare inevitable, and has permanently torn apart the moral claims used to justify Western hegemony over the world. Consequences that will not be understood until it is too late.
A report on the British University of Portsmouth website confirmed that former US President Donald Trump's victory for a second term in the upcoming presidential elections will mean a return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan ""America First."" The report explained that if Trump wins a second term in the upcoming presidential elections , it is unlikely that Joe Biden will continue attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza, as Trump has been a long-time ally of Israel and has become the first American president to officially and controversially recognize Jerusalem as its capital. In 2017.
It added that Trump will return to the policies he followed in his first term under the slogan America First, which means withdrawing from military spending and paying attention to internal affairs, which means stopping the free flow of money and weapons from the United States and its proxy wars in Ukraine. A potential Republican candidate winning a second term would have disastrous effects on international diplomacy, according to Le Monde columnist Sylvie Kaufmann: The G7 and NATO summits will once again turn into unpredictable circus moments.
The report added, In continuation of the focus of his first presidency, Trump pledged to transfer thousands of American troops stationed abroad, FBI agents, and Drug Enforcement Administration officials to address the migration crisis on the Mexican border, and this will not only affect the American military presence in various parts of the world. ""It will also have a devastating impact on Mexico, which will have to deal with an increasingly problematic border with the United States.""
The report continued, ""One important difference this time is that Trump and his allies have been planning his next term since he left the White House. He will be surrounded exclusively by his loyalists, will be free from any constrained rational voices, and will be more organized than his first term, so he is unlikely to continue... Trump and Biden's attempts to ease Israeli operations in Gaza.
The report noted, ""Although much of the concern is focused on Trump's potential re-election, his two main rivals for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, have identified support for aggressive immigration policies and support for Israel as key goals if they win.""


Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th was 198, and 534 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of October. Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""

Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives.

The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""
It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.
The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.
The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.
More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel.
Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.
The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th was 198, and 534 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of October. Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.
Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.
The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.
According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.
According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.
The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.
At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.
Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.
An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.
The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.
The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""
Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.
In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.
He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""

Tehran, IRNA -- The army of the Zionist regime has used phosphorous munitions to attack southern Lebanon.
The vicinity of Hula in southern Lebanon was attacked by the phosphorous bombs, a Lebanese TV station Al Manar reported early on Sunday.
Hours before the Sunday attack, the Zionist regime's fighters targeted Odaisseh and Markaba in southern Lebanon.
Several rockets also were fired by the Zionist army into Aabbassiyeh town which is located in southern Lebanon, too, according to the report.
From the start of Al Aqsa Storm on October 7, 2023, Lebanon's Hezbollah declared that it would carry out daily operations against the Zionist regime to decrease pressure on the resistance groups in Gaza. Over 24,000 Palestinians including thousands of women and children were killed in Gaza since the date.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is alarmed by statistics revealing a surge in the number of desperate Rohingya refugees reportedly dying or going missing while taking risky boat journeys in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal during 2023.
Some 569 Rohingya were reported to have perished or gone missing last year in South-East Asian waters, with nearly 4,500 embarking on deadly sea journeys - a significant increase on previous years. The number reported missing or dead is the highest since 2014, when the total reached 730.
The findings for 2023 include some shocking details. The total reported dead or missing was over 200 more than in 2022. Survivors have shared horrifying accounts of abuse and exploitation during the journey, including gender-based violence.
Estimates show one Rohingya was reported to have died or gone missing for every eight people attempting the journey in 2023. This makes the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal one of the deadliest stretches of water in the world.
The majority of those attempting these journeys were children and women - some 66 per cent of those embarking on these deadly journeys. The refugees have been departing from Bangladesh and, to a lesser extent, Myanmar.
In a single deadly incident in November 2023, it is feared that some 200 Rohingya lost their lives when their boat was reported to have sunk in the Andaman Sea.
These figures provide a chilling reminder that failure to act to save people in distress results in deaths. More and more desperate people are dying under the watch of numerous coastal States in the absence of timely rescue and disembarkation to the nearest place of safety.
UNHCR calls on regional coastal authorities to take urgent action to prevent future tragedies. Saving lives and rescuing those in distress at sea is a humanitarian imperative and a longstanding duty under international maritime law.
UNHCR is working with impacted States and other stakeholders, including refugees, to develop a comprehensive regional response to address these perilous journeys.
The root causes of these maritime movements must be addressed and the international community must step up to make good on pledges made at the Global Refugee Forum in Geneva in December 2023. These included advancing solutions and enhancing self-reliance for Rohingya refugees to provide hope and reduce the compulsion to take dangerous boat journeys."

By Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide
Statement by Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr Espen Barth Eide in the Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
Thank you, Madam President.
And thank you to France for convening us today at this crucially important moment for the Middle East.
My thoughts are with the people of Gaza, who not only are fleeing from bombardment and military confrontations, but also are suffering from increasing malnutrition. From lack of medical facilities. From lack of clean water. It is a deep humanitarian crisis. One of the most dramatic in recent times, as we have heard from the Secretary General and all the UN agencies that are involved in the process. My thoughts are with the people of Gaza.
My thoughts are with the people of Israel who suffered the horrible, heinous attack of Hamas on October 7th, including the use of sexual and all other types of violence. And my thoughts are with the hostages and relatives of hostages. I call for the immediate release of all the hostages.
My thoughts are also with the people of the West Bank, who are experiencing increasing violence, including settler violence and increased danger to their lives. Nothing would be more tragic  - as we try to move forward on a peaceful path - than seeing a collapse also there - on the West Bank.
And last but not least, my thoughts are with all the UN workers and all the people of the humanitarian community, who are struggling to uphold services. Many of whom have lost their life.
International humanitarian law has to be respected. Violations are unacceptable. If we start accepting violations of clear rules of humanitarian law, the rules will lose their meaning. And the they will be harder to uphold in future conflicts. Humanitarian law has to be upheld equally, across similar situations.
Norway was among the first Western countries to call for a sustained and enduring humanitarian ceasefire. We still do. I'm happy to see that more countries are coming along.
We call for a radical step up of humanitarian efforts, not only volumes. I will echo the Secretary-General in pointing out that we cannot only count trucks. We also must look at the content, the efficiency, the access throughout the whole territory of Gaza. And we must improve coordination. Norway welcomes the appointment of Sigrid Kaag in her new, crucially important and really difficult role.
These are imperatives and we have to get them done. They are prerequisites for any further action. But I also agree with all those who say that these measures are not solutions in themselves. They are necessary. They are imperatives. But the solution must be political. The solution requires that we get back on the political track. A track  Norway has been trying to support for more than three decades after the Oslo process.
As the chair of the AHLC, we see the clear need for a political track towards Palestinian statehood. Norway recognizes the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to have their own state. Not only in theory, but also in practice. We believe that the quest for a Palestinian state is good for the Palestinian people, but also for the people of Israel. We do believe that it is the only route towards a situation in which both communities, both societies, can live in peace with themselves, and each other. And we underline - as we always do - that Israel has the right to necessary security guarantees. Just like the Palestinian people has that right. It must be one, united Palestinian governance for both Gaza and the West Bank, under the Palestinian Authority.
In order to get there, we also have to make sure that we strengthen and help further develop the Palestinian Authority and its institutions. Norway has now made itself available to assist in the transfer of the taxes and levies collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Because the PA has to be upheld and survive this terribly difficult situation. We need legitimate, credible institutions to run the entire Palestinian territory in the future.
I want to commend the good work that is being done by several ministers - many of whom are in this room - from Arab countries and other OIC countries, in trying to develop a comprehensive plan. I believe it is very important that we think about the presence, the near future and the long future. We need to have a credible vision, a credible horizon towards Palestinian statehood.
Norway believes, that pursuing a path to Palestinian statehood should be connected to the idea of broader regional peace, and a regional settlement with the necessary and legitimate security guarantees for both Israel and Palestine.

President,
This Council was set up to deal with exactly these issues, exactly these kind of challenges. I call on all members of the Council to act, and to take that responsibility seriously. In the midst of this deep crisis we see immense suffering in Gaza. We have seen the terror attacks on Israel. We see the rising tide of violence in the Middle East and the risk of spread to the Red Sea and Lebanon and to other parts of the region.
But this is also an opportunity. This is a moment of opportunity for the international community to come together and stop the fighting. To deal with the legitimate security concerns of all sides. To help build a Palestinian state. And then take us all towards a two state solution, which would solve many of the challenges of Israel, of Palestine and of the neighborhood.
I call on you to take on yourself the responsibility that you were entrusted with when we elected the members of the Security Council. This is really the moment to grasp the opportunity.
I thank you for your attention."

Poland is planning a new defense package for Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on January 22 after a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in which they pledged to tackle political disputes that have caused bilateral friction amid Russia's full-scale invasion.
The defense package is ""a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukrainian needs,"" Zelenskiy's press office quoted him as saying.
Zelenskiy also expressed gratitude to Poland for its readiness to start work on a bilateral agreement on security cooperation. The two leaders also hailed proposed plans for joint arms production that Tusk said would ""be a very profitable business for both sides.""
Tusk, who returned as prime minister in December following elections in October, insisted at a joint media briefing that ""no one in Poland has any doubts"" about further supporting Ukraine.
Tusk's office said the Polish prime minister told Zelenskiy that ""nothing builds mutual respect and friendship like selfless help in difficult times"" and assured him that Ukraine is not alone as he delivered a message of friendship toward Ukraine.
""Poland will do everything to increase Ukraine's chances of victory in this war,"" Tusk said. He also slammed leaders who have not fully backed Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia.
""Today, anyone in the free world who pretends to be neutral...deserves the darkest place in political hell,"" Tusk said.
Tusk announced the visit last week, saying he would hold talks on blockades by Polish truckers at the Ukrainian border, which threatened to hurt Ukraine's economic growth and eroded relations between the two countries.
The truckers agreed last week to suspend their protests, which had been aimed at revoking Ukrainian truckers' permit-free access to the European Union, until March 1.
Warsaw and Kyiv have also been at odds over Ukrainian grain exports to Poland and the rest of the European Union.
Tusk said both sides ""have reached a common understanding"" over protests by Polish farmers and truckers.
""We understand the depth of the reasons that led to this kind of situation, but draw attention first and foremost to the depth of the threat that stands before our peoples,"" Zelenskiy said, adding that he welcomed Warsaw's work on the issue.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, in a separate briefing with Tusk, declared a ""reset"" in relations between the two governments and said they would hold regular meetings to strengthen cooperation.
Kyiv will invest ""maximum effort"" to avoid harming Poland's economic interests, he said. But Ukraine also expects Warsaw to lift restrictions on its farmers and producers.
""I am sure that we will find a solution that will benefit Polish farmers and producers and will be safe for the Ukrainian side,"" Tusk said. ""An honest conversation between friends can work wonders.""

MUAP1UJ5N0_6TVE5BUXXZ0V93X,Myanmar court orders sale of jailed Suu Kyi's historic home,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240125-rfa02.htm,"The house will be auctioned for about $90 million, a court source said.
By RFA Burmese 2024.01.25 -- A Yangon court has ruled in favor of Myanmar's junta selling jailed former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi's historic family home, a source close to the court told Radio Free Asia on Thursday.
The court issued an order to allow junta officials to put the house up for auction on Mar. 20 for a reserve price of roughly US$90 million, the source said, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
""The price that has been decided would be divided up after auctioning and selling,"" he said.
""Now, the order has been implemented. It determined the reserve price of the auction and set the date of the auction and when the sale will be made.""
The source claimed the Kamayut District Court in Yangon region that issued Thursday's order was junta-affiliated.
Ownership of the historic lakeside home and yard at 54, University Avenue in Yangon's Bahan township has long been disputed by Aung San Suu Kyi and her brother Aung San Oo.
The house was awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi's mother, Khin Kyi, after Gen. Aung San was assassinated in 1947.
On Aug. 22, 2022, the junta-controlled Union Supreme Court declared the house would be auctioned under Aung San Oo's appeal.
Aung San Suu Kyi lived there for almost 15 years under house arrest during the military regime. The shadow National Unity Government has designated the house a national cultural heritage site and announced that legal action will be taken if the junta sells it.
Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested along with former President Win Myint and other leaders of the deposed National League for Democracy party shortly after the military seized power in a Feb. 2021 coup.
The junta sentenced the 78-year-old to 33 years in prison for 19 charges. Last August she was partially pardoned for five of them as part of a general amnesty, reducing her sentence to 27 years.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was initially jailed in solitary confinement in Yangon's Insein Prison. It's not clear where she is currently being held.

January 22, 2024
WASHINGTON -- Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets   Control (OFAC) designated Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO for   providing assistance to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force   (IRGC-QF) and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. OFAC is   also designating three leaders and supporters of one of the IRGC-QF's   main Iran-aligned militias in Iraq, Kata'ib Hizballah (KH), as well as a   business that moves and launders funds for KH. Today's action   underscores the ongoing threat the IRGC-QF and its proxy network pose to   U.S. personnel and the region. KH has carried out a series of sharply   escalating drone and missile attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and   Syria since Hamas's horrific attack on Israel on October 7. KH and other   Iran-aligned militia groups in Iraq have consistently issued statements   in support of Hamas's terrorism and declared their commitment to   attacking U.S. personnel.
""Iran and its proxies have sought to   abuse regional economies and use seemingly legitimate businesses as   cover for funding and facilitating their attacks,"" said Under Secretary   for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson. ""The United   States will continue to disrupt Iran's illicit activities aimed at   undermining the stability of the region.""
Today's action is being   taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, which   targets terrorists and their supporters. The Treasury Department   designated the IRGC-QF as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT)   pursuant to E.O. 13224 on October 25, 2007 for providing support to   multiple terrorist groups, and the Department of State designated the   group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) pursuant to the   Immigration and Nationality Act on April 8, 2019. State designated KH as   an SDGT pursuant to E.O. 13224 and as a FTO pursuant to the Immigration   and Nationality Act on July 2, 2009.
For several years, Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad has   supported the operations of the IRGC-QF and its proxies by delivering   materiel and personnel throughout the region. Fly Baghdad flights have   delivered shipments of weapons to Damascus International Airport in   Syria for transfer to members of the IRGC-QF and Iran-aligned militia   groups on the ground in Syria, including the Syrian Arab Republican   Guard, Lebanese Hizballah, KH, and the KH-affiliated Abu al-Fadl   al-Abbas Brigade. OFAC designated the Syrian Arab Republican Guard in   2016 for its role in perpetuating violence on the Syrian people, and   State designated Hizballah as an FTO in 1997 and as an SDGT in 2001 for   engaging in acts of terror. Fly Baghdad has delivered to these groups   operating in Syria a range of weapons, including Iranian-made Fateh,   Zulfiqar, and al-Fajr series missiles, as well as AK-47s, RPG-7s, and   other grenades and machine guns.
KH has been using Fly Baghdad to   transport fighters, weapons, and money to Syria and Lebanon to prop up   the Syrian regime. KH leaders used Fly Baghdad flights on multiple   occasions to transport bags of U.S. currency and U.S.-made weapons   obtained through battlefield collection from Iraq to Lebanon. KH sent   fighters from Iraq to Lebanon on flights operated by Fly Baghdad and   U.S.-designated Al-Nasr Wings to attend special operations training run   by Hizballah. In October 2023, following Hamas's horrific terrorist   attack on Israeli civilians, Fly Baghdad was involved in the transfer of   hundreds of Iraqi fighters, including fighters affiliated with   U.S.-designated terrorist organization and Iranian proxy militia Asa'ib   Ahl al-Haq (AAH), in support of the Iranian proxies' attacks on Israel.
Fly   Baghdad is being designated for having materially assisted, sponsored,   or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods   or services to or in support of, the IRGC-QF.
Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani (al-Shabbani)   is the CEO of Fly Baghdad. Al-Shabbani is being designated for owning   or controlling, directly or indirectly, Fly Baghdad.
OFAC is also identifying two Iraq-registered aircraft owned by Fly Baghdad, with tail numbers YI-BAF and YI-BAN, as blocked property in which Fly Baghdad has an interest.
Hossein Moanes al-Ibudi â known publicly as Hossein Moanes â   is a senior member of KH and currently the head of KH's political   party, Harakat Hoquq. Hossein Moanes was previously KH's chief of   government relations, and in that capacity was involved with many   aspects of KH's activities, including KH's plans for gathering   intelligence on, kidnapping, or even assassinating Iraqis identified as   working with the United States as well as planning terrorist attacks on   civilian targets with the help of the IRGC-QF.
Riyad Ali Hussein al-Azzawi (al-Azzawi)   is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) specialist and an engineer for the   Popular Mobilization Committee's (PMC) Directorate of Technical   Equipment (DTE), which is headed by U.S.-designated terrorist and former   KH official Salah Mahdi Hantush al-Maksusi (al-Maksusi). OFAC   designated al-Maksusi in 2012 for his involvement in KH's attacks on   U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. Al-Azzawi and the PMC DTE maintain   links with KH and are involved in training Iraqi fighters on a wide   range of procured or manufactured weapons. Al-Azzawi's fingerprints were   found on an Iranian missile that was launched in the vicinity of U.S.   forces in Iraq in 2021.
Awqad Muhsin Faraj al-Hamidawi (Awqad al-Hamidawi),   the youngest brother of U.S.-designated KH Secretary General Ahmad   al-Hamidawi, directs KH's businesses and aspects of KH's financial   portfolio. He raises funds for KH through commercial businesses, manages   KH's money laundering operations, and is involved in KH's cross-border   smuggling activities. Awqad al-Hamidawi manages Baghdad-based Al-Massal Land Travel and Tourism Company (Al-Massal),   which KH uses to generate revenue and launder money. KH has used   Al-Massal to evade taxes on large quantities of illegal imports and to   illegally confiscate land and other physical property from Iraqis for   KH's use.
Hossein Moanes, al-Azzawi, and Awqad al-Hamidawi are   being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having   materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or   technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, KH.   Al-Massal is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for   being owned, controlled, or directed by Awqad al-Hamidawi.
As   a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of   the designated persons described above that are in the United States or   in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be   reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or   indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one   or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general   or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC's regulations   generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or   transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in   property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.
In addition,   financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain   transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and individuals may   expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action.   The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of   funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated   person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,   or services from any such person.
The power and integrity of   OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC's ability to designate and add   persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List   (SDN List), but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN   List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to   punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For   information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC   list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC's Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.

MWJZEY8VBZ_6HNKS9XEX6TOVQ3,"Brainwashing still a global threat, new book on China says",_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/taiwan/2024/taiwan-240122-rfa01.htm,"Editors hope the Taiwan-published book will educate people about the 'cognitive warfare' waged by Communist Party.
By Hsia Hsiao-hwa and Huang Chun-mei for RFA Mandarin 2024.01.22 -- Brainwashing the public through mass propaganda campaigns by the Chinese Communist Party and other authoritarian regimes is a global threat, according to political scholars who recently published a new book on the topic.
The book, ""Brainwashing in Mao's China and Beyond,"" takes an in-depth look, through the lenses of political science, sociology and international relations, at the kind of ""cognitive warfare"" waged by the Communist Party from the Mao era onwards, co-editor Xia Ming told RFA in an interview on Monday.
Xia hopes the book will be a ""vaccine"" against the propaganda pumped out by the party as a way to stifle dissent and shore up its grip on power.
Taiwan's 23 million inhabitants got a heavy dose of cross-border Chinese propaganda in the run-up to the Jan. 13 general election, co-editor and Chinese-American Cultural Revolution historian Song Yongyi told a recent symposium.
Song said the recent attempts by China to spook Taiwan's voters into complying with their constant negative messaging is just one among many examples showing that brainwashing is still being used, and still poses a threat to global stability.
While Taiwan is governed as a sovereign state under the 1911 Republic of China, whose leaders and officials fled there after losing the civil war to Mao Zedong's communists in 1949, Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly said that Taiwan must be ""unified"" with China, and refused to rule out the use of military force to annex the island.
""Communist regimes haven't been completely destroyed, and some totalitarian regimes have continued to develop in the post-Mao era, like Xi Jinping's regime,"" Song said, citing Russia under Vladimir Putin and its invasion of Ukraine.
""This is still a global problem today - it's not just a problem in China or Taiwan,"" he said.
Origin of term
The term ""brainwashing"" is a direct translation of the Chinese æ´è (xÇnÇo - ""wash brains"") that was first used in English by U.S. journalist Edward Hunter in 1950 to describe how the Chinese government got people to cooperate with them during the Korean War.
Later research found similar processes at work in Nazi Germany, and among criminal organizations including human traffickers.
""Among the tactics used by the Chinese Communist Party to [try to] intervene in Taiwan's election was the claim that, if Taiwan allows the Democratic Progressive Party to come to power, there will be immediate war,"" said Song.
""The Chinese Communist Party has been spreading such pessimism for a long time, telling Taiwan it can't win,"" he said. ""[The message is] if we want to defeat you, we can.""
""Even some [political] leaders in Taiwan have accepted this brainwashing,"" Song said.
Taiwan's Central Election Commission last week complained to TikTok about 105 videos posted to the platform it said were deepfakes targeting candidates in the Jan. 13 election. By Monday, TikTok had removed more than half of them.
The Chinese-owned video-sharing platform has been repeatedly described by Taiwan officials and national security personnel as a ""threat to national security,"" accusing it of peddling ""digital opium"" to the island's young people.
The book includes chapters from Pei Yiran on the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Ding Shu on the 1958 ""Confess to the Party"" movement, Wu Guoguang on brainwashing, propaganda and ""cognitive warfare,"" and from Yu Maochun on the impact of Chinese Communist Party propaganda on the international community.
There are also contributions on its use in prisons, textbooks, literature and movies, with links to similar practices under Kim Jong-un and by fascist regimes.
Suspicion of the U.S.
Suspicion of the United States is a key theme of propaganda and infowars originating in Beijing, Xia said, citing a chapter contributed by Li You-tan and Yang Xiujing.
Such themes have previously been used to target previous elections in Taiwan and undermine its democracy, while belittling the United States, he told RFA in an interview on Monday.
""When [scholars in] Western countries study brainwashing, they actually help each of us to resist brainwashing ... to protect the independence of our thoughts.""
""The Chinese Communist Party does the opposite,"" Xia said. ""They take the best and worst things in the world and throw them into the vat, to use against its people.""
""We need medicines to deal with this [thought-]virus,"" he said. ""This book hopes to contribute by offering everyone a vaccine against it.""
Li You-tan, professor at Taiwan's National Chengchi University, said one example of Chinese government brainwashing is referring to aspirations to independence as ""poison.""
""According to the manipulative language of the Chinese Communist Party, independence is the same as poison,"" Li said. ""This is a form of brainwashing.""
""The manipulation here is aimed at 1.4 billion [Chinese] people, because Taiwan already is independent.""
Same family
Another buzzword used by Beijing to bolster its territorial claims is the description of Taiwanese and Chinese people as coming from the same ""race"" or ""family,"" suggesting that anyone who works against ""unification"" is betraying their ancestors, Huang Ching-Lung of the Taipei Trust in Democracy Association told the symposium.
""Some people really take this on board,"" Huang said, citing comments by former Kuomintang president Ma Ying-jeou during a trip to mainland China last year.
Political YouTuber Mr. Shen said Chinese people have been brainwashed since childhood, including through the use of textbooks during compulsory education.
""A lot of people criticize those of us who oppose he Communist Party by saying we have been brainwashed by Western forces and Western media,"" Shen said. ""But that completely distorts the definition of brainwashing.""
""There is one prerequisite for brainwashing, and it is this: it must prevent you from getting hold of any other information,"" he said. ""But in the West, the information we see is diverse and conflicting, so whether you believe what the left or the right says becomes a matter of personal choice.""
Shen said he managed to rid himself of his early brainwashing, which included the belief that Taiwan could never be independent, by reading widely from overseas sources.
""When I had received that different information, I digested and analyzed it in my own mind, and formed my own independent judgment,"" he said. ""That's how I avoided being brainwashed.""

KALININGRAD, Russia (Sputnik) - Russia knows against who the NATO drills are held and has never had any illusions about this matter, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.
On Wednesday, NATO spokesman Dylan White announced the launch of Steadfast Defender 2024, the alliance's largest military exercise in recent decades.
""The exercises are rather unprecedented, and they do not hide who they are conducting these exercises against. Actually, we have never had illusions, we know what the NATO military infrastructure is,"" Peskov told reporters.
NATO announced last Thursday that it would kick off Steadfast Defender 2024 in late January. The exercises, which will take place in the Atlantic and Europe, will involve some 90,000 troops from 31 allies and Sweden. They will last several months.
During the drills, the allies plan to test out a conflict scenario against a ""near-peer adversary"" in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one ally is considered an attack against the entire NATO and allows for the provision of appropriate assistance.

Monday, 22 January 2024 6:01 AM
Fighters from the Lebanese Hezbollah resistance movement have thwarted an Israeli military incursion into the southern part of Lebanon, amid strikes by the group against the regime's positions, in response to the ongoing Israeli genocidal campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Lebanon's Arabic-language al-Manar television channel, citing a Hezbollah statement, reported that the group had targeted a gathering of Israeli forces stationed at an outpost in the town of Zar'it, close to the border with Lebanon, early on Monday. A number of the soldiers were injured as a result.
The statement added that the troops were preparing to carry out an offensive against an area in southern Lebanon.
The development came hours after Hezbollah announced in a separate statement that it had launched a heavy-caliber Burkan (Volcano) missile at 4:45 p.m. (1445 GMT) on Sunday, targeting a gathering of Israeli soldiers at the Hadab al-Bustan site. There were casualties among the forces.
Lebanese resistance fighters also targeted Israeli soldiers at an outpost in Ruwaisat al-Qarn area in the occupied Shebaa Farms with a salvo of rockets, causing casualties among the forces.
The Israeli regime launched its devastating hostilities in the Gaza Strip on October 7 after the territory's Hamas-led Palestinian resistance groups carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The Israeli military has also been carrying out attacks against the Lebanese territory since then, prompting retaliatory strikes from Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah in support of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.
The movement has vowed to keep up its retaliatory operations as long as the Tel Aviv regime continues its onslaught on Gaza.
The Israeli campaign in Gaza has killed at least 25,105 people, most of them women and children. More than 62,000 individuals have also been wounded."

By Lee Jeong-Ho for RFA 2024.01.22 -- South Korea and the United Kingdom have initiated their Free Trade Agreement renegotiations, aimed at better encompassing the latest bilateral advancements in chips and supply chain cooperation.
The effort to enhance cooperation in areas such as semiconductor production and future industries adds weight to U.S. President Joe Biden's strategy to create an alternative global supply chain that knits democratic nations closer together while requiring less of China's input.
Delegations comprising approximately 50 representatives from each side began their three-day FTA renegotiations in Seoul Tuesday, South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy said in a statement.
Seoul and London are set to discuss ways to ""upgrade"" their existing agreement, as well as reflect ""new trade norms"" in the deal, including digitalization, supply chains, clean energy and bioeconomy, according to the ministry.
The talks will solidify the ""development of a comprehensive and forward-looking strategic trade relationship by exploring the incorporation of new trade norms in various fields,"" the ministry added.
The existing deal, signed in 2019 and came into effect in Jan. 2021, was the first FTA the UK signed with an Asian country as it faced Brexit. The agreement, however, primarily focused on market access for goods and services, neglecting the latest global trade norms amid growing economic-security concerns, particularly in areas such as digital trade and supply chains.
South Korea's trade minister Jeong In-gyo said during the negotiations in Seoul that the two nations must work together in response to both domestic and international uncertainties.
""The global trade order is undergoing rapid changes, with the spread of protectionism worldwide and the swift restructuring of global supply chains,"" Jeong said.
Cutting dependence on Chinese components and resources is seen as a derisking exercise for businesses, given that Beijing has intertwined politics with economics and imposed measures on countries that make political decisions contrary to its interests.
The latest development follows the agreements made between South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during the summit in London in November, where the two vowed to further strengthen their economic and technological cooperation, from semiconductors to space technology.
At that time, the two nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a stable supply chain for the future, while also pledging to cooperate in artificial intelligence, digital technology, nuclear and space technology, biotechnology, quantum technologies, and renewable energy.
South Korea has recently been actively involved in talks with other democratic nations, including the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, Indonesia, India and Japan, a move designed to diversify key resource supply chains to reduce dependence on specific countries.
There has been growing fear in Seoul over the possibility of China using its dominant control of essential resources, such as rare earth materials, as a means of strategic influence in international politics. Such a concern is particularly relevant given the potential impact on crucial South Korean industries like semiconductors and electric vehicles, which could lead to significant economic disruption.
Earlier this month, South Korea also reorganized its National Security Office to prioritize ""economic security,"" reflecting a growing global trend where countries are combining their economic and political tactics to optimize their diplomatic interests.

January 24, 2024 - Ottawa - National Defence/Canadian Armed Forces
The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is set to participate in the largest   NATO exercise in decades that will serve to rehearse NATO's Deterrence   and Defence plans to counter threats to the Euro-Atlantic area.
Approximately 1,000 CAF sailors, soldiers, aviators, and special   forces members, will demonstrate NATO's ability to conduct sustained,   multi-domain defensive operations over a period of several months,   simulating an Article 5 attack by an adversary with similar   capabilities.
The exercise will run from the end of January until the end of May   2024, and is divided into two main parts. The first part will be largely   maritime based and will focus on defence of the North Atlantic and   Arctic waters, while the second part will test NATO's ability to rapidly   deploy reinforcements across all domains in defence of Central and   Eastern Europe.
CAF assets that will be participating include Canadian patrol frigate HMCS Charlottetown with an embarked CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, and the Canadian-led   enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group in Latvia, including for the   first time, a Canadian Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank squadron.
The exercise will also serve as an important milestone for the   Canadian Army's future Forward Land Forces Multinational Brigade Latvia,   as the second part of the exercise will see the future command team   integrate with their higher NATO command in the planning and execution   of defensive combat operations.
NATO is a cornerstone of Canada's Defence Policy, and Canada has been   contributing to NATO's enhanced defence and deterrence measures in   Europe since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. This exercise will provide a   valuable opportunity to strengthen the CAF's ability to project,   integrate, and sustain operations within the NATO command and control   structure.
""Canada's participation in Exercise STEADFAST   DEFENDER sends a strong message about our ability to operate with NATO   Allies and our continued contribution to the defence of Europe. Canada   remains unwavering in its commitments to defend our shared values and   interests, and to be a reliable partner in peace and security.""
The Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence
""The deployment of CAF personnel and assets   alongside NATO and Allied forces in Alliance territory serves as a   powerful and unmistakable message of deterrence to potential adversaries   and reassurance to Allies. This collective display of strength and   readiness reinforces our commitment to safeguarding the security and   stability of the region, sending a clear signal that any threat to our   shared values and interests will be met with a unified and resolute   response.""

""The next few months will see our sailors,   soldiers, and aviators engage in rigorous training and operational   activities in diverse and challenging environments. This period will not   only test their skills and capabilities but also provide an opportunity   to forge strong and valuable partnerships with our NATO allies and   partners, further enhancing our collective readiness and   interoperability.""

In development for over three years, STEADFAST   DEFENDER 24 will see over 90,000 military personnel, as well as more   than 50 naval assets, over 80 aircraft, and over 1,100 combat vehicles,   exercised across multiple domains (maritime, land, air space, and cyber)   through a series of integrated plans, overseen by an enhanced command   structure.
HMCS Charlottetown will deploy for a   period of roughly 7 weeks and will participate in live exercises   designed to provide tactical training for the NATO Standing Maritime   Groups. Canada is set to assume command of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2   this summer.
Canadian Army personnel will participate to   exercise CRYSTAL ARROW in Latvia in March, as well as exercise SPRING   STORM in Estonia in May. Additionally, Canadian Special Operation Forces   Command members will participate in exercise NORDIC RESPONSE in Norway   in March. These exercises fall under the wider umbrella of STEADFAST   DEFENDER 24 and are opportunities for soldiers to closely work with our   NATO allies.
During the second half of the exercise, the   Canadian Army will deploy over 100 additional vehicles including Light   Armoured Vehicles (LAV) 6.0 and Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicles (TAPV)   to Latvia as part of the commitment to scale the existing Battle Group   in Latvia to a combat-capable Multinational Brigade Latvia. In Summer   2024, Canada will also deploy four CH-146 Griffon helicopters to Latvia   and periodically deploy CH-147 Chinooks as well, starting in the Fall of   2025.
Op REASSURANCE is Canada's contribution to NATO   deterrence and defence measures in Central and Eastern Europe and is   Canada's largest over seas mission with approximately 1,000 personnel   deployed. The mission is set to grow to up to 2,200 persistently   deployed by 2026."
N9REDEJRVH_H8ZTA1BNE8RQYL3,Defense chief: Military to be used for safeguarding Philippine access to sea resources,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-rfa01.htm,"Gilberto Teodoro outlines a new concept for defending the Philippines' jurisdiction in South China Sea.
By Camille Elemia for BenarNews 2024.01.24 -- The Philippine armed forces will seek to ensure the country has ""unimpeded"" access to natural resources within its waters in the South China Sea, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro said this week as he signaled a more defiant strategy toward China.
In a major policy speech on Tuesday night, Teodoro spoke at length about his department's ""Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense"" concept which, he said, aims to ensure that Filipinos will benefit from the exploitation of resources in the mineral-rich waterway. Transcripts of the speech at the Manila Overseas Press Club were only released Wednesday.
The implementation of the strategy will ""guarantee as much as possible ... unimpeded and peaceful exploration and exploitation of all natural resources"" within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for Philippine nationals, corporations, and others authorized by the Philippine government, he said.
""[W]e are evolving into a defense concept which projects our power into our areas where we must protect and preserve our resources,"" Teodoro said.
China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, with the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan having overlapping territorial claims. China lately has intensified its harassment of Philippine ships and boats in the West Philippine Sea, the name given by Filipinos to South China Sea waters within its EEZ.
Manila has been looking to tap resources in the potentially mineral- and gas-rich sea. During his time in office (2016-22), President Rodrigo Duterte pursued warm ties with Beijing.
In talks with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, he sought joint sea exploration activities with China. That angered Philippine nationalist groups, who protested against what they saw as Chinese encroachment to undersea natural riches that belong to the Filipino people.
Last January, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled as unconstitutional an exploration agreement between the Philippines, China and Vietnam because, it said, natural resources were reserved only for Filipinos.
""We are a small archipelagic country, the land mass is getting smaller, our population is getting bigger, our resource needs are exponentially increasing. These resources must be secured for the future generations,"" Teodoro said in his speech on Tuesday.
""And if we do not stand up to the illegal and unilateral encroachment of these resources through a distorted nine- or ten-dash line, which nobody in the world accepts then we will be guilty of acquiescence and can be open to a rewriting of international law,"" he said, referring to China's own version of its territorial claims in the waterway.
Philippine laws, anchored in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), should be respected by China, he added.
""That is the bottom line. We cannot meet halfway with China in that because it is forcing us, without our choice, to be its sole partner in developing those resources which rightly belong to Filipino citizens and their posterity; Rightly belong to them for them to exploit and explore with whomever they choose. This is not China's property at all, the resources beneath the sea,"" Teodoro said.
Officials at the Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond on Wednesday to BenarNews requests for comment.
More alliances, joint activities
Another way for Manila to implement its new defense strategy is to pick up the pace of joint military activities with allies and partners, Teodoro said.
""We will increase the tempo of our activities with allies and other major partners not only in the West Philippine Sea but in other areas of the country,"" he said. ""We will exercise these partnerships to the full and it is within our unquestionable right to do so as a sovereign country.""
The Philippines has military pacts in place with the United States, its oldest defense ally, and with Australia. Manila is also in the ""last stretch"" of signing a Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan to allow the exchange and training of the two countries' military forces.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed a separate memorandum of understanding (MOU) on defense cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada.
""With other countries, the MOU list is growing. This will allow us to access on a government-to- government basis different capabilities,"" the defense chief said.
These activities and commitments, he said, were based on a ""common understanding"" of a rules-based international order and the primacy of UNCLOS.
In July 2016, an international arbitration court in The Hague ruled against China and in favor of the Philippines, which had filed a lawsuit to challenge Beijing's claims in the South China Sea. China, although a signatory to the UNCLOS, has refused to abide by the verdict.

ASTANA (Sputnik) - Russia sees no intentions and aspirations on the part of the United States to withdraw its military contingent from Syria, Russian special presidential envoy for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev said Wednesday.
""We do not see any aspirations or intentions on the part of the American side to withdraw its military contingent yet, although the situation there has quite worsened. The Americans are also suffering quite significant losses, but they continue to remain there,"" Lavrentyev told a briefing.
Iranian news agency Tasnim reported last week, citing sources, that the US was evacuating its Hemo military base located near the airport of the city of Qamishli in northeastern Syria after repeated attacks by ""Iraqi resistance"" forces.
The 21st Astana International Meeting on Syria is taking place in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, from Wednesday to Thursday after a joint request of the guarantor countries of the Astana Format - Russia, Turkey and Iran - as well as the Syrian government and opposition, the United Nations and the observer countries - Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. The preliminary agenda of the meeting includes the development of the regional situation in Syria, efforts for a comprehensive settlement and the humanitarian situation in the country, and the mobilization of the international community's efforts to promote its post-conflict reconstruction.
The US military illegally controls territories in eastern and northeastern Syria in the provinces of Deir ez-Zor, Hasakah and Raqqa, where Syria's largest oil and gas fields are located. Official Damascus has repeatedly called the presence of American troops on its territory occupation and state piracy for oil theft.

At least nine people were killed and another 75 wounded Wednesday in Khan Younis as tank shelling hit a United Nations training center, where 800 displaced Palestinians were housed in the southern Gaza city, a U.N. relief official said.
Israeli forces were reported advancing through the city in the fourth month of the war with Hamas militants. Palestinian officials said Israeli forces cut off access to southern Gaza's main hospitals and the key escape route for hundreds of thousands of people who have sought refuge in Khan Younis from fighting in central and northern Gaza.
Palestinians displayed video showing black smoke pouring into the sky above the training center run by UNRWA, the U.N. relief organization for Palestinians.
The U.S., which has been a key Israeli ally in its war against Hamas, condemned the latest assault that killed civilians, with the State Department saying, ""We deplore today's attack on the U.N.'s Khan Younis training center.""
State Department spokesman Vedant Patel added, ""You've heard me say it before, you've heard [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] say it before, but civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected. And humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need.""
Asked about the shelling, the Israeli military said the wider Khan Younis area was a significant base of Hamas militants.
""Dismantling Hamas' military framework in western Khan Younis is the heart of the logic behind the operation,"" it said.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, assailed the attack and said the number of dead was likely to increase.
""Once again, a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini said on X, adding that the compound had been clearly marked as a U.N. facility, and its coordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities.
Meanwhile, talks are continuing on a new 30-day cease-fire during which Israeli hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel would be freed and more aid would enter Gaza, the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea.
U.S. special envoy Brett McGurk was in Doha, Qatar, to discuss the possibility of a halt in the fighting. A weeklong truce in late November led to the release of about 100 Israeli hostages and 240 Palestinians from Israeli detention.
The war started October 7 with the Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and the seizure of the hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 25,000 people, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry.
But the fighting rages on, with U.N. relief chief in Gaza Thomas White announcing the newest attack on X: ""Attack on Khan Younis Training Centre this afternoon â two tank rounds hit building that shelters 800 people â reports now 9 dead and 75 injured.""
The Israeli military said it had killed ""numerous"" squads of gunmen ""with sniper, tank and aerial fire"" in the Khan Younis area.
Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said in a statement: ""The occupation is isolating hospitals in Khan Younis and carrying out massacres in the western area of the city.""
Israel said its troops carried out airstrikes and ground attacks throughout Gaza on Wednesday, while warning people in the northern parts of Khan Younis to evacuate, the latest such order that Israel said is meant to protect civilians from the fighting.
But with the war moving further south, and nearly all the population having fled their homes, there are fewer and fewer safe places for civilians to go.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Tuesday of the ""heartbreaking and catastrophic"" effects of the war on Palestinian civilians.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the evacuation order in Khan Younis affected an area with 88,000 residents, in addition to an estimated 425,000 displaced people sheltering in schools and other sites. The area is also home to 20% of the ""remaining partially functioning hospitals across the Gaza Strip,"" the agency said.
Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

Tehran, IRNA -- Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has reiterated that the United Nations has lost its effectiveness regarding the Israeli regime's genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.
""The United Nations has lost its effectiveness in this matter and has gone to the sidelines,"" President Raisi said at a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Ankara on Wednesday.
Raisi stressed that those who have committed crimes against the Palestinians must be held accountable.
The Iranian president said that Palestine is the most important issue of the Islamic world and humanity, adding that the United States is responsible for the Israeli atrocities in Gaza because of its support of the regime.
Raisi said that regional cooperation was the only solution to address terrorism in the region. ""Iran-Turkiye cooperation in the fight against terrorism is of great importance,"" he added.
The president said Iran regards the security of Turkiye and other regional countries as its own security.
""We are determined to combat terrorism for the security of Turkiye and the countries in the region,"" he noted.
Raisi, heading a political and economic delegation to participate in the eighth meeting of Iran-Turkiye Supreme Council of Economic Cooperation, arrived in Ankara earlier on Wednesday and was welcomed by Erdogan.
The two presidents had a private meeting before holding the joint press conference.

Iraq's foreign ministry says Baghdad and Washington have agreed to set up a committee to start talks to set a timetable for a phased withdrawal of American forces from the Arab country.
In a statement released on Thursday, the ministry said the talks on the future of the US-led military coalition in Iraq are set to take place between military officials.
The two countries agreed to form working groups that would eventually lead to formulating ""a specific and clear timeline... and to begin the gradual reduction of its (the coalition's) advisers on Iraqi soil,"" the statement read.
The ministry noted the timeline would be contingent on evaluating the ""threat posed by IS and its danger"" as well as the ""reinforcement of the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.""
In a statement, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed meetings ""in the coming days"" to discuss the ""transition"" of the coalition based on the outcomes of the Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue held between the two countries in August.
The statement comes days after Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that it was necessary to ""immediately begin a dialogue, to reach an understanding and a timetable regarding the end of the mission of international advisers.""
Senior Iraqi officials have said the end of the US-led coalition was a necessity for the security and stability of Iraq.
Longstanding calls by Iraqi factions for the US-led coalition's departure have gained steam in the wake of a series of US strikes on Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), which are part of Iraq's security forces.
Iraq has condemned the US strikes, not least a recent attack against a senior PMU commander in the heart of Baghdad.
Iraq's Islamic Resistance, an umbrella group of anti-US armed groups in the country, has conducted dozens of attacks on US bases in support of Gaza's resistance.
Senior officials in Baghdad say only an end to Israel's war on the besieged Gaza Strip would stop the risk of a regional escalation.
Iraq says Israel's mass killing and displacement of the Palestinians is a ""textbook example of genocide.""
The US maintains some 2,500 troops in Iraq under the pretext of fighting the Daesh terrorist group, which in 2014 seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria.
Daesh was defeated when in November 2017, then commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani declared the end of the terrorist group's domination of Muslim lands.
In 2020, Iraq's parliament voted for the departure of US forces. Days earlier, General Soleimani and deputy PMU commander Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis had been assassinated in a cowardly drone strike ordered by then President Donald Trump of the United States outside the Baghdad airport."

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- ""Intense"" Israeli strikes in Gaza and Palestinian rocket fire into Israel persisted on Monday, with UN humanitarian reports stating more than 25,000 deaths in the enclave since the war's onset on Oct. 7.
Referencing information from Gaza's health authorities, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 62,681 Palestinians have suffered injuries due to Israeli strikes. These strikes were in response to Hamas-led attacks in Israel, which resulted in about 1,200 fatalities and around 250 hostages.
Two Israeli soldiers had been killed in Gaza since Friday, OCHA said, which brought the total to 193 since the start of the ground operation, and 1,203 soldiers were injured, according to the Israeli military.
The same period saw 343 Palestinians killed and another 573 people injured, the UN aid coordination office said.
Addressing a summit of the Group of 77 countries and China (G77) in the Ugandan capital Kampala on Sunday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the Middle East as ""a tinderbox,"" before issuing an appeal to ""do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region.""
""Israel's military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary-general,"" Guterres said, having earlier reiterated his support for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.
Highlighting the scale of need among Gazans after more than three months of ""intense"" bombardment, OCHA said that only 15 bakeries were now operational in Gaza -- ""six in Rafah and nine in Deir al Balah"" -- and none is open north of Wadi Gaza.
Almost all of these functioning bakeries have continued to receive support from the UN World Food Programme which has provided flour, salt, yeast and sugar.
""Through this initiative, about 250,000 people were able to purchase bread at a subsidized price,"" OCHA noted in its latest update on the emergency on Sunday.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, meanwhile, reported on Monday that telecommunications shutdowns had entered a seventh day.
In its most recent update, UNRWA disclosed that the number of internally displaced people within Gaza has reached 1.7 million. Of these, at least 335 have been killed while taking refuge in the agency's facilities, and 1,161 have been injured. Additionally, since Oct. 7, 151 UNRWA staff members have been killed and 141 of its installations have suffered damage."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Israeli regime has reportedly used phosphorus bombs in its latest attacks on the northern Gaza Strip.
Israel used the banned weapons in its attacks on Jabalia refugee camp, setting fire to residential buildings there, according to a Sunday report by IRNA citing Gaza-based Sama News.
The regime also conducted artillery attacks on areas near Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Yunis, south of the besieged strip.
Hospitals and their nearby areas, where displaced Palestinians are taking shelter, have been the main target of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza in the past several weeks.
In addition to causing huge civilian casualties, those airstrikes have caused the hospitals to stop fully functioning, resulting in a health crisis.
Israel launched its devastating war on Gaza on October 7, killing nearly 25,000 people so far, mostly women and children. It has also put curbs on entry of food, water and other basic supplies, deteriorating the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

U.S. officials hoping to break China's near monopoly on the production of rare earth elements needed for many cutting-edge technologies should engage the governments of Central Asia to develop high concentrations of REEs found in the region, says a new report.
The study by the U.S.-based International Tax and Investment Center warns that a failure to act could leave China with a ""decisive advantage"" in the sector, which is crucial to green energy, many new weapons systems and other advanced technologies.
""As the uses for these minerals has expanded, so too has global competition for them in a time of sharply increasing geostrategic and geo-economic tension,"" the report says.
""Advanced economies with secure, reliable access to REEs enjoy economic advantages in manufacturing, and corresponding economic disadvantages accrue for those without this access.""
China, which accounts for most of the world's rare earth mining within its own borders, has not yet had to seek additional supplies from Central Asia, which enjoys plentiful reserves of minerals ranging from iron and nonferrous metals to uranium.
But, the report says, ""the massive size of the Chinese economy and the Chinese Communist Party's conscious efforts to dominate the REE sector globally mean such increases are a matter of time.""
Oil-rich Kazakhstan, the region's economic giant, holds the world's largest chromium reserves and the second-largest stocks of uranium, while also possessing other critical elements.
Report co-author Ariel Cohen says it is up to the governments of Central Asia to create the investment climate for development of these resources.
""They may be the next big thing in Central Asia as the engine of economic growth,"" Cohen said this week during a panel discussion at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.
Across Central Asia, experts note, REEs are found in substantial volumes in the Kazakh steppe and uplands as well as in the Tien Shan mountains across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, and in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan.
Monazite, zircon, apatite, xenotime, pyrochlore, allanite and columbite are among Central Asia's most abundant rare metals and minerals.
In 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey listed 384 REE occurrences in the region: 160 in Kazakhstan, 87 in Uzbekistan, 75 in Kyrgyzstan, 60 in Tajikistan, and two in Turkmenistan.
Wesley Hill, another expert on Central Asia's mineral reserves, says production of rare earths at present ""is almost wholly monopolized by China.""
""Depending on how you count, between 80 to 90% of REE refining is controlled by China and done directly inside of China,"" Hill said.
But, he argued, despite China's heavy involvement in Central Asia, it has yet to fully take over the region's rare earth sector. ""So, this means that Central Asia is very much at a crossroads,"" he said. ""Central Asia has the opportunity to expand its REE production without being wholly dependent on China.""
Central Asia is currently in a position where it can develop its REE refining capacities both for its national development strategies and to break the Chinese monopoly, Hill said.
""But this is only going to happen with good policy, both from the American side and the Central Asian side.""
Ambassador John Herbst, Washington's former top diplomat in Uzbekistan and Ukraine, says the region's REE assets are ""simply another reason for enhanced engagement by the West.""
He said he is not sure that Central Asian governments appreciate how important rare earths can be to their development. ""But I do know that the countries of Central Asia want a closer relationship with the United States, and that is one important part of their maintaining their hard-won independence.""
Herbst added that the United States and Central Asia have a common interest in working together to develop the region's rare earths ""for the economy of the future.""
""We have an ability to innovate that far exceeds [China's]. Their innovation is based largely on taking our technology.""
Suriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, who serves as energy transition counsel at the U.S. Department of Commerce, says the region is eager for investment.
""It is a development opportunity. Particularly with the geostrategic energy realignment after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but also, because of the energy transition. Lithium and other REE are necessary for different parts of that transition. So that's primarily an economic incentive,"" she said.
She pointed to the Mineral Strategic Partnership Initiative run by the U.S. State Department's Bureau on Energy Resources, which is able to promote foreign direct investment in the region while providing technical assistance in the mining sector.
Cohen said the Central Asian countries cannot wait long to develop their rare earths. ""There is a competition, and the African countries, Latin American countries and others will compete increasingly.""
Wilder Alejandro Sanchez, who heads a consultancy called Second Floor Strategies, says Central Asia needs a rare earth research center that can provide timely information to prospective customers and investors.
Transportation is key, Sanchez said. ""It's not just about finding and mining them. You have to get them to the international market.""
Access from the landlocked region at present is limited to China's Belt and Road infrastructure or routes through Russia. Sanchez and others recommend using the Middle Corridor, also called the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which can carry goods to Europe across the Caspian and Black seas.
These experts also say progress will depend on regional governments overcoming their traditional secretiveness regarding natural resources. They emphasize the importance of transparency, the rule of law, adherence to best practices and compliance with international norms if they hope to attract Western investment."

Sweden's foreign minister says there is no reason to negotiate with Hungary for a ratification of its NATO bid.
""I see no reason to negotiate at this point,"" Sweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom told reporters after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Swedish counterpart to Hungary for talks.
Billstrom noted that Hungary, unlike Turkey, the other holdout on Sweden's NATO membership, did not present any conditions when Stockholm was invited to join at the 2022 NATO summit in Madrid.
Meanwhile, Turkish legislators endorsed Sweden's membership in NATO on January 23, lifting a major hurdle on the previously nonaligned country's entry into the military alliance.
The legislators ratified Sweden's accession protocol 287 to 55 with four abstentions.
The ratification will come into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which is expected to be swift.
""Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,"" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X, formerly Twitter.
The ratification leaves Hungary as the only NATO ally that has not approved Sweden's accession.

Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy
Lt. Col. Garn: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's press briefing. It is my honor to introduce the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, Dr. Celeste Wallander. We'll have roughly 30 minutes for our discussion today, and we will strive to get through as many questions as possible, here and on the phones. If I did not call you by name, and your outlet, please introduce yourself when asking your question.
In her role as assistant secretary, Dr. Wallander facilitated the contact group this morning. And she is here to talk about DOD's support to Ukraine. And so I respectfully request you keep your questions to that topic at hand.
And with that, over to you, Dr. Wallander. Thank you.
ASD (INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS) CELESTE WALLANDER: Great, thanks, Garron.
Hi. Happy new year for those of you -- I think all of you -- I haven't seen so far.
So let me just make a quick statement. Secretary Austin just wrapped up today's virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. This was our 18th gathering of this contact group, and it was a very productive session. So we're very pleased to be kicking off the new year with new energy.
One key theme was that our allies and partners are making impressive contributions to Ukraine's defense, self-defense. And the United States and our partners will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people. As we heard today, Ukraine's armed forces are defending their country bravely, and Ukraine's troops need and deserve our firm and sustained support.
So it's worth taking a step back, amidst this context, that almost two years ago Russia decided to invade Ukraine. And two years into Putin's war, his attempt to swiftly conquer Ukraine has clearly failed. But Russian invaders continue their assault on the front line in Ukraine's east and south.
Putin's forces continue to target innocent civilians across Ukraine with missiles and drones. But the more Putin tries to impose his imperial vision through violence and aggression, the more Ukraine resists and the more Ukraine's allies and partners come together.
The Kremlin has isolated itself. It is left to seek weapons from ally -- from the likes of Iran and North Korea. And meanwhile you can still see the skill of Ukraine's military in the destruction of a Russian landing ship in the Black Sea last month and in the downing of multiple Russian aircraft in recent weeks.
As Secretary Austin has said, the outcome of Ukraine's fight against Putin's aggression will define global security for decades to come. And the countries that gathered today all know that. And they all know that sitting it out is not an option.
If we fail to counter Putin's war of choice, aggressors and autocrats worldwide will be emboldened. And as Secretary Austin has noted, we refuse to live in a world where tyrants get to decide which countries can be snuffed out.
So we remain determined to stand up for a secure and sovereign Ukraine that can defend itself and deter further Russian aggression. Ukrainians are not asking us to fight for them. They are asking only for the tools to defend their country. So in 2024 we must continue to get them what they need to fight for their freedom. And our allies and partners have shown impressive determination and drive.
We today met in the UDCG. This is a historic defense coalition of some 50 countries from across the globe, not only from Europe. And that coalition has committed more than $80 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, since the beginning of this Russian invasion two years ago.
That is a testament to our unity and commitment. And today we continue to hear from that coalition on more immediate -- additional immediate support to help Ukraine's armed forces make progress on the battlefield. And we intensified our common efforts to forge long-term security for Ukraine.
We focused today, a portion of the meeting, on Ukraine's future force and the standing up of capability coalitions to support Ukraine's defense forces. These important coalitions will build on the extensive work that we've already been doing in the contact group. They will sustain and deepen security assistance in the years ahead, working closely with Ukraine to create a formidable combat force that can defend against and deter future threats from Moscow.
We have already formed capability coalitions focused on Ukraine's Air Force, artillery, maritime security, ground-based air defense, de-mining, and information technology, and today, Germany announced that it would lead the armor capability coalition and Latvia has announced that it will lead a drone coalition.
Secretary Austin is especially proud that the United States is co-leading two of those vital coalitions. Together with Denmark and the Netherlands, the United States is helping Ukraine meet its urgent need for Air Force capabilities.
And alongside France, the United States is co-leading the coalition that will strengthen Ukraine's artillery power and ensure that Ukraine has the artillery systems and ammunition it requires. We're also an active participant in the other coalitions, including ground-based air defense capability coalition, which is led by Germany and France.
So it was a very productive meeting, again, focused on both the immediate requirements and the medium to longer term. So we're going to stay resolute and we're going to stay united, and together, we're going to prevail.
And with that, I'm ready to take questions.
STAFF: I want to thank you, Dr. Wallander. Let's start with the Associated Press, Lita.
Q: Hi. Thanks for doing this. So a -- a two-part thing. How much discussion was there in the UDCG about the U.S.'s lack of getting additional funding and -- and whether there is a need maybe for the other countries to kind of front-load some of their stuff while there's a -- a U.S. gap?
And then secondly, do you know -- so is there -- have all of the weapons that the U.S. has promised gotten there through -- I -- I realize some of the USAI hasn't but a PDA, or are there still some things moving?
MS. WALLANDER: Great. Thanks. Let me answer the first one -- the second one first. You -- there are -- USAI is a procurement facility, so it is longer term. Much of the capabilities that, over the last two years, have been contracted for have been delivered when they're ready, but yes, there is still a pipeline of capabilities that were contracted for either in 2022 or 2023, and those continue to be delivered apace as -- as scheduled for the most part.
You know, every now and then, there's a delay of a week but no fundamental delays in those deliveries. So that's -- so no, there are no challenges in -- in delivery of USAI. And up until December, we continued to announce PDA packages, and those are delivered in a more immediate timeframe, in a -- on a regular basis. So those -- there were no challenges of those. Some of those deliveries continue to roll out because they take weeks -- it's -- you know, to get the -- the capabilities to Europe and then onward to Ukraine, but that's just the normal process from the beginning.
On discussion about the challenge of securing additional funding for U.S. security assistance, there was not a discussion. We, the U.S. side, referenced that we are working with Congress to answer their questions and we continue to aim towards successful achievement of supplemental funding which will enable us to continue that USAI procurement calendar to give Ukraine the sustainable capabilities it requires to continue to fight, given that Russia continues to attack Ukraine.
And we're really focused also on achieving replenishment funding so we can continue to -- we can turn back to also the steady rollout of presidential drawdown authority packages that the replenishment makes possible.
Q: But just to be clear, you -- you said that the PDAs -- that some equipment is still rolling from some of the December PDAs, or has it all arrived?
MS. WALLANDER: I haven't checked before we -- we spoke today but the last package was announced in December. So it would not surprise me if that -- if those capabilities still are being delivered, but I don't have anything specific for you. But I also don't have any flags or alarms that have been reported to me, or concerns.
On allies and partners, your question about somehow gapping the United States, allies and partners have actually continued with their steady pace of announcing new security assistance. Just since October 1st, European countries individually announced new funding for Ukraine's security assistance about -- in the -- in the range of $4.6 billion just since October 1st. That is a period, I'll note, when the United States announced zero additional security assistance for Ukraine.
So that is about -- that is steady with the pace that the European countries have been rolling out security -- new security assistance packages since the early months of this conflict.
STAFF: Lara, Politico?
Q: Thank -- thanks for doing this. I was wondering again on the supplemental if there's been any discussion on the -- in -- amongst you in the Pentagon whether there's some kind of workaround in -- in case there is no -- you cannot -- the Congress and the administration cannot agree on a supplemental? Is there anything else as a backup that the (inaudible) weapons to Ukraine? Has that been a point of discussion?
MS. WALLANDER: In the absence of funding, we are unable to send new capabilities. We can fulfill existing contracts. Those are substantial in 2024. But they would -- the amount that we would be able to provide to Ukraine would not meet the pace or the scale that we have been able to provide Ukraine since Congress first generously passed support to Ukraine in 2022.
Q: So if you were to -- to potentially put something in the -- the budget request so that Congress could -- could pass that, that would not -- that would not solve the problem?
MS. WALLANDER: I won't get into the -- I'm -- I won't get in -- out of my lane, into the sort of Comptroller and OMB lane of how to request funding for security assistance, what the precise facility is. Right now, the focus is on that supplemental, but without funding, we would not be able to match the pace that we have provided Ukraine with since the start of this conflict. And the conflict hasn't died down, and in fact, the intensity remains high, based on Russian activity.
Q: I'm sorry, just one -- just one more. The -- can -- have you heard from specific Ukrainian units or soldiers that they are running out of ammunition at this point?
MS. WALLANDER: We have heard reports from the Ukrainian government that they have concerns -- from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and general staff that they are concerned that they believe that units are not -- do not have the stocks and the stores of ammunition that they require, and that is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress's questions so that they are able to move forward on a decision to pass the supplemental.
STAFF: Let's go over to this side please. Go ahead.
Q: Following up on that, the -- just to expand on that question, has has the mark of a new PDA been felt on the battlefield yet more generally, not just ammunition, but also in terms of equipment losses? Or has -- has -- has there not been enough time since the last one for that to have trickled down to -- to the front lines yet?
MS. WALLANDER: Well, in the fall, in order to make sure that we were able to continue the steady delivery of ammunition, interceptors and other capabilities that we pull from PDA -- as a -- as a result of PDA, our packages were smaller than they had been earlier in the year, and the Ukrainians have reported that they are grateful for that steady provision of capabilities. But they have reported that the -- the changed pace and volume of PDA packages in the fall did affect their planning and their operations.
And so I think the trend is such that we are able to provide ammunition and interceptors that were contracted for in 2022 and 2023 under USAI, but those levels are not -- are not at the same level when we were able to provide on a regular basis ammunition and interceptors and other capabilities funded both by PDA and by USAI. So without USAI, we're not able to sustain the same levels of provision of capability to Ukraine. We look forward in 2024. Precisely when this -- the -- what the numbers would be, I would have to refer you to the Ukrainians. That is, you know, their -- that is their -- they're tracking. It's their responsibility to assess their stocks and how they use that in their operations, but we are hearing that from them.
STAFF: Bill, go ahead.
Q: Hi. Have you seen any evidence that the Russians are -- are trying to seize on any opportunities for ammunitions or -- and air defense shortfalls? And then secondly, is there any consideration of perhaps -- I know that the DOD's -- prefers replenishment, but perhaps seeking additional aid for Ukraine without that replenishment?
MS. WALLANDER: So on Russian actions, we have seen surges in Russian air activities against Ukraine. We've seen them not only continue to use ballistic missiles and cruise missiles and UAVs, but we have seen periods in which they are using coordinated barrages of those capabilities, probably two -- two intentions clear. One is to try to overwhelm Ukrainian defense capabilities in a particular location, but also to seek to force the Ukrainians to use ammunition to create vulnerabilities in Ukrainian civilian and critical infrastructure targets, but also front lines in order to be able to try to exploit those potential vulnerabilities. They've not succeeded so far. The Ukrainians have a lot of practice- -- have a lot of experience over the last two years in how to cope with these kinds of Russian assaults, and we have been able, with the coalition and with this -- with the past deliveries from USAI and PDA to provide the Ukrainians with what they've needed.
So we haven't seen it succeed, but I think if you look at the -- the ebb and flow of Russian air assaults, that that is what they are trying to do. And they have also sought to concentrate their focus on the front lines in Eastern Ukraine in some particular localities where they have sought to use some of their sources of ammunition from some of the countries that they've been receiving ammunition from, including the DPRK, to try to break through. They -- again, they've not succeeded, but your question was, have we seen the Russian forces try, and yes, we've seen them try.
On -- on using PDA without replenishment, from the very start of this conflict we have first and foremost created our packages based on what the Ukrainians say they need, what kinds of capabilities they need, what kind of effects they're trying to achieve, and work to find the right capabilities in our stocks to provide to Ukraine, and that is measured against our own readiness. That has been true since February of 2022, and it's true today.
So when the secretary decides what he can recommend to the president, readiness is absolutely a bottom-line concern, and that is -- you know, that is require -- that is a responsible policy choice because the U.S. Defense Department has to make sure that American forces have the capabilities they need to fulfill their missions. As, for example, we're seeing the U.S. is called upon in the Red Sea right now to defend American warships, to protect American commercial ships and to defend freedom of navigation and the freedom of commercial shipping to be able to operate in international waters. So the world isn't stopping because Russia's fighting Ukraine, and the United States has global requirements and responsibilities.
STAFF: So we'll do a couple more in the room, then we'll go to the phones. Let's do Oren, CNN.
Q: Oren from CNN. How much concern was there on the part of the other 50-or-so countries there about the lack of the U.S. ability to contribute now? The U.S. normally announces fairly large PDAs around these. How much of a hold is there to fill, even with other countries stepping forward? And then I have just a couple more questions.
MS. WALLANDER: We were able to brief on what is in the pipeline from USAI and to make clear that that steady stream, if at a different level, will continue. We heard from a number of countries and allies that continue to find sources and to fund sources of ammunition production. We heard from at least three very major European countries how they are working with their defense industries to -- their indus- -- defense industrial base to expand their production of especially ammunition. So they are stepping up to help to provide Ukraine with the capabilities that they need. So there was an awareness that the United States right now is still working on getting that supplemental so we can plan to be part of that at the full level that we have been in the past. But it was a coalition approach and a -- a -- a determination to work together to reach up to the numbers that the Ukrainians need for their current operations.
Q: But is there still a gap there? I mean, is it -- would you need the Europeans to step forward with another billion dollars or so of -- of equipment to fill what the U.S. would normally fill?
MS. WALLANDER: It isn't a definable gap. There are multiple ways to fulfill the requirements, and the creativity and the multidimensional nature of the coalition has -- has helped us. For example, some of the ammunition is NATO-standard ammunition. Some of the ammunition that is being contracted for by European countries is actually Soviet-legacy ammunition, which the Ukrainians can still use and put to good effect because they have so (inaudible) capabilities.
Q: And then just, can you update us on F-16 training, where that process stands?
MS. WALLANDER: So the -- one of the elements of the UDCG today -- UDCG today was an update on the Air Force Capability Coalition. The -- the coalition leads, and some of the member countries reported on where we stood with training, which is it is on track. Ukrainian pilots are being trained and are working through the -- the training program. We are working as a coalition on ai- -- we are aiming to provide an initial operating capability for Ukraine with its F-16 program in 2024, which would entail trained pilots, the platforms, but in addition, trained maintainers and sustainers, infrastructure, and spare parts, ammunition. All of these pieces is what the coalition's responsible for, and so we gave a briefing on where that stood this year.
STAFF: All right, let's do one more in the room, then we'll go to the phones. Let's go Luis.
Q: Has the Secretary made a -- a pitch for more air defense systems? You mentioned USAI. There was -- there was a -- a flow of NASAM purchases under USAI back in 2022. All -- has all of that gone in or do you -- or is that still in the pipeline and then that -- will that be arriving here in 2024?
MS. WALLANDER: Some of those units have been delivered. Others were -- the procurement was for production. So those are still being produced and they'll be delivered and rolled out as they are -- as they come off the -- I know it's not actually a production line, but as they come off the equivalent of the production line, those would be delivered.
Q: But the need is more immediate right now, right? So, I mean, will -- what is currently in the USAI pipeline --
(CROSSTALK)
MS. WALLANDER: -- immediate need right now are the interceptors. And so -- and procurement also involves procuring interceptors for different kinds of systems, the variety of systems the Ukrainians have, including what we're -- we call the FrankenSAM project, which is creating new Western -- or NATO standard interceptors that can be used on Soviet legacy launchers for the most part.
So all of those things -- some of those have already been put on contract with previous tranches of USAI. Some of them, coalition partners are procuring. Some of them, coalition partners are refurbishing from old stocks. So it's kind of multi-source to provide those interceptor capabilities.
STAFF: All right, thank you. Let's go to the phones. Howard Altman, WarZone?
Q: Thanks. A couple questions. Given the -- the slowdown in U.S. arms provisions to Ukraine and -- and -- and the -- the -- only a fraction of the artillery that's been promised to Ukraine has been delivered, did the Ukrainians talk about how long they can -- they can hold out with, you know, a reduction in -- in the supplies?
And then can you go on a little bit -- talk a little bit more about the -- the -- the drone coalition? What -- what's the -- what's that going to -- you know, what's the goal of that? Thanks.
MS. WALLANDER: I -- I am not aware that only a fraction of what the United States committed to provide Ukraine, in terms of artillery capabilities --
(CROSSTALK)
MS. WALLANDER: -- some delivery timelines that still, you know, require packages to be delivered. But that -- that is not the challenge right now. The challenge right now is some of those artillery systems, including those -- are provided by other allies and partners, need to be repaired, and -- and that is a -- that means they have to be taken off the front lines and repaired, but there is a system in place for maintenance and repair, and funding being put into purchasing spare parts and being able to repair those.
And then there's the ammunition challenge, which is -- I suggested really is rooted in increasing defense production. And we have been working with allies and partners to expand their production of ammunition. So we're seeking to meet that.
But again, you know, in the end, the United States is going to need the supplemental to be able to do those procurement contracts and to be able to consider possibly additional PDA packages. So that is a concern but it -- it is something we're working on.
I'm sorry -- and your other question? I'm so sorry, I forgot.
Q: It was about the drone coalition. Can you provide some more details on --
MS. WALLANDER: Oh yes-- great question, thank you for asking the question. Look, what we are seeing in Ukraine and in Russia's operations in Ukraine and Ukraine's defenses and also its own strikes against Russian capabilities is how the quickly evolving -- the -- the quickly evolving role of uncrewed aerial vehicles and it -- and -- and of -- ranging from large capabilities, which are largely used for ISR, for -- for surveillance and reconnaissance, down to strike UAVs, which can be -- you've seen, you know, small is a -- a foot or two across.
The technology is evolving quickly, the techniques -- techniques -- the -- the tactics, techniques, and procedures are evolving very quickly. The Ukrainians have been incredibly creative with how they use these drone capabilities. And then the Russians also adapted and learned how to use these capabilities.
And so the idea of the drone coalition is to look at these multi-domain and multi-functional aspects in which drones or, you know, uncrewed aerial vehicles play a role in different requirements operationally on the battlefield.
And to get ahead of the curve -- the idea is to get ahead of the technological curve, to get ahead of the production curve, and to get ahead of the operational curve to be able to help the Ukrainians as they find new ways to use drones and as they confront new ways that the Russians are using them against them.
STAFF: All right, folks, I want to be sensitive of Dr. Wallander's time. We have time for a couple more questions. But as you know, General Ryder has a press conference at 2:30, so if we don't address everyone's questions, we'll get to you.
Courtney Kube, NBC?
Q: -- North Korean ammunition --
(CROSSTALK)
Q: -- by Russia and --
MS. WALLANDER: North Korea has been providing ammunition to Russia.
Q: But -- but did you say that?
MS. WALLANDER: I said the Russians -- I believe I said, but if I didn't, thank you. Let me correct that the Russians have new sources of ammunition and they are taking advantage of where they have artillery ammunition, and one of their sources has been North Korea.
Q: I'm just curious -- so are -- I mean, are -- is there evidence that North Korean ammunition and artillery are now being used by Russia in -- in Ukraine? Is that -- I -- we know that -- I think the --
(CROSSTALK)
MS. WALLANDER: -- have any evidence that they're being delivered in the -- in the sense that you're asking.
Q: Okay, well, let me ask it again. Like, is -- is -- do you -- is -- is -- is North Korean ammunition or artillery being used by Russia in Ukraine?
MS. WALLANDER: I cannot be specific and confirm that.
Q: And then I just want someone to be clear on a couple of other things. The -- the -- well, you've -- you've mentioned a couple of times in the past where you've heard, like, the ministers of -- of defense -- Ministry of Defense and general staff talk about concerns about stocks and ammunition stuff, but was that something that was actually reiterated today during the meeting? Did the Ukrainians talk about concerns about ammunition today? Can you give us any -- since we're on background, can you give us any -- any sense of -- of how concerned they were about that or if they give any sense of -- of -Garron will be fine with you answering the questions.
Q: Well, -- well, actually, I'll ask it anyway. She's (inaudible) on the record. If -- can you give us any sense of -- of whether that was something that was brought up specifically today, concerns about ammunition, and then -- and did they -- in the briefing, did they talk about these surges in air activity by the Russians? I mean, were those things that were actually briefed today in the contact group?
MS. WALLANDER: These are things that the Ukrainians have talked about publicly, that they have concerns that their -- their frontline troops are reporting that they've -- they are reporting to their leadership that they feel that they are constrained and they are asking for more ammunition.
This is not new. The Ukrainians have been asking for substantial amounts of capability throughout the conflict and the UDCG. So that's -- is -- that was part of the conversation. And we need to hear that from the Ukrainians so that we as a coalition can work -- look at what haven't we been procuring? Where -- where could production be ramped up? How could we get those requirements to them more quickly?
So, yes, that was part of the conversation, but that has been an element, broadly speaking, of UDCG's from the very first UDCG.
STAFF: All right. Thank you. Let's go to the last question from the phone, Heather Mongilio, USNI?
QUESTION: Thanks so much.
So the United Kingdom tried to send over a minesweeper, and that was blocked by Turkey and the Montreux -- Turkey, using the Montreux Convention.
I was wondering if you have any thoughts on whether this is something that's going to continue to be an issue if the U.S. or its allies try to send over things like minesweepers, and if this is -- you've seen any other similar incidents where aid has been blocked from getting to Ukraine?
WALLANDER: So I would note that Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey have publicly announced that they've -- they're joining together in a de-mining -- Black Sea de-mining operation. And we welcome that, because that's going to be really important, not just for Ukraine but for commercial shipping and shipping in general in the Black Sea, which is an international water -- body of water.
So we want to work with the littoral countries of the Black Sea, including Turkey, on conditions under which we can move away from the state of -- state of conflict in which Turkey decided to -- and as the, kind of, guardian of the Montreux Convention, invoked that provision of the Montreux Convention.
I would just note the reason why they invoked it is because of war -- Russia's war against Ukraine. And so what we need to do is help the Ukrainians continue to defend themselves against Russian attacks so that there is a permissive environment in which we can effectively re-open the Black Sea to commercial shipping completely. The conditions are better than they were because Ukraine has been able to move out some -- some grain, some commercial shipping, in large measure because of its success in pushing back Russian naval capabilities and strike capabilities in the Black Sea.
But the real key towards beginning to build a return to commercial shipping and to Ukraine being able to operate as a navy, as a maritime power, as is its right under international law, as a littoral Black Sea country, is for Russia to end its war against Ukraine.
STAFF: All right. Thank you for your time, Dr. Wallander.
That's all the time we have for today. Thank you.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The North Korean Missile Administration on Wednesday carried out the first test-fire of the still under-development ""new-type strategic cruise missile Pulhwasal-3-31"", the North's state-run news agency KCNA reported.
The launch of the cruise missile ""had no impact on the security of neighboring countries and has nothing to do with the regional situation,"" the report said.
The launch of the missile is ""a process of constant updating of the weapon system,"" which is ""a regular and obligatory activity of the administration and its affiliated defence science institutes,"" KCNA cited the administration as saying.
Last week, a spokesman for the North Korean National Defense Ministry said in a statement carried by KCNA that Pyongyang had tested the still under-development ""underwater nuclear weapon system Haeil-5-23"" in the Sea of Japan in response to joint three-day naval exercises by the United States, South Korea and Japan involving a US nuclear carrier and other warships.

The Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has once again targeted a strategic Israeli airbase in the north of the occupied territories in response to the regime's genocidal war in the besieged Gaza Strip and its recent assassinations in Lebanon and Syria.
Hezbollah said in a statement that Israel's Meron air traffic control base on Mount al-Jarmaq was struck by the resistance movement's missiles on Tuesday ""in support of steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza and their valiant and honorable resistance"" against the Israeli occupation.
""The Meron air traffic control base was attacked for the second time with a large number of appropriate missiles, and they achieved direct hits, in response to the recent assassinations in Lebanon and Syria, and the repeated attacks on civilians and homes in our villages,"" the statement added.
Israel's Meron base, which was also targeted by Hezbollah earlier in the month, is the sole air management, monitoring and control center in the north of the occupied territories, to which there is no major alternative.
Lebanese media reported that Tuesday's strikes were ""more focused,"" and hit the base ""accurately.""
The Israeli occupation army confirmed the latest retaliatory attack by Hezbollah and said the base had been hit, stressing that Meron's infrastructure was ""damaged as a result of being targeted by bombing from Lebanon.""
Israeli media also said electricity was cut off in several illegal settlements in the Meron area.
On January 6, the Lebanese resistance movement targeted Meron base with 62 missiles as part of the initial response to the Israeli assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy head of the political bureau of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas.
Arouri was known as the ""architect"" of the October 7 operation by Gaza's resistance groups, during which hundreds of missiles were fired at the occupied territories and dozens of Israelis were taken captive.
The Israeli regime has assassinated several high-ranking officials from the resistance front in Syria and Lebanon over the past month.
The Israeli regime launched its devastating war in the Gaza Strip on October 7 after the territory's Hamas-led Palestinian resistance groups carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The Israeli military has also been conducting attacks against the Lebanese territory since then, prompting retaliatory strikes from Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah in support of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.
The movement has vowed to keep up its retaliatory operations as long as the Tel Aviv regime continues its onslaught on Gaza.
The Israeli campaign in Gaza has killed at least 25,400 people, most of them women and children. More than 62,000 individuals have also been wounded."

Among those whose working lives have been upended, de facto authorities ""banned"" approximately 400 women workers at a pine nut processing from the workplace and dismissed another 200 at a power plant, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a report on the human rights situation.
The Mission also noted that women were arrested for purchasing contraceptives and that unmarried female staff at a healthcare facility were ""advised"" to get married by officials from the so-called Department for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, or risk losing their jobs.
The officials reportedly stated that ""it was inappropriate for an unmarried woman to work.""
Many women were also not allowed to board buses or go to work because they were unmarried or because they did not have a mahram - a male chaperone - to accompany them in public.
Enforcement of 'hijab' decree
The report also noted that several women were arbitrarily arrested in Kabul and other locations for ""not wearing proper hijab"".
Most were released after their mahrams signed a guarantee that they will adhere to the hijab decree in the future.
""The measures taken by the de facto authorities contradicts the hijab decree itself,"" UNAMA said.
""For a first violation of the decree, a warning is to be issued to individual's mahram (at the place of residence), for a second violation, the individual's mahram is to be summoned, for a third violation, the individual's mahram may be imprisoned for up to three days and for a fourth violation, the individual's mahram is to be brought before the de facto court for further action.""
Freedom of expression
UNAMA further noted that the de facto authorities continued to infringe the right to freedom of expression by limiting the opportunity to seek, receive and impart information and ideas.
On 14 December, the Taliban Ministry of Higher Education issued a letter instructing all universities and private education institutions to remove books which are considered against the laws of Hanafi jurisprudence.
This includes books relating to Shi'a belief, political parties and materials authored by individuals associated with the elected Government the Taliban deposed, the report stated.
In further examples, four women's rights activists and three staff of a radio station were arrested between September and December simply for doing their jobs.
Although five of them were released, one rights activist remains in detention and one journalist was sentenced to a year in prison.
Remnants of war
The report notes that at least 11 people were killed and a further 51 wounded by unexploded ordnance between October and December 2023. Forty-nine of the 62 victims were children (41 boys and eight girls)."

By Yitong Wu for RFA Cantonese 2024.01.25 -- Australia has revoked its ""golden visa"" immigration program targeted at attracting wealthy investors, a move that eliminates a popular option for China's rich to escape with their assets from an increasingly difficult political and economic climate at home.
Australian media reported this week that the Labor government announced in December plans to scrap the program at the end of last year because it could not bring economic benefits to the country. Also, members of the Australian Values ââAlliance - a group founded by Australians of Chinese heritage - pointed out that wealthy Chinese people have infiltrated politics.
The program will be replaced by a new immigration plan to provide more visas for skilled immigrants.
""It has been obvious for years that this visa is not delivering what our country and economy needs,"" said Australian Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil in a statement Monday.
""The investor visa is one of many aspects of the system which are reforming to create a system which delivers for our country,"" she added.
The Business Innovation and Investment Program (BIIP), commonly known as the ""golden visa"", was launched in 2012. Unlike other visa programs, it did not require foreign immigrants to learn or master English, nor did it have age restrictions. It was only mandatory for foreign citizens to invest up to A$5 million (US$3.3 million) to obtain residence for five years.
Research by the Australian government has, however, shown that the average economic value contributed by the immigrants in this program to Australia in their lifetime is $600,000, which is just slightly more than a third of the $1.6 million generated by Australian citizens.
According to the Australian Department of Home Affairs, more than 100,000 overseas immigrants have used the program to obtain residency in the country since 2012, with 85% of successful applicants coming from China. Currently, about 26,000 people have successfully obtained permanent residence in Australia.
The visa subclass was even given the number ""888"", as eight stands for prosperity and is auspicious in Chinese numerology.
China's rich - tools of CCP infiltration
Over the years, critics have argued that the plan created not just a fast path for China's wealthy to immigrate but had served as a conduit for corrupt officials in authoritarian countries to ""move illicit funds.""
Australian commentator Huangfu Jing told Radio Free Asia Cantonese that Chinese tycoon Huang Xiangmo, who was permanently banned from entering Australia for political donations in 2019, was a ""golden visa"" immigrant. The biggest problem with these wealthy Chinese immigrants, therefore, is not their inability to create greater economic value, but that they have become tools for the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) infiltration, she said.
""Australia eventually discovered it didn't earn much [from the program], but lost more, giving the CCP considerable penetration opportunities. A substantial number of these investment immigrants were pushed out and packaged by the CCP for all-round infiltration. Huang Xiangmo's political donation is a typical example.""
Huangfu Jing believes that the CCP, faced with economic difficulties, has nationalized assets of China's rich through what it labeled as ""public-private partnership"" schemes. As a result, she said wealthy Chinese, stripped of their wealth, will certainly flee China but at the same time, Western countries are increasingly aware of the risks and shutting their doors early.
Former Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin claimed that wealthy Chinese immigrants who landed in Australia also brought in a legion of unproductive people with no economic contribution to the country. He said they cause social havoc with bad Chinese cultural behavior and habits, including bribery and corruption that influences politics.
Still, Chen believes that the door should remain open for these affluent affluent businessmen.
""Moving their money out will hollow out China's economy and prompt social change; there's no downside, in fact only benefits,"" Chen said.
Apart from Australia's ""golden visa"", the ""golden passport and visa"" of some European Union countries are also popular among China's rich. Countries like Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria have issued ""golden passports"" to foreign investors, while Greece and Portugal granted ""golden visas,"" at investment prices ranging â¬1 million (US$1 million) to â¬5 million.
As early as January 2019, the European Commission warned countries offering ""golden visas"" to foreign investors that their schemes may help organized crime groups infiltrate the EU and increase money laundering, corruption and tax evasion and other risks.
In February 2023, Ireland announced the closure of the ""golden visa"" program. Portugal followed suit and stopped a similar program in March of that year.

O5EJMT0XR8_TKJZX0Z3SYF9B6S,Operation Iron Swords - Day 109 - 23 January 2024,_,_,20230123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-iron-swords-2024-01-23.htm,"Contents    NEW - Operations	  NEW - Operations Maps		  NEW - By-Standers	  NEW - Axis of Resistance	  NEW - Allied for Democracy  UPDATED - Oasis of Martyrs	  UPDATED - Hostages     	  	A Palestinian resistance operation in Al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip resulted in the killing of 21 Israeli soldiers. The Israeli army described it as the most difficult since the beginning of the ground invasion of the Strip on October 27 last year. In the details of the operation, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari explained that Palestinian fighters fired an RPG missile at a tank that was securing the Israeli force, and at the same time an explosion occurred in two two-story buildings, while most of the force was present inside them, or near them.
For its part, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that the incident, which led to the death of 21 soldiers, occurred in the Maghazi camp. It explained that the incident occurred when soldiers booby-trapped two buildings in the camp, and then members of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) fired anti-tank missiles, which led to the explosion of explosive devices and the collapse of the two buildings on the Israeli soldiers. It added that the explosion that killed the soldiers occurred 600 meters from the border fence, stressing that rescue operations for those injured in the collapse of the two buildings from under the rubble continued for long hours last night. It pointed out that the tank crew, which was there to secure the soldiers at the scene of the accident, was directly hit by a Palestinian fighters shell.
Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the incident that led to the killing of the soldiers in the Maghazi camp showed that the explosion occurred as a result of the firing of two RPG missiles that hit a tank and bombed buildings that collapsed on the soldiers.
the Israeli ""Wala"" website reported that the soldiers were booby-trapping the two buildings in the Maghazi camp with the aim of blowing up 10 houses in the area, so that they would be exposed to the army, under the pretext of preventing Hamas fighters from hiding there, according to what he put it. The site confirmed that the Palestinian resistance's bombing of the two adjacent buildings led to their collapse, making the area appear to be a hotbed of destruction, burying the soldiers under the rubble, describing the incident as an ""earthquake.""
The resistance operation in Al-Maghazi camp came after the Israeli army announced yesterday that it was continuing to fight the Palestinian factions in the northern and central Gaza Strip, while Israeli media had been talking for days about the army moving into the third phase of the war, and withdrawing a number of forces from the northern areas of the Strip.
Israeli officials expressed their pain following the announcement of the killing of 24 officers and soldiers in the Gaza Strip during the past 24 hours, especially since 21 of them died in a resistance operation in the Maghazi camp in the center of the Strip, which was described as the harshest since the start of the ground invasion on October 27. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and War Council member Benny Gantz expressed their sadness in a joint statement, saying that they bow their heads to those who fell in Gaza, and that they will not stop striving to achieve victory.
Galant also said that Israel suffered a strong blow yesterday with the killing of 24 soldiers, 3 of them in battles in the southern Gaza Strip, adding that they are following Hezbollah, which continues to provoke Israel in the north, as he put it. More than one political and military official also spoke about the difficulty of the ongoing battles in the Gaza Strip.
Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu : ""Yesterday we lived through one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of war, and the army began an investigation into the disaster. We are doing our best to preserve the lives of our soldiers, and we will not stop fighting until absolute victory is achieved.
President Isaac Herzog : ""It is a difficult morning to bear with the addition of the names of more of our soldiers to the list of the dead.
War Council member Benny Gantz : ""A difficult morning for the entire people of Israel with the catastrophic killing of 21 soldiers.
We must unite and remember the heavy price we had to pay for this just war.
Defense Minister Yoav Galant : ""A difficult and painful morning, and our hearts are with the families of the victims in their most difficult times. This is a war that will determine Israel's future for decades to come, and our soldiers will die to achieve the goals of the war.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich : ""Tragic news, and we pledge that the killing of our children in Gaza will not be in vain.
Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir : ""A difficult and painful morning, heart broken and shattered.
Education Minister Yoav Kisch: ""I feel tremendous pain and cannot find words to express the great sadness I feel with the announcement of the terrible disaster that occurred yesterday.
Energy Minister Eli Cohen: ""A very difficult morning, and the killing of 21 soldiers in the Gaza Strip is a very heavy price.
Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana: ""A very difficult morning in which the people of Israel woke up to heartbreaking news. Every one of our dead in Gaza is a world full of families, hopes and dreams that were cut off prematurely.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid : ""An unbearable difficult morning with the bitter news of the killing of 21 soldiers in Gaza.
A disaster in Gaza, the most difficult incident, a difficult and unbearable morning. These phrases are among the most widely circulated on official and unofficial Israeli communication platforms after the Israeli army announced the killing of 24 officers and soldiers in the Gaza battles within 24 hours. The accounts of the Israeli Ministry of Defense on social media platforms began publishing the names and pictures of its soldiers who were killed in the Gaza battles. Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari appeared with a look of sadness and grief on his face, announcing the killing of 21 officers and soldiers from the Israeli reserve forces who were killed in the bombing of two buildings in Al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip.
The Israeli Broadcasting Authority said that the killing of soldiers in the Maghazi camp occurred 600 meters from the border fence, and that operations to rescue victims from under the rubble continued for many hours. Al Jazeera broadcast a clip showing the moment of the explosion of a building in the Maghazi camp in which the occupation forces had barricaded themselves after it was targeted by Palestinian resistance factions in Gaza.
The killing of Israeli officers and soldiers sparked a state of shock on Israeli social media platforms, and accounts began publishing photos of the officers and soldiers whose names and photos were allowed to be published.
The Israeli Prime Minister offered his condolences to the families of the soldiers and officers who were killed, saying, Yesterday we witnessed one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war. I ask to extend our sincere condolences to the dear families of our brave fighters who fell on the battlefield. I know that the lives of these families have changed forever. I am saddened. For the fall of our brave soldiers, I embrace the families in their anguish as we all pray for the recovery of our wounded. The IDF has begun investigating the circumstances of the tragedy. We must draw the necessary lessons and do everything in our power to preserve the lives of our fighters, in the name of our heroes, and for our lives. We stop fighting until absolute victory is achieved.""
But Netanyahu's condolences to the families of the dead aroused the anger of many followers, who described him as a failure and held him primarily responsible for the terrible situation in which Israel now finds itself, for the never-ending nightmare, and for the endless black hole. They demanded that he stop lying to Israeli citizens, as well as Others called on him to resign, and asked him how many Israeli army forces would be killed before he resigned.
But how did the audience on social media platforms in the Arab world react to the news of the killing of 24 Israeli officers and soldiers in 24 hours? Tweeters commented on the news as a good morning and described the operation as thoughtful and precise. They said that the Palestinian resistance had caught the Israeli forces in a trap. After they let them bomb houses, they targeted them. The resistance fired a missile that cost no more than $10, which blew up the place, killing 21 officers and soldiers at once.
Some observers commented by saying, ""After the specific operation of the Palestinian resistance, it seems that the leaders of the occupation army will raise the ceiling of their feelings of disappointment, despair and frustration and read the scene from a field perspective indicating that a battalion or several companies were completely annihilated and fell into an elaborate trap.""
Bloggers said that the Israeli army sent large numbers that were not experienced in urban combat into Gaza, which increased the chance that they would be targeted by Palestinian resistance factions. Tweeters also repeated Abu Ubaidas famous saying, Here are the sands of Gaza swallowing their soldiers. While some observers pointed out that the Israeli army underestimates the number of its deaths, and does not announce the real numbers in order not to frustrate the rest of the fighting forces in the Gaza Strip, and they added that the operation came more than 100 days after the ground invasion of the Strip, which proves the failure of Israeli military intelligence in Its information gathering and inability to protect its forces from Palestinian resistance attacks.

Operational Update   		    		  The Israeli Broadcasting Authority said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed his government ministers that the third phase of the war on Gaza will take 6 months. The authority added that Netanyahu explained that it would take 6 months for the army to end the third phase of the war, which had already begun in the northern Gaza Strip. It quoted Netanyahu as saying to the ministers at a meeting yesterday: ""As we said previously, the air part will continue for 3 weeks and so it was, and as we said that the second part of the huge maneuver will last 3 months and so it was, and thus we say that the third part of stabilizing control and cleansing will continue for 6 months"", according to his expressions. 	    Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy said that the battle in the Gaza Strip will be long; Stressing the need for reserve forces again, after 24 Israeli soldiers were killed in one day in a specific Palestinian resistance operation. Halevy added: ""We will continue to fight"" the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) ""with great determination for our right to live in safety."" Regarding the operation in which 21 of his forces were killed, Halevy said: Our soldiers fell in battle during a defensive operation in the area separating the Israeli towns and Gaza. He added that the operation was aimed at creating security conditions for the residents of the Gaza envelope area to return to their homes safely, noting that an in-depth investigation will be opened and lessons will be drawn so that such an incident will not be repeated. 	      		    		    		  In recent weeks, the Israeli army announced the withdrawal of many of its forces from the Gaza Strip as part of entering the third phase of the war, which focuses on targeted bombing, noting that it does not clarify the number of its forces currently present in the Gaza Strip, as part of its ground incursion. 	  		  The Al-Qassam Brigades , the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), stated that it destroyed an Israeli troop carrier with an  Al-Yassin 105  shell in the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, which has been witnessing, since dawn on Monday, Israeli incursion attempts and fierce fighting and bombing.  	  		  For its part, the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement, reported that it blew up an Israeli tank with a piercing device in the Al-Taqadum axis, west of Khan Yunis, in the vicinity of the Japanese Quarter. It added that it bombed with a barrage of mortar shells a position of occupation soldiers and vehicles in the advance axis in the western camp in Khan Yunis. 	  		  Al Jazeera's correspondent said that the Israeli army also announced last night that about 18 wounded in battles in the southern Gaza Strip had been transferred to Israeli hospitals. The reporter added that the occupation forces are besieging the southern area of Khan Yunis and closing the western area with 7 military battalions, because they believe that the military leaders of the Hamas movement are concentrated in this area. 	  		  The Israeli army claimed to have completed the encirclement of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. The army said, in a statement, Over the last 24 hours, the 98th Division carried out a large-scale attack in Khan Yunis. It claimed that within the division, ""the paratroopers, the Givati and the 7th Brigade completed the operation during the attack to encircle Khan Yunis. The commandos also deepened the attack into the heart of the area that is used as a pivotal center of gravity for the Hamas-affiliated Khan Yunis Brigade."" The IDF army claimed that it ""eliminated dozens of militants in face-to-face battles in cooperation with air force raids."" 	        		    		    The American newspaper The Washington Post quoted Israeli military and security leaders as saying that the Israeli army may lose gains in the Gaza Strip, due to the lack of a post-war strategy. The leaders explained that the army must maintain its areas of control, not control new territory. The Washington Post, citing an Israeli military source, said that the long-term security presence in Gaza is a nightmare rejected by many in the security establishment. The newspaper pointed out that the Hamas tunnel network is much more extensive than the occupation army estimates, and that it extends for a distance of more than 300 miles in the southern Gaza Strip alone. According to military commanders, it is unlikely that Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza will be completely dismantled. 	    Israeli media reported details of what they said were the broad outlines of a possible exchange deal with the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), which was drafted in cooperation with the Israeli security services, Mossad chief David Barnea, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. 	  Under the weight of protests in the Israeli street demanding the release of those detained by Hamas, the strengthening of convictions of the Israeli failure to achieve the goals of the war on Gaza , and the disagreements in the  war cabinet ,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted that he had presented broad outlines for a possible exchange deal, refusing to go into details. 	  According to these lines, 136 Israeli detainees will be released in 3 stages:    Civilian detainees.   Then the female soldiers and the bodies of dead detainees.   Finally, the soldiers and men who serve in the Israeli army are regular and reserve, which is the condition that Hamas has insisted on from the beginning.   	  In return, Israel will release at every stage thousands of Palestinian prisoners, male and female, including veteran prisoners, the sick, the elderly, people with high sentences, and prisoners who the occupation says have blood on their hands, and the army will gradually withdraw from the Gaza Strip. 	  Netanyahu claimed that there was no serious offer by Hamas for an exchange deal, and he appeared contradictory during his meeting with a delegation of the families of Israeli detainees held by the Palestinian resistance, as he stated that he rejected the movements demands to end the war and reach an agreement that he says also includes the release of elite forces militants from Hamas. Who were arrested by Israel for allegedly participating in the  Al-Aqsa Flood  battle. 	  Israel recently handed over to the Qatari and Egyptian mediators a new framework for a possible exchange deal that includes preparing for a two-month truce in exchange for the return of all those detained by Hamas in Gaza, according to two senior Israeli officials. 	  According to Barak Ravid, a political analyst on the Walla website, this proposal is the most important that Tel Aviv has put forward since the beginning of the war, in an attempt to bring about a breakthrough in the negotiations to release the detainees. Although the proposal rejects Hamas's request to stop the war, it includes preparations for the longest ceasefire agreed to by Israel so far, according to Ravid. The analyst quoted two senior Israeli officials as saying that the war cabinet agreed about 10 days ago on a framework that includes the principles of what Israel wants and does not want to implement within the framework of the detainee release deal. 	  Ravid says that the deal includes the release of all living detainees and the return of all bodies held by Hamas in several stages.    The first phase will include the release of Israeli women who are still in captivity, men over the age of 60, and detainees who are in serious health condition.   In the next stages, men under the age of 60, female soldiers, male soldiers, and guard team members will be released, and the bodies will be returned.   	  According to the same proposal, Israel and Hamas would agree in advance on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released for each Israeli detainee in each of the categories, and then the names of the Palestinian prisoners to be released would be negotiated separately at each stage. 	  Ravid explained that the Israeli proposal includes preparations to begin redeploying army forces in the Gaza Strip, so that they gradually withdraw from large population centers, as well as allowing a gradual and controlled return of the Palestinian population to Gaza City and the northern Strip during the implementation of the agreement. 	  According to Ravid, the framework of the potential deal approved by the War Cabinet indicates that Israel will not agree to end the war after releasing the detainees and releasing all 6,000 Palestinian prisoners in its prisons. He stressed that Israel is still waiting for Hamas response to the proposal, but the Israeli side expressed cautious optimism about the possibility of moving forward with negotiations on the basis of this proposal, and acknowledged that if the deal is implemented, the activity of the occupation army in the Gaza Strip two months after the truce will be significantly less in scope and intensity. . 	  In reading the implications of Israel's drafting of a proposal for a new exchange deal and what was reported about Hamas showing some kind of flexibility in negotiating the deal, Amos Harel, a military analyst for the Haaretz newspaper, believes that the gap in positions is still large, but there is a willingness on both sides to discuss the broad outlines of this deal. 	  Harel estimated that the United States , Qatar and Egypt are exerting pressure on both sides to enter into a process of negotiations that will lead to the conclusion of an exchange deal in stages, in the first stage of which some Israeli detainees will be released, and in the final stage the occupation army will withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and thus the end of the war will be declared.  	  Harel added that it seems that no breakthrough has been achieved yet in the talks, but for the first time in a long time there is a willingness from Israel and Hamas to discuss - and seriously - the broad lines of the deal, and it is expected that one of the channels of talks will resume this week in Cairo . The military analyst pointed out that Israel, in light of the widening circle of protests denouncing the governments handling of the file of detainees held by Hamas, is seeking to move forward with another stage to release them in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners it holds in prisons, while agreeing to a two-week ceasefire. He pointed out that the Egyptian mediators are seeking to reach a ceasefire for a period of 90 days, and to eventually move to a final stage of the agreement to end the war. 	  In this context, Harel points out that the families of the detainees have escalated their protests against the backdrop of frustration with what appears to be the laxity of the political level regarding the deal. 	        A kilometer and a half long tunnel route and a factory for the production of rockets: the combat team of the 7th Brigade destroys the production capabilities of Hamas. As the forces advanced in the area, terrorist squads opened fire with small arms and many RPGs in order to prevent the entry of the forces. At the same time, the terrorists blew up the tunnel shafts in an attempt to prevent the force from penetrating the subsoil. Battles were held in the area against a large number of terrorists. The fighters returned fire and eliminated the terrorists at close range, with machine gun fire, tank shell fire and air support. 	  The fighters of the combat team together with the fighters of the Yalam unit located many shafts that led to a long tunnel route with a laboratory and a lathe for the production of underground rockets, this is the largest lathe that has been located so far in the southern Gaza Strip. The underground route was scanned, explored and destroyed after the end of the exploration. This activity is part of the effort to damage Hamas' weapons and rocket production capabilities in the Gaza Strip. 	    Air force fighter jets completed an attack on terrorist targets in Lebanon. As part of the attack, a military asset used by the terrorist organization Hezbollah and operated by Iranian forces was destroyed. Also, a military site where the organization's terrorists were operating was destroyed. During the day, IDF forces attacked several other areas in the territory of Lebanon.    Maps   All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.   	  	But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.  	Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.   	Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.  	Indeed, by late January 2024 mappers were rather less exuberant in their depictions of IDF advances. While by the end of 2023 maps suggested that it was ""mission accomplished"" in North Gaza which was depicted as entirely pacified, by late January 2024 enclaves of IDF elements were depicted at the margins of Gaza City, much of North Gaza was now depticted as either HAMAS-controlled, or ""contested"".   	Another noteworthy cartographic ambiguity is found to the south of Khan Yunis in the stretch of Salah Al-Deen avenue running north from Al-Nasr through al-Fukhari to the vicinity of Tawhid Mosque in the environs of Khan Yunis proper. By the end of 2023 some cartographers indicated that a large swath of territory centered on this avenue had been liberated by the IDF, while other cartographers professed no knowlege of an IDF presence in that part of the Strip. By late January 2024 there are suggestions that while the avenue itself is an IDF permissive corridor for nearly the full length of the Strip, much of adjacent territory is not.	  	                 Bystanders   European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that Israel does not have a veto against the Palestinians' right to self-determination. Borrell pointed out that an agreement had been reached between the European Union and its allies in the Middle East on a two-state solution, which Israel announced that it opposes. He pointed out that the United Nations has repeatedly recognized the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, and no party can deny or oppose that.    Axis of Resistance  Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei called on Islamic governments to join hands and cut off the lifeline of the Zionist regime in response to its onslaught against Gaza. The organizers of the National Congress for the Commemoration of the 24,000 Martyrs from Tehran met with Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran.  			  In the gathering, the Leader criticized the officials of Islamic countries for their poor conduct regarding the highly crucial situation in Gaza, saying, ""Sometimes the positions and statements of the officials of the Islamic countries are wrong because they talk about an issue such as the ceasefire in Gaza, which is beyond their control and is in the hands of the evil Zionist enemy. The officials of Islamic countries should focus on matters that are within their control.""  			  The Leader stressed the importance for officials in the Islamic countries to sever all ties with the Zionist regime in order to cripple its power, Khamenei.ir reported. ""That which is in the hands of the officials of the Islamic countries is to cut off the lifeline of the Zionist regime. Islamic countries should cut off their political and economic relations with the Zionist regime and they should also refrain from supporting this regime,"" the Leader stated.  			  Despite the inadequate conduct of the officials of Islamic countries and despite all the difficulties, as stated in the Quran, God is with the righteous people and wherever God is, there is victory', Ayatollah Khamenei underlined. The Leader also noted that the victory of the people of Gaza is inevitable, adding, ""the Almighty God will show this victory to the Islamic Ummah in the not-too-distant future, and it will bring joy to the hearts of Muslims, especially the people of Palestine and Gaza.""    	  	The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy argued that the Yemeni military forces have decided, of their own volition, to bar vessels owned by or bound for Israel from sailing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait without taking orders from anybody. Yemen is an independent state that has a powerful army and a strong leader, which acts independently and does not take orders from any party, Rear Admiral Ali Reza Tangsiri said in reaction to the attacks that the Yemeni forces have been launching against Israeli vessels in the Red Sea. He noted that the hero Yemenis have expressed their practical support for the Palestinian people in Gaza.   Allied for Democracy   		Haaretz newspaper said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lost control over his lying, as happens to him when he is under pressure, especially since he is cornered due to the pressure of calling for the detainees deal and the United States. The newspaper reported - in a report by Anshel Pfeiffer - that Netanyahu said in a meeting with relatives of detainees held by the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) in Gaza that contrary to what is said, there is no real proposal on the part of Hamas, and this is not true, according to Pfeiffer. 	  		The writer added, ""I will say that as clearly as I can, and then he will ask, 'Who said that there is a proposal from Hamas?' He responds that Netanyahu is the same one who said less than 24 hours ago, I completely reject the terms of surrender proposed by the monsters of Hamas. Thus - the writer points out - that there is not only a proposal, but rather that there are actual conditions that Netanyahu continued to detail, saying, In exchange for the release of our hostages, Hamas demands an end to the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the killers and rapists from the elite, and leaving Hamas in its place. 	  		Although Netanyahu can avoid lying to the families of detainees and to the public, what worries him most is that the Egyptian government is about to present an official proposal regarding a deal to release detainees in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a long-term ceasefire in Gaza, which is what his companions Benny Gantz and Gadi prefer. Eisenkot, and they will demand a clear answer from him and will not allow him to evade.  		Meanwhile, Netanyahu is still trying to lie to US President Joe Biden . He gave him the impression of being prepared to consider certain forms of a demilitarized Palestinian state. He then took to social media and wrote, I will not give up full Israeli security control over western Jordan, and this contradicts With the Palestinian state. 	  		After the two pressure factors - the Americans and the detainees deal - became unbearable, it is possible for Netanyahu to agree to discuss the possibility of the Egyptian proposal and the American framework, because it is likely that Hamas and the Palestinian Authority will reject it , and therefore he may be playing for time in the meantime. 	  		But the biggest concern and what Netanyahu fears most is losing the majority in the Knesset , after it took him 4 years and 5 election campaigns - including 18 frustrating months out of office - for him to be able to secure it in November 2022. This majority of the parties that supported him in the last elections is all... Something is for him, and he will do anything to avoid wasting it. 	  		Any indication from Netanyahu that he is willing to accept a ceasefire or agree to the Palestinian Authoritys control of Gaza after the war - as the writer says - will put 14 seats at risk, and not because the leaders of the two extreme right-wing parties, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, are in a hurry to leave the ruling coalition. But because they need to bolster their claims to be true right-wingers when the next election comes. Without these two full-backs, Netanyahu will be at the mercy of Gantz and Eisenkot, whose National Unity Party has the seats needed to keep the government afloat if the far-right parties leave, but they will want to replace him as soon as possible. 	  		The writer concluded that Netanyahu cannot curb events forever despite his avoidance of a serious discussion in the cabinet regarding the next day strategy in Gaza, but whatever he does, he is likely to lose part of his emergency coalition within weeks, and Smotrich and Ben Gvir will not be able to protect him from The decisions he has to make, and soon his lies will run out, according to the writer. 	              		  Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, author of the controversial book How Were the Jewish People Invented, has published a new work entitled Two Peoples for One State? It supports the idea, which has been defended by many Zionist intellectuals since the end of the 19th century, which is the establishment of a bi-national state for Israelis and Palestinians. Sand said - in an interview with him, summarized by Julie Conan for the French newspaper La Croix - that what is happening in the Gaza Strip is dangerous because no one in the Israeli authority knows what to do, and because aimless wars are dangerous, and almost turn into genocide. 	  The Israeli historian explained that he never supported a bi-national state and was not against it, but after the 1967 war, he supported the two-state solution. But after all these years of settlement, the idea of a two-state solution has become more and more hollow, because we have been living for half a century in a bi-national state under a clear apartheid system, in which people live side by side but with different rights, as he put it 	  Sand believed that it was Europe that vomited the Jews onto the Arabs of Palestine, and for this reason the behavior of the Europeans bothers me a lot.   Speaking to the Europeans, he added, You are responsible for long-term tragedies. For all my life, I have been surprised that people who claim that they were taken from their land two thousand years ago do not recognize the rights of those who were taken from their land 75 years ago. Israel does not want to recognize this, despite the fact that all Hamas leaders , such as Yahya Al-Sanwar and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin come from the ancient land of Palestine, from Ashkelon and Ashdod, which is considered the land of Israel. 	      The air and missile strikes launched by the administration of President Joe Biden against the Houthis in Yemen did not succeed in restoring American deterrence, or preventing them from attacking ships in the southern Red Sea . Instead of calming tension in one of the most important commercial sea lanes in the world, the military strikes exacerbated it further. 	  A number of experts Al Jazeera Net spoke to fear the involvement of the United States in a broader war in the region, at a time when the Houthis do not show any signs of retreating from their declared position regarding the continuation of attacks as long as the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip continues. Washington hopes that its almost daily attacks will deter the Houthi group from attacking shipping lines in the Red Sea, or destroy and eliminate its missile stockpiles. 	  For his part, John Finner, Deputy National Security Advisor to the White House, defended the Washington-led coalition strikes against the Houthis, saying, ""The goals here go beyond deterrence. We seek to weaken their ability to continue launching these attacks."" Despite the continuation of the strikes involving the British Navy, Biden admitted that they had not yet produced the desired effect. He responded to the question of one of the journalists accompanying him, Will the Houthis stop? He said, No. He answered the question, ""Will they continue?"" By saying: Yes. 	  In an interview with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, retired General Frank McKenzie, former head of the US Central Command, said that the US strikes are welcome, even if they are somewhat late, given the importance of the Bab al- Mandab Strait. We may be able to deter the Houthis from continuing these actions, McKenzie said. There is still a lot of fighting ahead to achieve this goal, but I think we are doing the right thing. 	  Days earlier, the US announced the killing of two Navy personnel after they disappeared 10 days ago during a naval operation to intercept weapons from Iran destined for Houthi fighters. They are among the first known American deaths in the US campaign against the Houthis. This coincided with the publication of successive reports about the possibility that taking action against the Houthis could fuel a broader war in the Middle East , and McKenzie believes that the threat is exaggerated. 	  In an interview with CNN last Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said , Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation, we have issued warnings that if the attacks and war crimes do not stop... And the genocide against Gaza and the West Bank , the war will spread widely, and will become larger. 	  He added, ""This does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion. We care about maritime security and shipping safety. Our oil exports take place across the sea. Therefore, the security of the Red Sea, the Sea of Oman and the Persian Gulf is very important to us. We benefit from it. Otherwise, we will not be able to Export our oil. 	  On the other hand, McKenzie believes,  Iran currently has no interest in entering a major war, because they understand in the end what will happen. They will be defeated. The regime will be under intense pressure and may collapse. I do not think that Tehran will escalate its attacks significantly in the region because we are striking the Houthis, according to him. Appreciate it. He continues, ""Currently, this is a cheap war for them. They have waged it very effectively by shipping missiles and other lethal components to Yemen."" 	  For his part, security affairs expert Alexandre Langlois considered, in an article published by ""The Nation"" magazine, that while the Houthi strikes have continued since last November, the Biden team hopes that its step will deter them from continuing these attacks. But he believes that the reality is more ambiguous, and Biden will fail to stop the groups aggression while it further obstructs international shipping, as both actors are climbing an escalatory ladder that risks a broader regional war. 	  Speaking to Al Jazeera Net, the director of the Gulf States Studies Foundation, Giorgio Cafiero, considered that the Houthis conflict with the United States gives them more sympathy and support throughout the Arab world at a time when anti-Washington sentiment is rising in the region due to the Biden administration providing strong support to Israel amid the genocidal war on Gaza. Cafiero added that the conflict with Washington enables the Houthis to better consolidate their position within the Iranian-led axis of resistance, and demonstrates to Tehran the extent of the groups connection to this anti-hegemonic alliance. He also pointed out that the Houthis are accustomed to war and fighting while foreign powers bomb their targets in Yemen. Hence, the Houthis spread their weapons across the country, making it increasingly difficult for the US military or any other force to eliminate their fighting capacity through air strikes. 	  Langlois believes that instead of continuing with failed regional policies, the United States should consider the only clear measure that will end the Houthi strikes on international shipping with a permanent ceasefire between Israel and the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), which will solve multiple problems facing American foreign policy if the administration shows... Biden is real leadership by pressuring Israel. 	  In a difficult election year, President Biden's aides are concerned about the possibility of escalation on the one hand, and the fear that he will appear as a weak president if he does not resort to military tools on the other hand. Jawdat Bahjat, a professor at the Near East and South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the Pentagon s National Defense University , told Al Jazeera Net, Washingtons military and technological superiority does not give it the ability to deter the Houthis. It has previously failed in Afghanistan , and the Houthis have won, in one way or another, In the war in Yemen. He adds that the Houthis, like other militias, use asymmetric wars and tactics to confront the United States. In an election year, President Biden cannot appear weak, noting the possibility that Washington will continue to attack the Houthis, but these strikes are unlikely to stop their attacks or prevent them from taking action against Israel.     Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  With the Israeli army announcing the killing of 24 soldiers, the total number of occupation deaths has risen to 559 since the start of the war on October 7, including 229 killed since the ground invasion as a result of the ongoing clashes with the Palestinian resistance [other sources report the total number of deaths of the occupation army has risen to 221 since the start of the ground invasion].	 Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	An Israeli official said that negotiations with Hamas regarding a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for a prisoner exchange are still ongoing. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that the negotiations are still ongoing and we have not received a negative response. It pointed out that the Israeli official's statements came after Western reports about Hamas rejecting the Israeli offer.         Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have been held as hostages in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Unlike the roughly 240 people kidnapped in the Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, the campaign for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed has received little publicity. Mengistu is known to suffer from what HRW deemed ""serious"" mental health issues. ""Avera crossed one of the safest borders in the world, under the eyes of the security services,"" recalled Gil Elias, a relative. ""We're talking about a mentally ill person who got lost."" The calls for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed have been barely audible during the many years they have been held captive in Gaza.	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address

The Israeli Broadcasting Authority said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed his government ministers that the third phase of the war on Gaza will take 6 months. The authority added that Netanyahu explained that it would take 6 months for the army to end the third phase of the war, which had already begun in the northern Gaza Strip. It quoted Netanyahu as saying to the ministers at a meeting yesterday: ""As we said previously, the air part will continue for 3 weeks and so it was, and as we said that the second part of the huge maneuver will last 3 months and so it was, and thus we say that the third part of stabilizing control and cleansing will continue for 6 months"", according to his expressions.
Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy said that the battle in the Gaza Strip will be long; Stressing the need for reserve forces again, after 24 Israeli soldiers were killed in one day in a specific Palestinian resistance operation. Halevy added: ""We will continue to fight"" the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) ""with great determination for our right to live in safety."" Regarding the operation in which 21 of his forces were killed, Halevy said: Our soldiers fell in battle during a defensive operation in the area separating the Israeli towns and Gaza. He added that the operation was aimed at creating security conditions for the residents of the Gaza envelope area to return to their homes safely, noting that an in-depth investigation will be opened and lessons will be drawn so that such an incident will not be repeated.
In recent weeks, the Israeli army announced the withdrawal of many of its forces from the Gaza Strip as part of entering the third phase of the war, which focuses on targeted bombing, noting that it does not clarify the number of its forces currently present in the Gaza Strip, as part of its ground incursion.
The Al-Qassam Brigades , the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), stated that it destroyed an Israeli troop carrier with an  Al-Yassin 105  shell in the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, which has been witnessing, since dawn on Monday, Israeli incursion attempts and fierce fighting and bombing.
For its part, the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement, reported that it blew up an Israeli tank with a piercing device in the Al-Taqadum axis, west of Khan Yunis, in the vicinity of the Japanese Quarter. It added that it bombed with a barrage of mortar shells a position of occupation soldiers and vehicles in the advance axis in the western camp in Khan Yunis.
Al Jazeera's correspondent said that the Israeli army also announced last night that about 18 wounded in battles in the southern Gaza Strip had been transferred to Israeli hospitals. The reporter added that the occupation forces are besieging the southern area of Khan Yunis and closing the western area with 7 military battalions, because they believe that the military leaders of the Hamas movement are concentrated in this area.
The Israeli army claimed to have completed the encirclement of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. The army said, in a statement, Over the last 24 hours, the 98th Division carried out a large-scale attack in Khan Yunis. It claimed that within the division, ""the paratroopers, the Givati and the 7th Brigade completed the operation during the attack to encircle Khan Yunis. The commandos also deepened the attack into the heart of the area that is used as a pivotal center of gravity for the Hamas-affiliated Khan Yunis Brigade."" The IDF army claimed that it ""eliminated dozens of militants in face-to-face battles in cooperation with air force raids.""
The American newspaper The Washington Post quoted Israeli military and security leaders as saying that the Israeli army may lose gains in the Gaza Strip, due to the lack of a post-war strategy. The leaders explained that the army must maintain its areas of control, not control new territory. The Washington Post, citing an Israeli military source, said that the long-term security presence in Gaza is a nightmare rejected by many in the security establishment. The newspaper pointed out that the Hamas tunnel network is much more extensive than the occupation army estimates, and that it extends for a distance of more than 300 miles in the southern Gaza Strip alone. According to military commanders, it is unlikely that Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza will be completely dismantled.
Israeli media reported details of what they said were the broad outlines of a possible exchange deal with the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), which was drafted in cooperation with the Israeli security services, Mossad chief David Barnea, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar.
Under the weight of protests in the Israeli street demanding the release of those detained by Hamas, the strengthening of convictions of the Israeli failure to achieve the goals of the war on Gaza , and the disagreements in the  war cabinet ,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted that he had presented broad outlines for a possible exchange deal, refusing to go into details.
According to these lines, 136 Israeli detainees will be released in 3 stages:    Civilian detainees.   Then the female soldiers and the bodies of dead detainees.   Finally, the soldiers and men who serve in the Israeli army are regular and reserve, which is the condition that Hamas has insisted on from the beginning.
In return, Israel will release at every stage thousands of Palestinian prisoners, male and female, including veteran prisoners, the sick, the elderly, people with high sentences, and prisoners who the occupation says have blood on their hands, and the army will gradually withdraw from the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu claimed that there was no serious offer by Hamas for an exchange deal, and he appeared contradictory during his meeting with a delegation of the families of Israeli detainees held by the Palestinian resistance, as he stated that he rejected the movements demands to end the war and reach an agreement that he says also includes the release of elite forces militants from Hamas. Who were arrested by Israel for allegedly participating in the  Al-Aqsa Flood  battle.
Israel recently handed over to the Qatari and Egyptian mediators a new framework for a possible exchange deal that includes preparing for a two-month truce in exchange for the return of all those detained by Hamas in Gaza, according to two senior Israeli officials.
According to Barak Ravid, a political analyst on the Walla website, this proposal is the most important that Tel Aviv has put forward since the beginning of the war, in an attempt to bring about a breakthrough in the negotiations to release the detainees. Although the proposal rejects Hamas's request to stop the war, it includes preparations for the longest ceasefire agreed to by Israel so far, according to Ravid. The analyst quoted two senior Israeli officials as saying that the war cabinet agreed about 10 days ago on a framework that includes the principles of what Israel wants and does not want to implement within the framework of the detainee release deal.
Ravid says that the deal includes the release of all living detainees and the return of all bodies held by Hamas in several stages.    The first phase will include the release of Israeli women who are still in captivity, men over the age of 60, and detainees who are in serious health condition.   In the next stages, men under the age of 60, female soldiers, male soldiers, and guard team members will be released, and the bodies will be returned.
According to the same proposal, Israel and Hamas would agree in advance on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released for each Israeli detainee in each of the categories, and then the names of the Palestinian prisoners to be released would be negotiated separately at each stage.
Ravid explained that the Israeli proposal includes preparations to begin redeploying army forces in the Gaza Strip, so that they gradually withdraw from large population centers, as well as allowing a gradual and controlled return of the Palestinian population to Gaza City and the northern Strip during the implementation of the agreement.
According to Ravid, the framework of the potential deal approved by the War Cabinet indicates that Israel will not agree to end the war after releasing the detainees and releasing all 6,000 Palestinian prisoners in its prisons. He stressed that Israel is still waiting for Hamas response to the proposal, but the Israeli side expressed cautious optimism about the possibility of moving forward with negotiations on the basis of this proposal, and acknowledged that if the deal is implemented, the activity of the occupation army in the Gaza Strip two months after the truce will be significantly less in scope and intensity. .
In reading the implications of Israel's drafting of a proposal for a new exchange deal and what was reported about Hamas showing some kind of flexibility in negotiating the deal, Amos Harel, a military analyst for the Haaretz newspaper, believes that the gap in positions is still large, but there is a willingness on both sides to discuss the broad outlines of this deal.
Harel estimated that the United States , Qatar and Egypt are exerting pressure on both sides to enter into a process of negotiations that will lead to the conclusion of an exchange deal in stages, in the first stage of which some Israeli detainees will be released, and in the final stage the occupation army will withdraw from the Gaza Strip, and thus the end of the war will be declared.
Harel added that it seems that no breakthrough has been achieved yet in the talks, but for the first time in a long time there is a willingness from Israel and Hamas to discuss - and seriously - the broad lines of the deal, and it is expected that one of the channels of talks will resume this week in Cairo . The military analyst pointed out that Israel, in light of the widening circle of protests denouncing the governments handling of the file of detainees held by Hamas, is seeking to move forward with another stage to release them in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners it holds in prisons, while agreeing to a two-week ceasefire. He pointed out that the Egyptian mediators are seeking to reach a ceasefire for a period of 90 days, and to eventually move to a final stage of the agreement to end the war.
In this context, Harel points out that the families of the detainees have escalated their protests against the backdrop of frustration with what appears to be the laxity of the political level regarding the deal.
A kilometer and a half long tunnel route and a factory for the production of rockets: the combat team of the 7th Brigade destroys the production capabilities of Hamas. As the forces advanced in the area, terrorist squads opened fire with small arms and many RPGs in order to prevent the entry of the forces. At the same time, the terrorists blew up the tunnel shafts in an attempt to prevent the force from penetrating the subsoil. Battles were held in the area against a large number of terrorists. The fighters returned fire and eliminated the terrorists at close range, with machine gun fire, tank shell fire and air support.
The fighters of the combat team together with the fighters of the Yalam unit located many shafts that led to a long tunnel route with a laboratory and a lathe for the production of underground rockets, this is the largest lathe that has been located so far in the southern Gaza Strip. The underground route was scanned, explored and destroyed after the end of the exploration. This activity is part of the effort to damage Hamas' weapons and rocket production capabilities in the Gaza Strip.
Air force fighter jets completed an attack on terrorist targets in Lebanon. As part of the attack, a military asset used by the terrorist organization Hezbollah and operated by Iranian forces was destroyed. Also, a military site where the organization's terrorists were operating was destroyed. During the day, IDF forces attacked several other areas in the territory of Lebanon.

Maps   All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.   	  	But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.  	Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.   	Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.  	Indeed, by late January 2024 mappers were rather less exuberant in their depictions of IDF advances. While by the end of 2023 maps suggested that it was ""mission accomplished"" in North Gaza which was depicted as entirely pacified, by late January 2024 enclaves of IDF elements were depicted at the margins of Gaza City, much of North Gaza was now depticted as either HAMAS-controlled, or ""contested"".   	Another noteworthy cartographic ambiguity is found to the south of Khan Yunis in the stretch of Salah Al-Deen avenue running north from Al-Nasr through al-Fukhari to the vicinity of Tawhid Mosque in the environs of Khan Yunis proper. By the end of 2023 some cartographers indicated that a large swath of territory centered on this avenue had been liberated by the IDF, while other cartographers professed no knowlege of an IDF presence in that part of the Strip. By late January 2024 there are suggestions that while the avenue itself is an IDF permissive corridor for nearly the full length of the Strip, much of adjacent territory is not.
All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.
But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.
Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.
Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.

Bystanders   European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that Israel does not have a veto against the Palestinians' right to self-determination. Borrell pointed out that an agreement had been reached between the European Union and its allies in the Middle East on a two-state solution, which Israel announced that it opposes. He pointed out that the United Nations has repeatedly recognized the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, and no party can deny or oppose that.    Axis of Resistance  Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei called on Islamic governments to join hands and cut off the lifeline of the Zionist regime in response to its onslaught against Gaza. The organizers of the National Congress for the Commemoration of the 24,000 Martyrs from Tehran met with Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran.  			  In the gathering, the Leader criticized the officials of Islamic countries for their poor conduct regarding the highly crucial situation in Gaza, saying, ""Sometimes the positions and statements of the officials of the Islamic countries are wrong because they talk about an issue such as the ceasefire in Gaza, which is beyond their control and is in the hands of the evil Zionist enemy. The officials of Islamic countries should focus on matters that are within their control.""  			  The Leader stressed the importance for officials in the Islamic countries to sever all ties with the Zionist regime in order to cripple its power, Khamenei.ir reported. ""That which is in the hands of the officials of the Islamic countries is to cut off the lifeline of the Zionist regime. Islamic countries should cut off their political and economic relations with the Zionist regime and they should also refrain from supporting this regime,"" the Leader stated.  			  Despite the inadequate conduct of the officials of Islamic countries and despite all the difficulties, as stated in the Quran, God is with the righteous people and wherever God is, there is victory', Ayatollah Khamenei underlined. The Leader also noted that the victory of the people of Gaza is inevitable, adding, ""the Almighty God will show this victory to the Islamic Ummah in the not-too-distant future, and it will bring joy to the hearts of Muslims, especially the people of Palestine and Gaza.""    	  	The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy argued that the Yemeni military forces have decided, of their own volition, to bar vessels owned by or bound for Israel from sailing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait without taking orders from anybody. Yemen is an independent state that has a powerful army and a strong leader, which acts independently and does not take orders from any party, Rear Admiral Ali Reza Tangsiri said in reaction to the attacks that the Yemeni forces have been launching against Israeli vessels in the Red Sea. He noted that the hero Yemenis have expressed their practical support for the Palestinian people in Gaza.   Allied for Democracy   		Haaretz newspaper said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lost control over his lying, as happens to him when he is under pressure, especially since he is cornered due to the pressure of calling for the detainees deal and the United States. The newspaper reported - in a report by Anshel Pfeiffer - that Netanyahu said in a meeting with relatives of detainees held by the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) in Gaza that contrary to what is said, there is no real proposal on the part of Hamas, and this is not true, according to Pfeiffer. 	  		The writer added, ""I will say that as clearly as I can, and then he will ask, 'Who said that there is a proposal from Hamas?' He responds that Netanyahu is the same one who said less than 24 hours ago, I completely reject the terms of surrender proposed by the monsters of Hamas. Thus - the writer points out - that there is not only a proposal, but rather that there are actual conditions that Netanyahu continued to detail, saying, In exchange for the release of our hostages, Hamas demands an end to the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the killers and rapists from the elite, and leaving Hamas in its place. 	  		Although Netanyahu can avoid lying to the families of detainees and to the public, what worries him most is that the Egyptian government is about to present an official proposal regarding a deal to release detainees in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a long-term ceasefire in Gaza, which is what his companions Benny Gantz and Gadi prefer. Eisenkot, and they will demand a clear answer from him and will not allow him to evade.  		Meanwhile, Netanyahu is still trying to lie to US President Joe Biden . He gave him the impression of being prepared to consider certain forms of a demilitarized Palestinian state. He then took to social media and wrote, I will not give up full Israeli security control over western Jordan, and this contradicts With the Palestinian state. 	  		After the two pressure factors - the Americans and the detainees deal - became unbearable, it is possible for Netanyahu to agree to discuss the possibility of the Egyptian proposal and the American framework, because it is likely that Hamas and the Palestinian Authority will reject it , and therefore he may be playing for time in the meantime. 	  		But the biggest concern and what Netanyahu fears most is losing the majority in the Knesset , after it took him 4 years and 5 election campaigns - including 18 frustrating months out of office - for him to be able to secure it in November 2022. This majority of the parties that supported him in the last elections is all... Something is for him, and he will do anything to avoid wasting it. 	  		Any indication from Netanyahu that he is willing to accept a ceasefire or agree to the Palestinian Authoritys control of Gaza after the war - as the writer says - will put 14 seats at risk, and not because the leaders of the two extreme right-wing parties, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, are in a hurry to leave the ruling coalition. But because they need to bolster their claims to be true right-wingers when the next election comes. Without these two full-backs, Netanyahu will be at the mercy of Gantz and Eisenkot, whose National Unity Party has the seats needed to keep the government afloat if the far-right parties leave, but they will want to replace him as soon as possible. 	  		The writer concluded that Netanyahu cannot curb events forever despite his avoidance of a serious discussion in the cabinet regarding the next day strategy in Gaza, but whatever he does, he is likely to lose part of his emergency coalition within weeks, and Smotrich and Ben Gvir will not be able to protect him from The decisions he has to make, and soon his lies will run out, according to the writer. 	              		  Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, author of the controversial book How Were the Jewish People Invented, has published a new work entitled Two Peoples for One State? It supports the idea, which has been defended by many Zionist intellectuals since the end of the 19th century, which is the establishment of a bi-national state for Israelis and Palestinians. Sand said - in an interview with him, summarized by Julie Conan for the French newspaper La Croix - that what is happening in the Gaza Strip is dangerous because no one in the Israeli authority knows what to do, and because aimless wars are dangerous, and almost turn into genocide. 	  The Israeli historian explained that he never supported a bi-national state and was not against it, but after the 1967 war, he supported the two-state solution. But after all these years of settlement, the idea of a two-state solution has become more and more hollow, because we have been living for half a century in a bi-national state under a clear apartheid system, in which people live side by side but with different rights, as he put it 	  Sand believed that it was Europe that vomited the Jews onto the Arabs of Palestine, and for this reason the behavior of the Europeans bothers me a lot.   Speaking to the Europeans, he added, You are responsible for long-term tragedies. For all my life, I have been surprised that people who claim that they were taken from their land two thousand years ago do not recognize the rights of those who were taken from their land 75 years ago. Israel does not want to recognize this, despite the fact that all Hamas leaders , such as Yahya Al-Sanwar and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin come from the ancient land of Palestine, from Ashkelon and Ashdod, which is considered the land of Israel. 	      The air and missile strikes launched by the administration of President Joe Biden against the Houthis in Yemen did not succeed in restoring American deterrence, or preventing them from attacking ships in the southern Red Sea . Instead of calming tension in one of the most important commercial sea lanes in the world, the military strikes exacerbated it further. 	  A number of experts Al Jazeera Net spoke to fear the involvement of the United States in a broader war in the region, at a time when the Houthis do not show any signs of retreating from their declared position regarding the continuation of attacks as long as the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip continues. Washington hopes that its almost daily attacks will deter the Houthi group from attacking shipping lines in the Red Sea, or destroy and eliminate its missile stockpiles. 	  For his part, John Finner, Deputy National Security Advisor to the White House, defended the Washington-led coalition strikes against the Houthis, saying, ""The goals here go beyond deterrence. We seek to weaken their ability to continue launching these attacks."" Despite the continuation of the strikes involving the British Navy, Biden admitted that they had not yet produced the desired effect. He responded to the question of one of the journalists accompanying him, Will the Houthis stop? He said, No. He answered the question, ""Will they continue?"" By saying: Yes. 	  In an interview with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, retired General Frank McKenzie, former head of the US Central Command, said that the US strikes are welcome, even if they are somewhat late, given the importance of the Bab al- Mandab Strait. We may be able to deter the Houthis from continuing these actions, McKenzie said. There is still a lot of fighting ahead to achieve this goal, but I think we are doing the right thing. 	  Days earlier, the US announced the killing of two Navy personnel after they disappeared 10 days ago during a naval operation to intercept weapons from Iran destined for Houthi fighters. They are among the first known American deaths in the US campaign against the Houthis. This coincided with the publication of successive reports about the possibility that taking action against the Houthis could fuel a broader war in the Middle East , and McKenzie believes that the threat is exaggerated. 	  In an interview with CNN last Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said , Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation, we have issued warnings that if the attacks and war crimes do not stop... And the genocide against Gaza and the West Bank , the war will spread widely, and will become larger. 	  He added, ""This does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion. We care about maritime security and shipping safety. Our oil exports take place across the sea. Therefore, the security of the Red Sea, the Sea of Oman and the Persian Gulf is very important to us. We benefit from it. Otherwise, we will not be able to Export our oil. 	  On the other hand, McKenzie believes,  Iran currently has no interest in entering a major war, because they understand in the end what will happen. They will be defeated. The regime will be under intense pressure and may collapse. I do not think that Tehran will escalate its attacks significantly in the region because we are striking the Houthis, according to him. Appreciate it. He continues, ""Currently, this is a cheap war for them. They have waged it very effectively by shipping missiles and other lethal components to Yemen."" 	  For his part, security affairs expert Alexandre Langlois considered, in an article published by ""The Nation"" magazine, that while the Houthi strikes have continued since last November, the Biden team hopes that its step will deter them from continuing these attacks. But he believes that the reality is more ambiguous, and Biden will fail to stop the groups aggression while it further obstructs international shipping, as both actors are climbing an escalatory ladder that risks a broader regional war. 	  Speaking to Al Jazeera Net, the director of the Gulf States Studies Foundation, Giorgio Cafiero, considered that the Houthis conflict with the United States gives them more sympathy and support throughout the Arab world at a time when anti-Washington sentiment is rising in the region due to the Biden administration providing strong support to Israel amid the genocidal war on Gaza. Cafiero added that the conflict with Washington enables the Houthis to better consolidate their position within the Iranian-led axis of resistance, and demonstrates to Tehran the extent of the groups connection to this anti-hegemonic alliance. He also pointed out that the Houthis are accustomed to war and fighting while foreign powers bomb their targets in Yemen. Hence, the Houthis spread their weapons across the country, making it increasingly difficult for the US military or any other force to eliminate their fighting capacity through air strikes. 	  Langlois believes that instead of continuing with failed regional policies, the United States should consider the only clear measure that will end the Houthi strikes on international shipping with a permanent ceasefire between Israel and the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), which will solve multiple problems facing American foreign policy if the administration shows... Biden is real leadership by pressuring Israel. 	  In a difficult election year, President Biden's aides are concerned about the possibility of escalation on the one hand, and the fear that he will appear as a weak president if he does not resort to military tools on the other hand. Jawdat Bahjat, a professor at the Near East and South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the Pentagon s National Defense University , told Al Jazeera Net, Washingtons military and technological superiority does not give it the ability to deter the Houthis. It has previously failed in Afghanistan , and the Houthis have won, in one way or another, In the war in Yemen. He adds that the Houthis, like other militias, use asymmetric wars and tactics to confront the United States. In an election year, President Biden cannot appear weak, noting the possibility that Washington will continue to attack the Houthis, but these strikes are unlikely to stop their attacks or prevent them from taking action against Israel.     Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  With the Israeli army announcing the killing of 24 soldiers, the total number of occupation deaths has risen to 559 since the start of the war on October 7, including 229 killed since the ground invasion as a result of the ongoing clashes with the Palestinian resistance [other sources report the total number of deaths of the occupation army has risen to 221 since the start of the ground invasion].	 Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	An Israeli official said that negotiations with Hamas regarding a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for a prisoner exchange are still ongoing. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that the negotiations are still ongoing and we have not received a negative response. It pointed out that the Israeli official's statements came after Western reports about Hamas rejecting the Israeli offer.         Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have been held as hostages in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Unlike the roughly 240 people kidnapped in the Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, the campaign for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed has received little publicity. Mengistu is known to suffer from what HRW deemed ""serious"" mental health issues. ""Avera crossed one of the safest borders in the world, under the eyes of the security services,"" recalled Gil Elias, a relative. ""We're talking about a mentally ill person who got lost."" The calls for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed have been barely audible during the many years they have been held captive in Gaza.	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address

Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, author of the controversial book How Were the Jewish People Invented, has published a new work entitled Two Peoples for One State? It supports the idea, which has been defended by many Zionist intellectuals since the end of the 19th century, which is the establishment of a bi-national state for Israelis and Palestinians. Sand said - in an interview with him, summarized by Julie Conan for the French newspaper La Croix - that what is happening in the Gaza Strip is dangerous because no one in the Israeli authority knows what to do, and because aimless wars are dangerous, and almost turn into genocide. 	  The Israeli historian explained that he never supported a bi-national state and was not against it, but after the 1967 war, he supported the two-state solution. But after all these years of settlement, the idea of a two-state solution has become more and more hollow, because we have been living for half a century in a bi-national state under a clear apartheid system, in which people live side by side but with different rights, as he put it 	  Sand believed that it was Europe that vomited the Jews onto the Arabs of Palestine, and for this reason the behavior of the Europeans bothers me a lot.   Speaking to the Europeans, he added, You are responsible for long-term tragedies. For all my life, I have been surprised that people who claim that they were taken from their land two thousand years ago do not recognize the rights of those who were taken from their land 75 years ago. Israel does not want to recognize this, despite the fact that all Hamas leaders , such as Yahya Al-Sanwar and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin come from the ancient land of Palestine, from Ashkelon and Ashdod, which is considered the land of Israel. 	      The air and missile strikes launched by the administration of President Joe Biden against the Houthis in Yemen did not succeed in restoring American deterrence, or preventing them from attacking ships in the southern Red Sea . Instead of calming tension in one of the most important commercial sea lanes in the world, the military strikes exacerbated it further. 	  A number of experts Al Jazeera Net spoke to fear the involvement of the United States in a broader war in the region, at a time when the Houthis do not show any signs of retreating from their declared position regarding the continuation of attacks as long as the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip continues. Washington hopes that its almost daily attacks will deter the Houthi group from attacking shipping lines in the Red Sea, or destroy and eliminate its missile stockpiles. 	  For his part, John Finner, Deputy National Security Advisor to the White House, defended the Washington-led coalition strikes against the Houthis, saying, ""The goals here go beyond deterrence. We seek to weaken their ability to continue launching these attacks."" Despite the continuation of the strikes involving the British Navy, Biden admitted that they had not yet produced the desired effect. He responded to the question of one of the journalists accompanying him, Will the Houthis stop? He said, No. He answered the question, ""Will they continue?"" By saying: Yes. 	  In an interview with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, retired General Frank McKenzie, former head of the US Central Command, said that the US strikes are welcome, even if they are somewhat late, given the importance of the Bab al- Mandab Strait. We may be able to deter the Houthis from continuing these actions, McKenzie said. There is still a lot of fighting ahead to achieve this goal, but I think we are doing the right thing. 	  Days earlier, the US announced the killing of two Navy personnel after they disappeared 10 days ago during a naval operation to intercept weapons from Iran destined for Houthi fighters. They are among the first known American deaths in the US campaign against the Houthis. This coincided with the publication of successive reports about the possibility that taking action against the Houthis could fuel a broader war in the Middle East , and McKenzie believes that the threat is exaggerated. 	  In an interview with CNN last Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said , Since the beginning of the Israeli genocidal war in Gaza, which followed the October operation, we have issued warnings that if the attacks and war crimes do not stop... And the genocide against Gaza and the West Bank , the war will spread widely, and will become larger. 	  He added, ""This does not mean that we wanted to play a role in this expansion. We care about maritime security and shipping safety. Our oil exports take place across the sea. Therefore, the security of the Red Sea, the Sea of Oman and the Persian Gulf is very important to us. We benefit from it. Otherwise, we will not be able to Export our oil. 	  On the other hand, McKenzie believes,  Iran currently has no interest in entering a major war, because they understand in the end what will happen. They will be defeated. The regime will be under intense pressure and may collapse. I do not think that Tehran will escalate its attacks significantly in the region because we are striking the Houthis, according to him. Appreciate it. He continues, ""Currently, this is a cheap war for them. They have waged it very effectively by shipping missiles and other lethal components to Yemen."" 	  For his part, security affairs expert Alexandre Langlois considered, in an article published by ""The Nation"" magazine, that while the Houthi strikes have continued since last November, the Biden team hopes that its step will deter them from continuing these attacks. But he believes that the reality is more ambiguous, and Biden will fail to stop the groups aggression while it further obstructs international shipping, as both actors are climbing an escalatory ladder that risks a broader regional war. 	  Speaking to Al Jazeera Net, the director of the Gulf States Studies Foundation, Giorgio Cafiero, considered that the Houthis conflict with the United States gives them more sympathy and support throughout the Arab world at a time when anti-Washington sentiment is rising in the region due to the Biden administration providing strong support to Israel amid the genocidal war on Gaza. Cafiero added that the conflict with Washington enables the Houthis to better consolidate their position within the Iranian-led axis of resistance, and demonstrates to Tehran the extent of the groups connection to this anti-hegemonic alliance. He also pointed out that the Houthis are accustomed to war and fighting while foreign powers bomb their targets in Yemen. Hence, the Houthis spread their weapons across the country, making it increasingly difficult for the US military or any other force to eliminate their fighting capacity through air strikes. 	  Langlois believes that instead of continuing with failed regional policies, the United States should consider the only clear measure that will end the Houthi strikes on international shipping with a permanent ceasefire between Israel and the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), which will solve multiple problems facing American foreign policy if the administration shows... Biden is real leadership by pressuring Israel. 	  In a difficult election year, President Biden's aides are concerned about the possibility of escalation on the one hand, and the fear that he will appear as a weak president if he does not resort to military tools on the other hand. Jawdat Bahjat, a professor at the Near East and South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the Pentagon s National Defense University , told Al Jazeera Net, Washingtons military and technological superiority does not give it the ability to deter the Houthis. It has previously failed in Afghanistan , and the Houthis have won, in one way or another, In the war in Yemen. He adds that the Houthis, like other militias, use asymmetric wars and tactics to confront the United States. In an election year, President Biden cannot appear weak, noting the possibility that Washington will continue to attack the Houthis, but these strikes are unlikely to stop their attacks or prevent them from taking action against Israel.     Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  With the Israeli army announcing the killing of 24 soldiers, the total number of occupation deaths has risen to 559 since the start of the war on October 7, including 229 killed since the ground invasion as a result of the ongoing clashes with the Palestinian resistance [other sources report the total number of deaths of the occupation army has risen to 221 since the start of the ground invasion].	 Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   	  According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	An Israeli official said that negotiations with Hamas regarding a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for a prisoner exchange are still ongoing. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that the negotiations are still ongoing and we have not received a negative response. It pointed out that the Israeli official's statements came after Western reports about Hamas rejecting the Israeli offer.         Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have been held as hostages in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Unlike the roughly 240 people kidnapped in the Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, the campaign for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed has received little publicity. Mengistu is known to suffer from what HRW deemed ""serious"" mental health issues. ""Avera crossed one of the safest borders in the world, under the eyes of the security services,"" recalled Gil Elias, a relative. ""We're talking about a mentally ill person who got lost."" The calls for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed have been barely audible during the many years they have been held captive in Gaza.	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei called on Islamic governments to join hands and cut off the lifeline of the Zionist regime in response to its onslaught against Gaza. The organizers of the National Congress for the Commemoration of the 24,000 Martyrs from Tehran met with Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran.
In the gathering, the Leader criticized the officials of Islamic countries for their poor conduct regarding the highly crucial situation in Gaza, saying, ""Sometimes the positions and statements of the officials of the Islamic countries are wrong because they talk about an issue such as the ceasefire in Gaza, which is beyond their control and is in the hands of the evil Zionist enemy. The officials of Islamic countries should focus on matters that are within their control.""
The Leader stressed the importance for officials in the Islamic countries to sever all ties with the Zionist regime in order to cripple its power, Khamenei.ir reported. ""That which is in the hands of the officials of the Islamic countries is to cut off the lifeline of the Zionist regime. Islamic countries should cut off their political and economic relations with the Zionist regime and they should also refrain from supporting this regime,"" the Leader stated.
Despite the inadequate conduct of the officials of Islamic countries and despite all the difficulties, as stated in the Quran, God is with the righteous people and wherever God is, there is victory', Ayatollah Khamenei underlined. The Leader also noted that the victory of the people of Gaza is inevitable, adding, ""the Almighty God will show this victory to the Islamic Ummah in the not-too-distant future, and it will bring joy to the hearts of Muslims, especially the people of Palestine and Gaza.""

Hence, the Houthis spread their weapons across the country, making it increasingly difficult for the US military or any other force to eliminate their fighting capacity through air strikes.

As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.

Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander.

In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire.

According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.

Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	An Israeli official said that negotiations with Hamas regarding a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for a prisoner exchange are still ongoing. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that the negotiations are still ongoing and we have not received a negative response. It pointed out that the Israeli official's statements came after Western reports about Hamas rejecting the Israeli offer.         Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have been held as hostages in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Unlike the roughly 240 people kidnapped in the Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, the campaign for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed has received little publicity. Mengistu is known to suffer from what HRW deemed ""serious"" mental health issues. ""Avera crossed one of the safest borders in the world, under the eyes of the security services,"" recalled Gil Elias, a relative. ""We're talking about a mentally ill person who got lost."" The calls for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed have been barely audible during the many years they have been held captive in Gaza.	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Haaretz newspaper said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lost control over his lying, as happens to him when he is under pressure, especially since he is cornered due to the pressure of calling for the detainees deal and the United States. The newspaper reported - in a report by Anshel Pfeiffer - that Netanyahu said in a meeting with relatives of detainees held by the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) in Gaza that contrary to what is said, there is no real proposal on the part of Hamas, and this is not true, according to Pfeiffer.
The writer added, ""I will say that as clearly as I can, and then he will ask, 'Who said that there is a proposal from Hamas?' He responds that Netanyahu is the same one who said less than 24 hours ago, I completely reject the terms of surrender proposed by the monsters of Hamas. Thus - the writer points out - that there is not only a proposal, but rather that there are actual conditions that Netanyahu continued to detail, saying, In exchange for the release of our hostages, Hamas demands an end to the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the killers and rapists from the elite, and leaving Hamas in its place.
Although Netanyahu can avoid lying to the families of detainees and to the public, what worries him most is that the Egyptian government is about to present an official proposal regarding a deal to release detainees in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and a long-term ceasefire in Gaza, which is what his companions Benny Gantz and Gadi prefer. Eisenkot, and they will demand a clear answer from him and will not allow him to evade.  		Meanwhile, Netanyahu is still trying to lie to US President Joe Biden . He gave him the impression of being prepared to consider certain forms of a demilitarized Palestinian state. He then took to social media and wrote, I will not give up full Israeli security control over western Jordan, and this contradicts With the Palestinian state.
After the two pressure factors - the Americans and the detainees deal - became unbearable, it is possible for Netanyahu to agree to discuss the possibility of the Egyptian proposal and the American framework, because it is likely that Hamas and the Palestinian Authority will reject it , and therefore he may be playing for time in the meantime.
But the biggest concern and what Netanyahu fears most is losing the majority in the Knesset , after it took him 4 years and 5 election campaigns - including 18 frustrating months out of office - for him to be able to secure it in November 2022. This majority of the parties that supported him in the last elections is all... Something is for him, and he will do anything to avoid wasting it.
Any indication from Netanyahu that he is willing to accept a ceasefire or agree to the Palestinian Authoritys control of Gaza after the war - as the writer says - will put 14 seats at risk, and not because the leaders of the two extreme right-wing parties, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, are in a hurry to leave the ruling coalition. But because they need to bolster their claims to be true right-wingers when the next election comes. Without these two full-backs, Netanyahu will be at the mercy of Gantz and Eisenkot, whose National Unity Party has the seats needed to keep the government afloat if the far-right parties leave, but they will want to replace him as soon as possible.
The writer concluded that Netanyahu cannot curb events forever despite his avoidance of a serious discussion in the cabinet regarding the next day strategy in Gaza, but whatever he does, he is likely to lose part of his emergency coalition within weeks, and Smotrich and Ben Gvir will not be able to protect him from The decisions he has to make, and soon his lies will run out, according to the writer.
Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, author of the controversial book How Were the Jewish People Invented, has published a new work entitled Two Peoples for One State? It supports the idea, which has been defended by many Zionist intellectuals since the end of the 19th century, which is the establishment of a bi-national state for Israelis and Palestinians. Sand said - in an interview with him, summarized by Julie Conan for the French newspaper La Croix - that what is happening in the Gaza Strip is dangerous because no one in the Israeli authority knows what to do, and because aimless wars are dangerous, and almost turn into genocide.
The Israeli historian explained that he never supported a bi-national state and was not against it, but after the 1967 war, he supported the two-state solution. But after all these years of settlement, the idea of a two-state solution has become more and more hollow, because we have been living for half a century in a bi-national state under a clear apartheid system, in which people live side by side but with different rights, as he put it
Sand believed that it was Europe that vomited the Jews onto the Arabs of Palestine, and for this reason the behavior of the Europeans bothers me a lot.   Speaking to the Europeans, he added, You are responsible for long-term tragedies. For all my life, I have been surprised that people who claim that they were taken from their land two thousand years ago do not recognize the rights of those who were taken from their land 75 years ago. Israel does not want to recognize this, despite the fact that all Hamas leaders , such as Yahya Al-Sanwar and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin come from the ancient land of Palestine, from Ashkelon and Ashdod, which is considered the land of Israel.
The air and missile strikes launched by the administration of President Joe Biden against the Houthis in Yemen did not succeed in restoring American deterrence, or preventing them from attacking ships in the southern Red Sea . Instead of calming tension in one of the most important commercial sea lanes in the world, the military strikes exacerbated it further.
A number of experts Al Jazeera Net spoke to fear the involvement of the United States in a broader war in the region, at a time when the Houthis do not show any signs of retreating from their declared position regarding the continuation of attacks as long as the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip continues. Washington hopes that its almost daily attacks will deter the Houthi group from attacking shipping lines in the Red Sea, or destroy and eliminate its missile stockpiles.

According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that In addition, 2,659 officers and soldiers were injured, including 407 who are still receiving treatment for their injuries in the Gaza battles, and the condition of 48 of them is serious, while 405 were seriously injured, 692 were moderately injured, and 1,562 were described as having minor injuries since the start of the war.  At least 13,599 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	An Israeli official said that negotiations with Hamas regarding a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for a prisoner exchange are still ongoing. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that the negotiations are still ongoing and we have not received a negative response. It pointed out that the Israeli official's statements came after Western reports about Hamas rejecting the Israeli offer.         Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have been held as hostages in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Unlike the roughly 240 people kidnapped in the Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, the campaign for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed has received little publicity. Mengistu is known to suffer from what HRW deemed ""serious"" mental health issues. ""Avera crossed one of the safest borders in the world, under the eyes of the security services,"" recalled Gil Elias, a relative. ""We're talking about a mentally ill person who got lost."" The calls for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed have been barely audible during the many years they have been held captive in Gaza.	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""
It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.
The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 25,295  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
The number wounded was  62,681. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.
The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.
More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel.
Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.
With the Israeli army announcing the killing of 24 soldiers, the total number of occupation deaths has risen to 559 since the start of the war on October 7, including 229 killed since the ground invasion as a result of the ongoing clashes with the Palestinian resistance [other sources report the total number of deaths of the occupation army has risen to 221 since the start of the ground invasion].	 Among them were at least 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.
Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.
The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.

O5KROO2SHQ_99QK7EILFLY3MWG,Ukraine Aid-Border Security Deal in Congress Likely a Week Away,_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240123-voa02.htm,"By  Katherine Gypson January 23, 2024
U.S. lawmakers said Tuesday a deal on border security in return for Republican votes to send nearly $60 billion in aid to Ukraine is nearing completion but likely will not be announced this week.
""The whole world is watching and asking a simple question: Does the United States stand up for its friends?"" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the lead negotiators on the deal, told reporters Tuesday. ""Does the United States stand up for democracy? Does the United States stand up for the preservation of the post-World War II order? Or do we turn our back on our friends, on democracy and on international norms?""
The White House's $106 billion national security supplemental request also includes funding for border security as well as nearly $14 billion in aid to Israel and funding for Taiwan to combat the threat posed by China.
""This is a unique opportunity where divided government has given us an opportunity to get an outcome,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. ""Virtually all of my members have said to their constituents for a long time, 'We need to fix the border.' This administration is not going to do it unless we force him to.""
Biden asks for $60 billion
The United States has dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve another $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine's defense.
The Pentagon announced on December 27 a new $250 million security assistance package for Ukraine that included additional munitions for surface-to-air missiles systems, artillery rounds and more air defense components. The Pentagon still has $4 billion available to provide Ukraine with military aid, but no funds are available to replenish the U.S. military's stockpiles.
""We have heard reports from the Ukrainian government, from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and their general staff, that they are concerned, as they believe that units do not have the stocks and stores and ammunition that they require,"" said Celeste Wallander, assistant U.S. secretary of defense for international security affairs, on Tuesday.
""And that is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress's questions so that they are able to move forward with that decision to pass the supplemental.""
Republicans set conditions for approving aid
Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the country.
According to multiple news organizations, an estimated 300,000 people crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2023. That estimate marks the highest-ever recorded number of U.S.-Mexico border crossings.
Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant group of Republican House members oppose additional aid to Ukraine, and the party in early October voted out a speaker who partnered with Democrats to pass legislation.
Earlier this month, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson led a delegation of 60 House Republicans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas.
""If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national security, it better begin with defending America's national security,"" Johnson told reporters at a news conference on the border.
Republicans have proposed their own legislation, H.R. 2, which would resume construction of a border wall as well as impose new restrictions on asylum-seekers.

Jan 21, 2024
Kerman, IRNA -- Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Shahram Irani says the deployment of the Alborz destroyer to the Red Sea has nothing to do with the regional situation.
Speaking to IRNA's defense and security correspondent, Irani said the Islamic Republic does not regard the situation in the region as complicated.
""The deployment of the Alborz destroyer to the Red Sea is in line with the permanent missions of the [Iranian] Navy and the escort of oil tankers of the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" he said.
He further said the destroyer will safeguard the security of Iranian ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.
According to Irani, the 96th flotilla has also been deployed to the Red Sea recently and the 97th flotilla will soon join the Iranian naval forces in the strategic region as well.
Conveying a message of peace and friendship to all countries, announcing Iran's readiness for multilateral relations with different countries, and strengthening the country's defense diplomacy and naval clout are among the goals of the deployments, he added.
The Alborz destroyer entered the Red Sea on January 1, amid the Yemeni armed forces' retaliatory attacks on Israeli-linked ships in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Elsewhere in his remarks, Rear Admiral Irani said the country's seizure of a US-linked ship in the Sea of Oman was a response to the US theft of Iranian oil.

Pakistan alleged Thursday that a recent spate of assassinations of its citizens on Pakistani soil was orchestrated by India, claiming that the violent acts bear resemblance to cases that have occurred in other countries, including the United States and Canada.
Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Qazi told a news conference in Islamabad that his government had collected ""credible evidence"" linking Indian intelligence operatives to the killings of two Pakistani citizens in September and October of last year.
""These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions. Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan,"" Qazi stated.
""They fit the pattern of similar cases, which have come to light in other countries, including Canada and the United States. Clearly, the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon,"" asserted the Pakistani official.
Qazi identified the slain Pakistani men as Shahid Latif and Muhammad Riaz, saying investigations were also underway into several other killings in recent months to determine if Indian agents also sponsored them.
Recent Indian media reports have said that Riaz and Latif were wanted by New Delhi for their roles in plotting ""terrorist"" attacks against India and its administered part of the disputed Kashmir region.
The Indian foreign ministry spokesperson, in a statement, swiftly rejected Thursday's allegations by Islamabad as ""false and malicious"" propaganda against India.
""As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities,"" said Randhir Jaiswal.
""India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan, cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence ... To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution,"" Jaiswal added.
The Pakistani allegations came nearly two months after U.S. federal prosecutors in late November accused a man, who claimed to be a ""senior field officer"" for an Indian intelligence agency, of orchestrating a foiled assassination plot against an American citizen, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. He is the leader of the Sikh separatist movement in India.
Last September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told an emergency parliamentary session that his government had ""credible allegations"" linking Indian agents to the slaying of exiled Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia last June.
New Delhi has rejected Trudeau's allegations and has launched an investigation into U.S. charges."

WASHINGTON -- Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets   Control (OFAC) imposed a fifth round of sanctions on Hamas since the   October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. Today's action targets networks of   Hamas-affiliated financial exchanges in Gaza, their owners, and   associates, and particularly financial facilitators that have played key   roles in funds transfers, including cryptocurrency transfers, from the   Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to Hamas and   Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Gaza. Concurrent with OFAC's   designations, the United Kingdom and Australia are also placing   sanctions on key Hamas officials and facilitators.
""Hamas has   sought to leverage a variety of financial transfer mechanisms, including   the exploitation of cryptocurrency, to channel funds to support the   group's terrorist activities,"" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for   Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. ""Treasury, in   close coordination with our allies and partners, will continue to   leverage our authorities to target Hamas, its financiers, and its   international financial infrastructure.""
This action builds on OFAC's recent joint designations with the United Kingdom on December 13 and November 14, targeting Hamas leaders and financiers; as well as U.S. actions on October 27, targeting sources of Hamas support and financing; October 18, targeting Hamas operatives and financial facilitators; and May 2022,   designating officials and companies involved in managing Hamas's secret   international investment portfolio. Individuals and entities targeted   today are being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as   amended, which targets terrorist groups and their supporters.
Over   the last several years, members of the Shamlakh family have become the   main end point for funds transferred from the IRGC-QF to Hamas and PIJ   in Gaza. Gaza-based financial facilitator Zuhair Shamlakh (Zuhair)   is a Gaza-based moneychanger who facilitates funds transfers in the   tens of millions of dollars from Iran to Hamas. Zuhair has used his   companies Al-Markaziya Li-Siarafa (Al-Markaziya) and Arab China Trading Company to channel funds for the Izz al-Din al Qassam Brigades (al-Qassam   Brigades), the military wing of Hamas. Zuhair has been facilitating   funds transfers to terrorist groups in Gaza since at least 2017, when he   worked with Muhammad Kamal al-Ayy to coordinate the transfer of millions from Lebanon to Gaza. Al-Ayy was   designated in August 2019 for providing financial, material,   technological support, financial or other services to or in support of   Hamas.
Gaza- and TÃ¼rkiye-based Al-Markaziya is owned by Zuhair and   managed by his family members. Formerly known as Al-Mutahadun for   Exchange, it has been directly involved in facilitating tens of millions   of dollars from IRGC-QF to Hamas and PIJ. In April 2023, the Israeli   Defense Ministry's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF)   seized 189 cryptocurrency accounts associated with three Palestinian   currency exchanges, one of which was Al-Markaziya. Arab China Trading   Companyis also based in Gaza and TÃ¼rkiye and is owned   by Zuhair. Israel designated both Arab China Trading Company and   Al-Markaziya for their support to Hamas.
Gaza-based financial facilitators Ahmed Shamlakh (Ahmed), Alaa Shamlakh (Alaa), and Imad Shamlakh (Imad),   serve as key players in the financial flow from Iran to Hamas and PIJ   using their ties to money changing companies, including Al-Markaziya.   Ahmed is one of the owners or directors of Al-Markaziya and Alaa is the   sole employee and officer of Al-Markaziya's branch in TÃ¼rkiye. Both   Ahmed and Alaa have been involved in transferring money to Hamas. Imad   has directly facilitated the transfer of Chinese yuan from bank accounts   in China to accounts controlled by Hamas in Gaza. Imad has also   faciliated multiple transfers, worth approximately 50,000 Chinese yuan,   to accounts in China likely for the benefit of Hamas. Additionally, Imad   has smuggled cash from Egypt to Gaza on behalf of the Islamic State of   Iraq and Syria in the Sinai (ISIS-Sinai).
Zuhair Shamlakh,Ahmed   Shamlakh, Alaa Shamlakh, and Imad Shamlakh are being designated   pursuant to E.O.13224, as amended, for having materially assisted,   sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support   for, or good or services to Hamas.
Al-Markaziya and Arab China   Trading Company are being designated pursuant to E.O.13224, as amended,   for being owned, controlled or directed by Zuhair Shamlakh.
Hamas   has used multiple methods of illicitly transferring funds to the West   Bank from Gaza in order to fund and support recruitment and the purchase   of weapons there. Hamas has directly co-opted and utilized some corrupt   money exchanges in both the West Bank and Gaza to launder funds for the   terrorist group. Since at least 2020, Hamas has also used   cryptocurrency to transfer some funding in support of operational costs   in the West Bank as a means of mitigating the risks of physically moving   cash, circumventing border crossings, and evading monitoring by   authorities.
Gaza-based Herzallah Exchange and General Trading Company LLC (Herzallah Exchange)   has worked with Hamas to facilitate transactions, including through the   use of cryptocurrencies. Herzallah Exchange has laundered money for   Hamas, as well as for PIJ. Herzallah Exchange is owned by Muhammad Fallah Kamil Hirzallah (Muhammad Fallah), Na'im Kamil Raghib Hirzallah, and Salah Kamil Raghib Hirzallah (Salah).   Muhammad Fallah has facilitated the transfer of cash while Salah acts   as the financial manager of Herzallah Exchange which is a primary money   launderer for Hamas.
Gaza-based Samir Herzallah and Brothers For Money Exchange and Remittances (Samir Exchange)   has also worked with Hamas to facilitate money transfers for the group.   Samir Exchange has facilitated millions of dollars worth of funds   transfers from around the region for Hamas since at least 2014. Samir 'Abd Al-Mu'in 'Abd Hirzallah (Samir Hirzallah) is the manager of Samir Exchange and has publicly represented Samir Exchange.
Gaza-based financial facilitator Thair Abd Al Raziq Shukri Hirzallah (Thair Hirzallah)   has previously coordinated transfers of millions of dollars to TÃ¼rkiye,   and has handled financial transactions for both Hamas and PIJ. Thair   Hirzallah has worked with Gaza-based money exchanger Muhammad Kamal   al-Ayy and Hamas financial official Fawaz Mahmud Ali Nasser.   Fawaz Mahmud Ali Nasser was designated in August 2019 for providing   financial, material, technological support, financial or other services   to or in support of Hamas.
Herzallah Exchange, Muhammad Fallah   Kamil Hirzallah, Na'im Kamil Raghib Hirzallah, Salah Kamil Raghib   Hirzallah, Samir Exchange, Smir Hirzallah, and Thair Hirzallahare   being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having   materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or   technological support for, or good or services to Hamas.
As   a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of   the designated persons described above that are in the United States or   in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be   reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or   indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one   or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general   or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC's regulations   generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or   transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in   property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.
In addition,   non-U.S. financial institutions and other persons that engage in   certain transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and   individuals may expose themselves to sanctions risk or be subject to an   enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any   contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for   the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution   or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
The   power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC's   ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its   willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law.   The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a   positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for   seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer   to OFAC's Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.
Treasury   remains committed to enabling the flow of legitimate humanitarian   assistance supporting the basic human needs of vulnerable populations,   while continuing to deny resources to malicious actors. Accordingly,   OFAC sanctions programs contain provisions for legitimate humanitarian support to vulnerable populations, including   authorizations for certain humanitarian transactions in support of   nongovernmental organizations' activities. For more information, please   review relevant authorizations and guidance on OFAC's website. On November 14, 2023, OFAC issued a Compliance Communique which provides additional guidance for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.

The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that it attacked the American bases of Al-Omar and Al-Shaddadi fields deep in Syria, using drone strikes.
Tehran (ISNA) - It has been reported that the sounds of explosions were heard from inside the American base in the city of Al-Shaddadi, south of Al-Hasakah Governorate, noting that the US air defense systems attempted to repel the attack.
Our correspondent further reported that the ""Green Village"", which contains the housing of American forces at the base of the Al-Omar oil field in the Deir Ezzor countryside, was also targeted.
Ash Shadadi occupation base is just one kilometer southeast of the city of Al-Shadadi; it has helipads and is equipped to launch all sorts of drones.
As for the Al-Omar field base, it is located in the workers' city of the Al-Omar oil field in the Deir Ezzor countryside. It is the largest American base.
According to the White House, attacks on US forces in the Ain Al-Assad base by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq over the weekend are being taken ""extremely seriously.""
White House Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer called it a ""serious attack"" on Sunday,  emphasizing that the attack was carried out using ""a capability of ballistic missiles that posed a genuine threat.""

North Korea says it has tested a new type of strategic cruise missile, assuring neighbors that the test-firing has no impact on the security of neighboring countries.
The state-owned Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Thursday that Pyongyang tested ""Pulhwasal-3-31,"" meaning ""blaze arrow"" the day before. It described it as a strategic cruise missile, implying it could be armed with nuclear weapons.
""The test-fire had no impact on the security of neighboring countries and has nothing to do with the regional situation,"" KCNA said as it did not specify how many missiles were fired.
The Pulhwasal-3-31 missile is still in its development phase and was also part of the process of updating the country's weapon system, KCNA reported, citing the missile administration.
""The range was not short, and it was presumed to have been launched from the ground,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified source, reported, speculating that the cruise missiles were likely type Hwasal-1 or Hwasal-2, which are capable of carrying the North's compact Hwasan-31 nuclear warhead.
The announcement came a day after South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it had detected the launch of ""several"" cruise missiles from North Korea's western coast, while Seoul's defense minister, Shin Won-Sik, condemned the launches as a serious threat to his country.
The JCS said it was analyzing the launch, as it believed the firing was to test upgrades of existing missiles' capabilities. North Korea carried out its first test of a strategic cruise missile in September 2021.
Pyongyang has repeatedly test-fired ""Hwasal"" cruise missiles since last year. The weapon is reportedly capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and flying at low altitudes for long periods.
The missile is harder to detect and intercept than ballistic missiles.
North Korea says they are nuclear-capable and have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) before hitting preset targets, a distance that would include US military bases in Japan.
Last week, North Korea said it had tested an underwater nuclear weapons system under development in response to the latest 10-day joint maritime exercise involving South Korea, the United States and Japan.
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un has repeatedly said his government is building up its military arsenal in preparation for potential war by the West that could ""break out at any time"" on the peninsula.
Pyongyang has previously warned that the US is increasing provocations of a ""nuclear war"" by deploying nuclear-capable bombers to the region."

25 Jan 2024
(As prepared for delivery)
I thank the President of the Security Council in allowing me the   opportunity today to update you on IAEA activities concerning nuclear   safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine. I also thank the Council for   their continuing support for the IAEA's efforts.
I have addressed the Council on the situation in Ukraine five times   before, on 4 March, 11 August, 6 September, 27 October in 2022, and 30   May last year.
It is now nearly two years since the beginning of the war, and I   remind you that it is the first time in history that a war is being   fought amid the facilities of a major nuclear power programme.
This includes several of Ukraine's five nuclear power plants and   other facilities that have come under direct shelling. All NPPs have   lost off-site power at some point.
Furthermore, one of Ukraine's nuclear power plants, the Zaporizhzhya   NPP, has been under Russian operational control with the presence of   Russian troops on-site for almost all of that time.
And as you know the IAEA has been closely monitoring the situation   and assisting Ukraine every single day since the start of the war.
Shortly after the start of the war, I elaborated the Seven   Indispensable Pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an   armed conflict. These are:
And in my previous update to the Council on 30 May I reported that,   as a result of intensive consultations with the leadership of Ukraine,   as well as of the Russian Federation, I had further established five   concrete principles for the ZNPP in order to prevent a nuclear accident   and ensure the integrity of the plant, namely:
I said that these commitments are essential to avoid the danger of a   catastrophic nuclear incident and I had respectfully and solemnly asked   both sides to observe them.
I was pleased that at that meeting last May distinguished Members of   the Security Council and Ukraine clearly supported those principles.
Furthermore, I said that the experts on the IAEA Support and   Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ), who have been on-site since 1   September 2022, would report to me on the observance of these   principles and that I would report publicly on any violations.
Now nine months later, I wish to report today on the nuclear safety   security and safeguards situation in Ukraine, and the Agency's continued   activities including the Agency's assessment against the seven pillars   and our monitoring of these five principles.
Mr President
Firstly, I wish to report on the scope and extent of our activities over nearly two years,
There has been a total of 102 missions to Ukraine. I have personally   led eight of them, including three to ZNPP and I will shortly be leading   another one to ZNPP within the next two weeks.
We have the 15th ISAMZ team of our dedicated and courageous   international staff at the ZNPP, a plant that is still on the front   lines of this war and our staff who still have to cross that front line   to undertake this vital work. 37 of our staff have been part of these   teams at ZNPP, a number of them more than once.
For a year we have had other dedicated IAEA experts stationed at   every other major Ukrainian nuclear site: Rivne NPP, South Ukraine NPP,   Khmelnytskyy NPP and at the Chornobyl NPP - their presence allowing us   to provide the international community with reliable information on the   nuclear safety and security situation at each of those sites as well.   More than 100 of our staff have been part of these teams, totalling more   than 3662 person-days of our staff in Ukraine.
Since I last addressed you, thanks to the generosity of Member   States, the Agency has purchased armoured vehicles and recruited   additional staff, security officers and drivers, and now manages our own   security for the missions, thereby relieving some of the pressures on   the United Nations Departments of Safety and Security and Operational   Support.
We continue to facilitate an international assistance package now   totalling more than â¬8.5 million with 34 deliveries of vital equipment   to Ukraine, and I again thank Member States for their contributions.
We have developed a proposal for the Agency to provide advice,   training, and equipment in the area of the safety and security of   radioactive sources in Ukraine.
We have put together a programme of health care assistance including   through equipment and psychological support for all Ukrainian nuclear   workers.
I also announced the new programme for assistance of the Kherson   Oblast aimed at managing the adverse impact associated with the flooding   after the Kakhovka dam destruction and we work with Ukraine to identify   their immediate needs in this area.
In addition to our work on nuclear safety and security we are also   continuing our vital safeguards verification activities across Ukraine,   ensuring that there is no diversion of nuclear material for military   purposes. Based on these activities the Agency has not found any   indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern.
And we are keeping the world informed of the situation at Ukraine's   nuclear sites with now well over 200 web statements and updates, 9   reports and multiple briefings, including to the United Nations General   Assembly and to your distinguished selves at the Security Council.   Thanks to this, the international community has at its disposal timely,   technically sound and objective information, thus avoiding the risks   associated with lack of information and misinformation, including   misperceptions which might lead to decisions with serious implications.
Mr. President,
The nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP - in particular - continues to be extremely fragile.
The plant's six reactors have been shut down since mid-2022 - five of   them in cold shutdown and one in hot shutdown. But the potential   dangers of a major nuclear accident remain very real.
Although the plant has not been shelled for a considerable time,   significant military activities continue in the region and sometime in   the vicinity of the facility, with our staff reporting rockets flying   overhead close to the plant, thereby putting at risk the physical   integrity of the plant.
The plant needs secure and uninterrupted sources of external cooling   water. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam in early June last year, just   days after I last reported to the Council, led to a large reduction in   the water level of the reservoir. Consequently, the depth of the water   in the reservoir was no longer sufficient to supply water and   considerable efforts on site were needed, including the drilling of   wells on site, to provide sufficient cooling water for the six shutdown   reactor units.
The plant has been operating on significantly reduced staff, who are   under unprecedented psychological pressure - which despite the reactors   being shut-down is not sustainable.
The reduced number of qualified and trained operating personnel and   the challenging supply chain has had a negative impact on the   maintenance of equipment which is essential for maintaining the safety   of the plant.
And there have now been eight occasions when the site lost all   off-site power and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, the last   line of defence against a nuclear accident, to provide essential cooling   of the reactor and spent fuel.
The plant is currently relying on just two lines of external power,   and sometimes just one, or for a period the backup power was not   properly configured. This demonstrates the highly precarious situation   regarding essential off-site power.
There are occasions when the team has not had timely access to some   areas of the plant. The IAEA teams need access in order to be able to   effectively conduct their assessment of the situation regarding nuclear   safety and security at the ZNPP and to reflect on the new developments.
Turning now to the five concrete principles, the Agency has been   monitoring observance of these principles, and there have been no   indications that the five concrete principles are not being observed.   Nevertheless, in line with the evolving situation, the Agency needs to   have timely access to all areas of the ZNPP of significance for nuclear   safety and security, to monitor that all five concrete principles are   being observed at all times.
We also should not forget the other nuclear facilities in Ukraine   which are operating, most of the reactor units at full capacity.   Although our teams continue to report that nuclear safety and security   is maintained, they are also confirming the looming threat of military   conflict and at some plants having to take shelter on several occasions.   I wish to remind the Council that the availability of off-site power is   essential to ensure their safe operation.
Mr President
A nuclear accident has not yet happened. This is true. But   complacency could still lead us to tragedy. That should not happen. We   must do everything in our power to minimize the risk that it does. And I   am grateful for the continuing support from Member States - including   financial support.
And we must be clear about the nature of the five principles   established in this very chamber on 30 May last year. They are not an   arms control or armistice agreement. They are not the solution to all   the tragic problems this war has brought.
Instead, they are a creative, practical arrangement which has a very   defined aim: to save Ukraine, Europe, and the world from a major nuclear   accident with significant radiological consequences.
So far, this limited but crucial objective has been achieved. But we   should not be complacent - we should take nothing for granted. Utmost   restraint is a must, from all sides.
I am asking this Council for continued support for the seven pillars   and the five principles, and for the IAEA's role in monitoring the   situation, in the service of the international community.
And I thank the Council, and you Mr President, for inviting me today   thereby demonstrating its continuing focus on this critical issue.
The IAEA and myself remain at your disposal for updates,   clarifications and action, where so required, to assist this body in its   mission to preserve international peace and security.
Thank you, Mr President."

The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon - Hezbollah - targeted an Israeli force near the 'Zar'it' barracks, ""which was preparing the carry out an attack inside Lebanese territory,"" according to what was included in Hezbollah's statement.
The statement noted that the resistance targeted the Israeli force with missile weapons, resulting in confirmed injuries. This targeting is a continuation of the resistance operations against occupation sites and deployments.
Earlier on Sunday, the resistance launched missiles at the Israeli ""Biranit"" barracks, then attacked the Ruweisat al-Qarn site in the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms, before targeting the Hadab al-Bustan military site. In addition, the Islamic Resistance's fighters launched a barrage of rockets toward the Israeli settlement of ""Avivim"" in response to Israeli air strikes on civilian areas in southern Lebanon.
This comes amid the Islamic resistance in Lebanon's ongoing operations in Lebanon against settlements and military barracks in northern occupied Palestine, in response to the Israeli massacres against innocent people in Gaza and support of the Palestinian resistance.
The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon on Sunday celebrated young martyr Fadel Ali ""Issa"" Salman Shaar from Nabatiyeh, southern Lebanon, a martyr on the path to al-Quds who ascended while performing his duty in the face of the Israeli occupation.

Turkish parliamentarians have opened the debate over Sweden's NATO membership after a one-year delay.
The lawmakers on Tuesday opened the debate on Sweden's membership of NATO after more than a year of delays frayed their diplomatic relations.
All the MPs were expected to approve Sweden's membership of NATO after the Nordic nation gained the public backing of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in July after Stockholm clamped down on Kurdish groups regarded by Ankara as terrorist outfits.
""We see that there is a change in policy in Sweden. We see some decisions taken in courts, albeit few,"" Fuat Oktay, a senior MP from Erdogan's ruling AKP party and head of the parliament's foreign affairs committee said in a televised interview last month.
Turkey lawmakers' ratification of the bill would leave Hungary as the last holdout in an accession process that pro-Western leaders in Sweden and Finland began in reaction to Russian troops' special military operation in Ukraine.
Hungary is expected to follow Turkey's lead and approve Sweden's NATO membership without much resistance.
Sweden says, ""at this point"" they have ""no reason"" to negotiate with Hungary about Stockholm's NATO membership."
OMJEJROYDA_ZGB187MIA3L8TX1,Nine killed in direct hit on UNRWA shelter in Gaza,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-unnews01.htm,"24 January 2024 - Nine people were killed and 75 injured on Wednesday in a direct hit on a training centre turned shelter in southern Gaza run by UNRWA, the UN agency that assists Palestinians, according to initial reports.
Teams from the agency and the World Health Organization (WHO) were trying to reach the Khan Younis Training Centre, said Tom White, Director of UNRWA Affairs in the Gaza Strip, in post on the social media platform X.
Some 30,000 people are sheltering at the site and the death toll could be higher, said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner General, who also took to the platform to lament ""another horrific day in Gaza"".
""The compound is a clearly marked 'UN facility' and its coordinates were shared with Israeli authorities, as we do for all our facilities,"" he said, adding ""once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war"".
Shock and resignation
The incident was indicative of the recent intense fighting around Khan Younis, said Jamie McGoldrick, interim UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, speaking during a press briefing from Jerusalem.
Mr. McGoldrick updated journalists on his visit to Gaza on Tuesday, where he said humanitarians are struggling to provide displaced people with basic services such as food, medical support, shelter, water and sanitation.
""As a result of that, the people themselves are really struggling to get through this, and the shock is actually starting to wane now, and people start to see...a resignation that this is what we're going to have to face for some significant time.""
While in Gaza, Mr. McGoldrick visited the southern city of Rafah, located on the border with Egypt, and a crossing point for aid into the enclave.
Rafah normally has a population of around 280,000, which has swelled to an estimated 1.2 to 1.4 million as people fleeing fighting elsewhere pack into the city, setting up makeshift shelters and tents in the streets.
The squalid and unsanitary conditions have led to outbreaks of respiratory infections and hepatitis A, both of which had been eradicated in Gaza. Meningitis and other illnesses are also emerging.
Shelter and safety
The conflict in Gaza has displaced over 75 per cent of the population, with nearly 1.7 million people now living in UNRWA and public emergency shelters as well as informal sites.
He said humanitarians are facing ""massive issues"" trying to provide shelter for displaced people seeking safety in the south. Some have moved from Rafah to the coastal town of Al-Mawasi, which is poorly supported or serviced by aid agencies, given the overwhelming numbers in need.
Currently, around 250 trucks come through the Rafah border ""on a good day"" when in the past, roughly 500 trucks from the private sector would bring in basic commodities daily.
More supplies needed
Mr. McGoldrick said the UN and partners are doing their best in the face of massive challenges, many of which are outside their control, and he emphasized the need for ""minimum operating requirements"" so they can work better.
""We need more supplies to come in from the private sector. We need to be able to scale up our pipelines and the key lifesaving commodities, but also from the authorities, the Israeli side, we need to get them to give us communications equipment,"" he said.
Humanitarian workers are being sent into very hostile areas, ""and they have no radios, they have no communications that work for them to be able to be seen to be safe,"" he said, adding that they also do not have enough armoured vehicles.
Critical items 'prohibited'
Furthermore, many of the goods humanitarians are trying to bring into Gaza to support water and sanitation ""seem to be prohibited by the Israelis"", he said.
""They see them as something that could be used for other things such as pumps, such as generators, such as spare parts, pipes for water sanitation, solar panels and some medical equipment, which is key to our ability to address the humanitarian crisis that's there in front of us,"" he said.
Some of the medical materials include basic drugs for treating chronic illnesses such as insulin pens for children.
Humanitarians are also facing difficulties with bringing in enough shelter material, including tarpaulins, blankets and non-food items.
Fuel for hospitals
Mr. McGoldrick said more fuel also needs to get to the north to supply generators inside hospitals there, such as Al-Shifa, ""because they're working in some cases without anaesthetic, without electricity, to serve patients who are also ill and been wounded"".
He added that there is no real medical or casualty evacuation system in place to transport badly wounded people out of Gaza.
""We're not able to get people out farther afield to the neighbouring countries in order to get this very sophisticated surgery, and that's something we've been trying to work with the Israelis on,"" he said."

The leader of the Ansar Allah movement highlights the US' direct role in war crimes against Palestinians in his latest address.
Tehran-ISNA- The leader of the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement, Sayyed Abul-Malik al-Houthi, lambasted the United States for its role in supplementing and supporting the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, during his weekly address to the Yemeni people and the Ummah at large on Thursday.
Sayyed al-Houthi underlined the essential role that Washington plays in extending the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, holding the US administration accountable for piled-up humanitarian aid outside the Gaza Strip and the closure of the Rafah border crossing.
Moreover, the leader pointed to the ongoing US-UK-led aggression on Yemen, which the two Western nations claim aims to secure international maritime trade routes. Contrary to US-UK claims, Sayyed al-Houthi said that Washington ""does not care about the threat to international navigation and the fact that it has turned the Red Sea into a battlefield, nor about the arrival of food and medicine to the people of Gaza.""
He added, ""[The US] has no problem with expanding the conflict [and increasing tensions in the region].""
In fact, the Resistance leader said the US ""insists on keeping Gaza under total siege and keeping the Rafah crossing closed most of the time,"" adding that Washington ""insists that there be no flow of [humanitarian aid] to the Palestinian people in Gaza.""
It is worth noting that Sayyed al-Houthi's statements coincide with a months-long effective Naval campaign launched by the Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF), aiming at pressuring the Israeli occupation to lift its siege on the Gaza Strip and allow humanitarian aid in. The Biden administration in Washington has opted to support the Israeli occupation's genocidal war on Palestinians and launched at least eight strikes on Yemen.
In this context, Sayyed al-Houthi said, ""While the Americans fight for the supplies to reach the Israelis, they prevent food and medicine from reaching Gaza,"" pointing out that ""[Washignton] is the one behind the continuation of Zionist crimes and behind [the incompetence of international organizations].""
The US ""contributes directly to starving the Palestinian people, causing them to die of hunger, not only with the bombs [it provides the Israeli occupation forces with] to kill them.""
The leader of the Ansar Allah movement said the Yemeni Armed Forces launched more than 200 attack drones and fifty cruise and ballistic missiles in support of the Palestinian people.
He stressed that Yemen would continue to launch operations in support of the Palestinian people ""until food and medicine reach all residents of Gaza and the Zionist crimes"" in the Gaza Strip stop.
Sayyed al-Houthi stressed that the US' military aggression and its insistence to reject a humanitarian deal ""will not affect our position,"" stressing that the Yemeni people ""will never retreat.""
""Our battle is ongoing and is entirely linked to the Gaza battle.""
He also indicated that the US is attempting to ""justify its aggression against our country and its protection of Zionist crimes,"" under the pretext of protecting international navigation.
In response to these claims, Sayyed al-Houthi said that since the beginning of the Yemeni Naval campaign, ""4,874 commercial ships have crossed,"" through the Red Sea, untouched, adding that the US-UK-led escalation ""is [the real] threat to international navigation"" and has violated ""the sovereignty of countries"" in the region.
He went on to advise Europeans against allowing the US to exploit their govenrments' funds for such purposes.
He explained that ""no matter how much the Americans and the British escalate,"" the results of this escalation will ""be counterproductive and will not affect our decision and position, but we will continue to develop our military capabilities.""
""Whenever the Israelis and the Americans insist on [committing war crimes in Gaza], we must be more resolved and determined to prevent it.""

The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has strongly defended as a necessary step its October 7, 2023 operation against the Israeli regime, which was followed by the regime's brutal onslaught against the Gaza Strip.
The movement made the comments in an official statement released in English and Arabic on Sunday.
It said the operation, dubbed al-Aqsa Storm, was a normal response to all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people.
""Operation al-Aqsa Storm ... was a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people and their cause. It was a defensive act in the frame of getting rid of the Israeli occupation, [and] reclaiming the Palestinian rights...,"" Hamas said.
The movement added that Israel ""has systematically destroyed every possibility to establish the Palestinian state through a wide campaign of settlement construction and Judaization of the Palestinian lands in the occupied West Bank"" and the city of al-Quds.
The Israeli regime has built hundreds of settlements across those territories, and is constantly ratifying plans to expand such structures, which are illegal under international law due to their construction on an occupied territory. Backed by the regime's forces, illegal Israeli settlers also regularly invade the al-Aqsa Mosque Compound, Islam's third-holiest site, where it is forbidden to perform non-Muslim prayers or rituals based on longstanding international agreements.
The movement also referred to the history of Western and Western-backed acts of aggression against Palestinians, saying, ""The battle of the Palestinian people against occupation and colonialism did not start on October 7, but started 105 years ago, including 30 years of British colonialism and 75 years of Zionist occupation.""
Protecting civilian lives
Hamas added that Operation al-Aqsa Storm exclusively targeted Israeli military bases and every effort was made to capture only Israeli troops in order to free Palestinian prisoners held by the regime.
""Avoiding harm to civilians, especially children, women and elderly people is a religious and moral commitment by all the al-Qassam Brigades fighters. We reiterate that the Palestinian resistance was fully disciplined and committed to the Islamic values during the operation and that the Palestinian fighters only targeted the occupation soldiers and those who carried weapons against our people,"" Hamas said,
Emphasizing that ""if there was any case of targeting civilians, it happened accidently and in the course of the confrontation with the occupation forces,"" the movement noted, ""Many Israelis were killed by the Israeli army and police due to their confusion"" as Operation al-Aqsa Storm led to ""rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system.""
Blasting Israeli war
Elsewhere in the statement, the movement called for ""the immediate halt to the Israeli aggression on Gaza, [as well as] the crimes and ethnic cleansing committed against the entire Gaza population"" to allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
More than 25,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli military onslaught so far, while over 62,600 others have been injured.
The movement added that it wants to hold the Israeli regime ""legally accountable for what it caused of human suffering towards the Palestinian people, and to charge it for the crimes against civilians, infrastructure, hospitals, educational facilities, mosques and churches.""
""We tell these countries -- especially the US administration, Germany, Canada and the UK -- that if they really want justice to prevail as they claim, they ought to announce their support for the course of an investigation into all crimes committed in the occupied Palestine and to lend their full support to the international courts to effectively do their job,"" Hamas said.
Israel is currently facing a lawsuit filed by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing the regime of committing genocide against the people of Gaza.
Mexico and Chile have also asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Israel's genocidal war, citing the ""escalation of violence against civilian targets.""
'Gaza's future belongs to Gazans'
The movement, meanwhile, rejected any foreign efforts to decide Gaza's future.
""We categorically reject any international or Israeli projects aimed at deciding the future of Gaza that only serve to prolong the occupation. We stress that the Palestinian people have the capacity to decide their future and to arrange their internal affairs, and thus no party in the world has the right to impose any form of guardianship on the Palestinian people or decide on their behalf.""
The Israeli regime and the United States, Tel Aviv's biggest ally, have come up with a number of so-called ""post-war"" plans for Gaza, suggesting that the territory might not be ruled by the resistance movement in the aftermath of the Israeli military aggression. Hamas and the international community have already rejected all such plans, saying the fate of Gaza only lies in the hands of its own people."

23 January 2024  From Rosemary Mena-Werth
MONTEREY, Ca -- Following years of dedicated work with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), NPS and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) partners have successfully concluded the ultimate test of a nine-year continuum of research and development in one of the world's most challenging environments: the Arctic Circle.
The collaborative team integrated NPS' own cutting-edge flight-path planning software known as POTION (Path Optimization) with the Vanilla UAV, developed and operated by Platform Aerospace. This initiative pushed the boundaries of their research, subjecting the Vanilla-POTION combination to rigorous testing in the daunting North Slope of Alaska, making the best of a narrow weather window.
Remarkably, the outcomes of the Arctic flight in September surpassed all expectations, as well as numerous records set by Vanilla in previous missions. This achievement underscores the exceptional capabilities of the Vanilla-POTION combination and represents a milestone in advancing UAV technology for naval operations within the scope of the long-term partnership.
Leading NPS efforts on what he terms ""energy-aware aerial flight"" is NPS Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Dr. Vladimir Dobrokhodov, who began at NPS as a postdoctoral fellow in 2001.
""A glider's efficiency is quantified by its judicious energy utilization, a stark contrast to the combat efficiency metrics applied to fighter aircraft. Similar to transport planes, gliders aim to traverse vast distances with minimal fuel consumption,"" explained Dobrokhodov. ""Over a meticulous nine-year collaboration between NPS and NRL, innovative approaches have been developed to optimize efficiency of long endurance aircraft.""
Back in 2014, Dobrokhodov worked alongside NRL's Dr. Dan Edwards and Dr. Richard Stroman to explore energy-aware flight research with a novel hybrid UAV called Hybrid Tiger that integrated hydrogen fuel cell, solar and atmospheric wind energy-harvesting technologies.
The project spanned three years and received funding from the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), the Department of Defense's premier joint operational energy investment program, as well as support from DOD's Operational Energy Prototyping Fund (OEPF), which played a key role in development of energy-focused mission planning tools. Eventually, the initiative evolved into the energy-aware project called POTION.
Central to the project's achievements was the development of optimal trajectory planning software emulating the energy-conserving flight patterns of migrating birds navigating atmospheric wind rivers. In the realm of energy-efficient flight, characterized by low airspeeds and altitudes, susceptibility to the adverse effects of strong winds and icing is amplified, making flight-path planning extremely challenging for human operators. Mathematical optimization of routing becomes vital, necessitating a complex software solution that enables the aircraft to skillfully navigate through diverse and potentially hazardous weather conditions.
Close collaboration with MAE professors Mark Karpenko and Kevin Jones, researchers who have spent years in the area of flight efficiency and optimal control engineering, helped to advance the energy optimal approach to what is now POTION. The team developed the propulsion efficiency model of an aircraft to model the Vanilla UAV's fuel consumption and used machine learning to integrate that model into the algorithm for route optimization.
""Using neural networks to represent and quickly execute an otherwise complicated energy model was a key enabler for optimizing Vanilla's flight path,"" Karpenko said.
Weather forecasts from Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (METOC) were used to inform multi-day missions of the weather conditions ahead. Just as with ships, an aircraft might waste precious energy flying directly into headwinds even if it is a more direct flight path. POTION designs a mission that finds the most energy-advantageous route through time-varying three-dimensional winds by referencing METOC weather forecasts that extend up to 5-8 days.
To test the POTION software, researchers needed a unique aircraft to host the technology, and found one in Vanilla, a Group III UAV. Vanilla UAVs have a maximum endurance of 10 days, a payload capacity of 150 pounds, and a maximum range of 15,000 nautical miles. Vanilla's capability for long endurance flight makes it especially suitable for realistic testing of its flight performance in wind and icing conditions, and thus a prime candidate for testing the POTION software.
Originally, flight testing was to be conducted in California, but a last-minute change necessitated launching the Vanilla UAV from Alaska's North Slope - above the Arctic Circle - in rough weather. Typically, Vanilla is required to be ""chased"" by a manned aircraft in the terminal area of airports, but the weather was so intense that the escort aircraft could not take off. Instead, Vanilla was given a chance to fly using Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) fully autonomously and following the POTION-generated routes.
""In the most severe arctic conditions, Vanilla demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving unprecedented milestones in its operational history. Notably, it set records for the longest duration flown by a Vanilla aircraft in Arctic environments, covered the greatest distance at these latitudes, and marked its inaugural operation utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR),"" said Dobrokhodov. ""We had so many expectations and none of them were met. Just none. Every single one was exceeded, and it was incredible. At the time when Vanilla landed, we (Dobrokhodov, Edwards, and Stroman) just looked at each other knowing this took us nine years to make it happen. And now everything had finally clicked together.""
In honor of the 101st flight by a Vanilla UAV and its unique location, the team named the flight Arctic 101. According to Karpenko, ""Arctic 101 was also a fitting name for our first flight because we learned a lot, especially about deploying POTION software in the 'wild'.""
By adding NPS' POTION software to the Vanilla UAV, the team was able to significantly extend its endurance, and extending UAV endurance bears profound implications for military operations.
In this respect, the POTION software developed by NPS stands as a pivotal tool, facilitating the automation of mission optimization involving long endurance aircraft deployment from a base, navigating to a designated location for extended loitering, and subsequently returning to base. This versatile software is compatible with diverse aircraft platforms and could be seamlessly integrated with nearly any ground control station.
The operational scenario in the Arctic also showcased the transformative potential of POTION. Notably, it effectively mitigated the operator's cognitive load associated with the intricate multi-day mission design and management process, marking a substantial advancement in operational efficiency.
The POTION research initiative has proven instrumental in advancing the knowledge base of numerous NPS students. During the past three years, seven students in diverse NPS departments have chosen operational energy and its efficacy in aircraft applications as the focal point of their thesis topics.
While some students originated from the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department - including U.S. Navy Ensign Luke Lalumandier, a June 2023 graduate whose work focused on the energy-optimal guidance of UAS systems in varying wind environments - it is noteworthy that Operations Research students in particular have significantly contributed valuable insights into the realm of optimization at the mission level. One such OR student was U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Tyler Cotney, another June 2023 graduate whose thesis dealt with real-time solutions of robust, energy-aware UAV routing.
Dobrokhodov underscores his appreciation for the contributions from students across various disciplines.
""Active student engagement constitutes a cornerstone NPS endeavor. Many NPS students come in from the fleet. A lot of them already have operational experience flying UAVs, and they give us fruitful thought and advice on how UAVs should be operated. In part, the success of this project is also the success of our students. They come to NPS, learn from us, but, also, we learn from them. That's a significant part of what we all do here,"" said Dobrokhodov.
Although no NPS students were able to take part in the Arctic testing this September, NPS is already looking to incorporate results from the POTION research into a new project with opportunities for students and research partners alike. Another proposal for NPS, NRL and Platform Aerospace was recently awarded $7.5 million by OECIF for a project entitled GUIDER (Guidance of UxS: Intelligent, Energy-aware Routing) that will be a natural extension of the work done with Vanilla, hopefully extending its applicability to a wider class of autonomous aircraft.
""We want to integrate the energy savings attained during transit to and from the operational zone with the aircraft's energy-aware performance during the mission execution phase,"" Dobrokhodov said of his goals for the GUIDER project. ""The question is how we can extend the energy efficient flight into typical mission tasks, like searching a huge area of the south Pacific, for example. Using what we have learned in the Arctic experiment, we can now study how to perform a large-scale search, optimally with respect to fuel and energy and apply that knowledge to other aircraft.""
Use of the Vanilla UAV in research conducted by the Naval Postgraduate School does not constitute endorsement of Platform Aerospace or its products or services by NPS, the Department of the Navy, or the Department of Defense."

Speaking at a meeting in New York on counter-terrorism initiatives across the continent, AntÃ³nio Guterres said terror groups were ""shredding the social fabric of entire countries with the blades of violence, mistrust and fear"".
""Community by community, terrorist groups are extending their reach,"" he said, adding that networks are widening, adding fighters and resources, and making common cause with transnational organized crime.
""In every case, civilians are paying the highest price and, in the end, all of humanity pays.""
'Fight this inferno now'
Addressing an audience of counter-terrorism experts, government officials and civil society and private sector representatives, Mr. Guterres said the crisis must be tackled head on before it spins out of control.
He highlighted initiatives such as the multinational task force in the Lake Chad Basin countering Boko Haram as well as the African Union (AU) Transition Mission in Somalia in addition to Security Council resolution 2719 on financing AU-led peace support operations.
""But, we need urgent action on a much larger scale than we've seen to date,"" the UN chief said.
Emphasize prevention
The root causes of terrorism - fragility and instability - must be addressed, he continued, pointing to the New Agenda for Peace he launched last July.
He said efforts to counter terrorism must be anchored in human rights and strategies focus on the marginalized and vulnerable.
Two-day meeting
The top-level meeting of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact will address rising violence and the spread of terrorist networks.
Participants will also consider how counter-terrorism efforts can be aligned with the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the AU's Agenda 2063.
Launched in 2018, the Counter-Terrorism Compact is a network of 46 UN and non-UN entities. It also includes INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization and the Financial Action Task Force, which combats money laundering and terrorism financing."

In about one week after Nauru's announcement to sever ""diplomatic relations"" with China's Taiwan region, China and Nauru officially resumed diplomatic relations on Wednesday in Beijing, unveiling a new chapter in their bilateral ties and cooperation.
The resumption of diplomatic relations was marked with a ceremony held at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse in Beijing. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Lionel Aingimea, Nauru's minister for foreign affairs and trade, as well as Nauru's former president, attended the event.
During the ceremony, Wang and Aingimea signed the Joint CommuniquÃ© on the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Nauru, and exchanged a handshake, both beaming with smile.
The People's Republic of China and the Republic of Nauru have decided to resumeâdiplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level,âeffective immediately, in line with the interests and desire of the two peoples, reads the communique.
The two governments agreed to develop friendly relations between the two countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression and noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, it noted.
The government of the Republic of Nauruârecognizes that there is but one China in the world, that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing the whole of China, andâthat Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The Government of the Republic of Nauruâhas officially severed ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan as of this day and undertakes not to develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan.
China applauds Nauru for taking this stance. Both sidesâagree to exchange ambassadors as early as possible and to provide each other with all the necessary assistance for the establishment of embassiesâin each other'sâcapitals on a reciprocal basis in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationsâof 1961 as well as international customary practices.
Wang stated that with the resumption of China-Nauru diplomatic relations, the two nations will embark on a new chapter of bilateral collaboration across a variety of areas which will be rooted in principles such as the one-China principle, equality, mutual respect, openness and inclusivity.
Following the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Nauru, a total of 183 countries have now established diplomatic ties with China.
Wang emphasized the widespread acceptance of the one-China principle stressing its importance as a fundamental norm in international relations, that reflects the will of the people and the unstoppable trend of the times.
Regardless of any changes in the Taiwan question, Wang stressed that the historical fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory remains unchanged, adding that the vast majority of countries in the world accept the one-China principle and recognize the government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing the entire nation whole of China, Wang said. No matter how the situation induced by Taiwan may change, the historical and legal fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory will not alter, he said.
""The historical process of Taiwan's inevitable return and China's eventual reunification will not be altered,"" Wang affirmed at the ceremony.
Some experts said that with only 12 remaining ""diplomatic allies"" for the Taiwan authorities, it reflects the prevailing trend and popular support for the one-China principle. The DPP authorities' approach of using ""dollar diplomacy"" and pursuing ""Taiwan independence"" is against the tide of history and is destined to be abandoned by the international community."

By RFA Burmese 2024.01.24 -- Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government has claimed administrative control of four key towns in the northern region of Sagaing following their fall to resistance forces, but residents say they still live in constant fear of attacks by the military.
Beginning in November, anti-junta forces seized the towns of Kawlin, Khampat, Shwe Pyi Aye and Maw Lu. National Unity Government, or NUG, officials entered the towns shortly afterward and set up basic administrative services.
""The civil administrative mechanism was put in place after the first round of conflicts,"" said an information officer with the People's Administration Organization in Khampat who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke to RFA Burmese on condition of anonymity due to security concerns.
""The town is now firmly under the control of the NUG and the People's Administration Organization is formed and functioning,"" he said.
But a series of junta attacks on the towns since their seizure have left residents fearing for their safety, and some who have fled their homes say they are reluctant to return.
From Dec. 10-16, Khampat township was the center of fierce fighting due to incursions by junta forces, while on Jan. 7, the military conducted airstrikes that hit a church service in the township's Ka Nan village, killing 17 civilians, including nine children, and injuring 19 others, according to a report by the NUG.
""It is safer to travel than before due to fewer security checkpoints,"" a resident of the township told RFA Burmese. ""But we are constantly alert to loud noises of cars and motorcycles, as we live in fear of airstrikes. We are still worried that fighting will resume.""
Similarly, a joint force of anti-junta fighters under the NUG and members of the ethnic Kachin Independence Army seized Kawlin on Nov. 6, and the NUG began administering the town on Dec. 6.
But residents told RFA that civilians have since been killed by junta artillery attacks and said transporting goods around the area remains unsafe.
""The junta is blocking cargo trucks and travelers into Kawlin ... so there are many difficulties affecting the flow of commodities,"" one inhabitant of the town said. ""The junta's Light Infantry Battalion No. 120 fires artillery shells from [nearby] Wuntho township ... [and] more than 10 civilians were killed after the town fell under the control of resistance forces.""
Residents said that on Jan. 2, a junta artillery attack on Kawlin's market killed six civilians, and injured two. Five days later, the bodies of 19 civilians killed by the military council were discovered near Wuntho township, six of whom were from Kawlin, they said.
NUG governing with 'all possible resources'
Some residents told RFA that they feel they have the right to expect better protection from the NUG, now that the shadow government has assumed administrative control in their towns.
Kyaw Zaw, the spokesperson of the NUG President's Office, said that his administration is doing the best it can with the resources in the areas under its control.
""We are implementing civil administrative mechanisms with all possible resources, while our defense forces are working to prevent attacks by the junta,"" he said.
He added that the NUG has established interim administration in more than 170 townships across the country, and is working to enhance rule of law, development, education, health and the economy.
In other towns, the NUG has faced challenges implementing its goals, acknowledged a member of the People's Administration Organization in Maw Lu township, who also declined to be named citing fear of reprisal.
""We have experienced some difficulties in the administrative process as we are not civil service personnel,"" he said of the town, which was seized by a joint force of the Kachin Independence Army, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front, and anti-junta People's Defense Force paramilitaries on Dec. 13.
A resident of Maw Lu confirmed that inhabitants have ""many needs"" at the moment.
""We have been relieved from some adversities [under the junta], but frankly, we don't enjoy total peace,"" the resident said. ""We expect a genuine democracy, in which an administration treats us humanely. We hope the people will not have to suffer much longer and that the end of revolution will come as soon as possible.""
The junta has issued no statements about the towns it lost to the NUG in Sagaing region.
According to a Nov. 28 report by the independent research group ISP-Myanmar, which documents the impact of conflict on civilians in the country, at least 119 armed clashes took place in Sagaing since the Oct. 27 launch of Operation 1027, an offensive led by the Three Brotherhood Alliance of ethnic armies.

As I reported previously, since at least November 2023, Yemenâbased Houthi militants have engaged in a series of attacks against United States military forces, including ships and aircraft, and against maritime commercial shipping, operating in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden.  These attacks pose a threat to the safety of United States forces and commercial ships and their crews, regional political and economic stability, and navigational rights and freedoms.  The Houthi militants continue to pose a threat of future attacks against United States forces and military vessels and against other maritime traffic in the region.
I previously reported that on January 11, 2024, in response to these attacks and the threat of future attacks, at my direction, United States forces as part of a multinational operation alongside the United Kingdom, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted discrete strikes against facilities in Yemen that facilitate Houthi militants' attacks in the Red Sea region.
On January 22, 2024, at my direction, United States forces as part of a multinational operation alongside the United Kingdom, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted discrete strikes against Houthi underground storage sites and locations associated with the Houthis' missile and air surveillance capabilities in Yemen that support and facilitate Houthi militants' attacks in the Red Sea region.  I directed the strikes in order to protect and defend our personnel and assets, to degrade and disrupt the ability of the Houthi militants to carry out future attacks against the United States and against vessels operating in the Red Sea region, and to prevent the Houthi militants from conducting or supporting further attacks that could further destabilize the region and threaten United States strategic interests.  The strikes were taken to deter and degrade Houthi capacity to conduct future attacks and were conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk of escalation and avoid civilian casualties.  I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law and in the exercise of the United States' inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.
Sincerely,
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR."
P5ZL19ZVK0_QBI1KKZL5U1QIPJ,Nearly 40 Myanmar civilians dead after four-day clash,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240124-rfa02.htm,"Indiscriminate junta airstrikes and heavy shelling caused the deaths, locals said.
By RFA Burmese 2024.01.24 -- Intense battles between junta troops, the Kachin Independence Army and joint People's Defense Forces have killed 40 civilians, locals told Radio Free Asia on Wednesday.
Fighting in northern Myanmar has surged for four days as allied resistance forces and junta troops fight for control over Shan state's Mongmit city. Junta airstrikes and heavy weapons are responsible for civilian deaths, residents who witnessed battles said.
Fighting began last Thursday, when the Kachin Independence Army captured Mongmit Police Station and junta camps in the city, and ended on Sunday. The military retaliated with heavy arms and indiscriminate airstrikes, burning Mongmit market and causing high civilian casualties, locals said.
Most victims were from the southern neighborhoods of Mongmit, said one resident who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals.
""We can't say the number of the people who died in the neighborhood yet. For sure, the southern neighborhood has the most deaths, including Let Hkoke Tan and Haw Nan,"" he said. ""I can estimate that there are almost 40 dead and they all are civilians.""
One local who fled the city on Saturday told RFA he witnessed the deaths of civilians and junta soldiers while fighting raged in the city center. He has since seen casualty lists circulated.
""I saw four dead civilians. I can confirm that one military officer and about seven junta soldiers were dead when we left the city,"" he said, asking to remain anonymous to protect his identity. ""I don't know the current situation of the city because the phone lines are down now.""
At least 10 people were injured and are being treated at nearby village clinics, he added.
Continuous aerial attacks and shelling damaged and destroyed houses downtown and in the city's south, locals said, adding that homes near the police station were burned down.
About 150 shops in the market caught fire and several monasteries were also damaged by heavy artillery, according to residents.
Calls to Shan state's junta spokesperson Khun Thein Maung and national spokesperson Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun by RFA to learn more went unanswered Wednesday.
Kachin Independence Army spokesperson Col. Naw Bu said he could not confirm details about the battles due to phone line outages in the area. Telecommunication and internet access have been cut off in Mongmit city where fighting occurred. More than 10,000 people have fled the city, residents said.

BRUSSELS (Sputnik) - Belgium will allocate 611 million euros ($663 million) to help Ukraine in 2024 from the profits received from the frozen assets of Russia, La Libre newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder.
The funding will be provided from the interests on the accounts of Russia's frozen assets in the country, the newspaper reported.
Last year the US proposed G7 working groups to look at possible ways to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. The EU, and the UK have stressed that the money received via the confiscation would not be easily accessible and would also be insufficient to cover Ukraine's reconstruction needs. Besides, the countries have noted that the confiscation of Russian assets should not occur to the detriment of providing financial support to Kiev in 2024.
Moscow has maintained that any attempt to confiscate its frozen assets would violate international law. The Russian Foreign Ministry has dismissed the freezing of Russian assets as theft.
""Those who are trying to initiate this, and those who will implement it, must understand that Russia will never leave those who did this alone. And it will constantly exercise its right to a legal battle, internationally, nationally or otherwise. And this, of course, will have â both Europeans and Americans understand this very well â it will have legal consequences for those who initiated and implemented it,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said commenting on the issue.
Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin dubbed the West's asset seizure an ""unseemly business,"" and stressed that ""stealing other people's assets has never brought anyone good"".

P8IY9G9HBA_I41KAK1VGMDPNIH,Hun Manet reiterates 'no foreign military bases' allowed in Cambodia,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-rfa02.htm,"The prime minister's remarks come just after a month-long visit to Ream Naval Base by two Chinese Navy warships.
By RFA Khmer 2024.01.24 -- Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Wednesday that no foreign military bases will be allowed on Cambodian territory - a statement likely made to blunt criticism over China's recent involvement in the development at Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand.
Hun Manet made the comment during the 25th anniversary commemoration of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces' infantry command.
""Cambodia is not allowed to have foreign military bases on its territory, nor is it allowed to have its military bases on any other territory except under the umbrella of the United Nations,"" he said, referring to the 1993 Cambodian Constitution.
In June 2021, China and Cambodia began expanding the Ream base with Beijing's funding. Satellite images last year showed the construction of a deep-draft pier that could accommodate aircraft carriers.
The government has repeatedly denied that China is being given exclusive military access to the base, saying that would contradict its constitution, which states that Cambodia ""shall not permit any foreign military base on its territory and shall not have its own military base abroad, except within the framework of a United Nations' request.""
The constitution was written during a period when the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia administered the country as it prepared for parliamentary elections following decades of conflict.
Article 53 of the constitution also states that Cambodia ""reserves the right to receive foreign assistance in the form of military equipment, armaments, ammunition, training of its armed forces and other assistance for self-defense and for maintaining public order and security within its territory.""
Hun Manet said on Wednesday that Cambodia is working to modernize its armed forces for self-defense, and also ""to increase its ability to participate in regional and global peacekeeping.""
Training by Chinese Navy
If China begins operating from the base, Ream would become its first naval staging facility in Southeast Asia and the second foreign base in the world after one in Djibouti.
Radio Free Asia reported on Dec. 5, 2023, about the arrival of two People's Liberation Army vessels at Ream as part of a training program for the Cambodian Navy. They were the first foreign warships to gain access to the new facility.
The Chinese ships provided on-ship and in-port training to Cambodian navy staff, according to the base's social media.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters on Dec. 6 that Washington has ""serious concerns about the PRC's plans for exclusive control over portions of Ream Naval Base,"" calling China by its formal name, the People's Republic of China.
Hun Manet's remarks were unsurprising, according to Keut Saray, president of the Association of Khmer Intellectual Students. He added the government should be transparent and allow visits to suspected areas at the base.
""When there is an international expert who is recognized by countries around the world to study the base, I believe that all the results that are obtained will eliminate any doubts,"" he said.

Kerman, IRNA -- A conscript has killed five fellow soldiers in a military barrack in the southeastern Iranian province of Kerman.
Commander of the Iranian Army's Southeastern Regional Headquarters Brigadier General Amir Gholamalian said on Sunday the conscript had opened fire on soldiers resting in a military position and then fled the scene.
Gholamalian said a probe had been launched to determine the motives behind the shooting, adding that the conscript is being chased.

By Liu Xuanzun Published: Jan 25, 2024 11:06 PM
The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) tracked and monitored a US destroyer as it made a transit through the Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, with experts saying on Thursday that the provocative US move, the first of its kind since separatist Lai Ching-te won the Taiwan regional election, sent a wrong signal and further raised tensions.
The Chinese Defense Ministry also confirmed on Thursday that the PLA Eastern Theater Command recently held combat patrols around the island of Taiwan, vowing firm actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Senior Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesperson at the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement late on Wednesday that the USS John Finn made a transit through the Taiwan Straits on the day and publicly hyped its operation, and the PLA Eastern Theater Command organized forces to track, monitor and deal with the US warship's transit operation throughout its entire course in accordance with the law and regulations.
Foreign media outlets including Reuters said it marks the first time the US Navy has sent a warship through the Taiwan Straits following the January 13 regional election on the island of Taiwan.
Shi revealed that recently, the US military frequently made provocative moves and intentionally sabotaged peace and stability in the region.
The troops affiliated with the theater command maintained high alert at all times to resolutely defend national sovereignty security as well as regional peace and stability, Shi said.
In response to the US warship's transit through the Taiwan Straits, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference on Thursday that the US should immediately stop infringement and provocative moves, stop creating troubles undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, and stop sending any wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces.
The defense authority on the island of Taiwan said in a press release on Thursday morning that it detected 18 PLA aircraft and six PLA vessels around the island over the past day, with four of the detected aircraft crossing the so-called median line of the Taiwan Straits or entering the island's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone.
The PLA Eastern Theater Command recently held routine naval, air joint combat alert patrols around the island of Taiwan in a move to further enhance the troops' combat training level as well as elevate their combat capabilities in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a regular press conference on Thursday.
China's reunification requires Taiwan's return, and the PLA will speak through actions and always be an iron Great Wall defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wu said
""Taiwan will never be a country. 'Taiwan independence' and the attempts by foreign forces to split China will never succeed,"" Wu said.
US having sent a warship to sail through the Taiwan Straits shortly after Lai's election sent a wrong signal to the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Thursday.
The PLA's response showed that it has every situation under control as always, the expert said.
With the PLA's capabilities in situational awareness and precision strike capability, a few foreign warships transiting through the narrow Taiwan Straits are of little military significance, and can only serve the purpose of putting on a political show, analysts said.
Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, slammed the US warship transit as a provocation.
After the regional election on the island of Taiwan, the US boosted provocations over the Taiwan question in attempts to contain China under its ""Indo-Pacific Strategy,"" Song told the Global Times on Thursday.
Another goal of the Biden administration is to win more votes in the upcoming US presidential election by adopting a strong stance on China, Song said.
The latest warship transit in the Taiwan Straits is not the only US attempt to raise military tensions in the region.
US think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday released a report hyping that the ""majority of experts"" from the US and the island of Taiwan said they believe ""a crisis in the Taiwan Straits is likely in 2024.""
According to a graphic released by the US Naval Institute on Monday, the US Navy has amassed since last weekend three aircraft carriers in the Asia-Pacific region, namely the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan, with analysts saying that they will likely hold provocative exercises or patrols on China's doorstep.
Deploying military assets and making irresponsible remarks are US tricks aimed at creating tensions in the Taiwan Straits, containing China's development and maintaining the US' hegemony, analysts said.
The world should clearly see that tensions in the Taiwan Straits are not being created by China, but by the US as well as collusion among ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and external interference forces, experts said."
PDZHVRNG25_GDQRF92EGJGF0AU,Hong Kong leader warns of foreign 'wolves' waiting to pounce,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/01/china-240125-rfa02.htm,"One report says Amnesty International, Greenpeace could be targeted under forthcoming new security law.
By Alice Yam and Lee Heung Yeung for RFA Cantonese, Chen Zifei for RFA Mandari 2024.01.25 -- Hong Kong's leader on Thursday said his city is poised to step up a crackdown on foreign ""wolves"" trying to undermine its stability, as a top court reinstated a prison sentence handed down to human rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung, a key figure in the pro-democracy movement.
""I really think Hong Kongers have been a bit too gentle,"" Chief Executive John Lee told lawmakers during a question-and-answer session about additional national security legislation on Thursday, referring to his government's claim that the 2019 pro-democracy movement was a bid by ""hostile foreign forces"" to undermine it.
""They didn't realize how dangerous the world is, how many villains there are,"" Lee said. ""They didn't know that the wolves were in charge, that a tiger was eying up the fat pig that was Hong Kong.""
""But we have experienced it, especially the pain of 2019 [which] made us realize that we must protect ourselves against these villains, against hostile forces and espionage,"" he said, in a session convened to explain new security laws to be passed under Article 23 of the city's Basic Law.
Lee continued: ""Hostile forces are watching and waiting for an opportunity, so we must seize the opportunity to legislate as soon as possible.""
He said that while the city appears calm today, ""undercurrents"" of dissent remained, citing China's top official in charge of Hong Kong, Xia Baolong, and that ""soft confrontation"" remains a potential threat.
""We need to always be wary ... of anti-China disruptive activities in Hong Kong ... in the guise of so-called human rights, freedom, democracy and people's livelihood,"" Lee said, adding that the new legislation should take priority over measures to boost the city's economy.
Blows to rule of law
His comments came as the city's Court of Final Appeal overturned the acquittal of rights activist Chow Hang-tung, in what rights groups said was ""another blow to the rule of law in the city.""
The court overturned an earlier decision acquitting Chow on charges of ""inciting"" people to take part in a banned vigil marking the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, in what London-based rights group Amnesty International said was ""the latest injustice"" against her.
Chow is a former leader of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which disbanded after authorities used the annual Tiananmen candlelight vigil it had organized for 30 years as evidence it had ""endangered national security"".
Chow also faces charges of ""inciting subversion"" under the 2020 National Security Law, for which she faces a potential life prison sentence.
""The disappointing ruling announced today is the latest injustice against Chow Hang-tung, who remains unjustly detained on separate charges under the National Security Law for her entirely peaceful actions,"" the group's China director Sarah Brooks said in a statement.
""The Hong Kong authorities must drop all charges against her, ensure she is free from torture and other ill-treatment and release her,"" she said.
Amnesty International and possibly even Greenpeace are among foreign organizations being eyed as potential national security threats by the Hong Kong government, the city's Ming Pao newspaper reported on Thursday.
More dangerous law
The paper cited government sources as saying that the two groups would likely be placed on a list of ""foreign political organizations"" once the Article 23 legislation has been passed, a near-certainty due to the lack of political opposition in the Legislative Council.
Former Amnesty International researcher Patrick Poon said the group isn't political, but that human rights issues are regarded as political by authorities in China and Hong Kong.
""The scope of the Article 23 legislation will be wider than the [existing] National Security Law,"" Poon said. ""They will be able to accuse people using [this] law if they think your activities are political.""
He said the report that Greenpeace would also be targeted as a ""foreign political organization"" was shocking, although its inclusion could be linked to its vocal opposition to the government's massive island-building project, Lantau Tomorrow Vision.
Greenpeace replied to requests for comment from RFA, saying that they are ""a major environmental organization recognized globally"" and have always adhered to the principle of political neutrality in all countries and regions.
Australia-based former pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui agreed that the forthcoming laws will be more stringent than the existing National Security Law, which ushered in a citywide crackdown on dissent that has seen more than 10,000 arrests on public order charges linked to the 2019 protest movement and 230 arrested under the law, which criminalizes public criticism of the authorities by anyone, anywhere in the world.
""The devil is in the details,"" Hui said. ""[Vague wording] by the Hong Kong government can give law enforcement agencies greater flexibility and power, and few restrictions on how they enforce the law.""
""The Article 23 legislation will be more dangerous than the National Security Law,"" he said.

Jan 22, 2024
Tehran, IRNA - Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has said that Iran is the biggest supporter of the national sovereignty, stability, security, and territorial integrity of Iraq.
Addressing the press conference on Monday, Kanaani said that Iran's commitment to the national and territorial sovereignty of Iraq has been proven.
Iran has proven its honesty to the nation and government of Iraq for many years, he added, noting that Tehran and Baghdad enjoy strong and have all-out relations.
Iran's attack on Israel's espionage center in Erbil was aimed at fighting the aggressors of Iran's national security and was not against Iraq, or its security and sovereignty, he stated.
Iran has repeatedly warned the Iraqi authorities and stressed Iran's national security is a red line, Kanaani said.
He went on to say that some extremist groups' gathering in the Iraqi Kurdistan region to act against Iran's national security is unacceptable.
Details of Iran's preemptive attack on terrorist group
Kanaani also pointed to Iran's recent military attack on a terrorist group's hideout in Pakistan, saying that the recent strike on the headquarters of the so-called Jaish al-Adl in Koh-e Sabz in Pakistan's Balochistan province was an urgent need to confront terrorists who were planning to make attacks inside Iran. He further argued that the terrorists were only about half an hour away from the Iranian borderline and were getting ready to kick off their attacks on Iran's military posts and even civilians.
Confronting terrorist groups and preserving security on both sides of joint borders are among the joint missions of Iran and Pakistan, he underscored, adding that the two nations enjoy a firm relationship and that the attack on the terrorist group, which has a long-run history of carrying out terrorist operations, proves the fact that the Islamic Republic attaches importance to its national security.
The spokesman also said that the Iran-Pakistan relationship is brotherly and strong and that the two sides give significance to the mutual amicable ties.
According to the diplomat, terrorism is a threat to both countries, so Tehran and Islamabad stress the need to fight the phenomenon and the recent military act cannot negatively affect bilateral relations.
Iran and Pakistan will not allow third parties to interfere in their mutual interactions or try to create misunderstanding, he mentioned.
Talks on lifting sanctions to be continued
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Ali Bagheri and Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service Enrique Mora held talks in Geneva in a bid to exchange views on removing the sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic, said Kanaani.
The negotiations are to be continued in this regard, he further noted.
Regarding the relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the official said that the two sides will continue the talks.
Kanaani also added that the two sides could pay visits whenever necessary to this end.
Zionist regime's threats against Iran
As to the threatening remarks of certain Zionist officials against Iran, he said that the baseless threats and statements demonstrate the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime.
The measures indicate the level of threat it poses to regional and international security, he underlined.
The regime keeps seeking to create instability and insecurity at both regional and global levels, he underscored.
Kanaani termed the remarks as hollow, noting, ""We will certainly not leave any action against Iran unanswered"".
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should pay attention to the statements of the Zionist regime, he said, calling on the UNSC to take the necessary legal measures against the threats.
NATO's recent military drill
We do not consider such military actions and maneuvers and efforts to expand NATO's presence in the region as contributing to peace, stability, and security in the region, Kanaani said.
Not only have NATO's activities not brought any peace and stability to the region, but they have also fueled insecurity and war, he added.
Iran-Egypt ties
He did not comment on the Iranian foreign minister's trip to Egypt.
He also hailed relations between Iran and Egypt, saying that based on the orders of the two presidents, and face-to-face and telephone conversations, a road map has been defined for the continuation of negotiations between the two countries and the resolution of disputes.
The issue of Palestine has been discussed by the officials of the two countries, he said adding that the humanitarian institutions, including the Iranian Red Crescent, have a relationship with Egypt.
Reports on Saudi Arabia mediating between Iran and the US
As to media reports on conveying messages between Iran and the US by Saudi Arabia, Kanaani noted that he cannot confirm Riyadh's role in this respect; however, he said that American officials usually find ways to send their messages to Tehran. Iran and Saudi Arabia enjoy a good and growing relationship and are making serious efforts to expand collaborations, he added.
Alleged death of Dutch national in Iran's attack
On the issue of summoning Iran's ambassador by the Netherlands' Foreign Ministry, he said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic has not received any verified information in respect of the death of a Dutch national as a result of Iran's attack on a terrorist hideout in Iraq's Erbil city.
Asked about a claim regarding the arrest of an Iranian national by the Kurdish forces in northern Iraq, he said that he does not have any information about this matter.
Iran's support for South Africa's lawsuit against Zionist regime
Answering IRNA correspondent, Kanaani said that the Islamic Republic backs the good, responsible, brave, and noble move by South Africa, who filed a lawsuit against the Israeli regime at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), adding that Iran announced its political support for the African country's stance.
According to the spokesman, Iran has underlined the need for resorting to international conventions since October 7, 2023, and called upon different states to utilize the opportunity as well as the capacities of the ICJ to this goal.
Iranians martyred in Syria
When asked about the Zionist regime's attacks against some Iranian advisories in Syria, he said that the martyrs were serving in the Arab country at the request of the Syrian government.  They had taken a considerable number of measures to fight against terrorism, he added.
Iran's stance of Palestinian cause
What the Zionist regime is pursuing is finding a way out of the self-created quagmire of the Gaza war. The regime keeps creating tension, conflicts, and war in the region, he said, adding that Iran will not play a role in a plot devised by the Zionist regime.
Iran will not be tight-handed to respond to the measures of the Zionist regime against Iran's goals, he said.
Regarding the stance of the Islamic Republic on the Palestinian cause, Kanaani said that Iran's stance on the crisis in Palestine is clear.
He went on to say that Tehran has repeatedly announced that the ongoing crisis in Palestine is the result of the occupation of land by an occupier regime. The main owners of Palestine should be given the right to self-determination, with the result being determined through democracy and referendum.
He also said that those countries that advocate a two-state solution to the issue of Palestine should recognize that the Zionist regime, as one side of this crisis, is opposed to the initiative.
Those who propose the so-called peace initiative should realize that the right of one side is practically ignored in favor of the other, Kanaani said. This solution will not bear fruits, he further noted.
NAM summit in Uganda
About the 19th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) held in Kampala, Uganda, on January 15-20, Kanaani said that participation in the multilateral mechanism has always been one of the methods used by Iran to take advantage of the potential of the international arena.
""We used the potential of the international organizations, particularly the NAM, to advance the Iranian interest in various areas,"" he pointed out.

Residents lack food and clean water, health facilities are practically nonexistent and communication with the outside world is patchy at best.
That's according to Juliette Touma, Director of Communications for UNRWA, the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees, who spoke in depth to UN News's Conor Lennon on Monday about her most recent visit to the Strip.
The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
""This was my second trip since the war began. I try to go whenever it's possible to express solidarity with the people there who are severely impacted by this brutal war and also to see our colleagues who continue to serve the communities through their humanitarian mission.
This time, however, I visited the middle areas, including Deir al-Balah, and then in the south, I went to Rafah and Khan Younis.
It was absolutely desperate. Wherever you looked, there were people who are displaced, people asking for assistance, and people were just very, very exhausted and tired after three and a half months of what has been a very brutal war.
I think that what was different to the first visit I took is how congested a city like Rafah has become.
Makeshift shelters
The population of Rafah in the south has quadrupled since the war began. People kept fleeing, looking for shelter in that part of Gaza, in the hope that they will find safety and protection.
Wherever you drove, wherever you walked, wherever you looked, the city was covered with these little structures that people who fled to the area have set up. They're very basic, just a couple of wooden poles covered with plastic sheeting. That's all people can find, and these have become home to many, many people.
'These are not conditions meant for human beings'
I spoke to one mother who was living in one of those informal structures. There were 26 people living on top of each other in a small space, less than three square metres.
She was carrying two of her kids, and she told me that they have no way to stay warm at night, that they were frustrated, that they are tired of this life.
She said that, in terms of assistance, she only had one piece of vegetable to be shared between the 26 people. She told me that she cannot wash; either the queues are too long or the showers don't work.
These are not conditions meant for human beings.
Total communication blackouts
Since the beginning of the war, phone and internet services have been cut several times, leading to total communication blackouts, but this has been the longest [still ongoing at time of publication] telecommunications blackout that Gaza has had since the war began. This is due, I understand, to severe damage that was done to the telecoms network in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.
When I was there, you couldn't even send a simple WhatsApp message, and you could forget about trying to place a call from one mobile phone to another.
The majority of people feel extremely isolated from each other and the rest of the world. This also contributes to a lack of safety.
Imagine, you're in the middle of a war zone, and you need to call an ambulance. Or you want to call for help, check on your loved ones. You simply cannot do it.
The other impact this has is on our own aid operation, whether it's UNRWA, the UN system or the humanitarian organizations in general, because it is, as one can imagine, very challenging to coordinate. You need to be able to call truck drivers and to organize with those who do the loading, the off-loading, the storing and the distribution. A phone is absolutely indispensable.
Humanitarian ceasefire, now
So, right now, we are continuing to call for a humanitarian ceasefire to bring respite and calm not only to people in Gaza, but the people across the region.
Meanwhile, there is a need for more humanitarian supplies, including medicines for chronic diseases, which are in very short supply at the moment.
That is why we said, after the trip to Gaza, that the siege is the silent killer of people in Gaza. People are likely dying as a result of hunger, disease or a lack of medical and health care.
And then what also needs to happen is more commercial supplies should come to the private sector in the Gaza Strip because the entire population almost entirely now is relying on humanitarian assistance, and that's not sustainable, not in the medium term and not in the long term."""

President Biden's Special Advisor for the Americas Christopher Dodd and Commander of the United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) General Laura Richardson met today with President of Ecuador Daniel Noboa and will meet with other senior Ecuadorian government officials tomorrow to showcase U.S. support for the country in the wake of a surge in violence.  The discussions are focused on ongoing commitment to democratic values and the rule of law, and ways to deepen bilateral cooperation, including with respect to security, counter drug cooperation, migration, and economic development.
This week, the United States is facilitating the delivery of over 20,000 bullet proof vests and more than $1 million worth of critical security and emergency response equipment, including ambulances and defense logistic support vehicles.  The United States also announced that, in the coming days, the FBI will increase its personnel in-country to support the Ecuadorian National Police and Attorney General's Office.  In addition, the Department of Homeland Security is deploying personnel to support the ongoing training of the police and prosecutors; offering additional support in digital forensics and other analysis critical to targeting gang members, drug trafficking networks, and corrupt officials; and providing key training and technical assistance with respect to protection of executive officials. USAID also is augmenting support for its municipal security programs, including support for crisis communications.  Meanwhile, the United States, Ecuador, and other regional partners continue to advance the goals under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity initiative launched by President Biden in June 2022 to help provide greater economic opportunity to Ecuadorians, which is crucial to addressing the underlying drivers of insecurity, criminality, and migration."

Parliamentary Assembly session  Strasbourg  25 January 2024
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has resolved not to ratify the credentials of the Azerbaijani delegation, which were challenged on the opening day of the session, concluding that the country has ""not fulfilled major commitments"" stemming from its joining the Council of Europe 20 years ago.
""Very serious concerns remain as to [Azerbaijan's] ability to conduct free and fair elections, the separation of powers, the weakness of its legislature vis-Ã -vis the executive, the independence of the judiciary and respect for human rights, as illustrated by numerous judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and opinions of the Venice Commission,"" the Assembly said in a resolution, based on a report by Mogens Jensen (Denmark, SOC). The resolution was adopted today with 76 votes in favour, 10 against and 4 abstentions.
The Assembly also cited the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, noting that Azerbaijan's leadership ""did not acknowledge the very serious humanitarian and human rights consequences"" stemming from the lack of free and safe access through the Lachin Corridor, and recalling its condemnation of the September 2023 military operation ""which led to the flight of the entire Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia and to allegations of 'ethnic cleansing'.""
Finally, the resolution cited a number of examples of ""lack of co-operation"" with the Assembly, including that its monitoring rapporteurs were not allowed to meet with persons detained on allegedly politically motivated charges, it had not been invited to observe the forthcoming presidential election, and other PACE rapporteurs had been refused visits to the country.
""The delegation of Azerbaijan may resume its activities in the Assembly when conditions provided by the Rules of Procedure are met,"" said the parliamentarians.
Once a year on the opening day of each PACE part-session, national parliaments are invited to present the credentials of their delegations. The Milli Mejlis, Azerbaijan's parliament, had presented the credentials of a twelve-member delegation.
Today's decision concerns only the credentials of the Azerbaijani parliamentary delegation. Azerbaijan continues to be a full member of the Council of Europe."

Defendant, a   Citizen of the People's Republic of China, Initiated Stalking and   Threats Campaign Against Individual Who Promoted Freedom and Democracy   in China
A   federal jury convicted a People's Republic of China (PRC) national and   Berklee College of Music student for stalking and threatening an   individual who posted fliers in support of democracy in China around the   Berklee campus area.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Xiaolei   Wu, 26, was convicted following a four-day jury trial of one count of   cyberstalking, one count of interstate transmissions of threatening   communication and one count of stalking. Wu was arrested and charged by   criminal complaint in December 2022 and subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury in January 2023.
""Today's verdict by a jury in the District of Massachusetts   underscores the Department's commitment to ensuring all U.S. residents   are able to freely exercise their fundamental rights,"" said Assistant   Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National   Security Division.
""No one in this country should ever be subjected to threats of   violence or a cyberstalking harassment campaign for expressing their   political views. Mr. Wu now stands as a convicted felon for his illegal   efforts to suppress speech by a fellow Berklee School of Music student   who was critical of the government of China. This type of conduct will   never be tolerated,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the   District of Massachusetts. ""The Department of Justice is committed to   safeguarding the fundamental right to free speech for all. Our office   will hold accountable individuals whose actions threaten or violate this   fundamental tenet of our democratic society.""
""What Xiaolei Wu did in attempting to silence and intimidate an   activist who expressed dissension with the ruling Communist Party of   China is not only criminal, but completely against our country's   democratic values,"" said Special Agent in Charge Jodi Cohen of the FBI   Boston Division. ""Today's conviction upholds one of our most fundamental   rights - freedom of speech - and the FBI will ensure that anyone who   tries to infringe on this right using threats or harassment will face   the same fate as Mr. Wu.""
Beginning on or about Oct. 22, 2022, and continuing until Oct. 24,   2022, Wu made a series of communications via WeChat, email and Instagram   directed towards the victim who posted the flier. Among other things,   Wu said, ""Post more, I will chop your bastard hands off."" He also told   the victim that he had informed the public security agency in China   about the victim's actions and that the public security agency in China   would ""greet"" the victim's family. Additionally, Wu solicited others to   find out where the victim was living and publicly posted the victim's   email address in the hopes that others would abuse the victim online,   and he reported the victim's information back to a member of the Chinese   government.
Wu was convicted of cyberstalking, which carries a   maximum statutory penalty of five years in prison, three years of   supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000; and interstate   transmissions of threatening communication, which carries a maximum   penalty of five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a   fine of up to $250,000. A federal district court judge will determine   any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other   statutory factors.
The FBI investigated the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy H. Kistner and   Alathea E. Porter for the District of Massachusetts are prosecuting the   case with the assistance of Trial Attorney Menno Goedman of the National   Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.

New York, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian says Iran has warned the US that its decision to launch joint attacks with the UK against Yemen is a strategic mistake.
He made the comment in response to a question by IRNA's correspondent to New York on Monday local time after the end of his bilateral meetings on the first day of his trip to New York.
""We sent a serious message and warning to the Americans,"" Amirabdollahian said.
""The action that the United States and the United Kingdom took jointly and attacked areas in Yemen is a threat to peace and security in the region and is an intensification of the scope of war,"" he added.
Yemenis have been launching attacks on Israeli-linked ships since the Zionist regime launched a brutal war on Gaza in early October.
The attacks expanded earlier this month to cover ships owned by US and Britain after the two countries launched attacks on the Yemeni soil in what they said was an attempt to protect shipping in the Red Sea and surrounding waterways.
More than 25,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed by the Zionist regime's bombardment of Gaza since the beginning of the war.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Ukraine's attack on the Russian Il-76 plane that led to its crash in the Belgorod Region was ""deliberate,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, and called the incident a ""terrorist act.""
Earlier in the day, the Russian Defense Ministry said that an Il-76 transport plane of the Russian air forces with 65 Ukrainian prisoners who were being transported for exchange, six crew members and three accompanying persons crashed in Belgorod region.
""Kiev was well aware of the planned exchange [of prisoners of war]. They knew how and by what route the prisoners of war would be transferred. The attack on the plane was a deliberate and conscious action. The terrorist attack clearly demonstrates the inability of the Kiev regime to negotiate,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that it ""condemns"" the attack.
The ministry also called on international organizations to condemn Ukraine's actions as ""their silence will mean support for [Kiev's] barbarism"".
Later in the day, Ukrainian news portal Strana.ua reported that the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry had confirmed that a prisoner exchange between Moscow and Kiev was to take place on Wednesday.
The procedure is currently suspended with no official explanation given, the news portal said, citing defense intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov. The Ukrainian intelligence services are reportedly checking the information about the prisoners being on board of the crashed plane.

Q64840E501_DEYP9KHC99FWO9Y,Attacks on Lebanon-Israel Border Prompt Warnings of Escalation,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-voa04.htm,"By Dale Gavlak January 24, 2024
Continuing retaliatory attacks and targeted assassinations along the Lebanon-Israel border are prompting warnings of an escalation that could unleash a wider conflict in the region.
Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia said it targeted Israel's northern army command Mount Meron base Tuesday, its second such attack on the post in recent days. Later Tuesday, Israeli warplanes fired missiles at Lebanon's southern districts of Bint Jbeil, Nabatieh and Iqlim al-Tuffah, destroying homes and wounding several people, Lebanon's National News Agency reported.
The border skirmishes have forced citizens on both sides to move further inland for safety.
Lebanon's caretaker foreign minister, Abdullah Bou Habib, in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York this week, linked the retaliatory aerial bombings to the war in Gaza.
""It is minor fighting, and I don't think the intention is to have a big war,"" he said. ""It also has to do with what's going on in Gaza â it's not acceptable Arab-wise, it's not acceptable world-wise.""
However, analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib points to Israel's increasing use of targeted assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders in Lebanon, such as Wissam al-Tawil and Saleh Arouri, as potential triggers for a wider conflict with Hezbollah.
Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA that Hezbollah is ""poking"" Israel but doesn't want an escalation. However, she said an escalation is possible if the United States does not rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""I think the Israeli army doesn't want to go to Lebanon because they know they cannot win,"" she said. ""They can destroy Beirut, but they cannot destroy Hezbollah. But I see it escalating unless there is U.S. pressure.""
Professor Filippo Dionigi of the University of Bristol in Britain told the France 24 TV network that Israel's targeted assassinations have gone beyond the ""rules of engagement.""
""The other possibility is error, is over-shooting, involving citizens to a greater [degree] than they're already involved,"" he said. ""That can create unwanted consequences on both sides of the conflict and therefore open the possibility of a greater escalation and even a possibility of an all-out war.""
Other observers say that Lebanon's dire economic crisis means there is little appetite for war with Israel and that Hezbollah would risk a significant public backlash.
Tobias Borck, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London, warned in Britain's MailOnline, as the Gaza war continues, ""I think the risk of something going wrong compounds the longer this goes on."""

Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, when summing up the outcome of 2023, said that the West is trying to shift NATO's activities to Asia, whip up a crisis there and form new military and political blocs.
NATO is a walking war machine that brings chaos wherever it appears, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said at a briefing on Thursday.
""We have drawn attention to inappropriate statements by the NATO Secretary General regarding China. As a regional military organization, NATO has launched and participated in wars since the very days of its inception,"" Wu Qian said.
He observed that over the past few years, the alliance has been steadily shifting its focus towards the Asia-Pacific region, employing the nonexistent ""China threat"" as a means to provoke bloc confrontation and endangering regional security.
""It should be said that NATO is a walking 'war machine,' and wherever it appears, it brings disorder everywhere,"" he pointed out.
Wu Qian has called on NATO to cease their fabrication of lies and cease engaging in dangerous actions that disrupt the Asia-Pacific region, and to treat China, along with the Chinese armed forces and its development in an unbiased and rational manner.
During the World Economic Forum in Davos, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized that the US-led military bloc remains ""regional"" in nature and will continue to be so.
Stoltenberg also engaged in classic blame game, stating that the Western bloc allegedly does not regard China as an adversary and does not wish to expand into Asia.
""This is not about NATO moving into Asia, but instead about the fact that China is coming close to us,"" he claimed.

Israeli forces have destroyed at least 1,000 mosques during their ongoing genocidal war against the Gaza Strip while desecrating dozens of cemeteries, the territory's officials say.
The Palestinian Information Center quoted Gaza's Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs as providing the information in a statement on Sunday.
""The Israeli occupation forces have destroyed more than 1,000 out of 1,200 mosques in the territory since October 7 last year,"" the ministry said, adding that reconstruction of those mosques would cost around $500 million.
The Palestinian ministry added that the Israeli aggression has also destroyed a number of churches across Gaza, including the historical Greek Orthodox Church, as well as Zakat religious committees, schools for teaching the Holy Qur'an, and the headquarters of the Endowment Bank.
Israeli forces have assassinated more than 100 religious scholars, preachers, imams, and muezzins who announce the Muslim call to prayer, since the onset of their military onslaught, the report noted.
In the same context, the ministry pointed out that the Israeli aggression has led to desecration and destruction of dozens of cemeteries and graves where dead bodies were stolen in clear violation of all international laws and human rights.
The regime began its military aggression against Gaza on October 7, 2023 following Operation al-Aqsa Storm by the territory's resistance movements. More than 25,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli military onslaught so far, while over 62,600 others have been injured.
The new revelation came after another investigation, whose results were released on Saturday, found that Israeli forces have desecrated at least 16 cemeteries in Gaza during their ongoing onslaught against the besieged territory.
The CNN study, which is based on satellite imagery and social media footage, said Israeli troops have left tombstones torn down and even bodies unearthed as they destroyed those cemeteries.
It went on to say that the regime forces have destroyed an entire cemetery in the southern city of Khan Yunis, removing bodies buried there.
The report further noted that in other cases, Israeli forces have used Gaza's cemeteries as military outposts.
Legal experts told CNN that Israel's acts could amount to war crimes, stressing that the intentional destruction of religious sites, such as cemeteries, violates international law."

LITTLE FALLS, Minn. -- U.S. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Group 2 commenced Snow Crab Exercise (Snow Crab Ex) 24-1 Jan. 22, 2024 following the arrival of Navy EOD Mobile Units (EODMU) and Navy Divers at Camp Ripley in Little Falls, Minn.
now Crab Ex 24-1 is a two week exercise designed to test and evaluate U.S. Navy EOD capabilities in a simulated Arctic environment and, ultimately, improve Navy EOD's combat effectiveness.
""We have a responsibility and a duty to be able to respond globally to explosive threats to peer adversaries and competitors. Navy EOD and Navy Diving forces aggressively pursue opportunities to further develop a more agile and flexible force to support the Fleet commander,"" said Capt. Joseph Haywood, commander, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group (EODGRU) 2. ""Snow Crab Ex allows Navy EOD and Navy Diving forces to build capability and readiness in an Arctic environment, so we are better equipped to fight for sea control in the Arctic environment.""
During Snow Crab Ex, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit (EODMU) 12 and Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit (MDSU) 2 will exercise tactical control over Navy EOD technicians from EODMU 12 and EODMU 2, as well as MDSU 2.
""Our EOD technicians and divers have a highly unique skill set, strong mindsets, and an unbreakable bond that allows them to commit to and accomplish seemingly impossible tasks, and that is what we are training toward during Snow Crab Ex 24-1,"" said Cmdr. David Scherr, commander, EODMU 12. ""It is important that we are able to efficiently operate wherever we are called, and we'll be honing our tactics, techniques, and procedures in a challenging Arctic environment to ensure we are ready for the challenge.""
Units participating in Snow Crab Ex 24-1 include: EODGRU 2, EODMU 2, EODMU 12, MDSU 2, EOD Expeditionary Support Unit (EODESU) 2, Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron (MSRON) 4, Expeditionary Exploitation Unit One, and Navy Expeditionary Intelligence Command (NEIC).
Navy EOD will clear simulated unexploded ordnance, secure critical infrastructure, and effectively communicate between units who will be distributed and operating simultaneously in a training environment, while also maintaining command and control (C2) during the exercise.
Navy Divers will also complete ice dive training, to include underwater location and identification of ordnance, to ensure they can complete dive and salvage operations in Arctic waters.
The Minnesota National Guard will provide air support for portions of the exercise. Camp Ripley provides ideal conditions and training ranges to simulate an Arctic environment for ice and cold weather dive training, where Navy divers can train in a subzero temperature and arduous conditions at training ranges.
""Camp Ripley provides us an opportunity to train in an environment that mimics the Arctic region, without the exceptional cost of traveling to remote areas,"" said Capt. Haywood. ""The Minnesota National Guard and Camp Ripley provide us modern facilities and the logistical and administrative support needed. They have been exceptional partners training with us as we train and prepare to be able to respond to any situation in any environment.""
The U.S. Navy routinely patrols on, above, below and around Arctic waters to ensure the security of commerce and demonstrate freedom of navigation. Exercises like Snow Crab Ex 24-1 allow our teams to assess their readiness, increase their experience in the region, test new technologies, and advance our understanding of the Arctic environment.
Navy Expeditionary Combat Command units participating in Snow Crab Ex 24-1 include: EODGRU 2, EODMU 2, EODMU 12, MDSU 2, EOD Expeditionary Support Unit (EODESU) 2, Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron (MSRON) 4, Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group (NAVELSG), and Navy Expeditionary Intelligence Command (NEIC).

Tehran, IRNA -- Head of the Iranian Space Agency Hassan Salariyeh has said that the most important mission of the newly-launched indigenous Sorayya satellite is to verify the performance of Qaem 100, a domestically-made satellite carrier designed for launches at higher space orbits.
Salariyeh made the comment in an interview with IRNA on Monday, two days after Iran placed the Sorayya (meaning Pleiades in Persian) research satellite into a space orbit of 750km above the Earth's surface.
Minister of Communications and Information Technology Isa Zarepour said afterward that it was the first time that Iran put a satellite in the 750-km orbit above the Earth's surface, hailing it as a new record set in the height of the country's space launches.
Sorraya was launched into the space using Qaem 100 satellite carrier built by the Aerospace Unit of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).
Now, the head of the Iranian Space Agency has said that the Sorayya satellite was launched to accomplish several missions including to verify the performance of Qaem 100 carrier, and to test the performance of locating the satellite using indigenous space GPS.
Testing the performance of telecommunication equipment in sending data on the situation of the satellite and receiving orders from the Earth, coupled with testing the satellite's performance in the orbit at the time of separation are some of other missions defined for the satellite, Salariyeh added.
He also elaborated on the capabilities of Qaem 100 satellite carrier. He said it is equipped with an engine working on solid fuel, which enables the carrier to carry objects weighing above 50kg and destined for a 500-km orbit. Qaem 100 is capable of carrying objects weighing up to 100kg, he added.
The official said the engine of Qaem 100 promotes its flight sustainability and have a better control mechanism, adding that the carrier will be used for several more space launches in the coming months to further test its capabilities and performance.
Salariyeh also said that Iran is building another satellite carrier called Qaem 120, while it will test-launch another one named Simorgh (meaning phoenix) in the near future, which has been produced by the country's ministry of defense.

Planned over the course of several years, Steadfast Defender 24 will highlight NATO's ability to deploy forces rapidly from North America and other parts of the Alliance to reinforce the defence of Europe.
""The Alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via trans-Atlantic movement of forces from North America,"" said General Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). ""Steadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength, and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order.""
Steadfast Defender 24 will take place in several locations, with associated exercises running until May 31, 2024. It will be the first large scale NATO exercise where new defence plans will be put into action. It will show that NATO can conduct and sustain complex multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of kilometres, from the High North to Central and Eastern Europe, and in any conditions.

AFP: The European Union yesterday announced a plan to strengthen economic security and prevent geopolitical rivals from gaining access to sensitive technologies, as part of the ""de-risking"" strategy toward China pushed by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. How does China view the plan released by the EU yesterday?
Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant report. In recent years, the international community has expressed concerns about the EU's protectionist and unilateral moves in economy and trade, and relevant moves will exacerbate such concerns. We hope that the EU will abide by the basic norms of market economy including free trade, fair competition and open cooperation, observe WTO rules, and avoid introducing any policies and measures that roll back globalization and overstretch the concept of security. This bears on the image of the EU in the international economic and trade field, and more importantly, on the confidence of companies from China and other countries in Europe's business environment.
The Paper: The US magazine Foreign Policy published an article a few days ago, pointing out that the Red Sea crisis proves that China's Belt and Road Initiative is very important as it is a blueprint for what every nation needs in an age of uncertainty and disruption. There is precisely one pathway for a world plagued by dire mistrust and unpredictable crises to take meaningful collective action in the global public interestâand that is to build more pathways for supply to meet demand. More belts, more roads. China is the one country that has known thisâand acted on itâfor years. What is your comment on this?
Wang Wenbin: We noted the article and also noted another recent article published by the US magazine The Diplomat, considering the possibility of complementarity between the Belt and Road Initiative and infrastructure aid programs of Western countries, rather than being outright competitors. What these two articles pointed out are simply objective facts that anyone without tinted glasses can see at a glance.
In the past decade and more since President Xi Jinping proposed the BRI, Belt and Road cooperation has expanded beyond the Eurasian continent to Africa and Latin America, and from ""hard connectivity"" to ""soft connectivity"" and to the connectivity between the people. BRI has built up the world's largest platform that covers the widest range of international cooperation. Thanks to the Belt and Road cooperation, cooperation in infrastructure, connectivity and other fields have been given wide attention around the world, injecting strong impetus to keeping international industrial and supply chains stable and boosting the inclusive and sustainable growth of global economy. The vision of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation supported by the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, open, green and clean cooperation, and a high-standard, people-centered and sustainable approach has been incorporated into important documents of the UN and multilateral regional mechanisms, which demonstrates the common aspiration and strong consensus for Belt and Road cooperation in the international community.
As the world enters a new period of turbulence and transformation, more and more people realized why we need the BRI in today's world. BRI advocates the approach of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, instead of supremacy. BRI advances connectivity, instead of decoupling and division. BRI pursues win-win cooperation, instead of antagonism and confrontation. China stands ready to work with all countries to deepen international Belt and Road cooperation, build more ""belts of development"" and ""roads to happiness"" to deliver benefit for all countries and contribute more to realizing global modernization featuring peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and prosperity for all.
Reuters: On January 24, Boeing delivered its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 to China Southern Airlines in Seattle since March 2019. Why would China resume deliveries when the safety of Boeing aircraft is under strict scrutiny?
Wang Wenbin: On questions about specific business activities, I'd refer you to relevant companies. What I can share with you is that on December 8, 2023, China's competent authorities completed the design approval of Boeing 737 Max 8 in accordance with China Civil Aviation Regulations, and the aircraft was deemed ready for delivery.
Beijing Daily: China National Intellectual Property Administration said recently, by the end of 2023, China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) owned 4.015 million domestic invention patents, making itself one of the world's leading countries in the area of IP. How do you see the impact of China's achievements in innovation and IPR protection on the world?
Wang Wenbin: The number of invention patents is an important indicator to measure a country's scientific and technological development and economic growth. In 1985, China officially implemented its first Patent Law. It used to take 31 years for China to have 1 million domestic invention patents in force, but now it only takes one year and a half to have another one. China has become the first country in the world with more than 4 million domestic invention patents in force, whose impetus for innovation and vitality for development continue to thrive and upgrade.
According to the Global Innovation Index 2023 issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization last year, China ranked 12th, becoming the world's highest ranking middle-income economy, and outnumbered all other countries for the first time in terms of its ownership of the top 100 science and technology clusters worldwide. This reflects that the international community has spoken highly of China's innovation capability.
By stepping up IPR protection, China has brought new opportunities to expand mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries. In recent years, China has continued to improve the mechanisms for international IP cooperation, and established cooperative relations on IP with more than 80 countries and regions and international organizations. We have actively responded to and addressed the concerns and demands on IP of foreign companies, strictly protected their IPR in accordance with the law, and stayed committed to building a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment. Foreign companies have become more and more satisfied with China's IPR protection, and an increasing number of foreign companies have come to invest and operate in China to share the dividends of China's development and its supersize market.
With enhanced sci-tech innovation capability, China has provided new driving forces for green and sustainable development in the world. China has fully leveraged the role of patent in promoting sci-tech innovation and the development of new industries and new arenas to boost the rapid development of green and low-carbon industries represented by electric vehicles, lithium batteries and solar cells. Key Chinese companies with top ten sales of new energy vehicles own over 100,000 international patents in force and the number is on a trajectory of rapid growth. China is also among the leading countries in terms of the growth rate of international patent applications for solid-state batteries and the number of international patent applications for solar cells. These have effectively boosted the development of global green and low-carbon technologies and industries of the future.
China's achievements in IP development have become a distinct manifestation of its high-quality development and Chinese modernization. Going forward, we are confident that China's potential of innovation-driven development will be further unleashed, which will lay the basis for and empower the advancement of high-quality development and the building of a new development paradigm, and make greater contribution to the innovation-driven development of the world.
CCTV: According to reports, the UNRWA stated yesterday that its training center was hit by two tank rounds in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Nine were killed and 75 were injured. What's China's comment?
Wang Wenbin: China was shocked by another attack on the UN facility in Gaza and we are saddened by the civilian casualties caused by the attack. We condemn all acts against civilians and oppose all moves that violate international law. The safety of UN facilities must be protected. The use of force does not bring true security and ceasefire is the overriding priority. China urges parties to the conflict to earnestly implement relevant resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, realize a comprehensive ceasefire at once and prevent an even worse humanitarian disaster from happening.
Yonhap News Agency: It's reported that on January 24 the DPRK test-fired a new strategic cruise missile for the first time. Did China know about the DPRK's test-firing plan in advance? What is China's view on the continued tensions on the Peninsula?
Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant report. China hopes that all parties stick to the direction of political settlement, resolve each side's legitimate concerns in a balanced way through meaningful dialogue and work for an early realization of peace and security on the Peninsula.
CCTV: China and Singapore signed a visa mutual exemption agreement just now. Do you have any comment?
Wang Wenbin: China attaches great importance to people-to-people exchanges with Singapore. With the concerted efforts of both sides, the two sides officially signed the Agreement Between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Singapore on the Mutual Exemption of Visa Requirements for Holders of Ordinary Passports in Beijing today. The agreement will enter into force on February 9. From then on, holders of ordinary passports from the two countries can enter the other country and stay for no longer than 30 days without visas.
The entry into force of the agreement before the Chinese New Year of the Dragon is a new year gift for the peoples of the two countries. It will further enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and Singapore and promote the steady progress of bilateral relations and cooperation in various areas.
Reuters: Tesla CEO Elon Musk said yesterday that Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world and they will have significant success outside of China, depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. If there are not trade barriers established, they would demolish most car companies in the world. What is China's comment on this?
Wang Wenbin: I haven't seen relevant reports. I would like to stress that all parties need to safeguard the fair, just, open and non-discriminatory business environment and observe market economy principles and WTO rules.
Dragon TV: The Zheng Lvcheng music festival is held every year in Gwangju where Zheng Lvcheng, one of the most excellent composers in China's modern history, was born. We noted recent reports that the festival will be slashed even canceled this year. The exhibition hall and memorial park for Zheng Lvcheng that are in the pipeline may be renamed without citing his name. His large portrait on the wall of the Elementary School where he attended may also be demolished. What's your comment?
Wang Wenbin: Mr. Zheng Lvcheng is a respectable and famous musician. Born in Gwangju in the southern Korean peninsula, he fought for the March 1st Movement in China in his early years, later worked and lived in DPRK and China, and became a naturalized Chinese citizen. For years, relevant localities in ROK have built spontaneously facilities in commemoration of him and held some cultural activities related to him, boosting China-ROK friendship. I want to stress that when commenting on famous domestic and international figures that have something to do with its country's history, the government should respect facts and take an objective and just position. There is no need to get ideological on such things. For any country, relations and people-to-people friendship with other countries should not be affected by its domestic political disputes.
Reuters: Japanese business leaders visited China and met with Premier Li Qiang this week. According to Japanese media reports, one of their concerns is on China's Counterespionage Law and the detention of Japanese nationals accused of engaging in espionage activities. Will China take measures to ensure the lawful rights and interests of the Japanese business community in China are protected?
Wang Wenbin: First, to answer your question about the Counterespionage Law: according to the principle of sovereignty, every country has the right to safeguard national security through domestic legislation, which is a universal practice. All the law enforcement and judicial activities of China are carried out based on facts and the law. Companies that conduct lawful operation have nothing to worry about. We welcome companies from all countries, including Japanese companies, to seize China's development opportunities and share in China's development dividends, so as to realize greater development.
You mentioned the visit to China by the delegation of Japan's economic sector. I would like to share with you more about the visit.
This morning, Premier of the State Council Li Qiang met with the delegation of Japan's economic sector led by Chairman of the Japan Business Federation Tokura Masakazu, Chairman of the Japan-China Economic Association Shindo Kosei and Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi Ken at the Great Hall of the People. Over 200 leaders of Japan's major companies attended the meeting.
Premier Li Qiang stated that the China-Japan relations are at an important juncture of taking stock of the past and envisioning the future. In November last year, President Xi Jinping met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in San Francisco and the two leaders reached important common understandings, providing important strategic guidance for the growth of China-Japan relations. All sectors in China and Japan need to work together to revisit our original aspiration of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries, adhere to the right direction of peace, friendship and cooperation and implement the political consensus that they should be cooperative partners rather than threats to each other, so as to bring the China-Japan relations back to the track of sound development. China hopes that Japan can properly handle historical, Taiwan-related and other issues of principle.
Premier Li Qiang pointed out that the two countries' economy are deeply connected. Economic and trade cooperation are playing an important role in our bilateral relations as an anchor and propeller. China stands ready to work with Japan to tap on our potentials for cooperation, continue to share development opportunities, support companies from our two countries to enhance cooperation in such areas as technological innovation, digital economy, green development, healthcare and elderly care and together keep industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded for higher-level complementarity and mutual benefit. We hope that the economic sector in Japan will play a positive role in advancing win-win cooperation between China and Japan. China is committed to its fundamental national policy of opening up and will continue to foster a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment. We welcome companies from Japan and other countries to continue to invest in China and hope that Japan will do better in providing an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies in Japan.
Heads of the three groups from Japan's economic sector stated that Japan and China are each other's important neighbor. They hope that the two countries will return to their original aspiration of friendship, enhance close exchanges between all sectors and at all levels, and build a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship based on common strategic interests. China is a major engine driving global economic growth. The Japanese economic sector is deeply encouraged by China's sound and steady economic growth and would like to work with China to enhance cooperation in trade, environmental protection, the green economy, healthcare, rehabilitation and other areas, promote cross-border travel, advance regional economic cooperation and make positive contribution to the growth of Japan-China relations and peace and prosperity in Asia and beyond.
Bloomberg: You said that the Japanese side should work harder. What aspect they should work hard on? Can you tell us?
Wang Wenbin: I just briefed you on the meeting between Premier Li Qiang and the Japanese delegation from the economic sector. I would like to reiterate that the various sectors in China and Japan need to work together to revisit our original aspiration of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries, adhere to the right direction of peace, friendship and cooperation and implement the political consensus that they should be cooperative partners rather than threats to each other. We also hope that Japan can properly handle historical, Taiwan-related and other issues of principle.â
Reuters: The US Navy destroyer USS John Finn transited through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday. What is the Foreign Ministry's comment on this?
Wang Wenbin: On the US destroyer USS John Finn's transit through the Taiwan Strait, the Spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command has issued a statement on China's position.
I would like to stress that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and China remains unwavering in our determination to defend the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. China noted that after the elections in the Taiwan region, we have seen negative statements and actions from the US side, which sent wrong messages to ""Taiwan independence"" forces. What the US did violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, and contravenes the commitments repeatedly reiterated by US leaders of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"", not supporting ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"", and not seeking to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China. The US needs to stay committed to the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, immediately stop infringement and provocative moves, stop creating troubles undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and stop sending any wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces."

CAIRO (Sputnik) - The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, when the Israel-Hamas conflict escalated, has increased to 25,105, while more than 62,600 others have been injured, the enclave's health ministry said on Sunday.
Some 178 people were killed and 293 injured in Gaza over the past 24 hours, the ministry added.
""The number of victims of the Israeli aggression since October 7 last year has risen to 25,105, while 62,681 people have been injured,"" the ministry said.
On October 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages.
On November 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on December 1.

The Agreement between Ukraine and the United Kingdom on Security Co-operation paves the way for signing similar documents with other allies. This was stated by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine.
""Of course, this agreement has set a certain trend, a level, and I think this is the level that everyone will try to stick to,"" he emphasized.
The Head of the Office of the President noted that the mandatory clauses that should be included in bilateral security agreements are contained in the Vilnius Joint Declaration of the G7 countries, which was based on the draft Kyiv Security Compact drawn up by an international expert group under the joint leadership of Andriy Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
""These clauses have already been further elaborated in the agreement with the UK. Of course, it is absolutely crucial for us that this agreement will remain in force until we join NATO. It includes provisions on joint arms production, specifics of financial support, information security, sanctions, and intelligence cooperation. Not just military support. That is, in my opinion, all the factual points that the G7 Vilnius Declaration contained and that have now been further elaborated in the agreement with the UK will be used with other countries as well,"" explained Andriy Yermak.
He also said that Ukraine had already begun consultations with the U.S. side on a bilateral security agreement.
""America remains our key partner and ally. That is why I believe that the agreement with the United States will have even more (clauses - Ed.). I think it will be even more special. We are working on it,"" the Head of the Presidential Office added.
Andriy Yermak also emphasized that Ukraine today enjoys the full support of both parties in the U.S. Congress, so the domestic political situation in the United States does not affect the drafting of the security agreement.
""I met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives in Washington. Then we had meetings together with President Zelenskyy. We came back with positive feelings. We have no impression that the United States' support for Ukraine has changed in any way,"" he said.
Andriy Yermak noted that, despite the U.S. presidential election, support for Ukraine remains at a very high level."

The Foreign Minister says Iranian military advisors will continue their anti-terror mission in the region in defiance of Israel's ""cowardly"" assassination operations.
""Iran's military advisers will strongly continue activities to fight terrorism and ensure regional security,"" Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in an X post on Saturday, after five members of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) were martyred in an Israeli strike in Syria.
The top Iranian diplomat paid tribute to the martyrs and wished the bereaved families peace and patience.
""The Israeli regime is the main accomplice to terrorist currents and enemy number one of regional security,"" Amir-Abdollahian noted.
""Undoubtedly, the Zionists' defeat against the will of the people of Gaza cannot be compensated by such cowardly terrorist acts.""
The IRGC advisors were assassinated in an Israeli airstrike on a residential building in the tightly guarded Mezzeh neighborhood, west of the Syrian capital Damascus.
Iran's President Ebrahim Raeisi said Israel's terrorist act is an indicative of the regime's failure to achieve its malicious goals and the depth of its frustration with the fighters of the resistance front, warning that the targeted killing will not go unanswered.
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kan'ani also said the Islamic Republic reserves the right to respond to the organized terrorism of the occupying entity at an appropriate time and place.
Iran has maintained an advisory mission in Syria at the request of Damascus with the aim of helping the war-torn country vanquish the foreign-backed militants, who have been fighting against the Syrian government since 2011.
Iran's advisory assistance helped Syria defeat Daesh and win back control of almost all regions from terrorists.
The Tel Aviv regime has ramped up its airstrikes on Syria since early October, when the regime launched the ongoing genocidal war on the besieged Gaza Strip.
More than 100 days into the brutal aggression, Israel has failed to achieve its objectives of ""destroying"" the Hamas resistance movement and finding Israeli captives in Gaza despite killing almost 25,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring over 62,300 others."

Depending on what kinds of weapons technology Moscow transfers to Pyongyang, the United States and South Korea may need to update their measures for dealing with North Korean threats, said analysts.
John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesman, said the U.S. is watching ""very closely"" as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pursues advanced military capabilities from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Kirby said at a press briefing on Tuesday that Kim's ability to benefit from this relationship is concerning, but the U.S. and South Korean defensive posture on the Korean Peninsula ""is appropriate to the risk.""
Since July, when Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea, Pyongyang has been deepening its military ties with Moscow while escalating threats on the peninsula and calling for preparations to occupy South Korea if war breaks out.
North Korea fired cruise missiles into the waters off its western coast on Wednesday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. It also began taking down a monument in Pyongyang symbolizing reunification with South Korea.
Putin and North Korean Ambassador Choe Son Hui discussed bilateral relations in Moscow on January 16, according to Tass, the Russian state-owned news agency. It quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov the next day saying Moscow and Pyongyang ""intend to boost relations in all areas, including sensitive ones.""
The most worrisome technology North Korea could seek from Russia would enable Pyongyang to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit into a ballistic missile cone, survive reentry and hit targets in South Korea, Japan and North America, said Robert Peters, a fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation.
""This technology is the last and the most critical step in North Korea fielding a credible nuclear strike capability and is well within Russia's ability to share,"" Peters told VOA via email.
He continued, ""South Korea and the United States should prepare to face a North Korea that is technically more capable than it has been before.""
At an event in Washington hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on January 18, Pranay Vaddi, the National Security Council's senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, warned that the North Korean threat ""could drastically change over the coming decade"" as a result of military cooperation with Moscow.
""What we are seeing between Russia and North Korea is an unprecedented level of cooperation in the military sphere,"" Vaddi said.
Last year, Putin turned to North Korea to replenish Russia's weapons stockpile, which has been drawn down severely since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He met with Kim in Russia in September to discuss possible arms dealings.
In October, Washington released satellite photos showing North Korea shipping more than 1,000 containers of weapons to Russia in violation of sanctions.
Artillery and missiles North Korea provided to Russia have been turning up in Ukraine, The New York Times reported on Monday.
John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said Russian technology transfers ""would not so much change the threat as add to the atmosphere of tension on the peninsula.""
But he told VOA via email, ""It will be important to keep defense and deterrence arrangements updated.""
In November, the U.S. and South Korea held an annual Security Consultative Meeting in Seoul, where they announced the revision of the 2013 Tailored Deterrence Strategy ""in recognition of the changing security environment.
Their meeting followed a summit that U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held in April in Washington, where they announced the Washington Declaration aimed at strengthening nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.
Gary Samore, White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said in a telephone interview that weapons technology Pyongyang could obtain from Moscow could embolden it to raise threats but would not be a game changer requiring the revision of ""fundamental deterrence"" on the Korean Peninsula.
Samore, a professor at Brandeis University, thinks Pyongyang could seek enhanced technology to include surface-to-air missiles, spy satellite collection capabilities and advanced military fighter aircraft.
He told VOA that although Moscow would be ""happy whenever there is trouble for the U.S.,"" it would not encourage Pyongyang to cause conflict on the Korean Peninsula that would ""jeopardize the flow of weapons to Russia"" for its war in Ukraine."

The United States, Britain and Australia imposed a fifth round of sanctions against Hamas on Monday, targeting the militants' financial exchanges in Gaza and money being sent there by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
In announcing the sanctions, U.S. Treasury official Brian Nelson said, ""Hamas has sought to leverage a variety of financial transfer mechanisms, including the exploitation of cryptocurrency, to channel funds to support the group's terrorist activities. Treasury, in close coordination with our allies and partners, will continue to leverage our authorities to target Hamas, its financiers and its international financial infrastructure.""
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said, ""These sanctions send a clear message to Hamas [that] the [United Kingdom] and our partners are committed to ensuring there is no hiding place for those financing terrorist activities. To reach a sustainable cease-fire in Gaza, Hamas can no longer be in power and able to threaten Israel.""
The U.S. said the sanctions target key financial officials in Gaza who have handled millions of dollars in Iranian transfers to Hamas in recent years.
The newest sanctions follow earlier ones imposed in the weeks after the shock October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza that Hamas health officials say has killed more than 25,000 people.
In a statement, Treasury said, ""Since at least 2020, Hamas has also used cryptocurrency to transfer some funding in support of operational costs in the West Bank as a means of mitigating the risks of physically moving cash, circumventing border crossings, and evading monitoring by authorities.""
The sanctions freeze any assets the Hamas entities hold in the U.S. and blocks Americans from doing any business with them."

Interview  Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State  Lagos, Nigeria  January 24, 2024  Via Translation
QUESTION:  Four countries in four days.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary of State, for taking the time to talk to us during your visit.  Let's start with Nigeria.  Despite its economic dynamism and President Tinubu's promise to double the GDP within eight years, the country is ranked as the fifth most violent country in the world by the ACLED group, which you must be aware of.  How does the Biden administration propose to help the country improve its security situation and achieve its economic potential?
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  You know, there's an approach, a partnership that needs to be comprehensive.  Obviously, there is support through programs to strengthen Nigerians' capacity to address security challenges, whether it's in terms of intelligence, equipment, or training.  All of that is very important.  We're trying to do this in greater depth, but at the same time, there needs to be an approach that takes everything into account.  For example - and by the way, we were, for example, in CÃ´te d'Ivoire just before coming to Nigeria, and we saw that an approach that takes into account the needs of the community, that tries to create a more positive relationship between security forces and the community in question, also has a very important impact on controlling extremism, terrorism, and crime efficiently.  So that is important.
And it's also necessary to try to address the root causes that essentially take choices away from people, which leads them to choose crime, terrorism, extremism.  Hence everything we do not only in terms of aid and assistance but especially in terms of investments, creating economic partnerships, establishing economic infrastructure that can create opportunities not only in major cities but throughout the country.
All of this is a process.  It takes time, it doesn't happen immediately, but it starts with a comprehensive vision of how to tackle the problems - yes, at the security level, but also in a more expansive, comprehensive way.
QUESTION:  You talked about the need to engage with the putschist regimes in the Sahel, including in Niger.  With Mali and Burkina Faso, this country has formed a defensive pact, as you are well aware, the Alliance of Sahel States.  Is this potentially a legitimate regional grouping, or is it too close to Russia?  And more generally, how do you avoid a new fragmentation of Africa that could resemble the Cold War with its blocs?
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Obviously, we are very concerned about the developments we have seen in Mali, in Burkina Faso, and more recently in Niger.  There is a timeline for a return to civilian governance for the first two, which is very important to us, and which I believe is crucial for the countries in the region as well.  So, that's what we want to see.  In Niger - by the way, I was in Niger with President Bazoum before the coup, a month before, a few weeks before, and already it was a positive example of what we could do together to address both security and economic challenges, and others as well.  In this regard, the role of ECOWAS is mainly to try to convince the putschists to return to constitutional order within a very clear and limited timeframe.  I believe that's essential.
There was a meeting with President Tinubu as the chairman of ECOWAS late last year, precisely to try to establish this process.  And for us, the United States, if Niger returns to the path of constitutional order and democracy, obviously, we are ready to lift sanctions.  We are ready to reinstate the programs we shared against terrorism, for security.  It all depends on the concrete steps the putschists take.  I have some hope that it can move in a better direction, but I don't see the evolution towards a new order or a new configuration of states.
We have seen something else in Mali, in Burkina Faso.  When they, and others, call on external forces like Wagner, for example, to try to address the security problem, what do we see?  We see that the problems become even more serious, more difficult - violence, extremism, terrorism in the states that have requested the help of Wagner.  It's increasing, not decreasing.  And obviously, the exploitation of resources, the exploitation of people.  We see that too.  So it's not the answer, and we know it.  It's not just because we say it; we know it from experience in these countries.  The answer is a return to constitutional order, to democracy, but also to governments that listen and respond to the needs of the people.
None of this is easy.  The problems, the challenges are very significant.  But we have now seen what happens when we make the other choice, and it doesn't go well, on the contrary, the situation only worsens, especially for the people in question.
QUESTION:  You are now traveling to Angola at the end of your trip.  The country remains ravaged by corruption.  Why is President Lourenco considered a more acceptable, and above all more reliable partner, compared to his predecessor Dos Santos?  And what is the current state of American relations with, after all, a former Cold War adversary?
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Actually, let me tell you this:  What we see with President Lourenco is someone who is actually fighting against corruption.  And we see that he has followed a very important path that both recognizes corruption as a poison for development and for creating opportunities, and takes very concrete steps to combat it.  At the same time, it is also necessary to create, I think, a more open system in order to truly address corruption.  For example, civil society has a very important role to play.  For that, there needs to be even more space for civil society, for the media, who also have a critical role to play in countering corruption, in shedding light on it, and in combating it.  But we see a very positive development in Angola, especially in this fight against corruption.
And we also have partnerships with Angola, with Zambia, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the very, very important Lobito Corridor infrastructure project which will bring a transportation and digital communication system to the people in these three countries and throughout the African continent, supporting a very important economic revolution.
Something that has been lacking in Africa and that is now emerging is having an internal market which would be as important, if not more important, than the external market.  The fact that African countries historically have more trade and investment with countries outside of Africa than among themselves is a missed opportunity.  Now, with a growing free-trade system in Africa, especially with the necessary infrastructure for it to work, we see a future where economic growth has much more significant possibilities.  And especially the connections we make between countries, with Angola playing a very important role in this corridor, I believe it holds a lot of promises for the future.
Something else with Angola:  President Lourenco has been playing a very important role in trying to manage crises through diplomacy, especially what is happening in eastern Congo and Rwanda, where the process established by Angola is very important to try to find a diplomatic way forward and not through war.  So all this to tell you that he is becoming an increasingly important partner.  President Lourenco came to the White House and met with President Biden last year, and President Biden asked me to follow up.  That's why we are visiting Angola.
QUESTION:  Very well, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you."

Holding a joint press conference with Iranian President Raisi, President ErdoÄan said: ""We attach importance to deepening our relations with Iran, our neighbor, on the basis of mutual trust and shared interests. We have reaffirmed this will during our meeting.""
President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and his Iranian counterpart Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi held a joint press conference following the 8th Meeting of the TÃ¼rkiye-Iran High-Level Cooperation Council and the signing ceremony of agreements at the Presidential Complex.
Condemning once again the terror attack that took place on January 3   in Kerman, which led to the postponement of President Raisi's visit to   TÃ¼rkiye scheduled for an earlier date, President ErdoÄan reiterated   TÃ¼rkiye's support for Iran in its fight against terror.
""We attach importance to deepening our relations with Iran, our   neighbor, on the basis of mutual trust and shared interests,"" the   President said and, noting that they have reiterated this will during   their meeting, expressed his belief that the decisions taken during the   council meeting are of importance not only for the two countries but   also for the stability and prosperity of the whole region.
""During today's meeting, we have discussed areas of concrete   cooperation as well as regional and international relations,   particularly Israel's attacks on Gaza and occupied Palestinian lands. We   exchanged views on the issues that are on our common agenda from the   fight against terror to energy, trade to education.

The head of Lithuania's diplomacy will meet with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and other officials.
""We see that 2024 can be a crucial year for the war in Ukraine. And to a large extent, it depends on us.

21 January 2024
Crucial to defend sailors, surface fleet and air threats, the Sea   Viper Air Defence system will be upgraded with updated missiles   featuring a new warhead and software update that will enable it to   defeat ballistic missile threats. The system will protect the UK's   Carrier Strike group and can track, target and destroy a variety of air   threats over 70 miles away.
Worth Â£405 million, the contracts will make Sea Viper the most   capable naval air defence system ever developed for the Royal Navy,   investing in vital capability used in recent weeks to protect one of the   world's busiest shipping lanes from multiple drone attacks.
The missile upgrades comprise three contracts awarded to MBDA UK,   including two to significantly enhance the Sea Viper capability on board   Type 45 warships, and a third to cover enhanced in-service support and   availability of the system for the next five years.
By further investing in our world-leading defence industry, the   contracts will also support the Prime Minister's priority to grow the   economy by sustaining 350 UK jobs, including highly skilled technology   roles in Stevenage, Cowes, Bristol & Bolton.
The work will include employees from MBDA across the UK, France and Italy working alongside colleagues from BAE Systems.
As the situation in the Middle East worsens, it is vital that we   adapt to keep the UK, our allies and partners safe. Sea Viper has been   at the forefront of this, being the Navy's weapon of choice in the first   shooting down of an aerial threat in more than 30 years.
Our strong and enduring relationship with   British industry has ensured we can deploy the latest technological   capabilities wherever they are required while supporting hundreds of   jobs across the country and bolstering UK prosperity.
The Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyers are among the most advanced in   the fleet and carry out a range of activity, including defence from air   attack, counter-piracy operations and providing humanitarian aid.
Defence Secretary Grant Shapps this week visited HMS Diamond in the   Red Sea, where it recently used Sea Viper missiles to shoot down   multiple attack drones, as part of the US-led international taskforce Operation Prosperity Guardian.
Alongside HMS Diamond, the taskforce currently includes three US   destroyers, and a French warship is also in the region. All are   currently operating in the Southern Red Sea with the multinational   partnership focusing on protecting freedom of navigation,   international trade and human life by countering illicit non-state   actors in international waters.
A cutting-edge weapon system, Sea Viper   continues to provide the Royal Navy with impressive lethality. Sea Viper   Evolution further enhances this capability against the more complex and   evolving threats and strengthens our cooperation and interoperability   with key partners.
The Sea Viper enhancements aim to deliver Ballistic Missile Defence   Capability to counter more complex threats, while providing an   opportunity for further upgrades and increased capability to be taken   forward into future systems.
The initial stage of the contract will upgrade the Royal Navy's   existing Aster 30 missiles to Aster 30 Block 1, which will enable   defence against anti-ship ballistic missile threats, and will see   modifications to the fleet's Multi-Function Radar (Sampson), Command and   Control system and Combat Management System.
The subsequent stage of the Sea Viper evolution will evaluate the   introduction of the new Aster 30 Block 1NT missile. Currently under   development with France and Italy, it features a new seeker that would   even further enhance the ballistic missile defence capabilities of   the UK's Type 45 destroyers.
In a rapidly changing defence environment, I'm   proud to see our teams work collaboratively with industry colleagues to   support highly-skilled jobs and ensure those operating the UK Type 45   fleet have the edge over their adversaries now and in the future.
These contracts will make Sea Viper the most capable naval air   defence system ever developed for the Royal Navy in our 60-year history   as the Navy's primary air defence system supplier.
They will also see the UK further enhance the   co-operation with France and Italy through MBDA by joining the Aster 30   Block 1 programme, giving the UK the ability to defeat anti-ship   ballistic missiles.
The enhancements to the fleet of Type 45 destroyers are expected to reach full operational capability by Autumn 2032."

The United Nations Security Council met Thursday in an emergency meeting at Russia's request, following the crash of a Russian military transport plane near the Russia-Ukraine border. Both sides are calling for an investigation.
U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo said the organization is not in a position to verify the circumstances around the crash.
""What is clear is that the incident took place in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ongoing war,"" she said. ""To avoid further escalation, we urge all concerned to refrain from actions, rhetoric or allegations that could further fuel the already dangerous conflict.""
Moscow has accused Kyiv of shooting down the plane, which crashed Wednesday in the Belgorod region. Russia said the plane was carrying 74 people, including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were to be part of a prisoner swap.
""The Ukrainian prisoners of war were transported to the Belgorod region in order to conduct yet another swap that was agreed between Moscow and Kyiv,"" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday in New York, where he was attending U.N. meetings. ""Instead of this, the Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike.""
Call for facts
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government was insisting on an international investigation to establish the facts.
Zelenskyy said Russia was ""playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war, the feelings of their relatives and the emotions of our society.""
At the Security Council, Ukraine's envoy repeated her government's call for an international investigation, saying that because the plane went down in Russian territory, Ukraine did not have access to it.
""Following the plane crash, the Federal Security Service and the Russian military did not allow emergency workers to inspect the crash site as per protocol,"" Deputy U.N. Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn said. ""According to our military intelligence, only five bodies were sent to the local morgue in Belgorod, and no human remains are visible on videos from the crash site.""
Russia's deputy envoy, Dmitry Polyanskiy, disputed that, calling it ""paranoid nonsense.""
Several council members warned against speculation and accusations without critical facts yet established.
Video of Wednesday's plane crash posted on social media showed a plane falling from the sky on its side before exploding into a massive fireball as it hit the ground in Russia's snowy, rural western Belgorod region.
Kharkiv borders Belgorod. The two sides have carried out numerous prisoner swaps since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago.
Nuclear concerns
Separately, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency briefed the council earlier Thursday on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine.
Rafael Grossi told reporters after the private meeting that he would be returning to Ukraine in the next 10 days and would then travel to Moscow.
The nuclear plant, which is in occupied Russian territory, recently lost external power for an eighth time. It has also frequently been in the crosshairs of fighting, leading to fears of a nuclear accident.
Asked by a reporter how dangerous the situation at Zaporizhzhia is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most dangerous, the IAEA chief said it varies.
""I think that there are days where you are near 10, and there are days that nothing seems to happen,"" Grossi said. ""The problem is this â the complete uncertainty, because this is a war.""

Monday, 22 January 2024 11:28 AM
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated a controversial temple that was built on the site of a historic mosque, demolished by Hindu extremists, heralding a ""new era"" for India.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said, speaking outside the temple to the Hindu deity Ram on Monday.
Modi has been accused of orchestrating the event for political gain ahead of the upcoming elections in the spring.
The opening ceremony was seen as an unofficial start to his re-election campaign this year, where he will seek a third term in power. The general election is expected to be held between April and May.
The inauguration of the temple, which came amid rising anti-Muslim hate crimes in India, has evoked blood-soaked memories of the violence that was sparked after the mosque that stood for centuries in Ayodhya was torn down in 1992 by Hindu far-right mobs incited by members of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Some 2,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in the violence.
Speaking to media, Mohammed Shahid, 52, recounted how his father was burned alive by a mob.
""For me, the temple symbolizes nothing but death and destruction,"" he told AFP last month.
Ever since it came to power in 2014, the BJP has been synonymous with its anti-Muslim stance as there have been recurring incidences, including mob lynching and hurting the sentiments of minority groups, especially of the Muslims of India.
Modi has been setting his sights on winning a third straight term by pleasing the Hindu majority in India.
Sunita Viswanath, executive director of the US-based nonprofit group Hindus for Human Rights, said the inauguration of the temple is an ""electoral stunt"" that ""should not be happening in the name of my faith."""

Resistance groups in Lebanon and Iraq have launched more attacks on the positions of Israeli and American forces in the region in response to the ongoing US-managed Israeli crimes against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah carried out new missile strike on Monday night targeting a gathering of Israeli soldiers in the vicinity of a settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories.
According to the Al-Mayadeen news network, Hezbollah announced a missile attack on the Even Menachem settlement. This is the second Hezbollah missile in about a week that hit the settlement where Israeli soldiers had gathered for a meeting.
There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or material damage from the latest Hezbollah attack that followed an Israeli bombing of a residential building at Majdal Salim, a village in southern Lebanon that according to the Lebanese media left one civilian dead and another injured.
The two sides have kept exchanging artillery fire and rockets since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza in early October. The Lebanese movement says attacks on Israel will stop only if the regime ends its onslaught on Palestinians.
With the launch of the Israeli war under the pretext of the Palestinians' ""Al-Aqsa Storm"" operation on October 7, Hezbollah has carried its anti-Israel operations almost on a daily basis to reduce the pressure on the Resistance in Gaza.
Anti-American sentiment
Meanwhile, Iraq's Islamic Resistance has targeted a US base in the Koniko natural gas field in Syria's eastern Deir ez-Zor province with missiles.
This base was targeted thrice on Monday, which the resistance group, said were in response to the US support for the Zionist regime's crimes in Gaza.
Since the onset of the Zionist regime's genocide in Gaza, resistance groups in the region, including, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen have been targeting Israeli and American facilities in a show of support for the oppressed Palestinians.
Iraq's Islamic Resistance has targeted US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria more than a hundred times over the past three months amid growing anti-American sentiment across the region.
Regional resistance groups, have time and again warned that their attacks on American bases will continue as long as Washington support the Zionist regime and its crimes in Palestine.

The   following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by   StÃ©phane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.
**Secretary-General's Travels
Good   afternoon.  You will all be delighted to know the Secretary-General is   back in New York.  He just landed a few hours ago.  And tomorrow, he   will be speaking at the monthly meeting of the Security Council on the   situation in the Middle East.
As you know, he was in Davos last   week, and from there he went to Uganda.  In Kampala, he met with leaders   of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 plus China.
His   messages to both groups focused on renewed international efforts for   peace; financing for sustainable development and climate action; and the   need for urgent reforms to our multilateral institutions.  He also   mentioned that the Security Council is stuck in a time warp, as it lacks   a single African permanent member.
On the situation in the Middle   East, the Secretary-General stressed that the refusal to accept the   two-State solution and the denial of the right to statehood to the   Palestinian people are unacceptable.  The right of the Palestinian   people to build their own State must be recognized by all, he said.
He   also added that he will not give up on calling for an immediate   humanitarian ceasefire; hence, this is ""the only way to end this   nightmare for civilians in Gaza, to facilitate the release of all   hostages, and to prevent the conflict from engulfing an entire region.""
While   in Uganda, he also held a number of bilateral meetings on the sidelines   of both summits, including obviously with the President of the host   country of the summits, President [Yoweri] Museveni, and a number of   other officials.  He also had a press conference and we shared that   transcript with you.
**Occupied Palestinian Territory
Turning   to the situation in Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territory as a   whole:  Our colleagues in the Office for the Coordination of   Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) report that since 19 January, mobile phone   communications have been restored to most of Gaza after a weeklong   blackout, except for some services in the north.
However, the   Internet remains down across the whole of the Gaza strip.  The   telecommunications blackout, as you can imagine, restricts people in   Gaza from accessing lifesaving information and impedes other forms of   humanitarian response.
Since Friday, limited amounts of fuel have   entered the Gaza Strip from Rafah.  However, since these are   insufficient, hospitals, water facilities and other critical facilities   are still only operating at limited capacity.
Our humanitarian   partners tell us that ongoing hostilities â as well as lack of access to   health care, clean water and nutritious food â are fuelling the risk of   famine in Gaza.
They report that no bakeries are functioning   north of Wadi Gaza â and only 15 bakeries were operational across the   entire Gaza Strip as of 17 January â and those were in Rafah and Deir al   Balah.
The World Food Programme (WFP) has been supporting eight   of those bakeries with flour, salt, yeast and sugar.  Through this   initiative, about a quarter of a million people were able to purchase   bread at a subsidized price.
Meanwhile, the Director of the World   Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], reported   that cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in Gaza through test kits   supplied by WHO.
And turning to the West Bank:  As of yesterday,   more than 700 Palestinians â including more than 300 children â have   been displaced since 7 October, following the destruction of 115 homes   during operations carried out by Israeli forces.  This is in addition to   displacement due to the demolition of homes. About 95 per cent of the   displacement due to Israeli operations was reported in the refugee camps   of Jenin, Nur Shams and Tulkarm.
Israeli military operations last   week in the Nur Shams and Tulkarm refugee camps rendered more than 20   homes uninhabitable, and civilian casualties were also reported.  That   is according to our OCHA colleagues.
**Security Council
This morning, the Security Council held a meeting on threats to international peace and security.
Briefing   Council members, the Director and Deputy to the High-Representative for   Disarmament Affairs, and that is Adedeji Ebo â he noted that almost two   years have passed since the Russian Federation launched its full-scale   invasion of Ukraine, in violation of the Charter of the United   Nations. That represents twenty-three months of death, destruction, and   unbearable suffering and devastation.
Mr. Ebo reported that   reports related to the transfer and use of cluster munitions throughout   the conflict are very concerning. He emphasized that the   Secretary-General has repeatedly called for an immediate end to the use   of cluster munitions, and in line with his long-standing position, these   weapons must be rendered inoperable and consigned to the dustbins of   history.  Mr. Ebo stressed that the UN will continue to work towards a   just and lasting peace in Ukraine, in line with international law,   including the United Nations Charter and the relevant United Nations   General Assembly resolution.
**Ukraine
Some of you over the weekend have asked us for our response on the attack in Donetsk.
I   can tell you that the Secretary-General strongly condemns all attacks   against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including the shelling of   the city of Donetsk in Ukraine, which reportedly killed at least 25   people and injured more than 20 others.
Attacks against civilians   and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international   humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately.
**Afghanistan
A   couple of reports I want to flag to you.  One is from Afghanistan, from   the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).  They released an   update on the human rights situation in the country, covering October to   December [2023] and, as you can imagine, it is not good.
Our   colleagues in Kabul note that the de facto authorities continue to   enforce and promulgate restrictions on women's rights to work, education   and freedom of movement.
Instances of officials of the de facto   Department for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice   impeding women from working or accessing services because they were   unmarried or did not have a male escort were recorded by the UN.
According   to the update, in early December, the de facto officials from that   Department advised an unmarried female staff at a health-care facility   to get married or risk losing her job, stating that it was inappropriate   for an unmarried woman to work.
The update also noted that the de   facto authorities continue to implement corporal punishment in public   places, usually announcing the punishments, and the crimes for which   they were implemented, on social media.  The full update is available   online.
**Democratic Republic of the Congo
Our   colleagues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's UN Peacekeeping   Mission (MONUSCO) continue to work in close partnership with the   Congolese armed forces in South Kivu to contribute to building the   capacity of their units and support the protection of civilians.
Peacekeepers   carried out joint operations in the Minembwe region, in response to   armed group activity.  These operations also led to the release of two   child soldiers and the handing over of weapons.
**International Organization for Migration
Our   colleagues in Geneva at the International Organization for Migration   (IOM) today launched their Global Annual Appeal for 2024 and, as you can   imagine, it is large.
They called for $7.9 billion to support   their operations and help create a system that realizes migration's   promise as a force for good throughout the world.
The appeal seeks   funding to save lives and protect people on the move, drive solutions   to displacement, and facilitate safe pathways for regular migration.    Full funding would allow IOM to serve almost 140 million human beings,   including internally displaced people and the local communities that   host them.  Crucially, it would also allow for an expansion of IOM's   development work, which helps prevent further displacement.
**Resident Coordinators
Two   new Resident Coordinators to announce.  They have been appointed by the   Secretary-General, and they took up their posts just yesterday,   following the agreement by the host Governments.
The first is Mohamed Yahya of Somalia, who will be the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Pakistan.  And second, our dear friend Nahla Valji of Canada, who is now the Resident Coordinator in Eritrea, and we congratulate her for that appointment.
Both   will lead the work of our UN teams on the ground boosting their   countries' commitments to advance the Sustainable Development Goals   (SDGs) and leave no one behind.
They will both also serve as the Humanitarian Coordinators in their respective countries.
**Honour Roll
Lastly   before lunch.  Food quiz.  Karjalan Paisti, Palusami and Bouneschlupp   are the national dishes of which three Member States?
I'll give   you a hint.  Bouneschlupp is a traditional green bean soup with   potatoes, bacon, and onions.  Palusami includes coconut milk and taro   leaves.  And Karjalan Paisti is a mixture of beef, pork and lamb stew,   seasoned with peppercorn and allspice.
Who do we say bon appÃ©tit and thank you to?
Bouneschlupp   is a traditional soup of Luxembourg.  So we say thank you.  Palusami is   the national dish of Kiribati.  And Karjalan Paisti is the national   dish of Finland.
We say bon appÃ©tit and thank you to all.
**Questions and Answers
Spokesman:  Maggie, go ahead.  You start to eat.
Question:  Let me kick this off.
Spokesman:  Yes.
Question:    Alright.  I saw the Secretary-General's remarks over the weekend in   Kampala on Gaza and the two-State solution.  But I would like to ask,   President [Joseph] Biden said on Friday that there are multiple kinds of   two-State solutions.  And he gave us an example, a State without an   army, for instance.  Does the Secretary-General believe there's a single   one... a two-State solution, or does he believe there are other ways to   get to a two-State solution?
Spokesman:  Well, they are   different.  The goal is to get to a two-State solution.  Two States   where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace and   security. Obviously, a lot of the details will have to be negotiated by   the parties, and that's why we've also been calling for a long, long   time for those talks to happen.  Edith?
Question:  A couple of questions, Steph.  First, can you give us an update on Sigrid Kaag's whereabouts and what she's doing?
Spokesman:    With pleasure.  She is in Israel.  Yesterday, she concluded productive   discussions with a number of senior Israeli Government officials,   including President [Isaac] Herzog.  She also met with the Defence   Minister, Mr. [Yoav] Gallant, with the Foreign Minister, Mr. [Israel]   Katz, the Minister of Strategic Affairs, Mr. [Ron] Dermer, and the Head   of the National Security Council, Mr. [Tzachhi] Hanegbi, as well as the   Head of COGAT, which is the liaison mechanism between the IDF (Israeli   Defence Force) and our interlocutor with the UN, and that is Major   General [Ghassan] Alian.  She also, while in Israel, visited Kibbutz   Kfar Aza, which was one of the kibbutzim that was hit during the Hamas   attack on 7 October, and she met with family members of people who   continue to be held hostage in Gaza.  Today, she was in Ramallah.  She   met with the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority and the head of   the Palestinian Red Crescent today.  And that's further to her meetings   with the Egyptian Red Crescent recently.
Question:  And   are we going to get any kind of readouts from those meetings, or is   anybody going to get even in the region going to get a chance to talk to   her?
Spokesman:  She will...  I'm not going to give you a   detailed readout because her work is ongoing.  We do expect Ms. Kaag to   be here at the end of 30 January, when she reports back to the   [Security] Council, and I'm sure there'll be an opportunity to talk to   you.  Obviously, since she's deployed in the region, there have been   moments of press interactions, and those will continue as they occur.
Question:    And a question on the Taliban's latest actions.  What is the   Secretary-General's reaction to the Taliban's latest ban on unmarried   women and women who are not accompanied by a male guardian to doing   anything, working?
Spokesman:  Horror.  Right? I mean, it's   difficult enough to read this out from here.  It must be unimaginable   to have to live through it.  Dezhi?
Question:  Okay.    First, a quick question on the schedule of the Secretary-General.  Will   the Secretary-General meet with the Foreign Minister of Russia?
Spokesman:  Yes.
Question:  What are they going to discuss?
Spokesman:  You pick.  There's lots to discuss.
Question:  Okay.  So my question here about the hostages kept in Gaza.  On 21st,   yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister, [Benjamin] Netanyahu, said they   won't stop the war.  They have to get the victory, to eliminate Hamas,   to ensure that all the hostages could go home.  We know that the   Secretary-General said those hostages must be released   unconditionally. Do you think to, how to say that, to completely   eliminate Hamas, which means to achieve the victory of the war, is the   way to release those hostages?
Spokesman:  We are not defence advisers to the Israeli...
Question:  But is that helpful?
Spokesman:    Let me...  to the Israeli Government or any other party involved in this   conflict.  I think the Secretary-General has been very clear in what   he's been advocating for, which is a humanitarian ceasefire.  In the   last time there was a pause, hostages were released. He's also been very   strong in advocating for an immediate and unconditional release of all   the hostages that are currently detained in Gaza.  He has said so   publicly.  He said so when he's met numerous times with families of the   hostages, and he met with two people who had been held hostage.  So his   position is clear.  You can do the compare and contrast with what others   are saying.
Question:  So how does the Secretary-General   feel, his two calls, one for immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the other   one for unconditional release of the hostages?  Both cannot be   fulfilled or achieved by both parties.
Spokesman:  He's continuing in his determination to call for those two things.
Question:  Okay.  Sorry.
Spokesman:  Go ahead.
Question:    One last part of this question about the spill-over.  The last weekend,   there's a strike in Damascus which led to the death of, I believe, 10   people, among them, five Iranian advisers, military advisers.  Does the   Secretary-General have anything to say on this?
Spokesman:    Yeah, I mean, it's yet another demonstration of the risk of the   spill-over.  He's very concerned about these air strikes, the reported   air strikes that took place in Damascus.  According to what Iran has   been saying publicly, they resulted in number of casualties among the   Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran.  They also hit a residential   area where, in fact, UN premises are located.  I mean, we're very happy   that all our staff is accounted for.  But there are also... we are   concerned and deplore the civilian casualties that did occur nearby.    Again, he calls on all to exercise the maximum possible restraint and   reminding all the parties of their obligations under international law,   including international humanitarian law, and to all to avoid attacks   that could lead to civilian casualties.  Dennis?
Question:  Is there a report that UN opened Russian bank account that was reported by Sovkombank.  Can you provide your comment on that?
Spokesman:    Yeah.  I saw... I think I received a question from one of your   colleagues.  If I'm not mistaken, that refers to something for a UN   Environmental Programme (UNEP) facility.  I will give you the contacts   at UNEP.  I have no information on it from here, but you should contact   our colleagues at UNEP. Okay.  Gabriel?
Question:  Thanks, Steph.  Any update on the UN helicopter crew in Somalia?
Spokesman:  Nothing to share with you.
Question:    Okay.  And following up on Edie's question about Ms. Kaag, she's been   on the job a little over three weeks now, almost four, if I'm not   mistaken.  She's been to Gaza once.  Is that your understanding as   well?  Is that correct?
Spokesman:  That is factual.
Question:  And do you have any update about plans for her to go back into Gaza, efforts to get into Gaza, anything along those lines?
Spokesman:    I can assure you that as soon as there's movement in that direction,   you will be the second to know after me.  Linda, then Mike.
Question:    Thank you, Steph.  Just going back to the SG's meeting with [Sergey]   Lavrov.  Are there any details?  Will that be tomorrow?  And also who   else will he be meeting in terms of world leadership here?
Spokesman:    He will be meeting with a number of the foreign... there are a number of   foreign ministers who are coming tomorrow.  Off the top of my head I   know he will also be meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister.  He will   be meeting with the French Foreign Minister.  He will be meeting with   the Algerian Foreign Minister.  I will and I ask for the indulgence of   those Member States who are not on the top of my head, but we will share   with you his schedule for tomorrow later this afternoon. Mike?
Question:    A follow-up on Ms. Besheer's question earlier.  The Secretary-General   has said many, many times in terms of a two-State solution, Israel's   legitimate security need to be taken into account.
Spokesman:  That's correct.
Question:    He's never delineated what exactly that means.  So going forward,   according to the Biden plan, that whatever it might be the vision for a   two-State solution, demilitarized, militarized, whatever. What is he   talking about when he says legitimate security concerns?
Spokesman:    I think every country, ever Member State has a right to feel safe and   to address its legitimate security concerns.  Those are issues that are   going to have to be negotiated between the parties.  The   Secretary-General is not one to impose a solution.  But we all know the   concerns of all the parties involved.  A circle will have to be squared   at some point to get to a two-State solution.
Question:  So   the comments he made over the weekend in terms of a refusal to   recognize Palestinian statehood to be unacceptable.  We're three months   past 7 October, hostages still in Gaza.  Forget Netanyahu specifically, I   mean, any Israeli leader â what would he expect them to accept?  Would   he expect them to wrap their arms around a two-State solution at a time   like this?
Spokesman:  Well, I think what the   Secretary-General has said a number of times during interviews is that   this is a human crisis of huge proportions, right, for human beings.    And we need, out of this crisis, to find the opportunities to move   forward to peace.  And for him, it is to... the end needs to be a   two-State solution.  Alan, and I'll get to you, sir.
Question:    Thanks so much, StÃ©phane.  Foreign Minister Lavrov during his speech   reiterated that he asked the SG several times to provide the list of the   victims of Bucha provocation, but still he didn't manage to get it.  Do   you have any signals, any signs from Ukrainian part?  Are they ready to   provide it finally?
Spokesman:  I have nothing on that for now.  Yes, sir?
Question:  Yeah.  Thank you. This is Lovlu Ansar from Bangladesh Pratidin.
Spokesman:  Yes, sir.
Question:    I have two questions, one in Gaza, another on Bangladesh.  United   Nations and USA's request ignored by Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu,   to a ceasefire in Gaza, even for humanitarian reasons.  Were there any   discussions regarding this issue at the meeting of the Security Council   this morning?
Spokesman:  You would have to... the Security   Council meeting this morning was open and transparent.  You will have to   do your reporting.  It's not for me to tell you what was discussed in   an open meeting with the Security Council.  Your second question?
Question:    Yeah.  You are aware that Bangladesh is hosting more than 1.2 million   Rohingya refugees since 2017, almost seven years.  Lack of progress in   repatriation is leading to infestation, and they are increasingly   getting involved in criminal activities.  Other hand, humanitarian   funding, international...
Spokesman:  What is your question, sir?
Question:  Yeah.  Humanitarian attention, everything is shrinking.
Spokesman:  No.  So what is the...  I enjoy your description, but what is the question?
Question:  Yeah.  What is the plan of the United Nations Secretary-General to address these challenges to repatriate these Rohingyas?
Spokesman:    Well, first of all, no one should ever be repatriated.  No refugee   should be repatriated against their will. It needs to be done   voluntarily in a manner that preserves their dignity and their safety.    It is clear for us that the situation in Myanmar currently does not meet   the necessary requirements.  What we do need is increased global   solidarity for those communities that are hosting generously Rohingya   refugees, like the community in Cox's Bazar, which the Secretary-General   has visited, because the refugees need our solidarity and the host   communities need our solidarity and we need increased funding for all of   that.
Question:  Thank you.
Spokesman:  Okay.  Yes, sir?
Question:    Thank you for the briefing.  So, my name is Yu from Kyodo News.  My   question is about the Nuclear Ban Treaty, Treaty on the Prohibition of   Nuclear Weapons. So three years ago, today, the treaty entered into   force.  Could you give me a comment?
Spokesman:  That it   entered into force when?  Well, I mean, the Secretary-General's, I   think, position and calls for complete nuclear disarmament have been   very clear, and they will continue to do that.  Yes, sir? I'll come back   to you the second round. Yes, go ahead.
Question:  Thank   you, StÃ©phane.  I'm Jaehong Lee from Yonhap News of Republic of Korea.    This morning in our joint statement [inaudible] 46 States or nations   urged Russia and DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) to abide   by the Security Council resolution relating to Russia's use of ballistic   missiles from DPRK.  So I'm wondering if Secretary-General has a   comment on this.
Spokesman:  The Secretary-General, his   position is pretty clear.  He urges all Member States to abide by   Security Council resolutions.  Yes, sir?
Question:  Yeah,   multiple reports indicating that US and many European countries are   pushing for aids through Israel, through Ashdod Airport.  Is the UN part   of this process?  Are you...?
Spokesman:  Well, we are part   of, in a sense, we are part of the process to advocate for the use of   Ashdod port to bring in more aid.  We think it would make sense   financially and logistically for us to be allowed to use that port.  And   that is something we've been advocating for.
Question:  I   believe you touched on this briefly when you started talking about the   aid to Gaza.  Can you update us on the aids that goes to Gaza from UNRWA   (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) and the UN agencies?  How is   the status?  How much have you been able to send to Gaza if possible?
Spokesman:    I mean, the short answer to your question is not enough.  Right?  But   I'll give you just a little bit of granularity.  Over the weekend, we   had about 325 truckloads of foods, medicine, and other supplies that   entered Gaza through Rafah and Kerem Shalom.  About 174 on Saturday, and   151 on Sunday, which â all of that â is very much a drop in the bucket.
Question:    I know you're not satisfied, but specifically regarding Kerem Shalom,   are you seeing, like, the flowing of aids getting better the same level   or worse?
Spokesman:  Not particularly getting better.  Let's go...  Mike, I'll come back to you.  Let's go to the screen.  Iftikhar?
Question:    Thank you, Steph.  My question on Afghanistan has been asked by Edie.    But as regards two-State solution, I would like to know when the   Secretary-General calls for a two-State solution, does he mean   independent and sovereign States?
Spokesman:  He calls for a two-State solution of two States living in peace and security side by side.
Question:  But he always used it in the past the words independent and sovereign States.
Spokesman:    There's been no change in his position.  Obviously, he's not going to   use every same words every time he speaks. Phrases may be different, but   the position is unchanged.  Abdelhamid, then Mushfiq.
Question:    Thank you, StÃ©phane.  I have few questions.  On Thursday, the Israeli   occupation forces in Gaza demolished a huge university called Israa   University.  It was videotaped.  It was a volcanic explosion of one of   the largest universities in Gaza.  And it includes a museum of 3,000   pieces, which were all either stolen or destroyed.  I haven't seen any   statement coming from any UN official about destruction of that   university.
Spokesman:  Well, I think I was asked about this last week and I did speak to it. Your next question?
Question:    But UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural   Organization) did not say anything, but just...  My next question, Hamas   issued an 18 page statement or a document.  It's entitled, this is our   story about October 7.  Have the Secretary-General been briefed about   this important document?  Out of even just knowledge of what was being   written there?
Spokesman:  I can't, I don't know is the short answer.
Question:    Okay.  My last question is about the two-State solution.  Why the SG   doesn't refer to those UN resolutions that entitled the Palestinians for   a two- State, a free and independent State, resolution 1397 of 2002 and   resolution 1515?
Spokesman:  Abdelhamid, I will answer you   and all of you have asked questions about the two-State solution.  The   position is unchanged.  The fact that every time he speaks, he doesn't   refer to every Security Council resolution or General Assembly   resolution that has been adopted on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict   doesn't mean he's ignoring it.  He speaks using different words.  I   mean, he could repeat the same speech over and over again, but I think   we'd get very little coverage if he did that.  All of that to say   clearly that his position is unchanged.  He is a Secretary-General of   the United Nations, a defender and a promoter of the Security Council   resolutions.  Mushfiq?
Question:  Thank you, Steph.  Did   the Secretary-General disregard human rights violation and sham   elections in Bangladesh when congratulating Sheikh Hasina for renewing   State power?  Does this raise concerns about a contradiction with the   UN's previous stance and the statements from its Human Rights   Commissioner on the non-democratic nature of the elections?
Spokesman:    No.  He sent a letter to the Prime Minister as he does to Heads of   Governments or Heads of States when they're re-elected.  What we have   said in the past from this podium, what the Human Rights High   Commissioner has said remains unchanged.  Mike?
Question:  I   forgot to ask you earlier.  Multiple media reports today said that the   Israeli Foreign Minister, Katz, in a meeting of the EU ministers in   Brussels proposed an idea of an artificial island as a potential home   for Palestinians, floating there in the Mediterranean.  You mentioned he   met with the Senior Coordinator Kaag yesterday.  Was that idea brought   up to her to your knowledge?
Spokesman:  I don't know.  I don't know.
Question:  Okay.
Spokesman:    Sometimes I don't know and I won't lie about it.  Yes.  One last   question, and then I'm going to go eat some traditional green soup with...   [cross-talk]
Question:  Yeah, it needs a short answer.  So do you think this suggestion is valid?
Spokesman:  I think people are allowed to determine their own future, and I will leave it as that.  Hasta la vista."
RBMPAIE302_JPCBIW6AM59RRZJ,Erdogan Officially Approves Turkiye's Ratification of Sweden's NATO Membership - Reports,Sputnik News,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-sputnik01.htm,"Sputnik News
20240125
ANKARA (Sputnik) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday approved the ratification of Sweden's membership in NATO by Turkiye, the NTV broadcaster reported.
According to the Turkish broadcaster, the decree with the presidential assent of the ratification of Sweden's NATO membership has been published in Turkiye's official journal known as Resmi Gazete. The publication in the journal means that the ratification process is over.
Turkiye has been reluctant to ratify Sweden's NATO membership arguing that Stockholm had to do more to ensure that it was no longer a safe haven for pro-Kurdish militants, seen as terrorists by Ankara.
The Swedish authorities have welcomed Turkey's decision.
""Welcome TÃ¼rkiye's approval of the ratification of Sweden's NATO accession. With this, a key milestone has been reached in Sweden's path towards NATO membership,"" the Swedish prime minister's office wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
Sweden, along with Finland, submitted its NATO application in May 2022, several months after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine. Finland became a member of the alliance in April 2023. Sweden's application is still pending ratification by Hungary.

RBSNMCU19W_VHBOUONPT3QMCVG,Human Rights Watch Says 11 At 'Imminent Risk' Of Execution In Iran,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2024/iran-240124-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL January 24, 2024
Human Rights Watch (HRW) says at least 11 prisoners in Iran are at ""imminent risk"" of execution, most of whom are Kurdish.
In a statement dated January 23, the rights group said all 11 had been sentenced to death on political or security-related charges, which ""under international law should never result in the death penalty, a grave violation of the right to life.""
Some of the prisoners were convicted of ""corruption on earth"" and moharebeh, which translates to ""enmity against God.""
HRW urged the international community to ""put pressure on Iran to end the use of the death penalty for such charges.""
""Iranian authorities are notorious for wielding the death penalty against people after unfair trials to instill fear into a population that has mobilized nationwide protests calling for fundamental reforms,"" said Michael Page, HRW's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.
The rights group identified eight of those at imminent risk as Anvar Khezri, Kamran Sheikha, Khosro Besharat, Pejman Fatehi, Vafa Azarbar, Mohammad Faramarzi, Mohsen Mazlum, and Reza Rasaee.
HRW's statement comes after Iran executed Farhad Salimi, an ethnic Kurd, and Mohammad Qobadlou, a protester arrested during the antiestablishment unrest in 2022.
""Iran's brutal government takes an especially harsh response to ethnic minority communities,"" said Page.
HRW said Iranian authorities substantially increased the rates of executions in 2023. Some foreign-based Iranian human rights groups have said the Islamic republic executed more than 700 prisoners last year.
Citing an April 2023 report by the Oslo-based Iran Human Rights, HRW said ethnic minorities were disproportionately targeted in executions.
The report showed that, in 2022, the execution of ethnic Kurds, Azeris, and Baluchis had more than doubled compared to the previous year.
""This underscores the intensified targeting of minority communities with capital punishment,"" HRW said.

Sun / 21 January 2024 / 07:48
Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi has strongly condemned the assassination of five Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) advisors in an Israeli missile strike in Syria, saying such ""cowardly"" acts will not go unanswered.
Tehran-ISNA- ""Certainly, the continuation of such terrorist and criminal acts, which are indicative of the increasing failure and defeats of the illegitimate Zionist regime in achieving its malicious goals and the depth of its frustration with the fighters of the resistance front, will not go unanswered by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Raeisi said in a statement on Saturday.
The IRGC said earlier in the day that four of its members serving on a military advisory mission in Syria were assassinated in an Israeli strike on a residential building in Damascus. It said later than a fifth advisor had succumbed to his injuries.
The IRGC named its martyred advisors as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
""The recent crimes of the usurping Zionist regime, which.... are committed under the shadow of the support of hegemonic countries, chief among them the United States, and the silence of international organizations, will undoubtedly be another stain on the black record of all self-proclaimed human rights advocates,"" Iran's president said.
Raeisi also offered his condolences to the families of the martyrs, the Iranian leadership, and the entire nation.
Iran maintains an advisory mission in Syria at the request of Damascus to help the war-torn Arab country fight off the foreign-backed militants who have been fighting the democratically-elected Syrian government since 2011.
The Israeli regime has ramped up its airstrikes on Syria since early October, when it launched the ongoing genocidal war against the Gaza Strip.

RGXLZ0O73U_W5AMY2HJSJO95QS,UN agency says over half a million Palestinians face 'catastrophic hunger' in Gaza,Iran Press TV,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240123-presstv05.htm,"Iran Press TV
Tuesday, 23 January 2024 4:53 PM
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees says more than half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic hunger as Israel presses ahead with its genocidal campaign in the besieged Palestinian territory.
The United Nations Relief Works and Agency (UNRWA) in a social media post on Tuesday pointed out that intense fighting, communications blackouts and access restrictions had hindered the organization's ability to ""safely and effectively deliver aid"".
In the northern part of Gaza, very little aid has reached residents and displaced families there, who have begun to grind animal feed into flour, UNRWA said.
UNRWA says telecommunications and internet services in Gaza have been down for the past seven days, the longest since October 7. It added that the blackout prevents people from accessing life-saving information, and impedes humanitarian response.
Risk of having pockets of famine in Gaza remains: WFP
Meanwhile, the UN's food agency on Tuesday warned that ""very little"" food assistance has made it beyond the southern part of the bombarded and besieged territory since the start of the war.
""It's difficult to get into the places where we need to get to in Gaza, especially in northern Gaza,"" said Abeer Etefa, the World Food Programme's spokesperson for the Middle East.
""The risk of having pockets of famine in Gaza is very much still there,"" she added.
Etefa noted that there was a ""systematic limitation on getting into the north of Gaza, not just for the WFP"".
""This is why we're seeing people becoming more desperate and being impatient to wait for food distributions because it's very sporadic,"" she said. ""They don't get it frequently, and they have no trust or confidence that these convoys will come again.""
A UN expert also on Monday warned that Israel was ""intentionally"" starving Gazans and ""destroying"" its food system as the genocidal war continues incessantly for more than 100 days now.
Michael Fakhri, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food said that starving an entire population, what Israel is doing in Gaza amid the onslaught, is ""unprecedented.""
A group of United Nations human rights experts last week warned that ""every single person"" in the war-torn Gaza Strip is facing hunger amid Israel's war and blockade against the besieged strip.
The experts say that Israel is destroying Gaza's food system and using food as a weapon against Palestinians, noting that ""It is unprecedented to make an entire civilian population go hungry this completely and quickly.""
Gazans now make up 80 percent of all people facing famine or catastrophic hunger worldwide, marking an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the blockaded territory.
On the 109th day of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, the death toll has risen to more than 25,500, predominantly comprising women and children.
Khan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Strip, has been the focus of the regime's latest strikes.
Some 190 people have been killed over the past 24 hours, almost a third of them in Khan Yunis.  Israeli forces have encircled the city and launched an airstrike on areas around Nasser Hospital.
The Israeli army confirms the loss of 24 more troopers during intense clashes with Palestinian Resistance fighters in the past 24 hours in Gaza.
Israel's aggression has also displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been under near-total blockade since the beginning of the onslaught.
An Israeli military spokesman of the regime says two dozen soldiers were killed during an intense fighting in Gaza on Monday.
He said, 21 of them died after a rocket-propelled grenade hit a building they were in. Three others were killed in a separate Palestinian operation that targeted an Israeli tank with a mortar shell. More than a dozen troops were also injured on the same day.
Despite its deadly and destructive campaign in Gaza, Israel has so far failed to achieve its main goals in the onslaught, namely destroying Hamas and securing the release of its captives through military means."

By Wang Qi Published: Jan 22, 2024 08:48 PM
Embracing the One-China principle is the general trend of the times and the inevitable choice of the international community, Chinese experts said on Monday, after a Tuvalu envoy's recent remarks that the Pacific island country may follow Nauru's decision to sever ""ties"" with the island of Taiwan.
According to a report published on January 19 by the Weekend Australian, Tuvalu's representative to the island of Taiwan said a source told him that Tuvalu could cut ""ties"" with Taiwan after the Pacific nation's election on January 26.
The Tuvalu envoy's remarks came after Nauru, another Pacific Island nation, announced it was severing ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan on January 15, on the heels of the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s Lai Ching-te's victory in the regional leader election in the island on January 13 this year.
On Sunday, Taiwan's external affairs authority claimed that it ""maintains deep ties with Tuvalu,"" according to reports from Taiwan-based media. The department also noted that despite Nauru's decision, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau all pledged to stick with Taiwan.
Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Monday that the Taiwan authorities' reaction is nothing more than an effort to embolden themselves, or it shows that they are still making a last-ditch effort to hold on to Tuvalu.
Analysts noted that regardless of whether Tuvalu severs its ""ties"" with the Taiwan in the short term, the trend of the international community further distancing itself from DPP authorities show that accepting the One-China principle is the general trend of the times and the inevitable choice of the international community.
Lai's election victory further amplified the geopolitical risks posed by Taiwan secessionists, which in turn has made it increasingly difficult for the DPP authorities to establish themselves internationally, Zhang said.
There are currently only 12 UN-recognized nations that retain ""ties"" with Taiwan authorities. According to Zhang, it cannot be ruled out that the number of Taiwan's ""diplomatic partners"" could fall into the single digit during Lai's tenure.
According to Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, Tuvalu may just be the second domino in the chain.
The Chinese mainland will not be soft in containing Taiwan secessionists, said Xin, ""the mainland's influence on international affairs, and its importance to other countries, is far greater than that of Taiwan island.""
According to data from Taiwan's international trade department, the total trade volume between Tuvalu and Taiwan authorities in 2023 was only about $1.81 million.
The Pacific Island countries (PICs) actually lack close economic ties with Taiwan region as ballast for solid ties. At the same time, the financial resources, which the Taiwan authorities use to serve their ""dollar diplomacy,"" have been waning in recent years, Zhang said.
The PICs have been facing the negative effects of global warming and rising waters in the Pacific Ocean in recent years, putting the countries' survival under threat, said Zhang, ""In terms of the construction of infrastructures and coping with climate change, PICs are even more in need of, and more hopeful of, cooperating with Beijing.""
The DPP authorities are relying more on US and Australian efforts in pressing PICs to maintain ""diplomatic ties"" with Taiwan, but the vast majority of its handful of ""allies"" recognize their true national interests, which makes the trend [of cutting ties with the island of Taiwan] unstoppable, Xin told the Global Times."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today:
""We are continuing the war on all fronts and in all sectors. We are not giving immunity to any terrorist: Not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, not in Syria and not anywhere. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm him.
Regarding our hostages, we have returned home - as of today - 110 of our hostages and we are obligated to returning all of them. This is one of the goals of the war and the military pressure is a necessary condition to achieving it.
I am working on this around the clock. But let it be clear: I utterly reject the Hamas monsters' capitulation terms.
Hamas is demanding, in exchange for the release of our hostages, the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the murders and rapists of the Nukhba and leaving Hamas in place.
Were we to agree to this - our soldiers would have fallen in vain. Were we to agree to this - we would not be able to ensure the security of our citizens. We would be unable to safely restore the evacuees to their homes and the next October 7 would be only a question of time. I am not prepared to accept such a mortal blow to the security of Israel; therefore, we will not agree to this.
The conditions being proposed by Hamas underscore a simple point - there is no substitute for victory. Only total victory will ensure the elimination of Hamas and the return of all our hostages.
I told President Biden this in our conversation over the weekend. I greatly appreciate the US support for Israel and I also expressed this to the President. However, I will strongly insist on our vital interests. I emphasized to President Biden our determination to achieve all of the goals of the war, and to ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.
Therefore, I insist that after we achieve total victory, after we eliminate Hamas, there will no entity in Gaza that finances terrorism, educates for terrorism or sends terrorists.
Gaza must be demilitarized, under Israel's full security control.
I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River.
As Prime Minister of Israel, I have strongly upheld this position in the face of great international and domestic pressure.
My insistence is what has prevented - over the years - the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel. As long as I am Prime Minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this. If someone has a different position, they should show leadership and candidly state their position to the citizens of Israel."""

Tehran, IRNA -- Iraqi resistance forces have launched two separate missile attacks on a US military base in eastern Syria.
According to local media reports, the Iraqi Islamic Resistance claimed responsibility for the first attack that hit the US base in Koniko gas filed on Monday afternoon.
The group said it had fired several missiles at the base which came under the second missile attack shortly afterwards.
Iraq-based resistance fighters have launched numerous attacks on US bases in their country and neighboring Syria since the Israeli regime began its war on Gaza in early October.
They say the attacks are in retaliation for Washington's support for the Israeli regime's crimes in the Gaza Strip, which have thus far killed more than 25,000 innocent people.

MondayØ 22 January 2024 - 09:24 PM
Head of State Information Service (SIS) Diaa Rashwan, announced that the recent period has witnessed several statements by Israeli officials, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, containing false claims and claims about the existence of weapons'smuggling operations, explosives, ammunition, and their components, into the Gaza Strip from Egyptian territory through several methods, including tunnels that claimed to be existed between both sides of the borders.
He added that what clarifies and confirms the falsehood of these allegations are the following:
= All countries around the world know well the extent of the efforts made by Egypt in the last 10 years, to achieve security and stability in Sinai and enhance security on the border between Egyptian Rafah and the Gaza Strip, as Egypt itself had suffered greatly from these tunnels during the fierce confrontation with terrorist groups in Sinai after the overthrow of the Brotherhood regime in June 2013 and until 2020, it represented a means for smuggling fighters and weapons to Sinai to carry out terrorist operations that claimed the lives of more than 3,000 martyrs from the army, police, and civilians, and more than 13,000 injured.
= This situation prompted the Egyptian administration to take broader steps to eliminate these tunnels once and for all.  A 5-kilometre-long buffer zone was created from the Egyptian city of Rafah to the border with Gaza, and more than 1,500 tunnels were destroyed.  Egypt also strengthened the border wall with the sector extending to 14 kilometers, by strengthening it with a 6 meters long concrete wall above the ground and 6 meters under the ground, so that there are three barriers between Sinai and Palestinian Rafah, with which any smuggling operation is impossible, neither above ground nor underground. Egypt has full sovereignty over its land, and has complete control over its entire northeastern borders, whether with the Gaza Strip or with Israel.
= It is surprising that Israel speaks in this undocumented way about the allegations of arms smuggling from Egypt to Gaza, which is the country that has military control over the Strip and possesses the most modern and accurate means of reconnaissance and monitoring, and its forces, settlements, and naval forces surround the small strip on three sides, and are content with the accusations sent to Egypt without any further evidence of it.
= Any claim that smuggling operations are carried out through trucks carrying aid and goods to Gaza from the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing is an empty and ridiculous statement, because any truck entering Gaza from this crossing must first pass through ""Karm Abou Salem"" controlled by the Israeli authorities, which inspects all trucks entering the Strip.  Also, the recipients of this aid are the Palestinian Red Crescent and United Nations relief organizations such as UNRWA, which adds further evidence of the falsehood of the Israeli allegations.
= The true essence of Israel's claims is to justify its continuation of collective punishment, killing, and starvation of more than 2 million Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip, which it has practiced for 17 years.
= Also, Israel's continued marketing of these lies is an attempt to create legitimacy for its attempt to occupy the ""Philadelphia Corridor"" or ""Salah al-Din Corridor"", in Gaza along the border with Egypt, in violation of the security agreements and protocols signed between it and Egypt.  Here, it must be strictly emphasized that any Israeli move in this direction will lead to a serious threat to Egyptian-Israeli relations.  Egypt, in addition to being a country that respects its international obligations, is capable of defending its interests and sovereignty over its land and borders, and will not mortgage it in the hands of a group of extremist Israeli leaders who seek to drag the region into a state of conflict and instability.
This Egyptian red line joins the previous one, which Egypt has repeatedly declared, which is the categorical rejection of forcibly or voluntarily displacing our Palestinian brothers to Sinai, which Israel will not be allowed to pass.
Egypt was the initiative and agreed with Israel, in 2005 and 2021, to increase the size of the border guard forces and capabilities in this border region in order to secure the northeastern strategic direction, out of respect for the peace treaty with Israel, and so that the latter does not take any unilateral step on its part.
= The Israeli government must conduct serious investigations within its army, state agencies, and sectors of society, to search for those truly involved in smuggling weapons to Gaza, from inside, for the purpose of profit.  Many of the weapons currently inside the Gaza Strip are the result of smuggling from inside Israel, for example M16 rifles and types of RPGs, as well as dual-use materials in the military manufacturing of the military wings in the Gaza Strip.  Here, it is sufficient to review what the Israeli media publishes about the investigations taking place with members of the Israeli army, on the background of the disappearance of weapons or their sale in the West Bank and from there they are sent to the Gaza Strip.
= Speaking of the West Bank, can Israeli officials, who are spreading lies against Egypt, explain the source of the large quantities of weapons, ammunition and explosives spread in various areas of the West Bank, according to their official statements, in light of the full control of the occupation army over it, and that it does not have any kind of border with Egypt? Then, they will only find the same people involved, from their army, state agencies, and sectors of society, in smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip for the purpose of profit.
= The information shows that most of the heavy weapons smuggling operations into the Gaza Strip take place across the Mediterranean Sea, where its shores with Gaza are completely controlled by the Israeli naval and air forces, which indicates the same type of people involved in Israel, from its army, its state agencies, and sectors of society, in weapons smuggling to Gaza for the purpose of profit.
= It is worth noting what the Israeli statements ignore, which is what was revealed by the Israeli army's statements during the current war, especially the video ones, about the seizure of many weapons, missile and explosives manufacturing workshops inside the tunnels in Gaza, Which means that there is a high possibility that a large part of the armament of Hamas and the Palestinian factions will be manufactured locally and not through smuggling.
= These allegations and lies are a continuation of the policy of escaping forward followed by the Israeli government due to its successive failures in achieving its declared goals for the war on Gaza. It is looking for someone responsible outside of it for these failures, as it also did the same thing recently by accusing Egypt in the International Court of Justice of being the one preventing and obstructing Humanitarian aid entered the Gaza Strip, despite its full knowledge that Egypt did not close the Rafah crossing on its part, even for a single moment.
= The arbitrary policies of successive Israeli governments have eliminated any prospects for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue and encouraged the separation of the Gaza Strip under the leadership of Hamas from the Palestinian Authority, including turning a blind eye to the funding it receives and the stifling siege of the Strip.
These have led to the current conditions that Israel, from time to time, claims that Egypt is responsible for it.  These policies, for more than a decade and a half, are part of Netanyahu's strategy to deepen the Palestinian division and ensure the separation of Gaza from the West Bank to weaken the Palestinian Authority, and to have the justification to refuse to enter into any negotiations on a two-state solution.
= The full support and solidarity of the Egyptian people with the Palestinian cause is certain and realistic without the slightest doubt, and is in line with Egypt's official statue on supporting the rights of the Palestinian people in their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the borders of June 4, 1967.  But this popular and official solidarity and support for the Palestinian cause does not conflict with securing our borders and preventing smuggling to and from it, and that supporting the Palestinian cause has many political ways that bear fruit until the Palestinian people obtain their legitimate rights, which Egypt has done publicly since the beginning of the recent crisis, and before that all the time in support of the brotherly Palestinian people.
= There is no doubt that such false allegations do not serve the positive Egyptian efforts made to resolve the crisis in Gaza, which has affected the entire region and made it ripe for expanding the circle of conflict, something that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi warned against and sought to do repeatedly.
= The conclusion is that these false allegations do not serve the peace treaty that Egypt respects, and it demands that the Israeli side to show its respect for it also, and to stop making statements that would strain bilateral relations in light of the current inflammatory conditions.  Egypt calls on everyone who talks about its failure to protect its borders to stop making these allegations, in light of the fact that it has a strong army capable of protecting its borders with all efficiency and discipline.  Egypt will continue its natural positive role in order to solve all the problems of the region, and these false allegations will not succeed in dissuading Egypt from carrying out its internal, regional and international responsibilities."

By RFA Burmese 2024.01.22 -- Clashes broke out Sunday in Myanmar's Shan state between the military and an ethnic army signatory of a national cease-fire, leading to the arrest of rebel officers, but both sides were quick to downplay the incident as a ""misunderstanding.""
The fighting demonstrates how fragile treaties between the junta and Myanmar's myriad ethnic armies can be in the aftermath of the military's February 2021 coup d'etat and its subsequent nationwide offensive to solidify its hold on power.
The incident was sparked when the military carried out an inspection of five Pa-O National Liberation Organization, or PNLO, vehicles laden with arms and ammunition as they entered Ho Pong township's Sam Hpu village, PNLO Patron Col. Khun Okka told RFA Burmese.
The military initiated the attack because troops believed the supplies were being delivered to anti-junta forces, he said, adding that two brief skirmishes took place ""while senior officials were in talks,"" and the military arrested three PNLO officers, who were released Monday morning.
Khun Okka said that PNLO fighters believed that the military intended to confiscate the vehicles, so ""our forces destroyed the military equipment to prevent its seizure by junta troops.""
He reiterated that the arms and ammunition ""were for our armed group"" and dismissed any suggestion that the PNLO was acting as an ""arms broker.""
Khun Okka said the incident would have no impact on the PNLO's support for the nationwide cease-fire agreement, or NCA, which it signed along with seven other armed ethnic groups and the national military in 2015.
He said the PNLO's strategies for 2024 include avoiding conflict except in self-defense, refraining from making enemies with any party, seeking public support, protecting civilians, and strengthening its capabilities with arms and ammunition.
The junta confirmed the clashes in a statement issued through its broadcast channel MRTV.
""In consideration of peace, security forces managed to stop the fighting after negotiations, in line with the provisions of the NCA,"" it said. ""However, people in PNLO uniforms set fire to the vehicles ... during the negotiations. Explosions of arms and ammunition on the trucks caused a fire which then spread to Sam Hpu village, destroying 27 houses.""
Observers of Myanmar's ethnic affairs noted that as NCA signatories outline their stance amid the wider war in Myanmar, they are increasingly coming up against political and military conflicts.
One observer, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, added that many ethnic Pa-Os are taking part in the resistance to the military regime, and suggested that the weekend incident ""will change their politics and stance on the NCA.""
""The recent situation will have some impact on the PNLO and I wonder if the PNLO might turn to confrontation,"" he said. ""Moreover, the junta is likely to put additional pressure on [the PNLO].""
The observer added that as the NCA has not led to a lasting peace, relations between the junta and the signatories have gradually worsened.

RUT45N79S7_OLUHJ5PWQMS1JS1,Hong Kong to focus on security laws over economic revival,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/01/china-240125-rfa01.htm,"Chief executive says only after the completion of legislation can Hong Kong strive for economic development.
By Chen Zifei for RFA Mandarin, Alice Yam and Chingman for RFA Cantonese 2024.01.25 -- Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee has vowed to complete legislation of the city's own security laws this year, reiterating its priority on national security in the face of what he describes as increasingly complex geopolitics and secretive espionage tactics over public discontent as well as economic and social issues.
To effectively deal with sudden and unpredictable new risks, Lee stressed that legislating Article 23 of the Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini constitution - with laws to prohibit acts of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against Beijing is urgent.
Lee was responding to questions from lawmakers of the Legislative Council, or LegCo, on Thursday about the progress of legislation on Article 23, and what the government is doing to revive Hong Kong's economy, which is being hammered by underperforming stock and property markets.
With legislation completed, Hong Kong can only then fully strive for economic development, Lee told lawmakers, revealing that the work has entered the final stage and will be completed this year.
But such a move has been controversial. A previous attempt in 2003 failed following mass protests and was shelved until the introduction of Beijing's imposition of the National Security Law in 2020.
""The Hong Kong National Security Law helps us deal with the most critical national security issues in 2019. But there are still many issues, such as treason, and the management of some political organizations and political activities with foreign contacts. The relevant laws have not yet been perfected,"" Lee said.
He argued that compared with foreign countries, which often have more than 20 national security-related laws, Hong Kong has just one, and this would be clearly explained internally and to external stakeholders. A ""response and refutation team"" and an ""interpretation team"" will be established to respond to propaganda from hostile forces during the legislative process.
But exiled former legislator Ted Hui said Lee's argument that foreign countries have multiple security-related laws is aimed at downplaying the damage and impact of such laws on Hong Kong.
Since Lee took the helm as chief executive, he has not only taken a tough position politically but also on policies relating to people's livelihood, cracking down on areas such as traffic violations and hawking, sparking criticisms even from pro-government lawmakers.
At LegCo on Thursday, pro-communist legislator Paul Tse criticized the government for overreaching - law enforcers issuing traffic tickets 24/7 and penalizing hawkers heavily for road obstruction, plainclothes officers lurking to catch jaywalkers, and authorities cracking down on bookstores and factory canteens.
""Will the government review its heavy-handed enforcement of alleged excessive fines and money grabbing?"" Tse said.
Lee said such opinions only evoke ""conflicts"", likening Tse's vocabulary to terms used during the 2019 anti-government protests where Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities were described as ""black terror.""
Still, even pro-communist organization Patriotic Force founder Chan Ching-sum could no longer stay silent.
""Since Lee Ka-chiu took office as the chief executive, I have only seen the current government trying every means to mentally abuse the people,"" she posted on Weibo, referring to Lee's Chinese name. ""I can't stand the Lee Ka-chiu government! But there is no way to complain. Now as an ordinary Hong Kong citizen, I now make a complaint on Weibo against Lee Ka-chiu!""
Chan's post was quickly deleted but not before being circulated widely online.

CAIRO, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Monday urged the United States to stop supporting the Israeli aggression against the Palestinians and to adopt a stance coherent with international humanitarian law.
It urged the United States to adopt a stance that leads to a full and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza and to pressure Israel to stop its aggression and siege on the strip, read the resolution passed at the bloc's emergency meeting on Palestine held Monday at its headquarters in Cairo.
The AL also warned against what it called ""Israeli plans"" to push the nearly 2 million internally displaced Palestinians in Gaza towards the border with Egypt.
The pan-Arab body demanded the swift implementation of Security Council Resolution 2720 adopted in December 2023 and urgent steps to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza in a safe and unobstructed way.
Israel has been launching a large-scale offensive in Gaza to retaliate against a surprise attack by Hamas, the ruler of the enclave, on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies.
So far, the Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on Gaza has risen to 25,295, the Gaza-based Health Ministry said on Monday."

And there are dozens of caring countries and millions of caring people in the world. At least I believe in this,"" she added.
The adopted text reiterates that ""all Ukrainian children have the right to enjoy the rights and freedoms enshrined in relevant international human rights instruments"" and emphasised that ""the best interests of the child must prevail in all decision-making processes concerning them"", reinforcing the principle that children should never be used as ""a means of exerting pressure or as war trophies"".
The Assembly, therefore, called on national parliaments to adopt resolutions recognising these crimes as genocide, and the international community to collaborate with Ukraine to trace and repatriate missing children, namely ""to identify, locate and return them to Ukraine"".
Expressing gratitude to Council of Europe member states that have assisted Ukrainian children, the parliamentarians called for support, urging host countries to provide essential services, including education, healthcare and mental health support, and encouraged the maintenance of connections with their language and culture to facilitate their future return to Ukraine.
They highlighted the need for increased co-operation among existing parties and mechanisms, relying in particular on third-party intervention to collaboratively work towards the return of children. They called on the various organisations whose neutrality-based mandates allows them to gain access to the territories of the Russian Federation, Belarus, and occupied territories of Ukraine ""to contribute to the process of identification, location and repatriation of deported and forcibly transferred Ukrainian children and to work closely with Ukraine and all States which could facilitate the return of children"".
Finally, PACE reiterated its commitment to continuing its role as a facilitator to support the Ukrainian authorities and various international organisations, such as the ICRC, in ""determining the most rapid means to identify and facilitate an effective search for children"" with access to as much information as possible about their identity and the conditions of their deportation or forcible transfer by the Russian Federation."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, has announced that they have successfully taken control of three Israeli military drones.
The Al-Qassam Brigades said the seized drones include two suicide drones that have been brought under their control in the southern neighborhood of Al- Zeitoun in Gaza City.
Meanwhile, the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad movement, also confirmed that, in a joint operation with the Al-Qassam Brigades, they targeted the Israeli military positions in Nahal Oz with a significant number of rockets.
The operations came as Israeli soldiers suffered their highest single-day casualty toll at the hands of Palestinian resistance fighters in Gaza.

According to Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, if there is a ceasefire in Gaza, the Lebanese resistance Hezbollah, will halt fire against the Israeli occupation forces (IOF) in occupied Palestine.
Tehran (ISNA) - Bou Habib remarked that the ""minor fighting"" on the Lebanese-Palestinian border would ""stop immediately and automatically"" if such an agreement is reached.
Bou Habib explained that the intention in Lebanon is not ""to have a big war. It has to do with what's going on in Gaza, which is not acceptable.""
In an attempt to increase the pressure on Lebanon by fearmongering, the Israeli occupation claimed it is considering launching an attack on Lebanon in the following two weeks in case a political agreement is not reached regarding Hezbollah's presence near the Lebanon-Palestine border, The Washington Post reported on Saturday citing sources.
Since the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon launched its operations last October in support of Gaza after the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, almost a quarter-million Israeli settlers evacuated northern occupied Palestine fearing Hezbollah's attacks, and a repeat of a scenario similar to that in the Gaza envelope on October 7.
Citing Western and Lebanese officials, the newspaper reported that Israelis informed Washington last December that it would have ""no other option"" but to carry out a military aggression against Lebanon if a diplomatic agreement is not reached that would allow the entity's settlers to return to the North.

Good afternoon,
Excellencies, et en particulier ma chÃ¨re ministre de la dÃ©fense du Royaume de Belgique, Ludivine [Dedonder], en espagnol, on dirait ""Luz divina"", ni plus ni moins.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear colleagues and friends,
It is a great pleasure to join you once again at this year's European Space Conference. I think I have been able to come every year and it is a regular appointment in my agenda - and I hope it will still be next year. Well, next year I will not be here.
In any case, since the beginning of my mandate, I have constantly been arguing for the recognition of Space as a strategic domain with a major geopolitical significance. That is a fact but maybe it is not as much recognised as it should be.
We know that we are living in data-driven societies and economies which cannot be imagined without satellites navigation [for] travel and the financial sector, earth observation for agriculture, climate, crisis [monitoring and communication].
You know my colleagues from the industrial sector, [working] for environment, for climate, for [the European] institutions, have been coming here and explaining [it] to you.
And it is more and more true. But it is also true that our lives are also depending on Security and Defence. Maybe the Europeans have discovered recently how challenging the world in which we live [is] - la duretÃ© du monde. We were used to live in a world [with] peace, trade, and human rights.
Well, that is not enough. We have to be ready to participate actively in military operations, and this makes satellite communications much more important to synchronise our weapon systems. It is unimaginable to have a weapons' system that works without relying on what is going on up in the outer space.
For those who had doubts, the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine showcased how much space has become an essential dimension of any security policy.
Space is an indispensable tool, but it is also a risk factor. It is a risk factor. New threats have shown up, and we see, for example, increasing jamming of satellite signals, cyber-attacks on space command and control, or the testing of kinetic destruction or manipulation of assets in orbit.
But not only what is happening up there, not only what is happening 200 km to 36,000 km above our heads, but it is also what is happening here on the surface of Earth. How can we protect our ground-based infrastructure, our data links, and of course our space industry where our companies and technologies are at risk of being targeted by espionage or, still worse, by hostile takeovers.
As High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security [Policy] - and the word ""security"" is taking more and more importance in my job description. I suggest that in the next legislative period [we] should start putting ""Security [Policy] and Foreign Affairs"", because security is becoming more and more important. And part of the security tasking is to shape a common European Union Space Security and Defence policy.
We - as I announced here last year - have been producing a Space Strategy for Security and Defence, together with Commissioner [for Internal Market, Thierry] Breton. I announced it in my meeting last year with you immediately after it was approved, and we have been developing it, working closely with Member States which are fully behind it. Also, the European Parliament welcomed and supported it, and I want to thank the parliamentarians from all [the] political spectrum.
I think I can say that this Space Strategy for Security and Defence represents a kind of a paradigm shift in the way we look at space, and in the way we relate space to security and defence.
And, through this Strategy, we have committed ourselves to implement a series of concrete actions. I will give you some examples of this concrete work ongoing.
The defence must start by identifying an understanding [of the] threats. You want to defend yourself? To defend [yourself] from what? Which are the threats? Now, the [EU] Member States are systematically gathering and sharing with us information on space threats. Based on that, we will issue a first classified annual Space Threat Landscape Analysis. This will help us understand in particular the range of counter-space capabilities that our competitors are developing and testing. What our competitors are doing in order to represent a threat for us.
Since quite a long time (2016), we already have a Space Threat Response Mechanism. It is operational 24 hours every day, and it brings together experts from the European External Action Service, from the [European] Commission and from the European Space Programme Agency - the three bodies together. From time to time, we exercise this mechanism. And last year, in 2023, we simulated a cyber-attack incident against Galileo, our global satellite navigation system.
We exchange constantly with Member States on security-related events in space to support our response. We have to be permanently updated in our capacity. And thanks to that, for example, we have understood better and called out the recent use of ballistic missiles for the launching of a reconnaissance satellite by North Korea, last November.
Yes, we called out this incident - but it is not enough to call out on an incident or a threat. It is important, it is the first step, but we need to be able to take additional countermeasures, and among these countermeasures, there are sanctions. We have also begun to discuss the potential activation of the EU Mutual Assistance clause among the Member States when one of them has a space asset at risk.
We need more global cooperation, not only among the European [Union] Member States. We need more global cooperation on space security. We already engage in dedicated space security dialogues with the United States, with Japan and Australia, and other likeminded partners, including NATO. And now we are working - and I hope that we have an agreement soon - with South Korea. To have a good contact with like-minded countries is important, but we need to also have open channels of communication with ""less like-minded [countries]"".
In diplomacy, we have to talk with everybody, every day, even with the evil, and on the space domain also. We have to pay attention and try to cooperate or at least to be aware of what we can do with ""less like-minded"" countries in order to avoid unintended escalation. Because also, this may happen. I did not want [it] but it happened, and we have to avoid unintended escalations.
At the United Nations level, we have supported the moratorium on Anti-satellite weapons tests that was approved by the General Assembly last year. I think this is a very pragmatic approach to strengthen international security and stability.
And finally, as every year, I want to talk to you about one of our most important assets: our Geospatial Intelligence Analysis capacity, thanks to our EU Satellite Centre (SatCen).
All these actions are aimed at safeguarding essential space services for the European Union, but we also use our space-based capabilities for security and defence on the ground.
And this is the EU Satellite Centre at the TorrejÃ³n Military Base in Madrid who is playing a key role. I said [it] several times: the Satellite Centre of Madrid is our eyes from the space, a unique intelligence analysis capability in the European Union. You cannot imagine how useful it is [to] see what is happening everywhere on earth. But to see is not enough, because sometimes you do not see anything, you need someone who makes the link between your eyes and the eyes that are showing you what is happening on earth. This is the analysis and intelligence capacity that the Satellite Centre is providing.
Satellite imagery and data allow us to inform our decisions as we respond to crises and conflicts ranging from monitoring the movement of pirates in international waters, coordinating humanitarian support after floods, or analysing what is happening on the ground in Ukraine, in Gaza and in other crisis areas. Believe me, it is not crises what we are lacking. On the contrary, we have every day more [crises] and every day they are more challenging.
And I am happy to say that all European Union institutions and Member States, but also third states and international organisations such as the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), request insights from our Satellite Centre. In 2023, the Satellite Centre provided [nearly] 6,000 reports, dossiers [and] analyses. 6,000 - it is 10 times more than ten years ago. It is a good record - [you] multiplied by 10 your output capacities.
Last summer, I invited the European Defence Ministers to go to Madrid and to visit the Operations Room of the Satellite Centre. All came, and all agreed, that we need to empower this Centre by ensuring that it remains at the cutting edge of technology for geospatial intelligence and to have a diversity of satellite data sources at hand.
We do not have our own satellites. We have to ask for images, and we have to diversify the sources of data that we use. We have to be more and more autonomous - autonomous among Member States. I am very happy to know that five Member States signed an agreement to provide more satellite images to SatCen.
I am not going to go longer than that. I have my explanation on what we are doing directly through the Centre I have the honour to chair its Board.
This reflects our ""European Ambition"" in Space. We have to look at that in the broader geopolitical context in which we have to live. A world where the rules-based order is being challenged, where multilateralism is in decline, and, where more and more, it is the use of force which solves the problem. Well, they do not solve the problem, but they create realities de facto.
Our community of actors has become more diverse. Now, we have private operators, like Space X, and power projection by large space actors is becoming more frequent.
But still, we are one of the world's leading space actors. We have world class assets and infrastructure, but in order to remain strong, we have to invest more and better, and together. It is the best way of doing things better - to do it together. To invest more together on space security and defence and by reducing our strategic dependencies which remain strong.
This can be built step by step, and in particular [by] increasing our capacities with respect to space.

Tehran, IRNA -- The US-occupied military base in the Conoco gas field in Syria's Deir ez-Zur province has been reportedly targeted with rockets, hours after US Central Command (CENTCOM) said it had hit the positions of Iraq's Islamic Resistance movement.
The Al-Mayadeen news network reported on Wednesday that the position of the American forces was targeted in a ""heavy rocket attack.""
Local media also reported that an explosion was heard at the American military base in eastern Syria.
Earlier in the day, CENTCOM announced via its X social network that it had targeted the Islamic Resistance's positions in response to attacks including the recent ones on Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq's western province of Anbar.
""These attacks targeted depots, rocket and missile training facilities, drone facilities, and the resistance group's headquarters,"" the statement said.
Iraqi media reported earlier that the US attacked the positions of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of anti-terror fighters.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has carried out more than a hundred attacks using rockets against US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the US support of the Israeli regime's bloody war on the Gaza Strip.

Iraqi resistance groups have vowed to continue their operations against military bases, where US military forces and trainers are stationed, in retaliation for Washington's unqualified support for the relentless Israeli war on Gaza, after the US military carried out an airstrike against sites used by the Iraqi anti-terror forces.
Secretary General of Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada resistance group, Abu Ala al-Walai, said in a statement early on Wednesday that his fellow fighters have embarked on the second phase of their operations in the wake of the US strikes against their positions.
""Our strikes will continue until the unjust blockade of Gaza is lifted, and the horrific massacres of Zionists against its residents come to an end,"" he added.
Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for the anti-terror resistance group Kata'ib Hezbollah, also said that Iraqi resistance groups ""will continue to attack enemy bases until our brethren achieve victory in Gaza.""
Husseini noted that the attacks will continue until the brutal Israeli killing machine, which enjoys the US support, stops and the all-out blockade against Gaza is lifted. ""This is a solemn promise to freedom-loving people,"" he stated.
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin announced in a statement that the US military carried out airstrikes in Iraq on Tuesday, targeting facilities used by resistance groups in the country following repeated attacks on US forces.
The strikes targeted three facilities used by Katai'b Hezbollah and other resistance groups in Iraq.
Austin said in the statement that the strikes ""are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria"" by Iraqi resistance groups.
According to an unnamed Pentagon official, the strikes were carried out in two sites in western Iraq, including al-Qa'im town near the Syrian border, as well as Jurf al-Sakhar region south of Baghdad.
Two people were killed and two wounded in the bombardments in the al-Qa'im sector, according to an official at the Iraqi Interior Ministry and a former member of the Hashd al-Sha'abi forces.
In response, Iraqi resistance forces targeted a US-occupied military facility in neighboring Syria and Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq's western province of Anbar.
Lebanon's Arabic-language al-Mayadeen television network, citing local sources speaking on condition of anonymity, reported that a barrage of rockets slammed into a US-run facility at Conoco gas field in Syria's eastern province of Dayr al-Zawr.
Several explosive-laden drones also targeted the Ain al-Asad Air Base, located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of the capital Baghdad.
There were no immediate reports about the extent of damage at the military facilities or possible casualties.
Iraqi resistance forces have conducted dozens of strikes on the US-run military installations in both Iraq and Syria amid growing anti-US sentiments in the region over Washington's support for the Israeli genocidal campaign in Gaza.
Israel launched hostilities in Gaza following a historic operation by the Gaza-based Hamas resistance group against the occupying entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people. More than 100 days into the campaign, the regime has achieved no objectives despite killing at least 25,490 people in Gaza, around 70 percent of them women and children.
The United States has supplied Israel with weapons and intelligence support, and blocked UN resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Palestinian territory."

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- It was a small protest and a short one.
When it was over, long-stemmed carnations left by participants lay on the stone surrounding the eternal flame memorial in St. Petersburg, along with a white ribbon bearing an inscription: ""It is time to bring the mobilized soldiers home.""
The January 20 gathering brought a couple dozen women to the monument on the city's Field of Mars, a few of them with small children in tow. Some, covering their faces, held signs with messages such as ""Women for Life: 15 Months Without Leave. Without Their Families.""
It was organized by The Way Home, a Telegram channel uniting relatives of Russian men who were called up to fight in Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- a grassroots effort to bring them home from a war that, in addition to killing and wounding hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians, has left more than 300,000 Russian troops dead or wounded, according to Western estimates.
The channel, which has nearly 40,000 subscribers, has called for such demonstrations, at which the women wear white head scarves, around the country every Saturday for the foreseeable future.
""We don't intend to stop,"" read the group's call for the protests. ""We, the relatives of the mobilized and those who are not indifferent to our misfortune, will go and place flowers on eternal flames. These flowers do not just symbolize our problem. We would like to be joined by widows, no matter how hard that is for them. Together we are prepared to honor the memory of your slain relatives and to share your loss. No one should remain alone with their misfortune and our grief should not remain a secret.""
During the first weekly protests, on January 6, small groups gathered in at least 14 cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Nearly two years after Russia unleashed its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the end of the war is not in sight. And the growing discontent of the relatives of mobilized soldiers -- many of whom support the war itself, if not the way Russian soldiers have been treated -- is threatening to disrupt domestic politics ahead of the March election in which authoritarian President Vladimir Putin, 71, is set to secure a fifth term. It runs counter to the Kremlin's narrative of a country enthusiastically united behind the man who has held the reins of power as president or prime minister for a quarter-century.
""The president will be reelected because we do not have honest elections,"" one woman at the St. Petersburg protest, who asked that her identity be withheld out of fear of persecution for speaking out, told RFE/RL's North.Realities. ""Wars end through peace talks. Any war just benefits the rich, while ordinary people, draped in flags, fill the cemeteries.""
From Camouflage Nets To Protest
The woman's husband was mobilized in September 2022, days after Putin announced a call-up in the wake of successful Ukrainian efforts to push back against the Russian invasion.
""My husband is in the artillery now,"" she said. ""He doesn't tell me anything specific because he doesn't want me to worry. If he thinks it is better that I don't know, then so be it.""
In the early days after her husband was mobilized, the woman joined the wives, partners, and mothers of other soldiers gathering humanitarian aid and weaving camouflage nets for use on the front lines. But as the months dragged on and the recruiters' promises that her husband would return after six months proved empty, she became anxious. That's when she found The Way Home on Telegram and began walking the path from chatting with like-minded women online to meeting up with them to lay flowers at the eternal flame.
She said she stopped communicating with the women who are still making camouflage nets.
""There are mothers who say their son should be there because they have to defend their homeland,"" she said. ""Even the old women who need someone to care for them speak about 'defending.' They might be able to pull their sons out of the trenches because of their illnesses, but they remain convinced that they have to be at the front.""
In recent months, the rhetoric on The Way Home channel has changed noticeably. At first, the group stressed that its members were not against the war but were only asking that their relatives be rotated out and others sent to relieve them. Now, however, The Way Home is calling for an end to the war. In their notice for the January 20 protests, they called for ""all those who are not thrilled about the war"" to join them.
""At one point you bravely protested to try to stop the war,"" the announcement said. ""Now we are asking you to protest with us.""
The announcement also invited representatives of families that have not been directly affected by the war to join them.
""Don't believe the fairy tales you see on television,"" it told them. ""We have long known they aren't true.""
Although the Russian government does not release casualty figures from the war, journalists from Mediazona and the BBC have reported that they have identified at least 42,284 Russian combatants who have been killed, including at least 5,089 mobilized soldiers and 7,810 convicts who were released from prison to fight. Western intelligence agencies have estimated that more than 300,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the start of the full-scale invasion.
'You Don't Get Out Alive'
Another woman at the January 16 protest in St. Petersburg said her 25-year-old son was serving as an infantryman in Ukraine, although his military service had been with an engineering unit. He has been in Ukraine since the spring of 2023 without a single leave.
Her son, she said, is currently in the hospital, having lost the little finger on his left hand. When she visited him there recently, she added, he told her little about what he'd seen.
""He doesn't tell me how bad it has been,"" she said. ""He doesn't tell me he wants to get out because he knows that where he has been fighting, you don't get out alive.""
At that point, the woman in St. Petersburg said, she joined The Way Home.
""It is a group without leaders,"" she explained. ""There are various people there -- some active, some passive. We try to rouse the more passive ones. Everything is decided collectively. Sometimes we argue, sometimes we curse one another.""
The Way Home protest in St. Petersburg on January 13 was canceled, as local activists instead went to a presidential campaign event in support of anti-war liberal and former parliament deputy Boris Nadezhdin.
Both women from the St. Petersburg protest told RFE/RL they have no illusions about the March presidential election. After the vote, they said, Putin will have a free hand, and Russia's manpower problem in Ukraine will likely be even more acute.

BAGHDAD, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government said on Wednesday that U.S. airstrikes on positions of the paramilitary Hashd Shaabi forces are ""irresponsible escalation"" in the Middle East region.
Yahya Rasoul, the military spokesman of the Iraqi prime minister, said in a statement that the airstrikes in Iraq's western province of Anbar and the central province of Babil, which is located just south of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, are ""unacceptable act that violates Iraq's sovereignty and leads to an irresponsible escalation, at a time when the (Middle East) region is witnessing the danger of expanding the conflict in Gaza.""
At a time when Iraq is achieving a positive understanding regarding the role and tasks of the members of the U.S.-led international coalition and its advisors in Iraq by organizing the future relationship, ""we find such actions obstructive to this path and harmful to all agreements of security cooperation,"" the statement read.
Iraq urged the international community to assume its responsibility in supporting peace and security and preventing all violations that threaten the stability and sovereignty of Iraq, the statement added.
Earlier in the day, the Hashd Shaabi said in a statement that one of its fighters was killed and two others were wounded by U.S. airstrikes after midnight near the Iraqi-Syrian border and the Iraqi capital Baghdad."

Foreign Minister Baerbock will meet with her EU counterparts in Brussels today to discuss issues including the situation in the Middle East. In this context she will also exchange views with foreign ministers from the region.
The EU foreign ministers are gathering today for their first Council meeting of the new year. The agenda continues to be dominated by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine as well as the difficult situation in Gaza and the threat of escalation in the region. Foreign Minister Baerbock will brief her EU colleagues today on her talks and the outcomes of her most recent trip to Israel, the Palestinian territories (the West Bank), Egypt and Lebanon.
More than 100 days after Hamas' brutal terrorist attacks on Israel, more than 100 people are still being held as hostages in captivity by Hamas. Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas' ongoing terror. At the same time, Israel must do everything in its power to protect the civilian population and adapt its military approach accordingly. Germany is urgently campaigning for more humanitarian assistance for the civilian population in Gaza to alleviate the immeasurable suffering of the people there. Since 7 October, Germany has tripled its humanitarian assistance to around 211 million euro for the civilian population in the Palestinian territories, primarily in Gaza.
In order to further increase the pressure on Hamas and at the instigation of Germany, the EU adopted a new sanctions instrument in the run-up to the Foreign Affairs Council with the chief aim of drying up Hamas' cash flows. The mounting regional tensions will also be discussed at today's Council meeting. Foreign ministers from several countries in the region will participate in the meeting as guests.
The German Government, along with many international partners, has sharply condemned the attacks on civilian trade ships in the Red Sea by the Houthi militia. There is no justification for these attacks on civilian targets - they have to stop. And the EU is prepared to make a contribution to stability in the region. For this reason, the 27 EU member states will today discuss plans for a joint EU naval operation to protect civilian shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. The goal is to launch the mission as soon as possible.
Germany and the EU will continue to stand alongside Ukraine in 2024
Today's Foreign Affairs Council will once again focus on Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Once again, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will join the meeting at the beginning via video link. The German Government reaffirms its solidarity with the people in Ukraine. Through assistance with air defence and the supply of generators we are working with allies to provide a winter defence shield for Ukraine, for Russia is specifically attacking the country's infrastructure in order to weaken Ukraine also in the second winter of the war. We will not relax our support: in 2024, the German Government will make available bilateral military assistance to the tune of more than seven billion euro.
The EU will also continue its support for Ukraine. For Ukraine is also defending the European peaceful order. The consultations in Brussels on how this support - both financial and military - should be allocated this year and for the coming years are currently under way. The European Council will also discuss this issue again on 1 February."

The parties also discussed the current security situation in Ukraine and the situation on the frontline. Andriy Yermak informed about the consequences of Russia's missile strikes on Ukrainian cities and communities on Tuesday, which resulted in 18 fatalities and the destruction of residential buildings, social facilities and other civilian infrastructure. He emphasized the need to bolster Ukraine's air defense system and outlined the most pressing needs of the Defense Forces on the battlefield.
The Head of the President's Office expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister of Denmark, the Parliament and the entire Danish society for their consistent strong support of the Ukrainian people in the fight against the Russian aggressor.
""Denmark is a reliable friend of Ukraine. We will never forget all the military, political and humanitarian aid that Denmark has provided to our country and our citizens since the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion,"" said Andriy Yermak."
T0ZTQRRFFG_GBEU7ZKJMKID39L,Gaza fighting spreads into hospitals where there's 'no way in and out',_,_,20240124,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240123-unnews02.htm,"23 January 2024 - Amid continuing heavy fighting in Gaza on Tuesday morning including reported attacks on hospitals in the southern city of Khan Younis, UN humanitarians expressed deep concern for patients and others seeking treatment who had ""no way in and out"".
Speaking in Geneva, Christian Lindmeier, spokesperson for the UN World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that Al-Khair Hospital was ""one of the two hospitals that is now being raided"", while Nasser Hospital was ""now basically besieged around the hospital and has no way in and out"".
""I know it must be a horrible scenario on the ground there with people not knowing what the next minutes will bring.""
Desperate health needs
The WHO spokesperson added that only 14 hospitals are still functioning in Gaza -  seven in the north and seven in the south - where health needs are overwhelming after more than three months of heavy bombardment by Israeli Defense Forces, triggered by Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel that left some 1,200 dead and approximately 250 taken hostage.
The development follows an alert on X, formerly Twitter, from WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday evening about reports of ""continuous fighting"" near hospitals in Kheir Younis, where violence prevented ""newly injured people outside the hospitals from being reached and receiving care"".
The situation is ""absolutely unacceptable and not what any health facility anywhere in the world should go through"", Mr. Lindmeier insisted, noting that some 20 hospitals no longer function across Gaza.
Aid convoys held up
Underscoring the dire humanitarian situation in the enclave, the WHO spokesperson described how desperate and hungry Gazans have become, in their search for food. ""One of the convoys had mainly fuel for hospitals on it but the people were holding it up as multiple times it was trying to move forward and trying to leave and trying to get onto the road because they were so desperate looking for food.""
Echoing that warning, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned that more than half a million people in Gaza continue to face ""catastrophic food insecurity levels"".
The risk of famine increases each day as conflict continues to limit the delivery of lifesaving food assistance, said Abeer Etefa, WFP's Middle East And North Africa Senior Communications Officer and spokesperson.
""It is the largest concentration of people in what looks like famine-like conditions anywhere in the world. And also how fast we got to this point is extremely concerning.""
The WFP spokesperson also noted that children who had been evacuated for treatment on the Egyptian side of the border appeared malnourished, underweight and ""extremely thin"".
She added: ""If we don't have a more humanitarian pause, a ceasefire, more access to people, we're going to see, you know, these people are starving already and they will be in a very difficult situation.""
Senior humanitarians visit Rafah
Two top UN aid officials have visited Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, said UN Spokesperson StÃ©phane Dujarric, speaking later on Tuesday in New York.
Sigrid Kaag, Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, and Jamie McGoldrick, the interim Humanitarian Coordinator, met with civilians in the southern city, entry point for desperately needed food, fuel and other items.
They also saw the UN's own humanitarian operations and met with representatives of various UN agencies and international NGOs operating on the ground, as well as Palestinian relief workers.
Delivering food assistance
Mr. Dujarric told reporters that the UN and partners continue to address the acute famine risk across Gaza, despite the major obstacles they face.
""Between 15 and 21 January, about 1.2 million people were reached with at least one form of food assistance,"" he said.
More than half of the distributions were made in Rafah, and 21 per cent in Khan Younis.  Over a quarter reached Deir al Balah in central Gaza, and 14 per cent went to the northern governorates.
Civilians have been severely impacted by escalating hostilities in the Khan Younis area on Monday, according to the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA. Dozens of people were killed, while several homes and other buildings were destroyed.
""The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported to us that Israeli forces had surrounded their ambulance headquarters in Khan Younis, restricting ambulances from providing support in the area. Israeli forces reportedly struck the vicinity of Al Amal hospital and the ambulance headquarters,"" Mr. Dujarric said.
Attacks on healthcare continue to rise, according to WHO.  More than 300 have been verified since the start of the hostilities in Gaza, while more than 330 were reported in the West Bank over the same period."

23.01.2024  Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the European Commission
Several Outlets - 2024 started with an unprecedented number of Russian drones and ballistic missiles raining down on Ukraine. In this op-ed, HR/VP Borrell argues that Ukraine prevailing against the Russian aggression is the best security guarantee for Europe and that a paradigm shift is needed from supporting Ukraine for 'as long as it takes' to committing to 'what it takes' for Ukraine to achieve victory.
2024 started with an unprecedented number of Russian drones and ballistic missiles raining down on Ukraine. Two years ago, in the early days of 2022, I visited the Donbas and Kyiv. The drums of war were already sounding clearly, as Russia amassed over 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders.
In those days, Putin bet that Ukraine could not withstand a Russian attack and that internal division and energy dependency would prevent the EU from coming to Ukraine's help. He prepared for a war that would last merely a few days. Many Europeans harboured similar expectations. However, things turned out very differently. Putin could not have imagined that two years later, Ukraine would still be resisting.
The Ukrainian armed forces won the Battle of Kyiv, they won the Battle of Kherson, they liberated more than half of the territory Russia had captured, broke the blockade of Black Sea ports and forced Russia to withdraw the bulk of its fleet from occupied Crimea. However, last year's Ukrainian counteroffensive did not achieve the desired results and the Russian aggressors are keeping up the pressure on Ukraine, continuing with intense bombings. Russia has achieved virtually no progress on the battlefield in 2023, but Putin is still prepared to let hundreds of thousands more young Russians die to conquer Kyiv. His army and his people are suffering, but he does not know the meaning of reversing gear.
As a result, we once again hear claims that Ukraine cannot win, and that Western support will not hold. And once again, whispers of appeasement resurface. Those claims were wrong in 2022, and they remain so today. We must not let them shape our policy on Ukraine.
As Sam Greene, a Russia expert at King's College London, put it: 'Putin may want negotiations, but he does not want to negotiate'. Putin himself declared, 'We want to end this conflict as soon as possible, but only on our terms.' His terms? Denazification, demilitarization, and dismantling. Three words that mean one thing: surrender. He has repeatedly shown that he does not negotiate in good faith and has consistently failed to honour agreements. And now, less than a year before the US elections, which he believes may favour his imperialist ambitions, who can seriously expect Putin to seek compromise?
Putin was wrong two years ago. He was wrong about the capabilities of his army. He was wrong about the resistance of the Ukrainians. He was wrong about European unity. He was wrong about the strength of the transatlantic link. We must prove him wrong again. Instead of eying appeasement, we should remember the lessons we have learnt since 2022, avoid repeating mistakes and double down in areas where we saw success.
The EU and its Member States have provided unprecedented economic, humanitarian, and military support to Ukraine, delivering almost â¬30 billion in ammunition and weapons, and training nearly 40,000 Ukrainian soldiers on EU soil. The war has also bolstered transatlantic unity and our sanctions, which we progressively tightened to counter circumvention, have weakened Russia's war machine.
However, we have frequently been too slow to provide Ukraine with essential weapons, often only acting when Russia threatened to gain the upper hand. This hesitancy has cost lives. Going forward, we need a paradigm shift from supporting Ukraine for 'as long as it takes' to committing to 'what it takes' for Ukraine to achieve victory.
We need to equip Ukraine with the necessary tools to liberate its territory, including long-range missiles and other advanced weapons systems. We also need to bolster Ukraine's air defence capabilities. With Russia intensifying its campaign against civilian targets and infrastructure, anti-air missiles have become crucial to saving lives and preventing attacks, such as the recent bombing of a children's clinic in Kharkiv.
This needs to go hand in hand with a renaissance of the European Defence industry. The war in Ukraine has revealed that this industry is nowhere near adequately prepared to meet the challenges we face. Much of the EU's substantial military support to Ukraine came from existing stockpiles. Replenishing those stocks while at the same time providing Ukraine with more weapons and ammunition is a serious challenge for a defence industry shrunk to peacetime production. Even though defence expenditure is already 40% up compared to the all-time low in 2014, this reversal of trends is not yet rapid enough. We must intensify our efforts to win this race against time with Putin's Russia.
We cannot allow him to prevail. Our own security is at stake. Should Putin's strategy prove successful, it would embolden Russia and other autocracies to pursue their imperialist agendas. We must at any cost prevent a world where might makes right, where powerful countries change borders at will, and the weak fall prey to the strong. Allowing such a scenario would cast a long shadow over our future for decades to come.
Ukraine prevailing against the Russian aggression is the best security guarantee for Europe. A Russia that learnt to stay within its borders will lessen pressure on its neighbours, ease Ukraine's path to EU membership and allow Europe and the world to shift attention to the many other challenges that need solving. With our assistance, Ukraine can consign Russia's imperial ambitions to the pages of history. This must guide our actions and thinking."

Tehran, IRNA -- Australia has recalled an ship carrying livestock to the Israeli-occupied territories over fears it may be targeted by the Yemeni armed forces.
According to a Monday report by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, the ship which was transporting sheep and cattle to Israeli customers, had started sailing from Fremantle port in western Australia for Aqaba port in Jordan on January 5, but it was forced to return to the port of departure.
The Israeli regime is one of the biggest importers of livestock from Australia. The regime imported around one million livestock from Australia in 2022.
Yemen's army and its ruling Ansarullah movement have announced that they will continue to target Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea in support of the Palestinian people being subject to Israel's relentless attacks in the Gaza Strip.

Sunday, 21 January 2024 9:52 AM
US intelligence agencies estimate that the death toll among Hamas fighters from Israel's ongoing aggression against the Gaza Strip falls short of the regime's goal of eliminating the Palestinian resistance group.
In a classified report, the spy agencies highlighted Hamas' resilience over the past months, saying the Israeli war has killed 20 to 30 percent of members of the resistance movement, the Wall Street Journal says.
""Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces in Gaza for months, and that the group is attempting to reconstitute its police force in parts of Gaza City,"" said US officials who confirmed the report.
Israeli officials have conceded that they have not achieved their goal of obliterating Hamas despite killing thousands of civilians in the aggressive air and ground campaign on Gaza, the report added.
It also cited military analysts as referring to adjusted tactics by Hamas fighters, saying they are operating in smaller groups and hiding between ambushes on Israeli troops, while individual fighters are likely taking on more tasks to pick up the slack from their martyred comrades.
Israel waged the genocidal war on besieged Gaza on October 7 after Hamas carried out Operation Al-Aqsa Storm in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.
However, more than three months into the offensive, the usurping regime seems stuck in the Gaza quagmire despite killing 25,105 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring more than 62,000 others.
The report said that US officials have begun to scale down their expectations for the Gaza war and that they have urged Israel to shift toward more targeted operations aimed at Hamas' leadership.
Hamas can still fight despite casualties
The US estimated that Hamas had between 25,000 and 30,000 fighters before the Gaza offensive in addition to thousands of police and other forces, according to the report.
The Israeli military estimated that it has killed about 9,000 out of at least 30,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza with over 1,000 during the October 7 attack, amounting to about 30 percent of the resistance group's total fighting force.
Citing a senior Israeli military official, the report said as many as 16,000 Hamas fighters have been wounded and about half of those will not return to the battlefield.
It further noted that the US estimates between 10,500 and 11,700 resistance fighters have been injured, many of those could eventually return to the battle ground.
In US military doctrine, a conventional force that loses 25%-30% of its fighters would be considered combat-ineffective. But Hamas is an irregular force fighting a defensive war in a dense urban environment and has access to hundreds of miles of tunnels under Gaza.
It has shown that it can still fight, said retired Army General Joseph Votel, who commanded US military operations in the Middle East.
Recently, the Israeli military withdraw thousands of forces from the Gaza Strip in the first significant troop pullback since the devastating war began.
An Israeli military officer said Hamas authorities have returned to Gaza City, including to areas previously held by the regime's army.
""It's only a matter of time if Israel will not be boots on the ground in these places and that they will also bring back the military wing,"" said Michael Milshtein, a former head of Palestinian affairs for Israeli military intelligence."

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]
The UK Ministry of Defence reported that   in recent months, there have been heating breakdowns in 16 locations across Russia. These breakdowns amidst sub-freezing temperatures are an expansion of an existing problem that has plagued Russian cities and towns for decades, but has likely become more acute due to Russian wartime policies.
Russia has routinely prioritised military spending over re-investment in qeneral public infrastructure, especially since their invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Many regional governments have been asked to take on theburden of operating with less federal revenue and have been asked to fund local volunteer forces, which has likely stretched their budgets and necessitated some cuts to maintenance spending. Additionally, mobilisation has likely led to a workforce shortage across all industries including qualified heating engineers and plumbers
Putin has asked the Minister of Emergency Situations, AleksandrKurenkov, to ensure the supply of heating and electricity to residents. Appearing to tackle this issue is likely a key concern for Putin ahead of the forthcoming Russian presidential elections.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day of January 25, there were 65x combat engagements. Russian forces launched a total of 2x missile and 18x air strikes, carried out 49x MLRS attacks at the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements.

On Tuesday, Mohammad Qobadlou was executed by Iranian authorities after being arrested and sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 protests in Iran. The European Union strongly condemns this execution and calls once again on the Iranian authorities to immediately end the practice of imposing and carrying out death sentences against protesters.
The use of capital punishment as a response to domestic dissent is unacceptable. The increase in executions recorded last year in Iran and the current pace of executions are appalling.
The European Union urges the Iranian authorities to refrain from applying the death penalty and carrying out future executions, and calls on Iran to pursue a consistent policy towards the abolition of the death penalty altogether. It is also imperative for the Iranian authorities to uphold the accused individuals' due process rights, and ensure that those who are under any form of detention or imprisonment are not subject to any form of mistreatment.
The EU urges the Iranian authorities to uphold their obligations under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a party. Fundamental rights, including the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, must be respected in all circumstances.
The EU reiterates its firm and principled opposition to the use of death penalty at all times and in all circumstances. It represents an ultimate denial of human dignity, fails to act as a deterrent to crime and makes miscarriage of justice irreversible."

Tehran, IRNA -- Irish Foreign Minister Michael Martin has emphasized an immediate end to the barbaric crimes committed by the Zionist regime in Gaza, saying that his country may join a case by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the Israeli genocide.
In a memo published by Irish Independent daily, Martin wrote that ""every day we see images on TV and social media, which show terrible deaths of civilians including children, as well as mass displacement and destruction, and insufficient access by the United Nations and international institutions to provide vital humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza"", IRNA reported on Saturday night.
The top Irish diplomat called those conditions unacceptable, saying that the Al-Aqsa Storm Operation ""cannot justify the terrible impact of the Israeli military operation on civilians in Gaza.""
He also said that the case brought by South Africa at the ICJ is based on the 1948 International Genocide Convention and follows deep concerns around the world about what is happening in Gaza.
The Irish foreign minister stated that the case should be followed with utmost seriousness because ""genocide is the biggest crime against humanity.""
The Hague-based ICJ began hearings on South Africa's genocide case against the Israeli regime on January 11.

Ukrainian officials said Russia launched a barrage of missiles at Tuesday that killed at least seven people and wounded more than 60 others while damaging numerous residential buildings in Kyiv and Kharkiv.
Ukraine's air force said Ukrainian air defenses shot down 21 of 41 Russian missiles.
The attacks mainly targeted the capital, Kyiv, as well as the city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine.
Oleh Synehubov, Kharkiv's regional governor, said three people were killed and 42 wounded.
Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the Russian strikes damaged 30 apartment buildings.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attacks hit several of the capital's districts, wounding at least 20 people.

Military aid
The United States is convening the latest meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, bringing together partners to discuss support for Ukraine's military even as U.S. President Joe Biden faces opposition from some Republicans in the U.S. Congress on a new aid package for Ukraine.
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that while the United States is committed to Ukraine, lawmakers need to pass more funding for Kyiv as it battles Russian forces.
""Our partners, our allies continue to do that, despite the fact that we do not have a supplemental [funding bill] that's been passed by Congress,"" Singh told reporters.
Biden has requested $61.4 billion in additional military funding for Ukraine as well as for replenishing U.S. stocks as Ukraine nears the two-year mark of its war with Russia. The funds sought for Ukraine are part of a supplemental funding request that also includes $14.3 billion for Israel and $13.6 billion for U.S. border protection.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will attend the meeting virtually from his house, as the defense chief continues to recover from complications of prostate cancer treatment that led to his secret hospitalization, the Pentagon said Monday.
Lavrov at the U.N.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday attended a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine in New York.
At the meeting, requested by Russia, Lavrov focused on U.S. and European arms support to Ukraine, saying the aid was dragging out the conflict. He did not address Western accusations that Moscow has been procuring drones and missiles from Iran and North Korea.
""It is cynicism of the highest order to claim that legitimate and lawful support for Ukraine's self-defense is prolonging Russia's war of aggression,"" U.S. envoy Robert Wood told the council.
More than 40 ambassadors joined Ukraine's envoy in the reading of a public statement ahead of the meeting. The statement condemned Russia's aggression and its procurement of weapons from Iran and North Korea - which is a violation of several U.N. Security Council resolutions.
""The Russian Federation's actions undermine the credibility of Security Council resolutions, undermine the global non-proliferation regime, exacerbate regional tensions, and endanger us all,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Sergiy Kyslytsya read on behalf of the group.
Asked by a reporter if Ukraine can win the war, Kyslytsya said, ""Ukraine will win this war. But not only Ukraine, but all the democratic world.""
Next month marks two years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

As heightened tensions in the Middle East raise the risk of a broader regional conflict, the United States has blamed Iranian-backed militants for an attack on a U.S. military base in Iraq, Israel has been accused of killing members of an Iranian-backed extremist group in Lebanon, and Tehran has accused Israel of killing members of the Iranian military in Syria in an incident Tehran says will not go unanswered.
U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, said on January 20 that ""multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in western Iraq targeting the Al-Assad Air Base,"" which is one of the largest U.S. military bases in Iraq.
CENTCOM said most of the missiles were intercepted but some had hit the base, at which about 2,500 U.S. soldiers are currently stationed.
""A number of U.S. personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries,"" CENTCOM said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""At least one Iraqi service member was wounded.""
The attack comes as Iranian-backed proxies and partners have stepped up their strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria amid Israel's ongoing war against Iranian-backed Hamas -- which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union -- in the Gaza Strip.
Iranian officials have said that attacks by members of its ""axis of resistance"" against Israel and the West -- including Hamas, Lebanese Hizballah, and Yemen's Huthi rebels -- will not cease until a cease-fire is worked out halting ongoing fighting in the Gaza Strip.
Iranian state media reporting on the CENTCOM statement described the attack as having been carried out by ""Iraqi resistance"" forces, while saying the Islamic republic has denied using proxy forces in the Middle East.
Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas after it and other Palestinian extremist groups carried out a deadly surprise assault on Israel on October 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
The resulting three months of war have left more than 20,000 Palestinians dead, according to observers. Iran, which fails to recognize Israel as a state and considers it one of its greatest enemies along with the United States, has positioned itself as one of the leading voices against Israel and for the Palestinian cause since the war in Gaza began.
Tehran has also accused Israel of involvement in twin bombings in Iran early this month despite the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, which Iran has fought in Syria and Iraq, claiming responsibility. Israel has denied any role in the bombings in the southeastern city of Kerman that killed nearly 100 people.
On January 15, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out Iran's longest-ever strike by firing multiple ballistic missiles into northwestern Syria to attack what it called ""terrorist bases"" of IS and other extremist groups.
The same day, the IRGC launched ballistic missiles into Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region that targeted what it claimed was a ""spy headquarters"" operated by Israel. Israel has not commented on the allegation.
On January 20, Iran accused Israel of striking a building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, used by the IRGC. The strike, according to the IRGC, killed five of its members.
Various media reported that a senior officer the IRGC's elite foreign arm, the Quds Force, was among those killed, which reportedly included three Syrians, one Lebanese, and one Iraqi.
Reports also suggested a senior member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organization that took part in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 was killed.
Israel has not commented on the incident.
On January 20, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi threatened Israel with retaliation, saying it would not let the alleged attack go unanswered.
The next day, Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf accused Israel of carrying out the attack in Syria in an act of ""desperation"" due to alleged battlefield defeats and embarrassment related to the Gaza war.
Later on January 21, security sources in Lebanon said two Lebanese Hizballah fighters were killed in what they called an Israeli drone strike in southern Lebanon, in what would be the latest to target Lebanese Hizballah fighters in the area.

A federal jury in Boston has convicted a Chinese music student on charges of stalking and harassing one of his Chinese classmates after she posted flyers in support of democracy in China around the campus of the Berklee College of Music in the fall of 2022.
According to evidence presented at the trial and court documents, Xiaolei Wu, 25, sent his classmate online messages in late October of that year after she posted flyers that read: ""We want democracy,"" ""We want freedom"" and ""Stand with the Chinese people.""
Wu threatened to chop off her hands and demanded she tear down the ""reactionary posters.""
Wu also told the individual, who was referred to in court as Zooey, that he had informed public security authorities in China about her actions and that they would go to ""greet"" her family.
During the four-day trial, Wu's lawyers argued that his comments were not threats but just an ""immature"" online dispute between two young people who knew each other and had different political views. His lawyers also said he was trying to remind his classmate of the consequences her actions could have back in China.
However, the federal jury Thursday found Wu guilty on charges of cyberstalking and threats. Both charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000. Wu will face sentencing on April 24.
After the guilty verdict was announced, prosecutors requested that Wu be immediately detained, citing concerns that he is a flight risk and that Chinese authorities have repeatedly expressed concern about the case. However, after listening to the opinions of the defense and prosecutors, Wu was granted bail. The judge said that Wu had not previously violated the conditions of his bail and that those requirements would remain in place.
Wu is barred from changing his address, entering the Berklee campus, or contacting those involved in the case. He has surrendered his passport and cannot leave the state of Massachusetts.
Case spotlights efforts to quiet critics
Wu's trial highlights a growing problem that U.S. and other Western authorities have been working to counter â China's efforts to silence its critics abroad.
In a U.S. Department of Justice statement following the announcement of Wu's conviction, Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the District of Massachusetts noted the Justice Department's commitment to free speech for all.
""No one in this country should ever be subjected to threats of violence or a cyberstalking harassment campaign for expressing their political views,"" Levy said.
Special Agent in Charge Jodi Cohen of the FBI Boston Division added: ""What Xiaolei Wu did in attempting to silence and intimidate an activist who expressed dissension with the ruling Communist Party of China is not only criminal, but completely against our country's democratic values.""
VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment on the case but has yet to receive a response.
Flyers echo protest banner
Wu's classmate Zooey posted the flyers around Berklee's campus at a time when many Chinese around the world were inspired by the courage of a lone man in Beijing. The man, Peng Lifa, hung a large protest banner on a bridge on a busy street in the country's capital in October 2022 with similar slogans.
Some of the slogans on the large banner, such as ""We don't want [dictatorial] leaders, we want elections"" and ""We don't want Cultural Revolution, we want reform,"" were protests against Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Other slogans, such as ""We don't want nucleic acid testing, we want food to eat"" and ""We don't want lockdowns, we want freedom,"" highlighted the frustration that many felt at the time with China's draconian COVID-19 controls.
Peng was quickly arrested after hanging the banner and remains in custody at an undisclosed location. Sources told VOA's Mandarin Service in October of last year that authorities have yet to deliver any legal documents related to his case, and his relatives and friends have been unable to hire a lawyer to provide him with legal assistance.
According to Weiquanwang, a Chinese blog that posts updates on rights abuses and cases in China, Peng marked his 50th birthday earlier this month in secret detention. His whereabouts and health condition are unknown, the site said, quoting an anonymous source."

""I was having coffee at home this morning in Kyiv, my neighbours were getting ready for work, children preparing to go to school, when our homes started to shake because of a wave of airstrikes on the Ukrainian capital,"" Denise Brown said in a statement.
The attacks damaged civilian buildings just next to the UN office in Kyiv, she said, adding that homes also were damaged and civilians ""who were only trying to continue with their lives despite the war are now hospitalized.""
End 'brutal' attacks
Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, also came under attack.  Roughly 30 residential buildings were reportedly damaged and six people were killed.
Ms. Brown said the UN team on the ground reported that rescuers were trying to find people under the rubble of one of the buildings. The wave of aerial assaults also caused loss and destruction in the Dnipro Region.
""These strikes are yet another bitter reminder of the devastation, suffering and distress that Russia's invasion is causing for millions of people in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Brutal and indiscriminate attacks against civilians must stop.""
UNHCR alarmed by surge in Rohingya deaths at sea
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, on Tuesday called for urgent action to address the dramatic rise in deaths of Rohingya refugees at sea.
The Rohingya are a mainly Muslim community whose members have fled waves of persecution in Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh. Scores have been departing from Bangladesh and, to a lesser extent, Myanmar, in recent months.
UNHCR said statistics reveal a surge in the number who reportedly are dying or going missing while taking risky boat journeys in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
Roughly 569 Rohingya were reported to have died or disappeared in 2023 - the highest number since 2014, when the total reached 730, and 200 more than in 2022.
Mostly women and children
Additionally, nearly 4,500 embarked on deadly sea journeys in 2023, marking a significant increase on previous years. The majority of those making these crossings, around 66 per cent, are women and children.
Estimates show that one Rohingya was reported to have died or gone missing for every eight attempting the journey in 2023, making the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal one of the deadliest stretches of water in the world.
""In a single deadly incident in November 2023, it is feared that some 200 Rohingya lost their lives when their boat was reported to have sunk in the Andaman Sea,"" said   UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh, speaking in Geneva.
UNHCR called on regional authorities to take urgent action to prevent future tragedies, reminding them of the international obligation to save lives and rescue those in distress at sea.
ECOSOC meeting puts the world of work in the spotlight
The rapid transformation of the world of work is the focus of a special meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) that opened in Santiago, Chile, on Tuesday.
Although factors such as emerging technologies, globalization and demographic trends offer exciting opportunities for enhanced productivity and innovation, they also present challenges - both for workers and policymakers.
In her opening remarks, ECOSOC President Paula NarvÃ¡ez stressed how decent work, job creation, social protection, workers' rights, and social dialogue are crucial for sustainable development.
She appealed for increased investment to create more decent jobs.
""Greater cooperation, additional international financing, and technical assistance can complement national resources to expand decent work and access to social protection.  A coordinated effort is needed to counter informality and create policies that require living wages, secure contracts, and good working conditions,"" she said.
Ensuring future opportunities
Making the future of work one of opportunity is not automatic, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said in a video message to the meeting.
She warned that ""the needle will not move in the direction of our ambitions"" unless countries keep the promise to leave no one behind.
""This means acting on the stubbornly high rates of youth unemployment; on the persistent gender disparities in wages, labour market participation and access to social protection,"" she said.
She added that ""unregulated digitalization""  is also a driver of inequalities.
""When properly harnessed, digital tools can accelerate job creation and help expand social protection, as seen in many countries during COVID-19 - a time when we also came to realize the value of cultivating caring societies,"" she said.
Commemorations and celebrations
The two-day special meeting is being held at the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), which is based in the Chilean capital.
It will feature plenary sessions, interactive roundtable discussions, and a side event to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of both ECLAC and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as a special celebration of the legacy of Chilean lawyer and diplomat HernÃ¡n Santa Cruz, one of the original drafters of the Declaration."

25 January 2024
The UK and US have imposed co-ordinated sanctions on the Houthis   today to disrupt their ability to carry out attacks on international   shipping in the Red Sea, and promote the peace, stability and security   of Yemen.
Four key Houthi figures involved in the attacks will be subject to UK asset freezes, arms embargoes and travel bans.
This is the first sanctions action against the Houthis co-ordinated   between the UK and US since the attacks in the Red Sea began in   November. Pre-existing sanctions against 11 Houthi individuals and 2   entities remain in force. This includes Houthi Security Chief Sultan   Zabin, who was sanctioned by the UN in February 2021, for heading a   campaign of systematic arrest, detention, torture, sexual violence and   rape against politically active women in Yemen.
Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:
These sanctions reinforce our clear message to the Houthis in   recent weeks.  We can degrade their ability to attack international   shipping.  We are determined to protect freedom of navigation.  We will   back our words with actions.
With our allies, we will continue to target   those responsible for the Houthis' unacceptable and illegal actions,   which risk innocent seafarers' lives and disrupt aid deliveries to the   Yemeni people.
Since illegally seizing power in 2014, the Houthis have waged   economic warfare at the expense of ordinary Yemenis, and carried out   numerous human rights abuses against the Yemeni people - including   routine and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, recruitment of child   soldiers and restricting the rights and freedoms of women.
By continuing to attack ships in the Red Sea, the Houthis are   imperilling the delivery of vital aid from reaching Yemen, which is   reliant on food imports. UK aid helps feed 100,000 Yemeni people every   month, our Yemen Sanctions Regulations include a humanitarian exemption   to protect this vital work.
Those now subject to UK action today are:
The individuals are also subject to a travel ban and will be unable to enter the UK.
Today's action also follows strikes on 11 January and 22 January against a number of targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, led by   the United States and United Kingdom, with support from the   Netherlands, Canada, Bahrain, and Australia.
It also follows a meeting between the Foreign Secretary and the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian at this year's World Economic Forum, where the Foreign Secretary made   it clear that the Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are illegal   and unacceptable, and called on Iran to use its influence with the   Houthis to prevent further threats."

22 Jan 2024 | By Johannes Schmidt, Office of Public Affairs and Communication, MARCORSYSCOM Marine Corps Systems Command
MARINE CORPS BASE QUANTICO, Va. -- In a decisive move meant to ensure dominance over the electromagnetic spectrum, Marine Corps Systems Command is on track to upgrade 50,000 legacy radios with state-of-the-art multi-channel, crypto-compliant models in Fiscal Year 2024.
In line with Force Design's call for rapid force modernization, MARCORSYSCOM's Program Manager for Communications Systems, or PM CS, team has moved quicklyâ fielding more than 4,000 radios across the fleet since October 2023.
In recent years, experts have warned that stagnation in U.S. electromagnetic spectrum operations-- the strategic and tactical management of electromagnetic frequencies for military communications, intelligence, and combat operations-- has enabled our adversaries to significantly challenge American dominance in this crucial domain.
Recognizing this urgent need for change, the 2018 National Defense Strategy laid the foundation for the Department of Defense's 2020 Electromagnetic Spectrum, or EMS, Superiority Strategyâa document that emphasizes the EMS as a critical battleground where invisible waves and frequencies become pivotal in modern warfare.
With this new strategic reality in mind, PM CS has worked tirelessly to update the fleet's radio capabilities, ensuring that the fleet has the communications capabilities required to fight and win-- no matter the clime, place, or electromagnetic environment.
""We began fielding in October, focusing on a specific domain while being mindful of the capabilities of multi-channel radios,"" explained Richard Sessions, program manager for Communications Systems. ""In addition to their enhanced functionality, our priority was to transition to radios that meet cryptographic compliance standards mandated by the NSA. This compliance allows us to operate securely across various frequencies and within a secure environment. Our deadline for achieving this compliance is set for December 31, 2024.""
The new multi-channel radios provide the warfighter with a versatile, software-defined system that emphasizes modularity and flexibility to allow rapid integration of new waveforms and cryptographic standards. This enhances Marines' ability to operate securely and effectively in the dynamically evolving electromagnetic environment.
""The closest analogy to our current transition in radio technology is akin to moving from the era of flip phones to the advanced world of smartphones,"" said Sessions. ""In the past, we were limited to purchasing radios with fixed capabilities and had to replace them with newer models as technology evolved. Now, we're shifting towards acquiring highly adaptable hardware radios that are not just modular but also capable of supporting new waveforms, marking a significant milestone in our communication capabilities.""
As the Corps prepares to fight and win on the future battlefield, these fieldings prove crucial as superiority in the electromagnetic spectrum directly influences communication, intelligence, and combat effectivenessâsafeguarding the warfighter's strategic advantage ahead of the future fight.
In order to address challenges in transitioning from hardware-centric management to waveform and software configuration management, the PM CS team maintains regular contact with NSA partners. This ensures alignment and approvals for the necessary waveforms and configurations.
However, the team noted that communication with the fleet is also critical, underscoring the importance of Marine feedback throughout the acquisition process.
According to Stephenie Dodge, product manager at PM CS, ""Our team has conducted extensive testing and field user evaluations involving Marine units to ensure that our systems meet their needs. In every aspect of our work, we actively involve Marines from the fleet. We provide them with the equipment, offer quick training sessions, and then seek their input on how they would use it, what improvements are needed, and what aspects need fixing.""
Ultimately, this effort is critical within the context of Force Design's ambitious modernization goals. As Sessions highlighted, Tactical Communications Modernization bolsters our operational capabilities, securing robust communication and efficient data flow.
""In today's Marine Corps operations, where combat often unfolds within the electromagnetic spectrum, our success relies heavily on maintaining effective communication across the fleet and with joint forces,"" said Sessions. ""Controlling this space is critical, as it directly impacts our physical deployment capabilities. A key focus in our communication systems' rollout is minimizing detection and interception risks. We're dedicated to making our systems challenging for the enemy to locate and disrupt, thereby enhancing the operational security and effectiveness of our units in this digital battlespace.""
Despite the logistical challenges associated with the modernization of the fleet's radio capability, the PM CS team is on track for a successful fielding. In a transformative move for Marine communications, the planned deployment of 30,000 multi-channel radios by December 31, 2024, is poised to significantly enhance the communication capabilities of Marines in the field, marking a crucial advancement in military communications technology."

China maintains close communication with both Iran and Pakistan, and is willing to continue playing a positive and constructive role in improving the relationship according to their needs, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated on Monday, with Chinese experts noting that as a responsible power, China has played a crucial part in promoting the relationship between the two countries in the long run.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks during a regular press conference on Monday when asked about whether China is mediating between Iran and Pakistan after the two countries conducted strikes inside each other's territory.
Wang said China maintains close communication with Iran and Pakistan, emphasizing that the two countries are friendly neighbors and both are good friends of China. The spokesperson noted that China has always been committed to maintaining regional and international peace and stability, supporting Iran and Pakistan in resolving their differences through dialogue and consultation.
""China is also willing to continue playing a positive and constructive role in improving the relationship between the two countries according to their needs,"" Wang said.
On Sunday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu had a phone call with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani, during which the two sides had an exchange of views on regional and international issues of mutual interest and concern.
Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong met with Pakistani Foreign Secretary Mohammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan, on Saturday. The two sides had an exchange of views on the current international and regional situation, stressing that China and Pakistan will strengthen coordination and cooperation and jointly contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.
""While having friendly relations with both countries, China is committed to promoting the relationship between Iran and Pakistan in the long run,"" Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Monday.
Qian noted that China has played a crucial role as a responsible power by promoting bilateral relations of the two countries and regional peace and stability unaffected by issues such as border disputes between Iran and Pakistan.
Chinese experts said that Iran and Pakistan respect China's role in regional and international affairs, and China will continue to play an essential part as a mediator, so as to promote Iran and Pakistan to resolve their differences through diplomatic channels, as well as to build trust and dispel doubts.
According to Reuters, Pakistan launched strikes inside Iran on Thursday, two days after Tehran said it struck the bases of another group within Pakistani territory.
In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday that China believes that relations between countries should be handled in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law and that countries' sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity should be respected and safeguarded.
Mao said that Iran and Pakistan are close neighbors and both have influence and keep friendly relations with China, and China sincerely hopes that the two sides will remain calm and restraint and avoid escalation of the tension. ""If there is need from the two sides, we would like to play a constructive role in cooling down the situation,"" Mao noted."

Military means cannot resolve the Red Sea crisis: experts
By Chen Qingqing Published: Jan 21, 2024 11:06 PM
With global concerns rising over the prolonged Red Sea crisis, which not only causes a severe impact on shipping routes but also poses risks to the post-pandemic economic recovery, China has called for an end to attacks on civilian ships and urged the parties concerned to avoid adding fuel to the tensions in the Red Sea, as some Chinese experts noted that US military actions are exacerbating the Red Sea crisis.
China has been making active efforts to ease tensions in the Red Sea from the very beginning, having called for an end to the attacks on civilian ships and urged relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the tensions in the Red Sea, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in an interview with the media after concluding his trip to Africa.
During Wang's visit, discussions were held on addressing the spillover effects of the Gaza conflict, particularly on safeguarding the security of the Red Sea navigation channels, Wang said. China calls for an end to the harassment of civilian vessels, and urges relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the fire, jointly safeguard the security of the sea lanes in accordance with the law, and earnestly respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries bordering the Red Sea, including Yemen.
The structure of the global benchmark Brent crude futures market and some physical markets in Europe and Africa have been reflecting tighter supply partly over concerns about shipping delays as vessels have avoided or tried to avoid the Red Sea due to missile and drone attacks, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday.
US Central Command forces struck a Houthi anti-ship missile prepared to launch and aimed at the Gulf of Aden on Saturday, Voice of America reported on Saturday. It was the US military's seventh strike against Houthi missile launchers in a week.
The White House said the strikes are necessary to protect merchant ships and US Navy vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, according to the VOA.
The Red Sea crisis is an international issue that affects global supply chains and the security of maritime trade routes, involving stakeholders from around the globe. Addressing the Red Sea crisis should not involve forming exclusive, small multilateral organizations with ""high walls"" but rather involve a collective effort to resolve the crisis, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday.
The root of the Red Sea crisis lies in the Palestinian region. Without addressing this root cause, merely attempting to resolve the crisis in the Red Sea is likely insufficient, Sun noted. ""The motive behind the Houthi rebels intercepting commercial ships in the Red Sea is to strike against Israel, signaling the need for Israel to resolve the conflict and end the collective punishment of people in the Gaza Strip.""
Some experts noted that military means alone cannot resolve the Red Sea crisis. The frequent strikes by the US and Western forces against the Houthi rebels actually lead to the rise of more anti-American forces, including the unification of forces like Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthi rebels.
""This approach of meeting violence with violence only creates more conflicts and confrontations, escalating the crisis,"" Sun said.
The spillover of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is escalating in the directions of Syria, Lebanon and the Red Sea, presenting a coordinated uptick in tensions, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday.
""The conflict between the US and Israel and the Iran-led resistance front is intensifying, consequently elevating the risk of a direct confrontation between the US and Israel, and Iran,"" Liu said.
Although neither the US nor Iran desires to be drawn into a large-scale conflict or war, the current trajectory suggests an increasing risk of the US becoming further entangled in Middle Eastern conflicts, Liu noted.
The Palestinian issue remains at the core of the Middle East issue, touching on the peace and stability of the region and testing the moral conscience of humanity, Wang told the media.
China firmly supports the just cause of the Palestinian people in regaining their legitimate national rights and steadfastly supports the long-standing aspiration of the Palestinians to establish an independent state, he said.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down on opposition to an independent Palestinian state, deepening the division between Israel and its allies including the US, as US President Joe Biden said on Friday that he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for creating an independent Palestine state, according to media reports.
""Before a cease-fire in Gaza, it's impossible to launch any negotiations for a two-state solution. For Israel, the most urgent task now is to resolve the Gaza crisis,"" Liu said."

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico says he will tell his Ukrainian counterpart that Slovakia would reject Ukraine joining NATO because its membership would mean ""nothing other than a basis for World War III.""
Fico is preparing to travel to Ukraine on January 24 to meet Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal for talks in the border city of Uzhhorod.
One reason for the visit is to present a further aid package, but Fico said in an interview on January 20 with a Slovak public broadcaster that he would also make clear the Slovak position on Ukraine's desire to join NATO.
""I will tell [Shmyhal] that I am against the membership of Ukraine in NATO and that I will veto it,"" Fico said, adding that if Ukraine were in NATO, ""some conflicts will be constantly instigated there,"" and ""once a clash happens between Russia and a NATO member state, we will have a world war.""
NATO in July reaffirmed its position that Ukraine will one day become a member of the alliance, and members voted to simplify Ukraine's path to accession, such as the removal of the requirement for a Membership Action Plan. NATO has also formed the NATO-Ukraine Council to improve relations. However, NATO members are torn over when to admit Ukraine, and no vote or decision on membership is imminent.
Slovakia, which has been a member of NATO since 2004, was long one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. But when Fico's left-wing nationalist government took power in October, Slovakia decided to no longer supply Kyiv with weapons.
Fico also asserted in the interview that Ukraine is not an independent and sovereign country, saying it is ""under the total influence and control of the United States."" The remark repeated a baseless claim that Russia has made repeatedly.
Fico said the trip was very important to him and he will be interested to hear what kind of solution Ukraine has to end the war, adding that in his view current policies mean ""having 200,000 more people dead.""
He believes that some kind of a compromise will be necessary to end the fighting and ""it will be very painful for both sides.""
During his visit he will offer humanitarian aid -- Bratislava continues to send mine-clearing systems and diesel generators -- but no weapons from the army or state reserves of Slovakia.
Fico also said Slovakia was in favor of Ukraine joining the European Union as long as the country fulfills the same conditions as other candidates.
""I will tell [Shmyhal] that we respect them, but they must meet the conditions,"" he said, adding that in his view there cannot be a political accession to the EU ""by a country that absolutely doesn't meet any requirements.""
He said he will tell Ukrainian officials that their country is ""one of the most corrupt countries in the world"" and questioned how much of the aid the country receives ""gets lost or channeled toward some criminal structures.""

Criticism pours in after the Israeli regime attacks a United Nations' facility in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza Strip, which has endured more than three months and a half of an unrelenting genocidal Israeli war.
The world body reported the attack shortly after it took place on Wednesday.
It said the strike had targeted the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)'s vocational training center in the city, which had turned into a shelter for tens of thousands of Palestinians, who have been displaced by the war.
'Mass casualties'
""Mass casualties have taken place, some buildings are ablaze and there are reports of deaths. Many people are trying to flee the scene, but [are] unable to do so,"" said UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Palestinian Territory, James McGoldrick.
Thomas White, director of Gaza affairs for UNRWA, said two tank rounds had hit one of the center's buildings, where some 800 displaced people had been sheltering, killing at least nine people and wounding 75 others.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said the death toll was probably higher.
'Clearly marked UN facility, blatant disregard for rules of war'
""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility and its coordinates were shared with Israeli authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" Lazzarini said.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths, meanwhile, said, ""Ordering trapped people to evacuate and bombing them before they can even do so is callous.""
The Israeli regime's staunchest ally, the United States, which has been providing the war with unwavering military and political support, only sufficed to deplore the attack, saying the protected nature of UN facilities had to be respected.
The regime has been waging the war since October 7, 2023 following an operation carried out by Gaza's resistance movements.
Around 25,700 Palestinians, some 70 percent of whom are women, children, and adolescents, have been killed in the brutal onslaught so far."

Polish and Ukrainian leaders pledged Monday to bolster their alliance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, putting aside differences over the recent Polish blockade of Ukrainian trucks trying to enter the European Union.
In his first visit to Kyiv since being elected prime minster of Poland, Donald Tusk described Ukraine's defensive war against the Russian invasion as a ""battle"" between ""good and evil,"" adding, ""Poland will do everything to increase Ukraine's chances of victory in this war.""
""The security of the Polish nation and the Polish state is also at stake in this fight,"" Tusk said at a joint media briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Relations between the two countries had soured in recent months because of Polish blockades against Ukrainian trucks at the border.
Polish truckers enforced the blockade from November until last week, protesting Ukrainian truckers' permit-free access into the EU.
The EU had waived the permits system after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Polish truckers want it reintroduced, saying their earnings have taken a hit. The truckers agreed last week to suspend their protests until March 1.
Tusk returned to Polish politics last month after serving as president of the European Council.
Tusk and Zelenskyy hailed plans for joint arms production while Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter, that they had discussed a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukraine. He did not provide details.
Tusk's surprise trip to Kyiv coincided with Ukraine's Unity Day, commemorating the 1919 unification of western and eastern Ukraine, which has faced numerous invasions over its long history.
Zelenskyy marked the day by signing a decree offering dual Ukrainian citizenship to ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from all around the world, apart from Russia, as well as foreign fighters who took up arms alongside Ukrainian soldiers to defend Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
Drone attacks
Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said Monday that it had thwarted Russian drone attacks in multiple parts of the country overnight, while Russian officials accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a ""vicious"" attack in a Russia-controlled city in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian air force said its air defenses had downed eight drones launched by Russia, including in the skies over the Mykolaiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Officials said the drones had come from Russia's southern Primorsko-Akhtarsk region.
In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of using indiscriminate weapons and attacking civilian infrastructure, leaving at least 27 people dead in the city of Donetsk on Sunday.
Peskov also said Monday that Russia was taking necessary measures after a suspected Ukrainian attack on a Baltic Sea fuel export terminal.
Ukraine's military remained tight-lipped about both attacks.
US defense secretary
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will attend a meeting on Ukraine's military aid virtually from his house, as the defense chief continues to recover from complications of prostate cancer treatment that led to his secret hospitalization, the Pentagon said Monday.
Tuesday's virtual conference will mark Austin's first public engagement since treatment.
The meeting comes as Republicans in Congress have blocked President Joe Biden's emergency funding request for Ukraine, seeking increased security along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that while the United States is committed to Ukraine, lawmakers need to pass more funding for Kyiv as it battles Russian forces. ""Our partners, our allies continue to do that, despite the fact that we do not have a supplemental [funding bill] that's been passed by Congress,"" Singh told reporters.
Biden has requested $61.4 billion in additional military funding for Ukraine as well as for replenishing U.S. stocks as Ukraine nears the two-year mark of its war with Russia. The funds sought for Ukraine are part of a supplemental funding request that also includes $14.3 billion for Israel and $13.6 billion for U.S. border protection.
Lavrov at the UN
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday attended a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine in New York.
At the meeting, requested by Russia, Lavrov focused on U.S. and European arms support to Ukraine, saying the aid was dragging out the conflict. He did not address Western accusations that Moscow has been procuring drones and missiles from Iran and North Korea.
""It is cynicism of the highest order to claim that legitimate and lawful support for Ukraine's self-defense is prolonging Russia's war of aggression,"" U.S. envoy Robert Wood told the council.
More than 40 ambassadors joined Ukraine's envoy in the reading of a public statement ahead of the meeting. The statement condemned Russia's aggression and its procurement of weapons from Iran and North Korea - which is a violation of several U.N. Security Council resolutions.
""The Russian Federation's actions undermine the credibility of Security Council resolutions, undermine the global nonproliferation regime, exacerbate regional tensions and endanger us all,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Sergiy Kyslytsya read on behalf of the group.
Asked by a reporter whether Ukraine could win the war, Kyslytsya said, ""Ukraine will win this war. But not only Ukraine, but all the democratic world.""
Next month marks two years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Anti-drone technology is a rapidly evolving field aimed at countering the growing threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These systems utilize various methods such as radio frequency jamming, signal interference, and physical destruction to neutralize drones in the air.
Russia is finalizing tests of anti-drone mini-missiles that will soon be put into service with anti-aircraft missile systems (SAMs) in the special operation zone in Ukraine, an informed source told Sputnik.
""Enterprises of the defense industrial complex in cooperation with the military are completing tests of anti-drone mini-missiles. It is expected that in the near future they will be put into service with anti-aircraft missile systems, carrying out combat duty in the zone of the special military operation,"" the source said.
The missiles, according to the source, are primarily designed to destroy small UAVs, quadcopters, as well as FPV drones, which are actively used on the line of contact for reconnaissance and strikes. The source specified that the mini-missiles will be used as part of the modernized Pantsir-SM anti-aircraft missile systems, which began arriving in the special military operation zone last year.
The new missiles, the source noted, have a standard layout for the Pantsir complex - upper stage plus trailing stage, but with significantly reduced dimensions both in terms of diameter and length. As a result, a Pantsir-SM combat vehicle can be equipped with 48 anti-drone missiles instead of 12 standard missiles.
The new missiles are significantly cheaper than standard missiles, which will increase the economic efficiency of the Pantsir-SM, ""since it will not be necessary to hit drones with ammunition that costs at least ten times more than the target itself,"" the source added.
In August last year, the High-Precision Complexes holding, whose enterprises are building the mini-missiles, told Sputnik that after the tests are completed, the Defense Ministry will determine the conditions and volumes of missile deliveries to the troops.

U8K43YQ6Z4_WDLB30ZL3JXQ4JB,Ukrainian And Slovak PMs Agree To 'New Pragmatism' To Aid Strained Relations,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240124-rferl02.htm,"By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service January 24, 2024
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says he agreed with his Slovak counterpart, Robert Fico, on a policy of ""new pragmatism"" as the two neighbors try to improve relations that have soured since the populist Slovak leader won an election last year vowing to halt military aid to Kyiv.
The two met in the western Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod on January 24 to ""open a new page"" in bilateral relations, according to Shmyhal, just a day after Fico called life in Kyiv ""normal"" even though Russian missiles had rained down on the capital hours earlier.
After the meeting, Shmyhal said agreement was reached ""on a number of important issues"" that will allow Ukraine to purchase weapons and equipment directly from Slovak companies without government interference, and support from Bratislava for the Ukraine Facility program, which envisages the provision of 50 billion euros by the European Union for Ukraine.
""Despite all the political challenges, we are developing a policy of 'new pragmatism' in our relations,"" the Ukrainian prime minister said.
Since assuming office in October 2023, Fico has followed through on his campaign pledges to reorient Slovak foreign policy to be ""independent.""
At his first European Union summit in late October, Fico reiterated that Slovakia won't back further military aid to Ukraine, while also rejecting further international sanctions against Russia.
Earlier this week he said Slovakia rejects the admission of Ukraine to NATO because its membership would mean ""nothing else than a basis for World War III"" and that Kyiv would have to give up some territory to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022 because there was no military solution to the conflict.
His comments on January 23 about life in Kyiv struck a particularly sour note with Ukrainians given that dozens of people had been wounded during a barrage of Russian missiles.
After meeting Shmyhal, Fico appeared to strike a conciliatory tone, saying that while there are ""some issues where we might have different opinions, that's life.""
Fico assured Shmyhal that Ukraine had the ""full support"" of Slovakia to fulfill the country's ""European integration aspirations.""
In December, the EU voted to start membership talks with Ukraine despite hesitation among some members.
Ukraine is counting on quick steps in the first half of 2024 regarding the opening of negotiations on its bid to join the EU, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said this week, while also calling on the bloc to increase the supply of weapons and approve a long-term support program for Kyiv.

The Russian armed forces have launched a group precision strike with long-range missiles on Ukrainian military-industrial complex facilities producing missiles, ammunition and explosives, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.
""This morning, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a strike with long-range air and ground-based precision weapons against facilities of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex that produce missiles and their components, ammunition and explosives. The objective of the strike was achieved. All the targeted facilities were hit,"" the ministry said.
Russian troops in the Donetsk region have destroyed more than 280 Ukrainian servicemen, a tank and an electronic warfare station, the Russian Defense Ministry has said.
""The enemy lost over 280 military personnel killed and wounded, one tank, two infantry fighting vehicles, six vehicles, a D-30 howitzer,"" the ministry said.
Russian forces repelled six attacks by Ukraine in the Kupyansk area in the areas of the settlements of Synkeevka, Tabaevka in the Kharkov region and Makeevka of the Lugansk People's Republic, the ministry said.
The Ukrainian troops lost about 260 servicepeople in the Kupyansk and Krasny Liman directions during the day
The Russian military hit the control point of the operational tactical group of the Ukraine armed forces Liman, as well as repelled four attacks near the settlements of Yampoleevka, Debrova and Serebryansky forest area.
Kiev also lost over 105 soldiers in the South Donetsk direction in the past day, the Russian Defense Ministry concluded.

Mohammad Qobadlou, who was handed a death sentence in 2022 for allegedly killing a police officer during the nationwide ""Women, Life, Freedom"" protests against the Islamic republic's leadership, has been executed despite calls by rights groups to stop the process after he was diagnosed with a mental condition.
Qobadlou, 23, was arrested during the protests that broke out after the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Tehran's morality police for an alleged head scarf violation. He was charged with murder after being accused of running over police officers, killing one and injuring five.
Prior to Qobadlou's execution, his lawyer Amir Raisian said his client's execution had ""no legal permit"" because the Supreme Court had struck down his death sentence and the case had been referred to a new jurisdiction for reevaluation due to a diagnosis from doctors that Qobadlou suffered from bipolar disorder.
""As a result of the execution of Mohammad Qobadlou's sentence, he no longer has legal [recourse] and this can undoubtedly be considered murder,"" Raisian said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
The judiciary-run Mizan news agency rejected Raisian's comments, saying the Supreme Court last year had issued a ""stay of execution"" and that medical professionals determined that Qobadlou was not suffering from mental health conditions when he committed the alleged crime.
However, a spokesman for the Supreme Court last year told Iranian state media that the court had ""overturned"" the death sentence after doctors determined that Qobadlou was, in fact, suffering from bipolar disorder.
Masoumeh Ahmaidi, Qobadlou's mother, stated in a video last year that her son had discontinued his medication prior to the protests.
Hours before the execution, Amnesty International called on the Iranian authorities to stop Qobadlou's ""arbitrary and unlawful execution"" and highlighted his mental health condition.
The rights group insisted that the entire case against Qobadlou was ""based on confessions obtained in secret and under torture.""
A flurry of reactions followed as news of Qobadlou's imminent execution spread on social media on the evening of January 22.
Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi called for protests while exiled opposition leader and former crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, criticized what he described as a lack of a fair trial for Qobadlou.
Several human rights groups, including the Norway-based Iran Human Rights, have noted multiple flaws in the case.
German Parliament representative Clara Buenger, who was Qobadlou's political sponsor, and Canadian lawmaker Melissa Lantsman, among others, had demanded a stop to the execution.
Qobadlou is the ninth person to be executed in connection with the 2022 protests.

Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA) The inauguration of the Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, which took place in the capital Majuro on Monday, was attended by dignitaries from around the world including Taiwan, and saw the new leader reaffirming her support for strong Marshall Islands-Taiwan ties.
At her inauguration, messages of congratulations were read out, including from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (è¡è±æ), and representatives from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Japan, Palau, and the United States, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) press release.
Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang (ç°ä¸­å), who attended the inauguration as a special envoy of President Tsai, said both countries share the values of democracy and freedom, referencing the fact both have just conducted national elections.
President Heine, meanwhile, reaffirmed the 26 years of strong ties between the two nations, adding that her administration will continue to cherish the long-standing friendship, MOFA said in its press release.
Heine also once again congratulated Vice President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸å¾·) of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for being elected president on Jan. 13, and praised Taiwan as a model of democracy, MOFA added.
Heine was elected president on Jan. 2, 2024, by a 17-16 margin over David Kabua, who ousted Heine in 2020 after her previous stint as president from 2016 to 2020 by a 20-12 vote plus one abstention.
In the Marshall Islands, presidents are chosen by the country's 33 parliamentarians, who are selected by the electorate.
During his stay in the Pacific nation, Tien also met with top officials, including Foreign and Trade Minister Kalani Kaneko, Minister of Natural Resources & Commerce Anthony Muller, Minister in Assistance Bremity Lakjohn, and Minister of Justice & Immigration Wisely Zackhras, to discuss cooperation projects, MOFA said.
Tien also witnessed the delivery of 60 tons of rice donated by Taiwan to the Marshall Islands during a ceremony, it said.
Tien and his delegation were scheduled to return to Taiwan later Tuesday, according to MOFA.
Tien's delegation departed Taiwan last Wednesday, two days after Nauru, roughly 1,000 kilometers southwest of the Marshall Islands, announced that it was severing ties with the Republic of China, (Taiwan's official name) to recognize the People's Republic of China.
That move left the ROC with 12 allies worldwide, including the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Palau in the Pacific region. Tuvalu and Palau have also recently pledged to stick with Taiwan.
The severing of ties between Taiwan and Nauru came two days after Lai was elected president.
It was also the 10th diplomatic ally Taipei has lost to Beijing since President Tsai took office in May 2016 amid deteriorating cross-Taiwan Strait relations.

US President Joe Biden has urged Congress to approve ""without delay"" the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey once Ankara completes the ratification process for Sweden's NATO accession, sources say.
Turkey has effectively blocked Stockholm's NATO bid for nearly two years, alleging that the Nordic country has housed some Turkish citizens deemed as terrorists by Ankara.
However, Stockholm gained support from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in July after it clamped down on Kurdish groups regarded as terrorist outfits by Ankara. Furthermore, Turkish lawmakers on Tuesday ratified Sweden's membership of NATO after frustrating delays that strained Sweden-Turkey relations.
On Wednesday, four sources told Reuters that Biden had sent a letter to leaders of key Capitol Hill committees earlier in the day, informing them that he is willing to commence the formal notification process for the sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Turkey once Ankara completes Sweden's NATO accession process.
In his letter to the top Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees, the American president urged them to approve the $20 billion sale ""without delay.""
American legislators had said they were awaiting Turkey's approval of Sweden's NATO membership before moving to approve the sale.
Separately on Wednesday, the US State Department also called on Ankara to formally finalize Sweden's NATO ratification, which requires Erdogan's signature. The department, however, did not provide an exact timeline on the formal notification process for the F-16 sale.
Back in October 2021, Ankara asked to buy $20 billion of F-16 fighters and some 80 modernization kits for its existing warplanes.
NATO rules state that new members need all the 30 old members' consent to join the Western military alliance."

A total of 100 individuals were tried in the case, which lawyers in the country criticized as a hasty show trial.
The remaining 90 were handed prison sentences ranging from three-and-a-half years to 20 years, mostly on terrorism-related charges, Vietnamese state media said.
The armed attacks on the offices in Ea Ktur and Ea Tieu communes of Dak Lak province left nine people dead, including four policemen, two commune officials and three local residents.
One lawyer said it was impossible to convict 100 defendants over just four days.
""Everything has been predetermined before the official sentencing,"" said Vietnamese lawyer Dang Dinh Manh, who was not involved in the case. ""The court's trial, the prosecutor's arguments, and the lawyer's defense [were] all just done in an artificial and sketchy way to quickly end the trial.""
It is unclear how many defense lawyers participated in the trial, and whether they were hired by the defendants' families or appointed by the court. A relative of one of the defendants told RFA that the family could not visit their detained loved one or hire a lawyer.
The convictions appeared to be based on confessions. State media reported that the defendants confessed that they were ""lured, incited and forced"" to attack by counter-revolutionary groups abroad, including those in the United States and Thailand.
Alleged U.S.-based masterminds
At the start of the trial, authorities said all the participants were members of a U.S.-based organization that ordered them to infiltrate Vietnam and carry out the attack.
Several of those convicted were American citizens, sentenced in absentia because they are outside Vietnam.
One, named Y Sol Nie, who lives in the United States, was accused of  ""commanding, leading, manipulating and directing"" the attacks, and given a life sentence. Another,  Y Mut Mlo, said to be a mastermind behind the attacks, was sentenced to 11 years.
The area where the attacks took place is home to about 30 indigenous tribes who have a long history of conflict with the Vietnamese majority, and claim they have been discriminated against.
They are often referred to as Montagnards, a term coined by French colonialists to describe the tribes who live in the Central Highlands, many of whom are Christians, but Vietnam has rejected use of the term.
Alur Y Min, a pastor and ethnic Ede who has been living in Thailand since 2017, told RFA last week that said the Vietnamese government had been using the police and military to oppress Montagnards for decades by taking their land and denying them freedom of religion.
While 93 of the defendants are from ethnic minorities, Vietnamese authorities have denied that ethnic discrimination, injustice and poverty were behind the attack.
Yet during a meeting of the government's Judicial Committee in September to discuss the attacks, Deputy Minister of Public Security Tran Quoc To was quoted by state media as saying that the root causes of the shootings were the ""socio-economic problems of the Montagnards in the region - the gap between rich and poor; land management; building the political system, and finally, some other issues on security and social order management at the grassroots administration.""
The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said in an email to RFA that it called on Vietnam to ensure that the trial took place fairly, transparently and according to legal procedures.
Mostly terrorism charges
Among those in court, 53 were convicted of ""terrorism aimed at opposing the people's government,"" and 45 were convicted of ""terrorism."" One person was charged with ""organizing others to leave or enter the country illegally,"" and one was charged with ""concealing crimes.""
Y Quynh Bdap, one of six defendants convicted on terrorism charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison, told RFA that the Vietnamese government intentionally and wrongly implicated him because it wants to destroy his human rights organization.
""They didn't produce any evidence but accused me of that,"" said the cofounder of Montagnards Stand for Justice, an organization that advocates for the religious freedom of ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands.
The court convicted Y Quyhn Bdap in absentia, though he has denied participating in the attack.
""I am in no way related to that armed group,"" he said. ""It is absurd for the Vietnamese government to make such accusations!""
Another lawyer who wasn't involved in the case, Dang Dinh Manh, said he believes that the lawyers and legal assistants involved in the trial did not fulfill their responsibilities.
""Based on information reported by the state-owned press, I even think they sold out their client[s] with such an irresponsible defense,"" he said. ""I believe that it is impossible for all 100 Montagnard compatriots brought to court to be guilty.""

Pakistan condemns the construction and consecration of the 'Ram Temple' on the site of the demolished Babri Mosque in the Indian city of Ayodhya.
The centuries-old mosque was demolished on 6 December 1992 by a mob of extremists. Deplorably, India's judiciary not only acquitted the criminals responsible for this despicable act but also allowed the construction of a temple on the site of the demolished mosque.
Developments of the last 31 years, leading to today's consecration ceremony, are indicative of growing majoritarianism in India. These constitute an important facet of the ongoing efforts for social, economic and political marginalization of the Indian Muslims.
A temple built on the site of a demolished mosque will remain a blot on the face of India's democracy for the times to come. Notably, there is a growing list of mosques, including the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and Shahi Eidgah Mosque in Mathura, facing similar threat of desecration and destruction.
The rising tide of 'Hindutva' ideology in India poses a serious threat to religious harmony and regional peace. The Chief Ministers of two major Indian states, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, are on record as citing the Babri Mosque's demolition or inauguration of the 'Ram Temple' as the first step towards reclaiming parts of Pakistan.
The international community should take cognizance of the growing Islamophobia, hate speech and hate crimes in India. The United Nations and other relevant international organizations should play their part in saving the Islamic heritage sites in India from extremist groups and ensuring the protection of the religious and cultural rights of the minorities in India.
Pakistan urges the Government of India to ensure the safety and security of religious minorities, including Muslims and their holy places.

New York, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has met with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in New York where they have arrived to attend a Security Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East.
According to our UN correspondent, Amir-Abdollahian and Lavrov discussed regional, international and bilateral issues on Monday evening local time.
The top Iranian diplomat with a high-level delegation arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York where he was received and welcomed by Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Zahra Ershadi, Deputy Representative of Iran at the UN.
This is Amir-Abdollahian's third visit to New York this year. His first trip was with President Ebrahim Raisi to participate the United Nations General Assembly and the second time he traveled to the UN headquarters for an emergency General Assembly meeting.
Other than attending the UN Security Council meeting for the first time on Tuesday, Amir-Abdollahian is scheduled to hold meetings with his counterparts and UN officials.
Before his departure for New York, Iran's foreign minister wrote a letter addressing to the UN Secretary General over the latest Israeli assassination of five Iranian military advisors in Damascus who were on the official invitation of the Syrian government.
""The Israeli regime must bear the consequences of its terroristic and other actions against Iranian military advisors in Syria,"" the letter mentioned.
France, which is the permanent member of the Security Council and holds the rotating presidency of the council, has invited foreign ministers of Iran and other countries to  assess the situation in West Asia, especially the Gaza war.
In December, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution with an overwhelming 153 votes which called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
Despite international pressure, the UN Security Council, with five permanent members and 10 non-permanent members, has not been able to stop the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip or establish a ceasefire there as the US has vetoed several such resolutions in favor of Israel. Washington and its western allies also keep backing Israel with money and weapons and turn and blind eye to bloodshed of Palestinians in Gaza.

Tehran, IRNA -- Yemen will continue its naval attacks as long as the war against Gaza is ongoing, a member of Ansarullah's political bureau Mohammed al-Bukhaiti has said.
The Yemenis will always stand by the oppressed nation of Palestine, he said according to Yemen's Al-Masirah TV channel.
In recent months, the Yemeni army has targeted over two dozen Israel-related commercial vessels and oil tankers in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab strait in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China in Geneva will require serious follow-up by key players.
A commentary by Anouk Wear and Megan Prangley Khoo 2024.01.23 -- Small but mighty. This phrase summarizes Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong, Uyghur, Tibetan, and other advocates who campaigned to call attention to China's human rights violations at the United Nations Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China in Geneva Tuesday. Despite China's best efforts to spread disinformation, the truth prevailed.
It all started last May, as we testified to the egregious human rights violations of the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities before the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in Geneva.
As two of approximately ten non-governmental organization representatives defending the basic civil liberties of China, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet under international law, we were far outnumbered by representatives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who said our ""flawed comments on the human rights situation in Hong Kong"" were based on ""false information"" and ""distorted narratives.""
The surreal scenario left us feeling threatened, yet motivated us to continue calling out the ongoing human rights crisis in Hong Kong and other regions.
This preceded the U.N. UPR of China Jan. 23, in which hundreds of human rights advocates campaigning for Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, and other Chinese dissidents closely observed in person and online what will be the final review of the human rights situation in China for the next four or five years in Geneva.
The UPR is a U.N. review process which every member state is required to go through every four to five years, and is a mechanism to ensure scrutiny of every country's human rights record and recommendations for compliance with international human rights law.
This year's UPR was a chance for Hong Kong, and other regions of China including Xinjiang and Tibet, to expose China's worsening human rights record on the international stage.
Following a year of businesses and individuals physically leaving Hong Kong due to a noticeable decline in the once-thriving international financial hub, the start of Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai's trial, and the Hong Kong authorities placing HK$1 million ($128,000) bounties on the heads of 13 overseas Hong Kongers, the UPR was a timely opportunity for international governments to take a stand for human rights in China, and particularly Hong Kong, before it is too late, and before the issues spill over into Taiwan.
Chinese lobbying
Ahead of the UPR, Reuters reported that China lobbied non-Western member states to praise its human rights record at the UPR by sending memos around the U.N. in Geneva, and the Geneva Observer reported on China's efforts to quash dissent, in a story which featured statements from us. China also attempted to limit civil society input, submitted fabricated information regarding its human rights record, and blocked the live stream of the UPR in mainland China.
Therefore, the heart rates of pro-democracy advocates were high, as each member state had a mere 45 seconds to present recommendations to China regarding its human rights record. This anxiety quickly became a sense of achievement as Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, and other key human rights issues were placed in the spotlight for all the world to see.
U.N. diplomats made it clear that China has violated international human rights law and twisted laws within its own region to violate the rights of its people, such as imposing the National Security Law for Hong Kong in Hong Kong, which effectively deems whatever activities the government does not like as illegal.
Even the advance questions submitted by U.N. member states to China mentioned Hong Kong 25 times, as well as the cases of Jimmy Lai and Chow Hang-tung once.
The United States asked: ""Hong Kong's National Security Law (NSL) does not apply in the United States, nor does it apply to persons on U.S. soil. What is Hong Kong's justification for violating its commitments under the ICCPR and the Basic Law of Hong Kong and violating other states' sovereignty by issuing cash rewards that unjustly target 13 human rights advocates who reside outside of Hong Kong, including a U.S. citizen, pursuant to attempts to apply its NSL extraterritorially?""
During the UPR, the U.S. echoed its advance questions by recommending that China ""cease harassment, surveillance, and threats against individuals abroad and in China including Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong [...] repeal vague national security, counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, and sedition laws, including the National Security Law in Hong Kong [...] end repressive measures against women, LGBTQI+ persons, laborers, and migrant workers, including in Hong Kong and Macau.""
The U.S. also condemned the Chinese Communist Party's ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, as well as transnational repression worldwide. The U.S. made it clear that it will not tolerate its citizens, asylees, and their families being threatened by the CCP-controlled government in Hong Kong.
Attention to Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet
The U.S. was joined by Canada, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Austria, and Belgium.
Each of these countries mentioned some aspect of the plight of Hong Kong. This exemplifies the ongoing destruction in the rule of law in Hong Kong, especially given that only six member states mentioned Hong Kong during the UPR in 2018.
In addition to Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet also shared the spotlight on the deterioration of human rights in China. In response to the allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, and the deterioration of rights in Tibet, U.N. member states made an unprecedented number of relevant recommendations on these regions, too.
A total of 20 members raised the situation in Tibet, more than double the number of states that did so in 2018.
Despite China's best efforts to mislead the world, business interests and empty talking points did not prevail over concern about China's human rights violations and systematic abuse of millions of individuals around the world.
Following the UPR, we must wait and see how the U.N. Human Rights Committee and China respond. Once they do, they must hold China to account for the numerous human rights abuses documented on the permanent record in Geneva. This includes prioritizing the case of British citizen Jimmy Lai, which the UK delegation raised, and all other political prisoners who are detained in China and Hong Kong for peacefully exercising their basic human rights under international law.
U.N. member states, and particularly the U.S., should also monitor whether the Hong Kong authorities repeal the 13 arrest warrants with bounties against overseas pro-democracy Hong Kongers. These bounties are an outright act of transnational repression to scare Hong Kong activists from engaging with the U.N. and other international fora to ensure that the CCP is held accountable for its human rights violations in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet.
On its home turf, Washington must also act in accordance with the international commitments it makes to protect activists residing in the U.S.. Hong Kong has placed bounties on Joey Siu, who is a U.S. citizen; Frances Hui, who was the first Hong Kong pro-democracy activist to receive asylum in the U.S.; and Anna Kwok, who drew the government's wrath when she testified before the U.S. Congress last July.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken should publicly and immediately meet with these three brave women to keep the spotlight on Hong Kong's eradication of the rule of law and the dangers of the NSL so that ""bounty"" does not become a buzzword for the Hong Kong authorities in 2024.

20240121
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The EU foreign ministers gathering in Brussels on Monday will discuss ""consequences"" for Israel that are intended to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drop his opposition to Palestinian statehood, media reported.
A document circulated by Brussels to member states ahead of the meeting suggests that they should ""set out the consequences they envisage to attach to engagement or non-engagement"" with the EU's Middle East peace plan, the Financial Times reported.
Asked about the nature of those consequences, a senior EU official cited preferential trade and investment benefits that the European Union currently offers Israel under their association pact.
Netanyahu has frustrated his allies in Europe and the United States by repeatedly rejecting the so-called two-state solution that seeks to create an independent Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. He took to social media on Saturday to reiterate that Israel needed to have full security control over the territories west of the Jordan River, which he said ruled out Palestinian sovereignty.
The EU reportedly plans to put forward a 10-point peace roadmap and will seek the support of the United States and the Arab world. The initiative, parts of which were quoted by Euractiv on Saturday, outlines a series of steps leading to Israeli and Palestinian states ""living side by side"" as well as ""robust security guarantees"" for both nations and a ""full normalization"" of ties between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

After more than a year of delays, the Turkish parliament is set to approve on Tuesday Sweden's entry into NATO. The decision comes after the Turkish Foreign Affairs Commission approved the country's bid for membership last month.
In 2022, Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership. And although Finland eventually joined the organization in April 2023, Turkey refused to ratify Sweden's bid, a decision that has frustrated its Western allies.
Initially, Turkey refused to endorse Sweden's membership under claims that the country protected members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is recognized as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.
Sweden has since introduced an anti-terrorism bill that makes membership of a terrorist organization illegal.
Furthermore, Sweden, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands have relaxed arms-export policies for Turkey. However, Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan has linked the upcoming ratification with the delayed U.S. approval of the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. The White House backs the sale of these jets, but the timeline for congressional approval is not clear.
Despite this barrier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan this month that Turkey is likely to soon ratify Sweden's bid for membership, leaving Hungary as the next barrier to Sweden's entry to NATO.
Despite Turkey's likely approval of Sweden's bid, Hungary has been delaying a decision on the country's membership.
Hungary says Sweden has had an ""openly hostile attitude"" toward Budapest for years and is angry about Sweden's criticism of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the perceived erosion of the rule of law. Orban denies any erosion.
Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, noted last Thursday a lack of ""confidence-building steps"" from Stockholm to improve relations with Budapest, which might aid in ratifying Sweden's accession.

The United States is taking ""extremely seriously"" a weekend attack by Iran-backed militants on a base that hosts U.S. forces in Iraq, the White House said Sunday.
""It was a very serious attack, using a capability of ballistic missiles that posed a genuine threat,"" White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Sunday during an appearance on ABC's ""This Week.""
""We are going to respond... to establish deterrence in these situations, and to hold these groups accountable that continue to attack us,"" Finer added.
""Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets"" were fired by Iran-backed militants at Al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq late Saturday, the U.S. military said, leading to one Iraqi and possible American casualties.
The Pentagon said most of the projectiles fired at the base were intercepted by air defense systems.
The use of ballistic missiles marks an escalation in the attacks, which had previously been carried out with lower-tech rockets and drones.
""You can be assured that we are taking this extremely seriously,"" Finer said.
Since mid-October, there have been dozens of attacks on the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and the 900 troops in Syria, deployed there with other coalition forces to fight jihadis of the Islamic State group.
Most incidents, including Saturday's attack, have been claimed by ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq,"" a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.
Increasing missile attacks in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen have increased fears of a widening Gaza war in the Middle East, pitting Iran and its allies against Israel and the United States.
Iran said five of its Revolutionary Guards commanders were killed Saturday in a missile strike on a house in Damascus, blaming the attack on Israel, and security sources in Lebanon said an Israeli strike there killed a member of Iran-backed Hezbollah. Israel has not commented.
Some information in this report came from Reuters, The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse."

By RFA Burmese 2024.01.23 -- Speculation is swirling over the fate of six brigadier-generals from the Burmese military following their surrender of a strategic Shan state city to ethnic rebels earlier this month in a humiliating setback to the ruling junta.
The six were commanding officers deployed in the junta's Kokang regional command center at Laukkai, the largest base in northern Shan state near the Chinese border. The base was overrun on Jan. 4 by the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, prompting 2,100 soldiers in the facility to lay down their arms.
Soldiers and family members were permitted to leave by the rebels. Sources close to the military told RFA Burmese that on Jan. 6, the six generals were flown by helicopter to the Northeast Regional Military Command headquarters, and later sent to the capital Naypyidaw.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns.
AFP, citing an unnamed military source, said the six generals had been taken into custody.
The Irrawaddy online news journal on Tuesday cited unnamed ""junta sources"" as saying that three had been sentenced to death, and three jailed for life. The sources said the six had been charged under military law for ""shamefully abandoning"" their posts.
RFA could not immediately confirm the sentences. AFP on Tuesday quoted the junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun as saying there was ""no sentence for the six brigadier-generals yet.""
The officers were identified as Brigadier-Generals Moe Kyaw Thu, the head of Laukkai headquarters; Tun Tun Myint, the acting chief of the Kokang Self-Administered Zone; and Zaw Myo Win, commander of the 55th Division; and Aye Min Oo, Thaw Zin Oo, and Aung Zaw Lin - the heads of Operation Centers 14, 16, and 12, respectively.
Sentences may have repercussions
Analysts said that stiff sentences for the generals could have major repercussions within the military.
Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University, called the reported sentences ""extremely draconian,"" adding that, if true, they are ""likely to cause an enormous backlash within the senior officer corps,"" particularly if they were simply following orders from Naypyidaw.
Regardless, he said, ""no amount of scapegoats will make up for the SAC's gross incompetence in managing the economy and war effort,"" using an acronym for the official name of the junta, the State Administration Council.
Former Captain Aung Myo Khat, who now advises Myanmar's resistance forces as part of the anti-junta Civil Disobedience Movement, agreed that the officers had likely surrendered on Naypyidaw's orders, and that dealing with them had become a delicate situation for the junta.
""If the soldiers who retreated learn about [the junta leadership] taking such action against their commanders, there may be a rebellion,"" he said. ""On the other hand, if no action is taken, battalion commanders and officers ... in all parts of Myanmar may also follow in their footsteps and surrender. So, I think [junta leaders] are in a dilemma.""
Than Soe Naing, a political commentator in Myanmar, said that regardless of who ordered the surrender, it was ""a result of [the junta's] mismanagement.""
""Now there are lots of complaints about [mismanagement] in the army, and soldiers have lost confidence,"" he said. ""The idea that they cannot win the battle and therefore have to launch a suicide attack or surrender is dominating [the mindset of junta troops] in the entire northeast region, and its spreading.""
Leadership facing criticism
The MNDAA claims that the seizure of Laukkai resulted in the largest surrender by the military during Operation 1027, an offensive it began in late October as part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance of ethnic armies, along with the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army.
Since its launch, the alliance has reportedly captured 15 cities in northern Shan state, seized control of more than 200 military camps, and prompted the surrender of some 4,000 junta troops.
Nearly three years since its February 2021 coup d'etat, the military's control of Myanmar is ""rapidly diminishing,"" Zach Abuza said, noting that there are growing calls for junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing to step down.
""There will be schisms within the military leadership between those who are interested in negotiating a political settlement and those who feel that the military hasn't been sufficiently resolute in crushing the dissent,"" he said.
Min Aung Hlaing has faced increasing criticism over his handling of Operation 1027 and for allowing Myanmar's once-strong military to appear weak under his watch.

ANKARA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish lawmakers on Tuesday approved a long-delayed bill on Sweden's bid to become the 32nd member of NATO.
The Turkish parliament voted on the bill after a debate in the Grand National Assembly. A total of 346 lawmakers participated in the voting, with 287 votes in favor, 55 against, and four abstentions.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to sign the bill into law within a few days.
Turkish parliament's ratification was welcomed by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. ""Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,"" he wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
With Trkiye's ratification, Hungary remains the only NATO member country that hasn't approved Sweden's application to join the military alliance.
Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022. Their accession requires the unanimous approval of all members of NATO.
Trkiye approved Finland's NATO bid in March last year but has slow-walked Sweden's accession, demanding the Nordic country further address Ankara's security concerns.
In October last year, Erdogan signed Sweden's NATO accession protocol and submitted it to the parliament for ratification.
The foreign affairs committee of the Turkish parliament approved Sweden's NATO bid following deliberation in December last year, in a key step to put it to a full parliamentary vote.
Trkiye has been under pressure from the United States to approve Sweden's accession to NATO, but Ankara was holding up its ratification to press Washington to allow the sale of F-16 fighter jets."

Dear Ukrainians!
Another week of this war and our active actions, our defense, is   coming to an end. Since the beginning of this day alone, there have been   about 60 battles. The most intense hostilities are in the Avdiivka   sector, as well as in Bakhmut, Maryinka, Kupyansk directions, and in the   South of our country. There were more than 50 Russian strikes with   multiple launch rocket systems alone, as well as dozens of air and   missile strikes.
On this day alone, Russian savages shelled more than a hundred   cities, towns, and our Ukrainian villages in nine regions: from   Chernihiv and Sumy to Mykolaiv and Kirovohrad. The most brutal Russian   attacks were in Donetsk region. Unfortunately, there are wounded and   dead. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones.
Russia will be held accountable for all this terror - it must be. If   it hadn't been for Moscow's decisions to start this aggression and this   terror, thousands and thousands of people would be alive today. That is   why it is so important to bring Russia to full, fair accountability at   all levels. At the individual level, so that every war criminal is held   to account, every terrorist. And at the level of the entire terrorist   state - through its assets and capabilities.
Russia must feel and remember forever that the aggressor loses the   most from aggression. I am grateful to everyone who brings Russia's   accountability closer by all means - military, sanctions, legal, and   political.
And we have already defined our Ukrainian priorities for the coming   weeks. Our tasks are clear - both in terms of packages that will   strengthen our position at the front, and in terms of political   cooperation with partners, and in terms of what is needed for Ukraine's   financial stability.
A special priority is the European Union and relations with our   closest neighbors. We are preparing more interaction and new   communication, new important negotiations.
I am grateful to everyone who believes today, as they did last year   and in 2022, that Russian terror must be defeated. Anything that   strengthens Ukraine and protects our people adds strength to everyone in   Europe and everyone in the world who values international law. Anything   that weakens Russia and brings the war back home to Russia contributes   to the stability of international relations and saves the world from   even greater crises.
I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! I thank everyone who saves the lives of Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!"

Commander of the naval force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) says the latest addition to the force, the Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis warship, bears the message of ""readiness"" for the country's enemies.
The vessel that was inducted earlier in the month, features sophisticated radar-evading technologies, and can cruise within a radius of 2,000 nautical miles without being detected. It relies on four homegrown propulsion systems, and has a naval endurance of 14 days.
""Abu Mahdi Muhandis bears the message of peace and friendship for the Muslim countries of the Persian Gulf region,"" Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri told Iran's al-Alam Arabic-language television news network on Tuesday. ""But if ill-wishers sought to create a problem, the vessel would bear the message of readiness in the face of the enemies,"" he added.
""We enjoy complete readiness, and should be constantly ready. In the same context, the drills that we hold in the region is indicative of our readiness,"" the commander noted.
'Foreign military presence disrupts regional security'
""The Persian Gulf region is home to us and neighboring countries,"" Tangsiri said.
Foreigners resort to ""fabricating enemies"" so they can extend their regional presence and keep up their arms sales here, Tangsiri said.
This is while, ""foreigners' military presence [in the Persian Gulf region] makes no proper sense for either the people of the region or [concerning the issue of] regional security,"" he noted, adding, ""Foreign [military] presence in the region is disruptive to [regional] security.""
""There is no need for extra-regional presence [here], and establishment of calm takes place by the agency of the regional countries.""
Tangsiri, meanwhile, proposed taking place of joint naval exercises among the region's Muslim countries towards enhancement of their ability at preserving the regional security."

By Global Times Published: Jan 23, 2024 09:19 PM Updated: Jan 23, 2024 11:18 PM
China released the findings of its mammoth geological exploration of the South China Sea on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone in compiling a basic marine geological survey of the South China Sea and its adjacent seas.
The exploration was conducted over 25 years by the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS), under the direct control of the China Geological Survey under China's Ministry of Natural Resources. It completes the geological survey covering waters under China's jurisdiction in the South China Sea to achieve comprehensive coverage of the basic geology of the area.
The exploration achievements were officially published in a series of books on the geology of the South China Sea and its adjacent seas.
With a complex geological structure and abundant mineral resources, the South China Sea serves as a crucial experimental field and resource continuation zone for earth science research.
Over the past 25 years, the GMGS has acquired a considerable amount of valuable firsthand survey data of marine geology and physical geography which have filled the blanks in research of deep-sea areas of the South China Sea. GMGS also identified essential geological elements, compiled foundational digital geological maps and established a systematic set of results based on the data.
These achievements have laid a solid foundation for making breakthroughs in critical earth science research in the South China Sea and the establishment of an international model for the research on marginal seas.
Based on the measured data, the researchers have been able to comprehensively map the topography of the South China Sea and its adjacent seas, the geology, stratum and depositional system of the Late Quaternary and the Meso-Cenozoic geological structural evolution, the types and distribution of mineral resources, and the marine environment and geological hazards in the South China Sea and its adjacent areas.
These research findings provide important geological theoretical support for the exploration and development of mineral resources in the South China Sea, including petroleum, natural gas, gas hydrates (combustible ice) and heavy metal placer deposits.
Through systematically analyzing a large amount of measured topographic data, 36 new submarine geomorphic units and 47 categories of landform types have been identified in the South China Sea. Additionally, 384 geographic entities on the sea bottom in the South China Sea have been systematically named, with approval from relevant authorities for their public release, which plays a crucial role in areas such as the management of China's marine natural resources.
Meanwhile, researchers have systematically summarized the distribution patterns and mechanisms of environmental geological hazards in the South China Sea, believing that there is a high risk of geological hazards in the shelf slope-break of the South China Sea, where submarine landslides and shallow seafloor gas seepage are prone to occur."
VRABAAURWJ_BTXGOW210X3X0RO,Military Health System Stabilization: Rebuilding Health Care Access Is Critical to Patient's Well-Being,_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240122-dodnews03.htm,"January 22, 2024    By Jim Garamone , DOD News
The Defense Department is on a mission to get the right people into the right military hospital or clinic at the right timeâboth medical staff and patients.
On Dec. 6, 2023, the deputy secretary of defense signed a memo directing the stabilization of the Military Health System. The memo requires that the MHS add capacity to reattract patients and beneficiaries, improve access to care in military hospitals and clinics, and increase opportunities to sustain military clinical readiness for medical forces.
The need to stabilize the MHS is clear. The realignment of medical personnel and the volatile health care economy of the past three years, created challenges in the  care of beneficiaries. Further, the ability to efficiently generate and sustain ready medical forces was also affected.
""Coming out of COVID-19, there were capacity constraints across all health systems in both the United States and peer nations,"" said Dr. David J. Smith, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for health readiness policy and oversight, who is leading a task force charged with implementing the memo's directives. ""Health-seeking behaviors changed as well as the demands on the war fighters and readiness ... health systems worldwide could not keep up.""
Aligning with the recently released MHS Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2024 through 2029, the memo primarily addresses the need for the MHS to continue providing medically ready forces and ready medical forces while simultaneously delivering quality care to beneficiaries. Doing so effectively, ""requires a stable, predictable workforce sufficiently staffed, trained, and routinely available to provide health care to our beneficiaries,"" the memo states.
""A big piece of this memo was about providing that stability: creating more stability for our staff so that they can provide more stability for our patients,"" said Smith. ""This leads to better access to care and more clinical capabilities.""
Rarely have issues in the MHS become so front-and-center. Recognizing the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and reorganization, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness began relying heavily on the MHS executive review board to oversee and implement major improvement projects. Moreover, the board began referring issues to the senior most military and civilian leadership in the DOD through the deputy secretary's workforce council.
""The board is chaired by the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, with official representation from the Army, Navy, Air Force, joint staff and Marine Corps ... all of the major components of the United States DOD,"" Smith said. ""This is so important to our senior leadership, as we are actively discussing and updating this effort at the Deputy's Workforce Council, the most senior governance forum in the department covering personnel issues.
""This is a massive commitment of time from our senior-most leadership because we know that medical is critical to the war fight,"" Smith said. He added, in reference to the four-years-long reorganization of the MHS, ""The [Defense] Department has undergone a tremendous transformation to deliver more effective and efficient health care. This is critical to the well-being of our patients and the well-being of our families.""
The reorganization realigned all military clinics and hospitals from the Army, Navy and Air Force to the Defense Health Agency. Doing so leverages economies of scale and standardizes care for our warfighters and beneficiaries in the long-term, but the transition was enormous. Smith said the organization has been characterized as the largest reorganization and transformation in the DOD since the establishment of the Air Force in 1947. Major transitions often take time to stabilize and realize improvements, especially for organizations as large and diverse as the MHS.
Upcoming Steps to Stabilize the MHS
The DOD will prioritize military and civilian staffing and uniformed personnel management at military hospitals and clinics, incorporating the memo's guidance into programming and planning activities. The focus is increasing medical personnel delivering care at military hospitals and clinics to optimize capacity for beneficiaries and mission requirements. ""The [Secretary's] goal of taking care of our people is about investing in our workforce,"" Smith said, and that is exactly what the Deputy Secretary's memo does in the short and long term.
First and foremost, by June 30, 2024, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness will complete a comprehensive review of all medical manpower and staffing. The review will inform how best to increase capacity to improve access to care for service members, their families and all MHS beneficiaries while maintaining and improving readiness capabilities.
The memo also directs the DOD to rethink policies on the assignment of military medical personnel to hospitals and clinics. In the short term, there will be a limited redistribution of medical personnel to boost capacity at a few key locations to begin no later than July 1, 2024, ""to stabilize health care delivery and mitigate risk to operational forces and missions.""
""We'll begin PCSing [permanent change of station] a number of health care professionals,"" said Smith. ""From there, we're going to a phased progression of assigning these providers to military hospitals and clinics."" Assigning military medical forces primarily to military hospitals and clinics will provide more predictability and continuity for patients and increase capacity for day-to-day health care.
""Another big change will be on civilian personnel staffing,"" Smith said. ""We are going to implement authorities allowing us to recruit and retain our civilian employees better. This will include facilitating paying our civilian employees at rates commensurate with the [Department of Veterans Affairs] and the private sector.""
As Smith stated, one critical, key initiative is implementing the authorities under chapter 74 of Title 38 opens NIH.gov to improve pay for civilian health care personnel. The Department recognizes the need to be a more competitive employer and pay civilian health care personnel at rates equal to the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services.
Boosting Staff to Bring Back Beneficiaries
The DOD wants to reattract beneficiaries back to military hospitals and clinics where possible. Many have turned to the private sector for health care as fewer military and civilian personnel were available to deliver care in the Defense Department's hospitals and clinics. The DOD also recognizes that burnout in health care workers is a serious challenge in the United States. Recruiting and making more medical personnel available at military hospitals and clinics reduces burnout, improves the workplace environment and enhances the experience of care for patients.
""If we have more people in military hospitals and clinics, we won't be burning out people as much. We also know that burnout is correlated with the experience of care for our beneficiaries,"" Smith said. ""In doing so, we can reattract beneficiaries to MHS.""
Based on an economic model that optimizes the future state of the MHS around warfighters and military families, the memo directs, ""reattracting at least 7 percent of available care from the private sector back to MTFs on average."" Reattracting 7% of patients from the private care system is an ambitious yet realistic goal given the time it takes to close gaps in medical personnel staffing. For patients, coming back to military hospitals and clinics should be easy and limit any out-of-pocket costs.
""We want to bring beneficiaries back to the MHS  ... and truly make the MHS the place you want to receive care,"" Smith added. ""We are going to rebuild that capacity first to earn trust from our beneficiaries.""
The Defense Department does not plan to ask any patients to change their health plan or their doctor. The goal is to make the MHS more accessible to make getting care at military hospitals or clinics the easiest, simplest choice.
""We remain focused on readiness and health care for all our beneficiaries,"" stated Dr. Lester MartÃ­nez-LÃ³pez, the DOD assistant secretary for health affairs, in the strategic plan. ""The two are inseparable: When our people take care of people, we increase the readiness of the total force. I look forward to this work, knowing that it will lead to a stronger MHS capable of meeting the challenges we inevitably face."" His message to the MHS is this, ""I hear you. I know we have serious issues, and we have a plan to fix our situation. I am asking for your support during the time it will take to make the changes we need.""
Ultimately, the MHS exists to support the military and the nation. Doing so is the highest calling, and the Deputy Secretary's memorandum stabilizes and makes whole the MHS to provide better access to care for the DOD's 9.6 million beneficiaries in the United States and around the world."

Yemen's Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that a swift response awaits the Israeli regime for its crimes in the region, a day after the regime killed five Iranian military advisors in Syria.
The ministry condemned the suspected Israeli attack on Saturday in the Syrian capital Damascus which targeted a building housing the personnel of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) who were serving in the Arab country in an advisory capacity.
""The response to crimes of the Zionist regime will soon take place,"" said the statement, reiterating support for Syria's right to defend its sovereignty against Israeli aggressions.
It called on the United Nations to commit to its responsibilities for protection of international peace and security while warning that the Israeli regime and its supporters will be responsible for any spread of the ongoing conflict in Palestine to other parts of the region.
While offering condolences to the Iranian nation and government, the statement described the attack on IRGC advisors in Syria as a cowardly move to relieve the Israeli regime of the pressure it is facing for its war in Gaza.
It said the attack will boost solidarity within the regional axis of resistance and will improve the struggle against the Israeli regime.
Yemen has been a major part of a campaign targeting US and Israeli interests in the region since the Gaza conflict began in early October.
The Yemenis have launched missile and drone attacks on targets controlled by the Israeli regime in the occupied Palestine while also launching attacks on Israeli-linked ships sailing in the Red Sea in an attempt to force the regime to end its carnage in Gaza.
The Yemenis announced earlier this month after attacks by the United States and United Kingdom on their soil that they would expand the scope of their attacks in the Red Sea to cover ships linked to the US and the UK."

[Bilingual as delivered; scroll down for all-English]
Mr. President,  Excellencies,
Over 100 days have passed since more than 1,200 Israelis and others   were killed in the horrific terror attacks launched by Hamas against   Israel, with over 250 people taken hostage.
For all those affected, these have been 100 days of heartache and anguish.
Nothing can justify deliberate killing, injuring, kidnapping of   civilians, the use of sexual violence against them - or the   indiscriminate launching of rockets towards civilian targets.
I once again demand the immediate and unconditional release of all   hostages.  In the interim they must be treated humanely and allowed to   receive visits and assistance from the Red Cross.
Last week in Davos, I had another moving meeting with families of   hostages and in this case, even some former hostages themselves.
Since the beginning, I have maintained close contact with Qatari and   Egyptian authorities on the efforts for their release.  And yesterday, I   received from the Israeli mission a list of many of the remaining   hostages.
It was also reported yesterday that Israel is proposing a two-month   pause in hostilities in exchange for a phased release of all remaining   hostages.
I will continue, in my limited capacity, to pursue all efforts to contribute to their release.
Excellencies,
The past 100 days have been heartbreaking and catastrophic for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
More than 25,000 people, mainly women and children, have reportedly   been killed in operations launched by Israeli forces.  More than 60,000   others have been reportedly injured.
In recent days, the military offensive has intensified in Khan Yunis with many additional causalities.
The entire population of Gaza is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history.
Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Excellencies,
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is appalling.
With winter bearing down, 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza face   inhumane, squalid conditions, struggling to simply make it through   another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food,   and drinking water.
Everyone in Gaza is hungry - with a quarter of Gaza's population -   more than half a million people - grappling with catastrophic levels of   food insecurity.
Meanwhile, nearly one and a half million people are now crammed inside Rafah Governorate.
Disease is spreading as the health system collapses.  Only 16 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partly functional.
That means the people of Gaza not only risk being killed or injured   by relentless bombardments; they also run a growing chance of   contracting infectious diseases like hepatitis A, dysentery, cholera.
Without functioning hospitals, and with minimal opportunities for   patients to exit Gaza, thousands suffering from chronic diseases like   cancer and kidney failure are at risk of dying.
A functioning medical evacuation system is urgently needed.
Excellencies,
In the face of colossal human suffering and enormous obstacles, our   United Nations humanitarian operations are striving to deliver.
Tragically, 153 of our colleagues have been killed - a source of bottomless grief for us all.
At the same time, the women and men of the United Nations alongside   our partners in Gaza are working heroically every day to reach people in   need.  Many have lost loved ones and left behind shattered homes.
They have been distributing ready-to-eat meals and other food items to shelters.
They are supporting the very few bakeries that are still functioning.
They are delivering medicines, medical supplies, bottled water and   trucked water, hygiene kits and cleaning kits, tents, tarpaulin sheets,   and blankets. But in quantities that are far from enough.
In the south, food distributions are helping to bring down prices -   and 250,000 Palestinians in Gaza were able to buy bread at a subsidized   price.
I welcome the agreement, facilitated by Qatar and France, of an   operation to deliver additional medicines and healthcare supplies to   civilians in Gaza, and to hostages held in Gaza.
I also welcome Israel's announcement that it will allow a United   Nations assessment mission to the north - but that mission is on hold   because of renewed fighting.
Under-Secretary-General Sigrid Kaag started her work as Senior   Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza on 8 January, in   line with Security Council resolution 2720. She visited Gaza today and   will update you next week on her overall efforts.
I ask all parties to the conflict to cooperate with her, as demanded by the Security Council.
Excellencies,
Let's face it.  Despite all the efforts I described, no effective   humanitarian aid operation can function under the conditions that have   been forced on Palestinians in Gaza and those doing everything possible   to help them.
The quantity of aid is highly insufficient in light of needs.
It is fantasy to think that 2.2 million people can survive on aid alone.
Basic commodities from the private sector must enter in meaningful   quantities -- as they did for many years before the current fighting.
This is essential to address rising needs and avert both a complete breakdown and ever-mounting death toll.
For our part, we are determined to do much more to scale up the   distribution of food items, tents and shelter materials, medicines,   clean water and spare parts to repair critical sanitation   infrastructure.
Excellencies,
Humanitarian delivery is not an exercise of counting trucks.  It is   about ensuring the right volume and quality of assistance reaches people   in need, in line with Security Council resolution 2720.
To be able to do our work, a set of operational requirements must be met.
We need safety. We are operating in a war zone.  The current   humanitarian notification mechanisms do not offer any real confidence   for operations and planning humanitarian responses.
A number of serious incidents have shown how these essential mechanisms need to be substantially improved.
Safety also entails reliable and cleared roads inside Gaza, and unimpeded crossings at checkpoints.
We need to be equipped to do our job.
This includes telecommunications equipment, so convoys can   communicate with each other; armoured vehicles and protective gear,   given the ongoing hostilities and the widespread contamination with   explosive remnants of war; far greater logistical capacity; spare parts   for infrastructure such as desalination plants, and other critical   humanitarian items.
We are grateful to Member States for their funding support.  We are   finally seeing a few signs of progress in the authorization of entry   permits for certain goods - and some measures to reduce screening and   crossing times.
But we still face a cumbersome process of verifications and multiple unjustified  rejections of desperately needed items.
We need more crossing points into Gaza to reduce congestion and avoid chokepoints.
The provision of aid to Gaza via the Ashdod port in Israel must also   resume.  A first shipment of flour reached Gaza from Ashdod but much   more is required.
We need access to the north. In the first two weeks of January, out   of 29 planned humanitarian missions to deliver lifesaving supplies north   of Wadi Gaza, only 7 were accomplished, fully or partially.
The majority of missions were denied access by Israel.  After over   100 days of operations in the north, insecurity and fighting has   continued.
And we need visas. Dozens of humanitarians have been waiting for months to receive their visas from the Government of Israel.
I call for rapid, safe, unhindered, expanded and sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza.
I repeat my call for an end to all violations of International Humanitarian Law.
The use of human shields is unacceptable -- as are the unprecedented levels of devastation and civilian killings.
I am also deeply troubled by reports of Israel's inhumane treatment of Palestinians detained during military operations.
Excellencies,
I renew my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
This will ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed,   facilitate the release of hostages, and help lower tensions around the   Middle East.
War and misery in Gaza are fueling turmoil far beyond.
We are seeing dangerous developments across the occupied West Bank,   including East Jerusalem, where tensions are off the charts - with a   dramatic increase in casualties.
Dozens of Palestinians are being arrested daily. Over 6,000   Palestinians were detained since 7 October, with many subsequently   released.
Settler violence is also another major concern.
The demolition and seizure of Palestinian-owned houses and other structures continues.
The Palestinian economy is in crisis.
Israel's withholding of a significant portion of Palestinian tax   revenues, the continued prohibition on nearly all Palestinian workers   entering Israel since 7 October, and severe movement and access   restrictions across the West Bank are all contributing to soaring   unemployment and poverty.
I hope that ongoing negotiations will allow for the full payment of employees of the Palestinian Authority.
Excellencies,
The risks of broader regional escalation are now becoming a reality.
Turning to the north, daily exchanges of fire across the Blue Line,   including strikes on civilian areas, have killed 6 Israelis and 25   Lebanese civilians and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both   sides.
The risk of miscalculation is dangerously high.
I urge all parties to refrain from aggressive rhetoric, and to immediately end activities that could further inflame tensions.
My Special Coordinators and I continue our extensive outreach to all   key stakeholders to reduce regional tensions and I welcome the efforts   of the United States and several European and Arab governments for a   negotiated de-escalation.
The situation in the Red Sea is also deeply worrying.
Houthi attacks are disrupting global trade.  These have been followed   by airstrikes by the United States and the United Kingdom on Houthi   positions in Yemen.
De-escalation is essential - and all attacks on merchant and commercial vessels in the Red Sea must cease immediately.
Meanwhile, there are almost daily attacks on facilities hosting US and international coalition forces in Iraq and Syria.
In response, the United States has launched airstrikes targeting individuals and groups suspected of these actions.
And in Syria, airstrikes that Iran and Syria have attributed to   Israel, have targeted officials of Hamas and the Islamic Revolutionary   Guard Corps of Iran.
I urge all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict.
Beyond the need for immediate de-escalation, each situation demands   the implementation of a clear political roadmap that would contribute to   long-term regional stability.
In Syria, that is a UN-facilitated political solution in line with   Security Council resolution 2254 that meets the needs of all Syrians.
Along the Blue Line, we need full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701.
And in Yemen, the establishment of a UN roadmap to implement the   commitments made by the parties and prepare for a Yemeni-owned,   inclusive political process under UN auspices.
Excellencies,
A lasting end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come through a two-State solution.
Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized,   and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully   independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United   Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements.
Israel's occupation must end.
Excellencies,
Last week's clear and repeated rejection of the two-State solution at   the highest levels of the Israeli government is unacceptable.  And this   was despite the strongest appeals from even the friends of Israel,   including those sitting around this table.
This refusal, and the denial of the right to statehood to the   Palestinian people, would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has   become a major threat to global peace and security.
It would exacerbate polarization and embolden extremists everywhere.
The right of the Palestinian people to build their own fully independent state must be recognized by all.
And any refusal to accept the two-State solution by any party must be firmly rejected.
What is the alternative?  How would a one-State solution look with   such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of   freedom, rights and dignity.  This would be inconceivable.
The two-State solution is the only way to address the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.
Monsieur le PrÃ©sident,
Excellences,
Le rÃ´le de la communautÃ© internationale est clair.    Nous devons nous unir pour soutenir les IsraÃ©liens et les Palestiniens   afin qu'ils prennent des mesures fortes en faveur d'un vÃ©ritable   processus de paix.    Au cours des deux derniÃ¨res dÃ©cennies, la solution Ã  deux Ãtats a Ã©tÃ©   critiquÃ©e, dÃ©nigrÃ©e et laissÃ©e pour morte Ã  maintes reprises.    Cependant, elle reste le seul moyen de parvenir Ã  une paix durable et   Ã©quitable - en IsraÃ«l, en Palestine, et dans la rÃ©gion tout entiÃ¨re.   Comme nous l'avons tragiquement vu au cours des trois derniers mois,   c'est aussi la seule voie pour sortir des cycles sans fin de peur, de   haine et de violence.    Cette pÃ©riode terrible pour les IsraÃ©liens et les Palestiniens doit   inciter les parties au conflit, ainsi que la communautÃ© internationale, Ã    agir avec courage et dÃ©termination pour parvenir Ã  une paix juste et   durable.

[All-English version]
Mr. President,  Excellencies,
Over 100 days have passed since more than 1,200 Israelis and others   were killed in the horrific terror attacks launched by Hamas against   Israel, with over 250 people taken hostage.
For all those affected, these have been 100 days of heartache and anguish.
Nothing can justify deliberate killing, injuring, kidnapping of   civilians, the use of sexual violence against them - or the   indiscriminate launching of rockets towards civilian targets.
I once again demand the immediate and unconditional release of all   hostages.  In the interim they must be treated humanely and allowed to   receive visits and assistance from the Red Cross.
Last week in Davos, I had another moving meeting with families of   hostages and in this case, even some former hostages themselves.
Since the beginning, I have maintained close contact with Qatari and   Egyptian authorities on the efforts for their release.  And yesterday, I   received from the Israeli mission a list of many of the remaining   hostages.
It was also reported yesterday that Israel is proposing a two-month   pause in hostilities in exchange for a phased release of all remaining   hostages.
I will continue, in my limited capacity, to pursue all efforts to contribute to their release.
Excellencies,
The past 100 days have been heartbreaking and catastrophic for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
More than 25,000 people, mainly women and children, have reportedly   been killed in operations launched by Israeli forces.  More than 60,000   others have been reportedly injured.
In recent days, the military offensive has intensified in Khan Yunis with many additional causalities.
The entire population of Gaza is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history.
Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Excellencies,
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is appalling.
With winter bearing down, 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza face   inhumane, squalid conditions, struggling to simply make it through   another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food,   and drinking water.
Everyone in Gaza is hungry - with a quarter of Gaza's population -   more than half a million people - grappling with catastrophic levels of   food insecurity.
Meanwhile, nearly one and a half million people are now crammed inside Rafah Governorate.
Disease is spreading as the health system collapses.  Only 16 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partly functional.
That means the people of Gaza not only risk being killed or injured   by relentless bombardments; they also run a growing chance of   contracting infectious diseases like hepatitis A, dysentery, cholera.
Without functioning hospitals, and with minimal opportunities for   patients to exit Gaza, thousands suffering from chronic diseases like   cancer and kidney failure are at risk of dying.
A functioning medical evacuation system is urgently needed.
Excellencies,
In the face of colossal human suffering and enormous obstacles, our   United Nations humanitarian operations are striving to deliver.
Tragically, 153 of our colleagues have been killed - a source of bottomless grief for us all.
At the same time, the women and men of the United Nations alongside   our partners in Gaza are working heroically every day to reach people in   need.  Many have lost loved ones and left behind shattered homes.
They have been distributing ready-to-eat meals and other food items to shelters.
They are supporting the very few bakeries that are still functioning.
They are delivering medicines, medical supplies, bottled water and   trucked water, hygiene kits and cleaning kits, tents, tarpaulin sheets,   and blankets. But in quantities that are far from enough.
In the south, food distributions are helping to bring down prices -   and 250,000 Palestinians in Gaza were able to buy bread at a subsidized   price.
I welcome the agreement, facilitated by Qatar and France, of an   operation to deliver additional medicines and healthcare supplies to   civilians in Gaza, and to hostages held in Gaza.
I also welcome Israel's announcement that it will allow a United   Nations assessment mission to the north - but that mission is on hold   because of renewed fighting.
Under-Secretary-General Sigrid Kaag started her work as Senior   Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza on 8 January, in   line with Security Council resolution 2720. She visited Gaza today and   will update you next week on her overall efforts.
I ask all parties to the conflict to cooperate with her, as demanded by the Security Council.
Excellencies,
Let's face it.  Despite all the efforts I described, no effective   humanitarian aid operation can function under the conditions that have   been forced on Palestinians in Gaza and those doing everything possible   to help them.
The quantity of aid is highly insufficient in light of needs.
It is fantasy to think that 2.2 million people can survive on aid alone.
Basic commodities from the private sector must enter in meaningful   quantities -- as they did for many years before the current fighting.
This is essential to address rising needs and avert both a complete breakdown and ever-mounting death toll.
For our part, we are determined to do much more to scale up the   distribution of food items, tents and shelter materials, medicines,   clean water and spare parts to repair critical sanitation   infrastructure.
Excellencies,
Humanitarian delivery is not an exercise of counting trucks.  It is   about ensuring the right volume and quality of assistance reaches people   in need, in line with Security Council resolution 2720.
To be able to do our work, a set of operational requirements must be met.
We need safety. We are operating in a war zone.  The current   humanitarian notification mechanisms do not offer any real confidence   for operations and planning humanitarian responses.
A number of serious incidents have shown how these essential mechanisms need to be substantially improved.
Safety also entails reliable and cleared roads inside Gaza, and unimpeded crossings at checkpoints.
We need to be equipped to do our job.
This includes telecommunications equipment, so convoys can   communicate with each other; armoured vehicles and protective gear,   given the ongoing hostilities and the widespread contamination with   explosive remnants of war; far greater logistical capacity; spare parts   for infrastructure such as desalination plants, and other critical   humanitarian items.
We are grateful to Member States for their funding support.  We are   finally seeing a few signs of progress in the authorization of entry   permits for certain goods - and some measures to reduce screening and   crossing times.
But we still face a cumbersome process of verifications and multiple unjustified  rejections of desperately needed items.
We need more crossing points into Gaza to reduce congestion and avoid chokepoints.
The provision of aid to Gaza via the Ashdod port in Israel must also   resume.  A first shipment of flour reached Gaza from Ashdod but much   more is required.
We need access to the north. In the first two weeks of January, out   of 29 planned humanitarian missions to deliver lifesaving supplies north   of Wadi Gaza, only 7 were accomplished, fully or partially.
The majority of missions were denied access by Israel.  After over   100 days of operations in the north, insecurity and fighting has   continued.
And we need visas. Dozens of humanitarians have been waiting for months to receive their visas from the Government of Israel.
I call for rapid, safe, unhindered, expanded and sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza.
I repeat my call for an end to all violations of International Humanitarian Law.
The use of human shields is unacceptable -- as are the unprecedented levels of devastation and civilian killings.
I am also deeply troubled by reports of Israel's inhumane treatment of Palestinians detained during military operations.
Excellencies,
I renew my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
This will ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed,   facilitate the release of hostages, and help lower tensions around the   Middle East.
War and misery in Gaza are fueling turmoil far beyond.
We are seeing dangerous developments across the occupied West Bank,   including East Jerusalem, where tensions are off the charts - with a   dramatic increase in casualties.
Dozens of Palestinians are being arrested daily. Over 6,000   Palestinians were detained since 7 October, with many subsequently   released.
Settler violence is also another major concern.
The demolition and seizure of Palestinian-owned houses and other structures continues.
The Palestinian economy is in crisis.
Israel's withholding of a significant portion of Palestinian tax   revenues, the continued prohibition on nearly all Palestinian workers   entering Israel since 7 October, and severe movement and access   restrictions across the West Bank are all contributing to soaring   unemployment and poverty.
I hope that ongoing negotiations will allow for the full payment of employees of the Palestinian Authority.
Excellencies,
The risks of broader regional escalation are now becoming a reality.
Turning to the north, daily exchanges of fire across the Blue Line,   including strikes on civilian areas, have killed 6 Israelis and 25   Lebanese civilians and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both   sides.
The risk of miscalculation is dangerously high.
I urge all parties to refrain from aggressive rhetoric, and to immediately end activities that could further inflame tensions.
My Special Coordinators and I continue our extensive outreach to all   key stakeholders to reduce regional tensions and I welcome the efforts   of the United States and several European and Arab governments for a   negotiated de-escalation.
The situation in the Red Sea is also deeply worrying.
Houthi attacks are disrupting global trade.  These have been followed   by airstrikes by the United States and the United Kingdom on Houthi   positions in Yemen.
De-escalation is essential - and all attacks on merchant and commercial vessels in the Red Sea must cease immediately.
Meanwhile, there are almost daily attacks on facilities hosting US and international coalition forces in Iraq and Syria.
In response, the United States has launched airstrikes targeting individuals and groups suspected of these actions.
And in Syria, airstrikes that Iran and Syria have attributed to   Israel, have targeted officials of Hamas and the Islamic Revolutionary   Guard Corps of Iran.
I urge all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict.
Beyond the need for immediate de-escalation, each situation demands   the implementation of a clear political roadmap that would contribute to   long-term regional stability.
In Syria, that is a UN-facilitated political solution in line with   Security Council resolution 2254 that meets the needs of all Syrians.
Along the Blue Line, we need full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701.
And in Yemen, the establishment of a UN roadmap to implement the   commitments made by the parties and prepare for a Yemeni-owned,   inclusive political process under UN auspices.
Excellencies,
A lasting end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come through a two-State solution.
Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized,   and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for a fully   independent, viable and sovereign State realized, in line with United   Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements.
Israel's occupation must end.
Excellencies,
Last week's clear and repeated rejection of the two-State solution at   the highest levels of the Israeli government is unacceptable.  And this   was despite the strongest appeals from even the friends of Israel,   including those sitting around this table.
This refusal, and the denial of the right to statehood to the   Palestinian people, would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has   become a major threat to global peace and security.
It would exacerbate polarization and embolden extremists everywhere.
The right of the Palestinian people to build their own fully independent state must be recognized by all.
And any refusal to accept the two-State solution by any party must be firmly rejected.
What is the alternative?  How would a one-State solution look with   such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of   freedom, rights and dignity.  This would be inconceivable.
The two-State solution is the only way to address the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.
Mr. President, Excellencies,
The role of the international community is clear.
We must unite to support Israelis and Palestinians to take determined actions to advance a meaningful peace process.
Over recent decades, the two-state solution has been traduced, undermined and left for dead many times.
However, it remains the only way to achieve durable and equitable peace in Israel, in Palestine, and in the region.
As the events of the past three months have tragically reminded us,   it is also the only way to avoid endless cycles of fear, hatred and   violence.
This terrible time for Israelis and Palestinians must spur both   parties, and the international community, to act with courage and   determination to achieve a just and lasting peace.
Thank you."

Sunday, 21 January 2024 2:37 PM
The Palestinian Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip has announced that the death toll from Israel's aggression against the besieged coastal territory has surpassed 25,000, as the occupying regime's war rages on into a fourth month.
The ministry made the remarks in a statement on Sunday, saying Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 25,105 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, since the start of the aggression.
Earlier in the day, witnesses said Israeli boats had bombarded Gaza City and other areas in the northern part of the blockaded territory.
The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas also reported heavy combat in the north.
The Government Media Office in Gaza also noted that Israel's continued artillery shelling on the southern city of Khan Yunis, the Tal Al-Zaatar area of Gaza, and the north has made it impossible to transfer the dead and injured to the hospitals, adding that ""Dozens are still under the rubble.""
The Israeli military claimed it had ""eliminated a number of militants"" in Khan Yunis and killed 15 fighters in northern Gaza over the past day.
The Israeli regime waged the war on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's atrocities against Palestinians.
More than 100 days into the campaign, the regime has achieved no objectives despite killing more than 25,000 people.
The Tel Aviv regime has also imposed a ""complete siege"" on the territory, cutting off fuel, electricity, food, and water to the more than two million Palestinians living there.
UN agencies have warned better aid access is needed urgently as famine and disease loom.
West Bank raid
Meanwhile, the Israeli military says it has demolished two Palestinian-owned houses in the southern West Bank city of al-Khalil, as violence surges in the occupied territories.
The military claimed that the houses belonged to two Palestinian gunmen who attacked a road between al-Quds and Bethlehem in November.
Palestine's official Wafa news agency also reported clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians in a village south of the West Bank city of Jenin as well as the towns of Aroura and Qalqilya.
Israeli forces have recently been conducting overnight raids and killings in the northern occupied West Bank, mainly in the cities of Jenin and Nablus, where new groups of Palestinian resistance fighters have been formed.
Israel has intensified its attacks against Palestinians throughout the West Bank since October 7, when it launched a devastating war on the besieged Gaza Strip."

The 37th Government  24.01.2024
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Knesset:
""Distinguished colleagues,
'The true sons of the kindred of David that fell with their sword in their hand... There is no truth, there is no glory but them.' With these majestic words, the poet Uri Zvi Greenberg mourned our fallen soldiers, the defenders of the homeland by whose virtue we live. Today, the finest of our sons and daughters are buried in Israel's soil. On my behalf and on behalf of all the citizens of Israel, I would like to express our endless gratitude for their heroism and boundless appreciation for their sacrifice. Our hearts, my heart, is with my brothers and sisters, family members stricken by grief. I know: Your lives have changed forever. Your agony, the void in your souls, cannot be put into words.
Each of us feels this sacrifice. Yesterday, my son Avner called me, choked up, and said, 'Dad, one of the fallen soldiers was my pupil for an entire year.' One way or another, we are all connected to the fallen, know someone who knew someone, know the families. We all embrace them with tremendous love.
All of us, together - at this moment of all moments - must dig deep for more fortitude. We will continue to fight determinedly to vanquish the brutal enemy we face. We will continue to safeguard our national revival, thereby fulfilling the desire of our dear children, mighty in spirit and deed. Their last will and testament, as you read, Mr. President, cannot be clearer. They say, 'Together to victory!' May their memories be a blessing.
Members of Knesset,
Two months ago, our commanders and their soldiers took control of the Hamas 'Parliament' in Gaza, as they call it. Of course, it is not a real parliament. It is a fiction. There are no free and democratic elections in Gaza. From time to time, this regime executes people, brings them to the town square and shoots them in the back of the head. If anyone even wants to leave the war zone, they stop them and shoot them too.
There is no real parliament in Gaza. That is why the parliament of extremism and hatred being destroyed by our forces is an image of victory. It is a powerful image, a very symbolic one, in a long and difficult campaign.
Even on this sad day, in our real parliament in Jerusalem, we see another image of victory. The Knesset's anniversary is an expression of the victory of our people's revival, the victory of freedom, of democracy, of national sovereignty. Representatives of the people are here on behalf of the people, for the people - our millennia-old people, who embrace the values of progress. Every democracy, small and large, is tested during times of war. The State of Israel has experience with war and has been tested - and we will stand together and emerge victorious from this current test as well, with G-d's help.
Every day, we prove to our enemies that they made a grave mistake. They believed we would lose all that we held dear. They fooled themselves again that Israel was as weak as a spider's web. However, the complete opposite actually occurred: We were dealt a very heavy blow on October 7, but we got back up very quickly. Israeli society came together. Regular and reserve soldiers reported for duty in droves. The IDF and our security services honed their capabilities.
This is a war for our home. It must end - and it will end - with the defeat of the aggression and evil of the new Nazis. Anyone who participated, took hostages, and raped and murdered our citizens, brought unprecedented destruction on themselves.
Members of Knesset,
I have heard the opinion that the events of Simchat Torah brought us back to the early days of Zionism, to the antisemitic pogroms of Eastern Europe and later the eastern lands. This may be true in one respect: The intention of those who wish to destroy us has not changed over the years. It is the same hatred. The bloodlust is the same bloodlust. However, today, unlike in the past, we have a country and we have our own army. We restored to the people of Israel the defensive force that it lost over generations. We stand like a fortified wall in the face of the dark barbarism that came for us.
We set goals for the war, and they are robust and valid: To end Hamas's rule, to return our hostages home - all our hostages - and to ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel. Anyone who lifts a hand against us in Gaza, anyone who lifts a hand against us anywhere, will very quickly feel our power. There is not, nor will there be, any compromise with regard to safeguarding our existence and our future for the generations to come. I would like to add: If we have indeed returned to the early days of Zionism, it is only to clarify the understanding that we must shape our fate by ourselves.
We will hold onto our land even more strongly. We will rehabilitate our communities, the moshavim and kibbutzim in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. We will return the residents of the south and the north safely to their homes. We will advance more vigorously a policy of becoming stronger. A policy of strengthening and strengthening and strengthening. Mr. Speaker, it will reach the Knesset very quickly, this clear change in our policy to strengthen ourselves, to bolster the Jewish state to a strength heretofore unknown. We will fortify Israel's status as the civilized world's guard tower in the Middle East.
Already at the beginning of the war, I told the leaders of the world, 'If Israel, G-d forbid, does not win, you will be next. The danger will certainly reach you much sooner and faster than you think.' I told them, including yesterday, 'Our war is your war, and our victory is your victory.' I also said, 'Israel will never surrender to the murderous terrorism directed by Iran.' We will fight back against those who attacked us, thereby giving humanity hope - light and not darkness, good and not evil, freedom and not slavery.
I emphasize this message, my friends, also at home. A vast majority of the people believe in Israel's spirit, in Israel's resilience, in the justness of Israel's path. When faced with those who doubt this, we will respond with words from the Bible, instead of 'a small, weak voice,' a 'strong, brave voice.' Courage will win - the courage of our soldiers, the courage of our fallen heroes. The people of Israel will be victorious.
Members of Knesset,
Tomorrow is Tu B'Shvat. Even before this day became the day of the Knesset's founding, it was a time of deepening roots and planting saplings. At Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, on the Israel-Gaza border, new trees will be planted - trees of heroism. In recent years, members of the kibbutz, secular and religious, have planted a tree in every hollow created by a rocket falling within the kibbutz's borders.
They will do so again this year, despite the kibbutz's temporary relocation to a different part of the Negev. Tomorrow they will plant the saplings, the trees, to commemorate those who fell while defending their community on Simchat Torah, an expression of the victory of our life over our enemy's culture of death. This is a great victory. It will be complete and it will be absolute.
Happy holiday to the State of Israel, to our commanders and soldiers and to the Knesset of Israel."""

It has been reported on Monday that a new US-UK air aggression targeted several areas in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a and its surroundings.
Tehran (ISNA) - Al Mayadeen's correspondent reported significant explosions that rattled the northern side of Sana'a, simultaneous with the presence of warplanes in the air. Reports revealed that the aggression focused on Al-Dailami Air Base, located north of Sana'a, and Al-Hafa Camp to the east, with a total of seven raids.
He reported that the US-UK aggression targeted the encampment of the 22nd Republican Guard Brigade in Taiz and the Radaa District in al-Bayda Governorate.
According to Fox News, Britain and the United States attacked about 10 targets in Yemen.
This is the fifth aggression launched by the United States against Yemen.
Earlier today, the spokesperson for the Yemeni Armed Forces, Brigadier General Yahya Saree, announced that the navy had carried out a military operation during which it launched missiles at the American military cargo ship Ocean Jazz in the Gulf of Aden.
Saree declared that this operation was in support of the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and in response to the Israeli occupation's aggression against civilians.
He also stressed that the response to the American and British attacks is inevitable, and that ""any new aggression will not go unpunished.""
""The Yemeni Armed Forces confirm their continued efforts to prevent Israeli ships, or ships heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,"" the Yemeni spokesperson underlined.
These events come in the wake of sustained aggression by the United States and Britain on Yemen, coupled with their ongoing militarization of the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab, emphasizing that these actions pose a ""real and serious threat to international navigation.""
The Yemeni Armed Forces have escalated their operations, targeting US-owned ships in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and Thursday, Sanaa has promised a wider-scale response to the US-led violations in Yemen.

The death toll from intensified fighting ""in the area"" of the training centre in the southern city of Khan Younis in recent days has risen to 12 confirmed fatalities and 75 injured - 15 critically - said Thomas White, Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
""Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately...Yesterday, the centre was hit by two shells and caught fire,"" Mr. White said, as he condemned the ""consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out attacks"".
Terrified - and trapped
Amid ongoing heavy fighting involving Israeli Defense Forces and Palestinian armed groups around hospitals and shelters in Khan Younis, the UN official warned that staff, patients and displaced people ""are trapped inside and lifesaving operations are impeded"".
""A number of missions to assess the situation were denied,"" Mr. White maintained, adding that on Wednesday evening, ""the UN finally managed to reach the affected areas to treat trauma patients, bring medical supplies and evacuate injured patients to Rafah.""
But, heavy fighting near the few hospitals that remain partly functional in the southern city, including Nasser Medical Complex and Al-Amal, has left them ""effectively encircled"", the UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator reported from Gaza.
Another hospital closes
Amid reports that hundreds of buildings have been demolished in Gaza, Mr. White noted that Al-Kheir Hospital in Khan Younis had now closed ""after patients, including women who had just undergone C-section surgeries, were evacuated in the middle of the night"".
Rescue mission
Confirming details of the rescue mission in Khan Younis, UN World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that a team had helped to evacuate 45 patients from the UN training centre to Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, ""15 of whom were in critical condition. One patient tragically died en route"".
In a social media post on X, formerly Twitter, Tedros noted that the intensity of fighting was such that the team ""did not manage to evacuate all of the injured"".
""We urge protection of all civilians, humanitarians and health workers. We appeal for an immediate ceasefire,"" he stated.
Court ruling looms
The development came as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) prepared to issue a decision in South Africa's case against Israel over alleged genocide in Gaza, which Israel strongly denies.
Since war began in Gaza on 7 October 2023 when Israel launched heavy bombardment in response to Hamas-led attacks on Israeli communities that left some 1,200 dead and more than 250 taken hostage, Gaza health authorities have reported that at least 25,700 people have been killed and some 63,740 injured."

The Israeli military says its ground forces have ""encircled"" the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip after two dozen of its soldiers were killed in its largest single-day toll in the three-month of aggression on the besieged Palestinian territory.
""Over the past day, troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area,"" the Israeli military said of the attacks on Gaza's second-largest city on Tuesday.
Media reports said Israeli tanks shut the road out towards the coast, blocking the escape route for civilians trying to reach Rafah, the last town on Gaza's southern edge - now crammed with more than half the enclave's 2.3 million people.
The invading Israeli troops have blockaded hospitals, which Palestinian officials say makes it impossible to rescue the dead and wounded.
Khan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Strip, has been the focus of the regime's latest strikes.
Some 190 people have been killed over the past 24 hours, almost a third of them in Khan Yunis.
Israeli forces have encircled the city and launched an airstrike on areas around Nasser Hospital. At Khan Younis's main hospital, the biggest still functioning in the Gaza Strip, bodies were being buried on the grounds because it was unsafe to go out to the cemetery.
At the European Hospital, reached by media outlets in southern Khan Younis, Ahed Masmah brought in five corpses, piled on a mattress on his donkey cart. ""I found them face-down in the street,"" he said. ""I did a good thing and brought them in.""
Footage filmed by Palestinian journalist Hamdan El-Dahdouh showed persistent gunfire hitting the top of the main building.
""I am besieged at Nasser Hospital now and my life is in great danger. The smell of death, the only smell I know, is filling the place,"" Dr Mahmoud Abu Shammala posted on Facebook.
Meanwhile, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees says telecommunications and internet services in Gaza have been down for the past seven days, the longest since October 7. It added that the blackout prevents people from accessing life-saving information, and impedes humanitarian response.
On the 109th day of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, the death toll has risen to more than 25,500, predominantly comprising women and children.
Despite its deadly and destructive campaign in Gaza, Israel has so far failed to achieve its main goals in the onslaught, namely destroying Hamas and securing the release of its captives through military means.
Separately, US news website Axios has reported that Israel has forwarded the proposal through Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
The proposal doesn't include an agreement to end the war but points to a multi-phase deal on releasing the captives.
Unnamed Israeli officials have been cited as saying that an undetermined number of Palestinian detainees would also be freed. An Israeli media outlet has also confirmed the proposal.
It comes amid growing pressure and criticism Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing at home over his failure to bring the captives back home.
Some 250 captives were taken by Hamas following the al-Aqsa Storm operation on October 7th. Hamas exchanged 80 of them for 240 Palestinian prisoners during a pause in the war last month.
Palestinians say many of some 130 captives still held in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes."
WG4QVB8PPN_YZUESIR7CVVH2WW,"UK, US and Australia sanction key figures in Hamas's financial network",_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2024/01/sec-240123-ukfcdo01.htm,"The UK, US and Australia have announced new sanctions on key figures in the financial networks of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).
22 January 2024  Last updated 23 January 2024
The UK, US and Australia have imposed coordinated sanctions on Hamas today to disrupt the terrorist group's financial networks.
Five key figures and an entity involved in the leadership and   financial networks of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) are the   subject of the UK's new sanctions, which will help to cut off the flow   of funding that supports these terrorist groups, including from Iran.
Today's announcement is the third round of sanctions imposed on Hamas   and PIJ by the UK following the 7 October attacks on Israel, which   build on existing sanctions against the groups.
Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:
These sanctions send a clear message to Hamas - the UK and our   partners are committed to ensuring there is no hiding place for those   financing terrorist activities.
To reach a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas   can no longer be in power and able to threaten Israel. By disrupting the   financial networks which sustain Hamas' operation, including from Iran,   these sanctions support that crucial aim.
The UK is committed to working with partners to tackle Iran's   destabilising activities in the Middle East, including its long-term   support to terrorist and militant groups. Today's sanctions target   Zuheir Shamlakh, a man with an infamous reputation as Hamas's 'main   money changer' since 2019, and a key figure in the group's shift towards   cryptocurrencies.
Shamlakh exploited digital currencies and existing systems of   informal money transfers to move large sums of money from Iran to Hamas   ahead of the tragic 7 October attacks. This underground financial   network uses legitimate businesses as a front to conceal the flow of   terrorist funding.
Those now subject to UK asset freezes and targeted arms embargoes include:
The individuals are also subject to a travel ban, and will be unable to enter the UK.
The UK, along with our G7 partners, has committed to take action to   deny Hamas the ability to raise and use funds to carry out atrocities.   The EU announced on Friday 19 January 2024 a new EU sanctions regime against Hamas and sanctioned 6 targets which had previously been sanctioned by the UK and US.
This is the third tranche of sanctions the UK has imposed against   Hamas and its associates since 7 October under the UK's International   Counter-Terrorism sanctions regime. Previous packages have targeted   other top-ranking officials and financiers of Hamas.
The Foreign Secretary continues to work with allies and partners to   find a peaceful resolution to this conflict. During his visit to Davos   last week the Foreign Secretary spoke with Israel's President Isaac   Herzog, Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al   Saud, and Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq Masrour   Barzani."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has held a press conference at the UN headquarter in New York finalising his official visit. The top diplomat answered various questions touching upon the most hot topics of the day.
Downing of Russian Il-76
Russia is trying to establish the facts about the downing of the Ilyshin-76 transport aircraft in the Belgorod region and the reasons behind Ukraine undertaking this criminal act, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a press briefing on Wednesday.
""As for the question about the downed military transportation aircraft Il-76 and about the reasons behind the Ukrainian criminal act, we are trying to find out the facts right now "" Lavrov said after his visit to New York.
At the same time, Russia has called for an emergency session at UN Security Council on the incident, the minister said.
""We do not want to repeat the situation of April 2022, when after the staging of Bucha, where the bodies of people were shown and we still cannot get their names... the British chairmanship that was at the helm of the Security Council in April denied calling such a session for 72 hours. I hope that our French colleague will not follow the same path and will call an emergency session as we have asked today at 3:00 p.m."" Lavrov said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier in the day that an Il-76 transport plane of the Russian air forces with 65 Ukrainian prisoners who were being transported for exchange, six crew members and three accompanying persons was shot down by two Ukrainian missiles in Belgorod region.
Answering the question whether Russia is worried that Western countries would not believe that Ukrainian forces downed an Il-76 transport plane carrying 65 prisoners of war, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: ""I have no concern about the international community not believing us, as I've already mentioned the international community, through Western representatives and media outlets, has already proven the fact that its position is highly discredited.""
'Russia's Attack on NATO' Hoax
Russia has no need to attack anyone; statements made by various politicians in the EU and NATO to the contrary are nonsense, the top diplomat told journalists.
""[This is] nonsense... We have no desire, no need, neither military, nor political, nor economic, to attack anyone somewhere,"" Lavrov said.
Lavrov expressed hope that those who ""warn"" about the need to prepare for war with Russia still have the instinct of self-preservation.
""I hope that there are still smart people who at least have not only a knowledge of history, but also an instinct for self-preservation. I heard that even President Biden said something similar, warning that if Ukraine loses, Russia would immediately go to the Baltic states, Finland and other NATO countries,"" Lavrov said adding that Russia does not want a big war, it has already experienced this many times, but the US itself declares Moscow a threat in its doctrines and acts accordingly, drawing in neutral countries.
Nothing New to Add to Russia's Response to New START
During his press conference held at the United Nations (UN) on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed Washington's proposal on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START).
""We did respond in January. We expanded on our position. We don't have anything to say at this point ,"" Lavrov said.
Last week, National Security Council Senior Director for Arms Control, Disarmament and Nonproliferation Pranay Vaddi said the United States has not received meaningful feedback from Russia with regard to its latest proposal on arms control.
Vaddi said the point of the proposal presented to Russia in September was to re-initiate talks on arms control.
Earlier this week, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said it is premature to say whether Russia will comply with the New START restrictions after the treaty expires in 2026.
Ukraine's ICJ Genocide Case 'Extremely Politicized'
Commenting on Ukraine's genocide case against Russia at the International Court of Justice, Lavrov said it will be ""extremely politicized.""
""Ukraine is accusing Russia of violating the Genocide Convention. It has also applied to the International Court of Justice. About 40 Western countries in the violation of all precedent are on the side of Ukraine. This process will be extremely politicized. There is no doubt about it,"" Lavrov said in translated remarks at a press conference.
He added that the court ""always enjoyed a very high standing and we hope that you will follow the letter of the international law, including the international humanitarian law.""
Israel-Hamas Proposals Distract Attention From Establishing Immediate Ceasefire
Minister Lavrov also touched upon recent proposals between Hamas and the Israeli government, aimed at reaching a ceasefire. He said they only distract attention from the ""essence of the problem,"" which is to actually establish an immediate ceasefire.
""This is a trade that is ongoing and it distracts attention from the essence of the problem,"" Lavrov said after his visit to New York. ""The substance needs to be an immediate ceasefire.""
Lavrov further indicated that the Permanent Ambassadors representing the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) are resolute in their intention for an official decision regarding the creation of a Palestinian state.
""They're [The Permanent ambassadors representatives of the organisation for Islamic Cooperation] very resolute in their intention that an official decision should be made about the creation of a Palestinian state. And negotiations should be accompanied by neutral and effective mediators,"" Lavrov said during a press briefing.
US Presence in Syria is 'Illegal'
When asked to comment on media reports of a possible US withdrawal from Syria, Lavrov said: ""It's not a matter of them [the US] withdrawing or not, their presence there is illegal.""
""And those political forces among the Syrian Kurds who expect to have the US 'umbrella' and their protection, their bet is morally and politically wrong,"" Lavrov stated during his press conference at the UN.
Lavrov pointed out that the US had already claimed in the past that it would withdraw its forces from Syria, which did not happen.
""When Donald Trump, then the president, mentioned that they are leaving Syria, right away the leader of Syrian Democratic Forces asked us and our military servicemen to help them establish connection with Damascus,"" Lavrov said. ""In several days, the US reconsidered and the representatives of the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Kurds stopped asking for our facilitation of contacts with Damascus. They returned right away under the West's wing.""

The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by StÃ©phane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
**Middle East
All right, good afternoon.  At 2 p.m. today, the Security Council of these United Nations will begin a high-level open debate on the Middle East, that will be chaired by the Foreign Minister of France, StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ©.  The Secretary-General will make opening remarks, and we will share those remarks with you as soon as they are shared with me.
Meanwhile,   I know you've been asking about Sigrid Kaag; I can tell you that our   Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, along with   Jamie McGoldrick, the Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim,   visited Rafah in Gaza.  There they met with civilians and saw the UN's   own humanitarian operations.  While in Gaza, they also met with   representatives of various UN agencies, international NGOs   (non-governmental organizations) operating in Gaza, as well as   Palestinian relief workers.
Despite the major obstacles to the   humanitarian response, we and our partners continue to address the acute   famine risk across the Gaza Strip. Between 15 and 21 January, about   1.2 million people were reached with at least one form of food   assistance.  More than half of those distributions were made in Rafah,   21 per cent in Khan Younis, in the south.  Over a quarter of that   assistance reached Deir al Balah in central Gaza, with 14 per cent going   to the northern governorates.
The Office for the Coordination of   Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) tells us that civilians have been severely   impacted by escalating hostilities yesterday in the Khan Younis area.    Dozens of people were reportedly killed, including displaced women and   children, and several homes and other buildings were also destroyed.
The   Palestine Red Crescent Society reported to us that Israeli forces had   surrounded their ambulance headquarters in Khan Younis, restricting   ambulances from providing support in the area.  Israeli forces   reportedly struck the vicinity of Al Amal hospital and the ambulance   headquarters.  As intense fighting continued in the area, patients and   displaced people sheltering there could not leave.
The World   Health Organization (WHO) reports that attacks on health care continue   to rise.  In the Gaza Strip, more than 300 attacks have been verified   since the beginning of the hostilities on 7 October.  In the West Bank,   as well, WHO reports a significant rise in attacks against health care,   with more than 330 attacks reported since 7 October.
Humanitarian   health partners report severe shortage of medical staff in some of the   hospitals in Gaza.  Only 12 medical doctors are still working at Al Aqsa   hospital, which is about 10 per cent of the doctors who operated there   before the start of the hostilities.
North of Gaza, we and our   partners managed to visit the Al Shifa hospital yesterday, after five   days of denied and aborted missions.  They delivered fuel, which is   obviously in very short supply.  Thousands of people have sought shelter   at the hospital, where equipment, water and food are also scarce.  As   we told you, the intense hostilities and repeated access denials   continue to severely constrain our access especially in the northern   part of Gaza.
Also, a programming note:  Tomorrow, at 10 a.m.,   from Jerusalem, we will have a live connection with Jamie McGoldrick,   who will brief you on the humanitarian situation.
**Ukraine
Turning   to Ukraine:  Our Humanitarian Coordinator in that country, Denise   Brown, condemned in a statement the latest wave of aerial attacks that   took place this morning on Kyiv and Kharkiv â Ukraine's largest urban   centres â as well as Pavlohrad, which is in Dnipro area.
In the   capital, Kyiv, the attacks caused damage to civilian buildings just next   to the UN offices.  Ms. Brown said that civilians who were just   preparing for work or getting children ready to go to school ended up   hospitalized because of the attacks.
In Kharkiv, our humanitarian   colleagues on the ground tell us that many buildings were impacted, and   civilians killed and injured, as rescuers are trying to find people   under the rubble of a residential building.  The attacks left tens of   thousands of families, businesses and institutions without electricity   this morning; that's what the Energy Ministry is telling our colleagues   in Kyiv.  Water and gas supplies were also impacted â and on a day when   temperatures are below freezing in the city.
The attacks also caused loss and destruction in the Dnipro Region.
Meanwhile, in the east and the south of the country, fierce fighting and hostilities continue to take a heavy toll on civilians.
And   on the response side, we, along with our humanitarian partners, are   providing emergency assistance, including first aid, psychosocial   support and materials for emergency repairs.
**Democratic Republic of the Congo
Turning   to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our humanitarian colleagues   there tell us that the flood situation remains dire, where nearly half   of the country's 26 provinces being impacted by severe flooding; that   includes the capital, Kinshasa.
According to the Congolese   authorities, more than 400,000 households need emergency assistance,   including food, shelter and health-care support.
The Humanitarian   Coordinator in that country, Bruno Lemarquis, visited affected   communities in Kinshasa last week and expressed deep concern over the   precarious living conditions in these areas.  Some families live in   their flooded houses, increasing the risk, of course, of waterborne   disease, which could potentially overwhelm an already strained   health-care system.  We and our partners are working closely with the   Congolese authorities to develop an emergency response plan and mitigate   a public health crisis.
Humanitarian organizations are providing   emergency assistance such as health care to the injured and implementing   measures to prevent the risk of outbreaks and diseases.
We are also active on the ground, supporting local organizations to carry out assessments.
And   in the East of the DRC, peacekeeping colleagues are continuing to   protect the main supply routes leading towards Goma and Sake; that is in   North Kivu.  They are also assisting the Congolese army to prevent the   M23 armed group from advancing towards both Sake and Goma.
Peacekeepers and Congolese armed forces are deployed in Masisi, Rutshuru and Nyiragongo, patrolling in key areas.
As   we mentioned before, the Mission also established a security perimeter   near its Kitchanga base to help protect some 25,000 men, women and   children who are seeking shelter due to the prevailing insecurity we've   been telling you about.  The presence of peacekeepers also enables the   delivery of humanitarian assistance to those who need it.
**Somalia
And   turning to Somalia:  Our colleagues at OCHA are also warning that   cholera and acute watery diarrhoea are spreading.  Our humanitarian   colleagues tell us that more than 470 cases were reported during the   second week of January; that includes at least nine deaths.  Most of   these cases were in Hirshabelle State in central Somalia, where there   was severe flooding during the rainy season late last year.
We,   along with our partners, are scaling up the response to flood-affected   districts.  We are also preparing for further flooding expected during   the April to June rainy season, but underfunding for the humanitarian   response remains a critical concern.  Last year's $2.6 billion to help   7.6 million people in Somalia was less than 44 per cent funded, which   means we received just about $1.1 billion.
**United Republic of Tanzania
And   Tanzania, also related to floods, our team there, led by Resident   Coordinator Zlatan Milisic, is ready to further assist the   Government. Our teams and partners have been supporting the impacted   areas of Hanang in the north-eastern Manyara region for the past month.    Approximately 140 people are injured, with over 9,000 affected and   hundreds and hundreds of displaced.
The World Food Programme (WFP)   is distributing food rations; the World Health Organization is focusing   on disease prevention, and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) is   providing water and sanitation services, distributing hygiene kits,   water tanks and more.  And for its part, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA)   distributed 1,200 dignity kits for women and girls, while the   International Organization for Migration (IOM) joined the UN team's   assessment to further support the needs of displaced people.
**Rohingya
And   on the Rohingyas, just a note from UNHCR (United Nations Refugee   Agency) says they are alarmed by statistics revealing a surge of the   number of Rohingya refugees dying or going missing while taking risky   boat journeys in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal during 2023.
Some   569 people â the majority of whom were women and children â were   reported to have perished or gone missing last year in the South-East   Asian waters, with nearly 4,500 Rohingyas embarking on deadly sea   journeys â a significant increase [on previous years].
The   findings for last year also include some shocking details with survivors   sharing horrifying accounts of abuse and exploitation during the   journey, including gender-based violence.
UNHCR calls on regional coastal authorities to take urgent action to prevent further tragedies.
**Honour Roll
You will get a question if you answer my question.  We are going to forget about food today.  We are going to focus on language.
We have one nation to thank for its full contribution to the regular budget.  So, if I were to say to ""Go raibh mÃ­le maith agaibh"", who would I be speaking to, and in what language?  [responses from the crowd]
What?    No, I would be speaking Gaelic, and I would be saying thank you to our   friends in Baile Ãtha Cliath, or as you like to say, Dublin.
So, we thank our Irish friends.
**Questions and Answers
Spokesman:  Ibtisam?
Question:  Shukran.    I asked you yesterday after the noon briefing, I sent you a question   regarding ICJ (International Court of Justice) numbers. How many people   watched the South Africa v. Israel ICJ hearing?  And if you have a   breakdown regarding the first day and the second day and a broader   context.  Then I have another question later.
Spokesman:  I   mean, the numbers which I think I shared with you, and this is just   from our webcast folks, who said there were about 1.4 million views   across the two days of the ICJ hearings with 1 million on day 1 and   about 400,000 on day 2.  Our webcast people are telling me that's about   10 times what they usually see for proceedings from the ICJ.
Question:    Okay.  I have another question regarding the... in social media, the   Director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a video, what   seems to be stolen antiquities from Gaza universities that were bombed   by the Israelis.  Do you have any comments on that?  Do you believe that   this should go... but, like, any comments first?
Spokesman:    I haven't seen that particular report.  We'll look into it.  Obviously,   I mean, as with any conflict, it is important that historical artefacts   be protected and respected, but we'll look into them.
Question:    And on yesterday, you were asked about the suggestions by the Israeli   Foreign Minister to have an island, to basically displace Palestinians   and to send them there.  And in a follow-up question that you were   asked, you said:  ""I think people are allowed to determine their own   future.""  I guess my question here is not about whether people should   determine their own future or not â is rather in this context, which we   heard several times in the past, where Israeli officials are talking   about forced displacement and putting it in a different wording.  Could   you please tell us your comment on that?
Spokesman:  Well, I   mean, we strongly stand against any forced displacement â in this   context, forced displacement of the Palestinian people.  This idea of an   island is... I don't think is one we would support.  Edie?
Question:    Two questions, Steph.  First, does the Secretary-General have any   reaction to the Iranian hanging today of a prisoner who was a protester   during the protests that followed the deaths of Mahsa Amini, the young   woman who was pulled over for inappropriately wearing a headscarf?
Spokesman:  We continue to stand against and condemn the use of the death penalty.  Dezhi? Sorry, you had another question.
Correspondent:  No.  Go ahead. I'll come back.
Spokesman:  Okay, Dezhi.
Question:  Okay.  Two questions.  First, do you have any updates on the trucks of the humanitarian aid into Gaza from... [cross talk]
Spokesman:  No.  I think you know...
Question:  What would be the obstacles now?
Spokesman:    Well, the obstacles continue, first, that the fighting is continuing.    Obstacles continue to be the very complex and difficult procedures for   screening.  And obstacles continue also to be in... one of the other   issues is obviously our lack of transport on the inside, but it's also   just volume.  But I think truck counting is probably not the best   indicator.  We're just not getting enough aid in.
Question:    Yes.  The Security Council resolution, last one, suggests that the UN   should expand its humanitarian delivery operations, but it seems it's   not being implemented.
Spokesman:  Well, I mean, one of the   reasons the Council created the post that Sigrid Kaag has is to expand   the humanitarian deliveries in Gaza and to create a mechanism.  She's on   her first tour of the region.  She went to Gaza again today.  She will   be back here to report to the Council on her work.
Question:  Any expectations, like, when would this so-called expanded operation would go?
Spokesman:  I think if I were to give you a hard date, I would be very silly indeed.
Question:  Okay.  My second issue is yesterday, I asked you about the...
Spokesman:  Question.
Question:  Oh, sorry, say... no, no... [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Maybe you have an issue with me.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Question:  I'm sorry.  I was just trying to find a word rather than question, because I asked too many questions already.
Spokesman:  Okay.  No, no, I understand.  I understand. I understand.
Question:    So okay.  Yesterday, I asked you about the ceasefire.  I asked you   about the release of hostages.  It's been reported that Israel wants to   suggest a ceasefire of two months in order to... in exchange of the   release of all hostages.  Has the UN saw this?  [cross talk]
Spokesman:    Well, we're aware of these reports.  We're obviously waiting to see   what further developments, but we're obviously... I mean, we do read the   newspapers and we're aware of...
Question:  But do you think that would work?
Spokesman:  We are not a party to the conflict.
Question:  But you hope that will be working?
Spokesman:    Right.  We're not a party to conflict.  What we're hoping for is what   we've been hoping for since the beginning is a continued humanitarian   ceasefire.  Okay.  Benny?
Correspondent:  A couple of   questions.  By the way, that offer was rejected by Hamas.  But put that   aside.  I noticed that in your preamble... the opening statement...
Spokesman:  Yeah.  Opening statement.
Question:    You listed the whole lots of operations in Gaza.  You did not mention   the largest UN operation in Gaza. So, question, does the   Secretary-General see a role for UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works   Agency) in the post-war?
Spokesman:  The role for UNRWA   continues.  UNRWA continues to be our largest humanitarian operation in   Gaza.  They continue to provide... let me put it this way. The   Secretary-General, he said this before 7 October:  I believe UNRWA plays   a critical role in supporting many Palestinians on education, on health   care, and other services.  And it plays a stabilizing role in the   region.  He continues to believe that.
Correspondent:  And   when you were asked before about the UN Watch exposure of some comments,   some thousands of comments by UNRWA employees.  You say, you   pooh-poohed it.
Spokesman:  I don't think I ever used that wording.
Question:  Pooh-pooh?  You used those, saying that the records speaks for itself as far as... [cross talk]
Spokesman:    I also said, if you look at the transcript, I also said that UNRWA   takes these things seriously, and I know they do.  I mean, in fact, I   was talking to Philippe Lazzarini about an hour ago. They take these   things very seriously.
Question:  So, what does that mean?  Is there an investigation into this?  Because now names and numbers are being... [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Whenever they're able to, they do look into it.  They take disciplinary action when needed and when things are proven.
Question:    And on another question, from what I understand, the Secretary-General,   for the first time, was not invited to an event in a synagogue in New   York on Holocaust Memorial Day.  Do you have information on that?
Spokesman:  Which particular event are you speaking about?
Question:  Pardon?
Spokesman:  Which specific event are you speaking about?
Correspondent:  The same event he goes to every year.
Spokesman:  The Park East Synagogue?
Correspondent:  Yeah.
Spokesman:    The event from... we've been speaking to the organizer.  The event has   changed in nature from previous years, where it used to be an event for   the diplomatic community.  It is not this year.  And I was speaking to   them, in fact, just yesterday.  It is an event, from what they're   telling us, more focused on the events of 7 October, the terror attacks   by Hamas, and a healing event for the community.  So, it is no longer a   diplomatic event.  So, it is only natural that the Secretary-General not   be present.  It is not the same event they've had in previous years.    [cross talk]
Correspondent:  It is the UN that the Holocaust Day Memorial... [cross talk]
Spokesman:    No.  The Secretary-General will be very present on Friday in the   General Assembly at the annual Holocaust commemoration.  You're asking   me about an event that's off campus, to which he was in its previous   iteration, he was there, and his predecessors were there.  It is no   longer the same event.  It is no longer an event for the diplomatic   community.  That's why he will not be attending.
Correspondent:  Okay.
Spokesman:  Yes, sir.
Question:    [inaudible] National News Agency of Ukraine.  While Russian Minister   [Sergey] Lavrov is here at the UN Security Council, saying that there is   no need to help Ukraine, his troops, as you mentioned, have bombed   Ukrainian cities in my native Kyiv today.  There are dead and wounded.    What should be the Secretary-General's reaction to these words of   Russian Minister?
Spokesman:  The Secretary-General's   reaction has been consistent since the beginning of Russia's invasion of   Ukraine.  I mean, he has been saying the same things very consistently,   defending Ukraine's territorial integrity, defending the Charter of the   United Nations, defending international law and calling for an end to   the conflict.  Gabriel, and then Abdelhamid, and then Pam.
Question:    Okay.  Thank you, StÃ©phane.  Regarding Kaag's visit to Gaza, can you   give us any more details about roughly how long she was there?
Spokesman:  I don't know.  I mean, I know... let me just put it this way.  It was during daylight hours.  But, you know, so...
Correspondent:  Okay.
Spokesman:  I don't know is a short answer.  If I can give you some...
Correspondent:  Safe to say due to the security situation, it was hours only.  [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Well, I mean, it was meant to be a day visit.  I think one can assume that it was done during daylight hours.
Question:    Cool.  Thank you. And Hamas today urged the UN to step in immediately   and shoulder their responsibilities, their words, to stop Israel's   attacks on Gaza hospitals, given how serious the situation has turned in   the last 24 hours, as you mentioned at the podium.  Does the   Secretary-General have a reaction to this?
Spokesman:    Again, I think our actions speak for themselves.  We have done whatever   is humanly possible to support the health-care system.  I mean, I think   you had one of our colleagues from WHO a few weeks ago, describing in   great detail the mission they launched to save newborn babies.  We went   to Shifa Hospital yesterday.  We're operating in the midst of an active   combat zone and doing whatever is humanly possible to support the   health-care system.  Abdelhamid?
Question:  Thank you,   StÃ©phane.  At least 16 cemeteries in Gaza have been desecrated by   Israeli forces, satellite imagery and videos reveal, according to CNN   report.  Do you have any comment on that?
Spokesman:  We've seen those reports.  I've seen the disturbing video.  I mean, these are things that need to be thoroughly investigated.
Question:  Also, Haaretz yesterday issued another investigation, saying that it was Israeli air   force that hit the party, which killed 360 people, including   Palestinian.  It said, Haaretz said, that the Hamas fighters didn't know   anything about that party. Would that inspire people to change their   discourse about who was killed and what has happened in that...?
Spokesman:    I think there still needs to be a lot to be investigated, but the fact   that Hamas committed acts of terror on 7 October, I think, remains an   undeniable fact.
Question:  My last question.  In the West   Bank, now, over 6,000 had been arrested since 7 October, including   340 children, 80 women.  Are these considered what?  Hostages,   detainees?  How the UN should address this issue of now over   10,000 Palestinians altogether, in Israeli detention centres and jails?
Spokesman:    I think the Secretary-General will speak to that in his remarks, and we   have repeatedly spoken out on the issues of detainees in a very   consistent manner.  We'll continue to do so.  Pamela?
Question:    Thank you, Steph.  Thank you. The IAEA DG [International Atomic Energy   Agency Director General Rafael] Grossi is here.  Is it... and the latest   report is that there was some power that was cut in the last two days to   Zaporizhzhia and making a lot of people very worried about it.  Is   there any chance of getting a briefing from him or would there be any...?
Spokesman:  You can ask his office, we can ask his office, and we'll see who he says yes to.
Question:  And does he have meetings with the SG?  Any knowledge of his...?
Spokesman:  I mean, I have very little knowledge of a lot of things.  And off the top of my head, I don't know.  [laughter]
Correspondent:  Thank you.
Spokesman:  Yes.
Correspondent:  No.  No.  You know everything.
Spokesman:  Okay.  Yeah.  Maryam?
Question:    Thank you, Stephane.  I have two questions.  One is regarding Iran.    Last night, two other protesters were prosecuted by the Islamic Republic   of Iran without due court dates or any other investigations.  The   Foreign Minister is here.  Is the Secretary-General planning to address   the prosecution in Iran, especially after the protests last year and   after Mahsa Amini's death?  And also, I have a question about   Afghanistan which I will...
Spokesman:  I mean, we will share   with you a readout of the meeting.  I don't like to pre-empt whatever   will be discussed. But I think, as you've seen from readouts of meetings   with the Secretary-General and senior Iranian officials, he has   repeatedly raised human rights concerns in those meetings.
Question:    A lot of people... I have to ask this question because a lot of people   have this question, and I don't know if this question is for you.  But   I'll ask it anyway because people want me to ask you this question.  How   can a Government or an official from a country, like, a Government like   Iran, which is prosecution it's, like, through the roof, can still   travel to meetings, like, the Security Council or to the UN without   being held accountable?
Spokesman:  Listen, I think, let's   step back.  This is an organization of a 193 Member States.  It is   important that every Member State has the ability to take part in   discussions, right?  It does not stop... and I can only speak for the   Secretary-General.  Member States will have their own opinion.  And   there is... they have tools to address those issues. It does not stop the   Secretary-General from speaking his mind and calling out violations of   international law, violations of human rights, right?  So, I will leave   it at that.  Stefano, and then Linda.
Question:  Thank you, StÃ©phane.  About the Security Council reform, when the Secretary-General said...
Spokesman:  It's definitely not a question for me, but go ahead.  No.  Go ahead. Sorry.
Correspondent:  No.  It is a question for you.
Spokesman:  It's always.  Go ahead.
Question:    Because you just, yesterday, you mentioned that the Secretary-General   in Africa said that is for the permanent... for Africa to have a seat as a   permanent member.  So did you say that yesterday?  I think you did.
Spokesman:    Well, the Secretary-General said it in his remarks that he thought it   was an... and I don't know if the word was outrage, but he said it was   unimaginable that there is not a permanent member from Africa on the   Security Council.
Question:  Exactly.  So, my question is,   is the position of the Secretary-General now a specific position about   the Security Council reform â means that he wants a new permanent   members in the Security Council?
Spokesman:  What the   Secretary-General, I think, is expressing his opinion, I think, is   reflective of a lot of people's opinion, right?  That you have a whole   continent where in fact, a lot of the UN's peace and security work is   ongoing.  And no Member State from that continent sits on the body that   discusses and decides policies relating to peace and security, right?    And he's talked about the injustice of those countries that were former   colonies that were penalized twice â once by being colonized and second,   by not even being at the table when the architecture of the   multilateral system was discussed.  How Member States decide on Security   Council reform, what that will look like, will be up to them.  He's   made his feelings known, and I think it's not the first time he's said   something like that.  But in the end, it will be up to Member States   themselves to decide.  And whether or not they take into account the   view of AntÃ³nio Guterres we will see.
Question:  So, basically, from your answer is he agrees for Africa to have... [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Well, I mean, he said it.  So, I hope he agrees.
Question:  And not let's say, Japan or Germany.
Spokesman:  He didn't specify a specific country.  He pointed out that a whole continent is not represented.
Question:  And then another question is on Haiti.  What is...?
Spokesman:  On what?
Correspondent:  Haiti.
Spokesman:  Oh, Haiti, yeah, yes.
Question:    Yeah.  There is this situation where, I mean, I think it's last October   than the Security Council approve a mission there.  But the situation   is actually worse than ever.  So, is any new action that the   Secretary-General is thinking to do to try to move things?
Spokesman:    I mean, listen, I think he laid out an option which the Security   Council adopted.  We hope that Member States will coalesce and move   forward as quickly as possible around the option that they themselves   decided upon.  Linda Fasulo?
Correspondent:  Thank you, Steph.  This is in regards to the war which has been going on as... [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Which one?
Question:    That's true.  Which one? The Hamas-Israeli war.  And my question is we   know it's been going on nearly three and a half months.  Given the UN's   major role in Gaza, humanitarian among other things, how would you   characterize the relationship or the level of access that the UN has   with Hamas? In other words, what is the relationship?  Is anything   discussed about, you know, ending the war or the hostages or anything   like that?
Spokesman:  I mean, as in many places where we operate in places where there are de facto authorities, right, that are just, by fact, are in charge, we deal with them on an operational level.
Question:  Is there anything specifically on a political level that might be occurring?
Spokesman:  I will stick to my first answer.  Yes.  All the way in the back.
Question:    You must have, like, an updated list of the numbers of the UN employees   who have been killed in Gaza.  And my question is, how do you approach   to Israel in terms of those victims?  Do you communicate any messages?    Have you urged them to stop bombing the places where your employees or   at least the sheltering places that you offer?
Spokesman:  Yes is the short answer.
Question:  And have you heard back from them?  And how do you assess their response so far after you've... [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Well, I mean, it's... I think you can assess the response as well as I can. Sir, Ahmed, please?
Question:    Thank you, Steph.  Let me pivot a little bit from Gaza and Middle East   to North Africa, Sudan.  A couple of days ago, there was a report about   the atrocities perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their   commander, General Dagalo Hemedti.  Some of the compelling numbers,   50,000 fatalities, seven and a half million displaced, and this is we're   talking about Darfur, we're not speaking about the whole of Sudan.  I'm   thinking to see what's the Secretary-General reaction towards the   latest report?  And does he see a role for the United Nations to   leverage the mediation or the process to end this brutal civil war?    [cross talk]
Spokesman:  Well, I mean, you know, we have   been... you know, the crisis in Sudan is one that arguably has been   underreported.  We keep efforting here to keep it in the news.  I mean, I   mentioned Sudan usually more than once a week and the horrific things   that are going on.  From the UN side, there is a commission of inquiry   set up by the Human Rights Council that has started its work.  They were   in Port Sudan.  Also, Ramtane Lamamra has been appointed as the   Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General. He has been to the region and   will continue to focus his work on the political side working with   African institutions, whether it's the African Union or whether it's   IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority for Development).  And we're hoping   that the international community, all those countries that have an   influence over the parties, one way or another, will all work towards   bringing this horrific suffering of the Sudanese people to an end.    Tony?
Question:  Shukran, Steph.  The Iraqi   Government said they submitted the complaint to the Security Council and   the SG as well.  First, can you confirm that the SG received this   complaint?
Spokesman:  I will check if the letter was received.  [He later confirmed that it was received.]
Correspondent:  Okay.  The letter was regarding following the Iranian attack.
Spokesman:    And often, there are... you know, Member States send letters to the   Secretary-General, and his capacity as Secretary-General, to be   circulated to the Security Council as official documents.  So, let me   check if that letter... [cross talk]
Correspondent:  Because the Security Council confirmed that they received it.
Spokesman:  Yes.  So, if they received it, the Secretary-General received it because he's the postmaster, in a sense.
Question:  Okay.  So, any comments on this letter?  Will he bring it up?  [cross talk]
Spokesman:  I mean, we have repeatedly called for Iran and all Member States to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq.  Mike?
Question:    I'm sorry if the question was already asked.  I had to step out.  Do   you have any readout or any details from Sigrid Kaag's meeting with the   Palestinian Authority Prime Minister yesterday?
Spokesman:    No, no specific readout.  Just to say that she met with him yesterday   as part of her initial mission to the region. You know, she had met with   the number of Israeli officials, including the President and members of   the security cabinet or the war cabinet on Sunday.  But no meat but   just a schedule.
Question:  What does she or the UN, more   broadly speaking, expect or desire or try to get out of the Palestinian   Authority, in terms of facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid?
Spokesman:  We're trying to get everyone on board to support the mandate given to her in the Security Council resolution.
Question:  Nothing specific?  I mean...
Spokesman:  I mean specific is to get more a humanitarian aid in.  Everyone has a role to play.
Question:    I wanted to follow-up on something.  Resolution, I think it was 2712.    The Security Council asked the Secretary-General to draw up some options   for scaling up humanitarian aid.  He provided three options.  Has the   Security Council selected one of those?  I mean, where's that process   right now?
Spokesman:  Well, I mean, you know, then we had   the subsequent resolution creating the role for Sigrid Kaag.  Yep.    Yvonne, I didn't see you, and I'm embarrassed that I try to speak Gaelic   in your presence.
Question:  Don't ever try that again.  [laughter]
Spokesman:  Yeah.  No.  Trust me.  I won't do it again until the Irish pay next year.  Yes?
Question:    Yeah.  Sorry. It was just really after an impression of what the   Secretary-General hopes and expects from today, considering there are   lots of important people in town.  We've seen Security Council   resolutions come and go.  He's been calling for humanitarian ceasefire   since October.  What are his hopes for today?
Spokesman:    His hopes are for unified voices on the Security Council to push and   support his call for a humanitarian ceasefire, to support the resolution   that was adopted and to move away from conflict towards peace.  Edith   and then Abdelhamid.  Oh, sorry.  And then go ahead.
Question:  Steph, can we get an update on what Hans Grundberg is doing in Yemen to try and alleviate this escalating...
Spokesman:  Yes, I will try to get that for you.  Abdelhamid?
Question:    Two questions.  First, the Belgium Prime Minister today said that she   would be calling for an international conference to start imposing what   she said or starting the process for the two-State solution.  Are you   aware of this?
Spokesman:  I haven't seen that.
Question:    Okay.  The second question, when you know that there are eight   universities have been demolished, 150 schools, 680,000 children don't   go to school.  And some people are still calling it war between Israel   and Hamas. Is that a fair description of what's going on in Gaza?
Spokesman:  It's a description that we're using.  Last question, Brian.
Question:  Is that right?
Spokesman:    We are very transparent in the words that we use, the   Secretary-General's words that he uses.  Up to you to support them, to   criticize them, to analyse them.  But I can only use the words that I   use.  Last question, because I have a meeting with my boss in literally   45 seconds.
Question:  And thank you so much.  According to the Astana Times, the Astana meetings starts again.  And according to the news story, UN is sending observers.  Is that correct?
Spokesman:    I will check; we'll check with Geir Pedersen's office.  [He later said   that Najat Rochdi was in Astana on Mr. Pedersen's behalf.]  Okay.  See   you this afternoon."

On January 17, the Defense Ministry said that Russian forces had destroyed a temporary staging area for foreign fighters in Kharkov, most of whom were French mercenaries, adding that about 60 soldiers had been killed.
On Wednesday night, Russian forces eliminated more than 130 militants from the Kraken unit and the Russian Volunteer Corps* in Kharkov, as well as more than 100 members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city of Balakleya, Sergey Lebedev, coordinator of the Nikolaev resistance movement, told Sputnik, citing his sources from Kharkov.
""Late in the evening of January 23 there was an attack on military facilities in the city of Kharkov. Residents of Kharkov reported three strikes. The first two were powerful and almost simultaneous. A few minutes later, a third strike came in with a large flash and a powerful explosion,"" said the coordinator.
According to him, the strikes were carried out near where French mercenaries were destroyed on January 17.
""This time, the Banderites belonging to the Kraken group and their subordinates from the so-called Russian Volunteer Corps* were hit. Another attack occurred a block away from the first. There was a small pocket of Nazis, as well as their equipment,"" Lebedev added.
He further mentioned that local residents have reported a significant number of ambulances en route to the site of the explosion. According to initial reports from the Kharkov press, over 35 individuals lost their lives and numerous others were injured. Lebedev highlighted that some of the injured and deceased were transported separately, while being closely monitored by officers from the Security Service of Ukraine.
""The data is being verified, but preliminary these were foreign mercenaries,"" the resistance movement coordinator said.
He mentioned that there are issues in Kharkov concerning mobile communications and the Internet/telecom operator ""Kievstar"" following the overnight attacks.
""Our agents also reported a very successful strike on the town of Balakleya in the southeast of the Kharkov region, where Ukrainian forces were located. According to them, the strike resulted in more than a hundred dead and about the same number of wounded,"" he said.

WS5IVFZQ6G_I6JRFG2V7K1552G,Government Of North Macedonia Resigns Under Roadmap For General Elections,_,_,20231227,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-rferl03.htm,"By RFE/RL's Balkan Service January 25, 2024
The prime minister of North Macedonia and his cabinet on January 25 submitted their resignations to parliament, clearing the way for a caretaker government to be installed ahead of general elections in May.
Prime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski said he thanked his ministers ahead of a meeting with Talat Xhaferi, speaker of the parliament, who also resigned on January 25, three days before he is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister.
""I will wish him a successful procedure until Sunday, and then a successful election of him as technical prime minister,"" Kovachevski told reporters, describing Xhaferi as a politician who has a lot of experience in running the parliament.
Xhaferi will be the first ethnic Albanian to hold the position of acting head of government.
Kovachevski said that while Xhaferi's style will be different, he ""will certainly maintain the state's strategic direction, which is the Western orientation [and] the strategic partnership with the United States.""
The practice of forming a caretaker government 100 days before election day was established in 2015 as part of a deal between the main political parties under the mediation of the European Union to end a political crisis at the time.
Parliament is also scheduled to vote on a new cabinet on January 28. The current opposition will have two ministers in the 20-member cabinet and three deputy ministers.
The main political parties agreed last month to hold general elections on May 8, which is two months early and will coincide with the second round of presidential elections. The first round is scheduled for April 24.
The main opposition party, the center-right VMRO-DPMNE, had been pressing for early elections, accusing the government led by the center-left Social Democrats and their junior coalition partners of corruption, nepotism, and incompetence.
Kovacevski, representing the Social Democratic Union, has been head of the government since January 2022. He expressed confidence that on May 9 he will lead the new government.
North Macedonia began membership talks with the European Union in 2022. The small Balkan country of 1.8 million people must meet certain criteria to join including changing its constitution to recognize a Bulgarian minority. The issue is highly contentious because of the overlapping histories and cultures of Bulgaria and North Macedonia.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday the United States will continue intensive engagement with African partners in hopes of resolving the ongoing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Blinken held talks Thursday with Angolan President Joao Lourenco in which they discussed ""concrete ways"" to achieve ""a durable peace"" in the DRC's conflict-ridden eastern region.
These discussions come against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Rwanda and the DRC, marked by several alleged cross-border attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces.
""The United States very much appreciates President Lourenco's continued efforts to de-escalate tensions between Rwanda and the DRC. We believe that the Luanda process, in tandem with the Nairobi process, is the best hope for enduring peace. Angola is trusted by all sides. President Lourenco's leadership is vital for breakthrough,"" said Blinken during a press conference before wrapping up the visit, which was part of a four-nation tour of Africa.
The chronic and escalating conflicts in eastern Congo have led regional countries to initiate two peace processes. The Nairobi Process is aimed at the disarmament of rebel groups within the DRC, while the Luanda Process focuses on resolving tensions between the DRC and its neighbor, Rwanda, which the DRC accuses of supporting the M23 rebel group. Rwanda denies the accusation.
In his meeting with Angolan Foreign Minister Tete Antonio, Blinken discussed the U.S.-Angola bilateral relationship, emphasizing the growing cooperation with Luanda in major railway infrastructure projects and outer space exploration.
""The United States has committed funding to refurbish the existing 1,300-kilometer Lobito Atlantic Railway. And we've taken the first steps to build out 800 kilometers a new rail reaching Zambia, including through a consortium with Angola and other partners,"" said Blinken during a joint press conference.
Blinken said these projects are the biggest investment the United States has made in railways on the African continent in over a generation and are central to the partnership for global infrastructure investment work in Angola.
In November 2023, the U.S. and Angola signed the Artemis Accords, a set of principles to guide space exploration cooperation among nations.
Over the past four years, the U.S. has significantly increased its military assistance to Angola, providing more than $18 million from 2020 to 2023. In the coming year, the U.S. will explore new opportunities to expand capacity-building efforts in cybersecurity and for Angola's Navy, according to the State Department.
Blinken began his four-nation tour of Africa on Monday. Besides Angola, the trip included stops in Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria.
In Cape Verde's capital Praia, Blinken met with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and toured Porto da Praia, modernized with U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation funding. Blinken praised Cape Verde for being the first country to complete two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts and starting a third. He also acknowledged Cape Verde's WHO certification as malaria-free.
In Ivory Coast, Blinken met with President Alassane Ouattara and announced $45 million in new funding to help the West African country and its neighbors prevent conflict and promote stability amid regional threats. This contribution brings the total U.S. stability-focused assistance in coastal West Africa to nearly $300 million since 2022.
Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in August 2020 and May 2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September 2022.
In Nigeria, Blinken held talks focused on regional security with President Bola Tinubu and Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar.
Nigeria shares a border with Niger, where the military ousted its elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, in July 2023.
Highlighting Nigeria's role in the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, Blinken commended its efforts toward restoring constitutional order and democracy in Niger.
During a press conference in Abuja, Blinken said the United States is determined to remain a strong security partner for Nigeria, a key partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist insurgents in West Africa.
The chief U.S. diplomat's trip to three countries in West Africa, and one in southern Africa, Angola, comes as Washington seeks to deepen its economic and security partnerships in regions where China and Russia have made significant inroads."
WVD8WNJD7Z_Y24J5VZARD280OT,UK announces new aid support for Gaza on Foreign Secretary visit to Middle East,_,_,20240126,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240125-ukfcdo02.htm,"The UK and Qatar are working together to get more aid into Gaza.
25 January 2024
The Foreign Secretary has announced that the UK and Qatar are working   together to get more aid into Gaza, with our first joint consignment   containing 17 tonnes of family sized tents being flown today [Thursday   25 January].
On the visit, the Foreign Secretary will witness first-hand both the   UK and Qatar's humanitarian aid being loaded onto a plane destined for   Egypt, after which it will go by road to Gaza. The tents will provide   critical shelter for people and are desperately needed, as more families   are displaced by the conflict and a cold winter continues.
Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:
The scale of suffering in Gaza is unimaginable. More must be done,   faster, to help people trapped in this desperate situation. We have   trebled our assistance for Gaza, and cooperation with partners like   Qatar is helping move life-saving aid and equipment over the border to   those living in devastation.
But our efforts will only make a difference if   aid gets to those who need it most, which is why we need more access for   UN staff. As I said to PM Netanyahu yesterday, far more trucks need to   be able to enter Gaza and more crossings need to open. We need an   immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostages out, followed by   a sustainable ceasefire, without a return to hostilities.
The UK has trebled its assistance and is continuing working with partners like Qatar to provide life-saving aid and equipment.
With reports of 9 out of 10 people in Gaza living on less than a meal   a day in northern Gaza, our focus must be on practical solutions to   save lives.
The Foreign Secretary pushed Israeli leaders for Ashdod to be used   for the delivery of life-saving aid into Gaza on his visit to the   region. The UK and its partners efforts can only make a difference if   they can reach those in urgent need.
Israel must take steps, working with other partners including the UN   and Egypt, to significantly increase the flow of aid into Gaza including   allowing prolonged humanitarian pauses, opening more routes into Gaza   and fully restoring water, fuel and electricity supplies.
The Foreign Secretary's Representative for Humanitarian Affairs in   the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Mark Bryson-Richardson, is based   in the region and is working intensively to address the blockages   preventing more aid reaching Gaza."

At least 25 civilians were killed and more than 20 wounded in the Ukrainian shelling of a market in Donetsk on Sunday.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement on Ukraine's shelling of Donetsk, calling it ""a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia.""
Russia urges international organizations and national governments to condemn Ukrainian attacks on Donetsk and stresses that any ""silence will mean unspoken approval of the massacre of civilians.""
The Foreign Ministry added: ""Kiev's terrorist attacks clearly demonstrate its lack of political will to reach a peace settlement through diplomatic means.""
However, the collective West is no less responsible for this terrorist attack since it has the ""desire to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation using Ukrainian puppets,"" a desire that has pushed Kiev to take even more ""reckless steps"", including ""terrorist acts, mass violation of international humanitarian law and war crimes.""
The ministry specified that shelling was conducted with the use of Western weaponry, which ""once again confirms its direct involvement in the conflict and makes it a partner in the crimes of the Zelensky regime's atrocities.""
The Foreign Ministry concluded that in the light of Donetsk shelling, the necessity to fulfill the goals and aims of the special military operation become even more evident since ""Ukrainian territory must not be a source of security threats"" and a platform for ""terrorist acts.""
On Sunday, Ukrainian troops shelled the Kirovsky district of Donetsk, a busy area with markets and shops, especially on weekends. According to the latest official information, the attack has claimed the lives of at least 25 civilians.
Ukraine regularly shells the Donetsk region, targeting civilian areas. According to the Joint Center for Control and Coordination (JCCC) of issues related to Ukraine's war crimes, Kiev has killed at least 9,152 civilians, including 233 children, in the Donetsk People's Republic since May 2014.

24 January 2024  From U.S. 2nd Fleet Public Affairs
NORFOLK, Va. -- The Whidbey Island-class dock landing ship USS Gunston Hall (LSD 44) departed Naval Station Norfolk, Jan. 24, for Steadfast Defender 2024, NATO's largest exercise in decades.
Exercise Steadfast Defender will involve approximately 90,000 forces from 31 Allies and Sweden.
Steadfast Defender 2024 will validate NATO's ability to deploy forces rapidly from North America and other parts of the Alliance to reinforce the defense of Europe, and it will showcase NATO's ability to conduct and sustain complex multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of miles, and in any conditions, from the High North to Central and Eastern Europe.
""The departure and transit signify the first tactical movements of the exercise and demonstrate the strength of the trans-Atlantic link,"" said Vice Adm. Doug Perry, commander, Joint Force Command Norfolk and U.S. 2nd Fleet. ""Working with our Allies and partners, Gunston Hall will embark Swedish and Finnish forces who will conduct amphibious landings throughout Norway. I am also sending a contingent of my U.S. 2nd Fleet staff to Norway to command and control NATO maritime forces as Task Force North. These efforts clearly demonstrate North America's commitment to NATO.""
For the last several years, Joint Force Command Norfolk and U.S. 2nd Fleet joined other NATO commands planning Steadfast Defender 24.
""The Alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via trans-Atlantic movement of forces from North America,"" said Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe. ""Steadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength, and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order.""
Royal Canadian Navy Rear Adm. David J. Patchell, vice commander, U.S. 2nd Fleet, who will be forward-deployed supporting the exercise, visited Gunston Hall days prior to the ship's departure to discuss the upcoming NATO exercise and its importance to U.S. 2nd Fleet's readiness to defend Allies and partners.
""This crew's preparations and their journey across the Atlantic represent the starting point of this historic NATO exercise,"" Patchell said. ""Demonstrating NATO's ability to rapidly deploy forces from North America and other parts of the Alliance, Gunston Hall will represent the U.S. Navy and is an essential element of the multinational NATO amphibious force.""
Gunston Hall is one of the most versatile amphibious platforms in the U.S. Navy. With two large helicopter landing pads, the largest well deck in the fleet and troop berthing facilities, she has the ability to embark a diverse array of military forces, including NATO Allies and partners when needed.
""Gunston Hall Sailors are looking forward to the experiences involved in operating overseas and working closely with our Allies,"" said Cmdr. Christopher W. Van Loenen, commanding officer of Gunston Hall. ""The conversation with the Rear Adm. Patchell gave us insight into why exercises like this one are so important and how important it is to keep our ship battle ready.""
This year marks NATO's 75th Anniversary, with a defensive Alliance that has grown from 12 to 31.
""For 75 years, NATO Allies have worked together to keep our one billion people safe,"" Perry said. ""In this moment where we face the most dangerous and unpredictable security environment, Steadfast Defender sends a clear message - NATO is capable, modern, and if required, ready to defend every inch of Allied territory.""
U.S. 2nd Fleet, reestablished in 2018 in response to the changing global security environment, develops and employs maritime forces ready to fight across multiple domains in the Atlantic and Arctic in order to ensure access, deter aggression and defend U.S., allied, and partner interests."

Closer cooperation with developing nations to achieve more balanced global landscape, fend off rising uncertainty
By Zhao Yusha Published: Jan 21, 2024 08:20 PM Updated: Jan 21, 2024 11:14 PM
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent visits to Africa and Latin America, his first overseas trips in 2024, underscore China's growing emphasis on Global South countries. Chinese experts argue that closer coordination with these nations will help create a more balanced and sustainable global landscape, which is crucial in the face of increasing uncertainties and turmoil ahead.
The strong bond between China and many developing countries is not only based on extensive economic cooperation but also on unwavering support for each other's core interests, as exemplified by the Taiwan question. Experts believe that this shared consensus forms the foundation and prerequisite for China's relations with these Global South countries.
China hopes to work with Jamaica to synergize development strategies, expand cooperation in various fields, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and consolidate the public opinion foundation for China-Jamaica friendship, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said Saturday during a meeting with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness.
Holness said that China did not hesitate to lend a helping hand when Jamaica encountered difficulties, which has strongly supported Jamaica's economic development and the improvement of people's lives, and vividly demonstrates China's sincere will to help developing countries.
China's top diplomat's trip to the Caribbean country came after his visit to Brazil, where he met with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Friday. The two spoke highly of the China-Brazil comprehensive strategic partnership.
Wang and Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira co-chaired the fourth China-Brazil Foreign Ministerial-Level Comprehensive Strategic Dialogue on Friday, vowing to strengthen the synergy of development strategies and expand cooperation in emerging fields. They signed an agreement on mutual visa facilitation to further expand personnel exchanges between the two countries.
Jamaica marks the last stop of Wang's New Year trip of 2024. Before visiting Latin America, the Chinese Foreign Minister also visited Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire.
Strengthening cooperation with developing countries has always been a priority for China's diplomacy, and China seeks to better coordinate the cooperation with those countries to achieve a sustainable, healthy and balanced global diplomatic landscape, Jiang Shixue, a professor at the Center for Latin American Studies at Shanghai University, told the Global Times.
Adhere to one-China principle
Both Holness and Lula voiced support and adherence to the one-China principle. After he concluded his trip to four African countries, Wang told media on Friday that leaders from those four countries all reiterated their adherence to the one-China principle.
When it comes to issues involving China's core interests, African countries have shown the most resolute attitude and clear stance, fully reflecting the fine tradition of mutual support between China and Africa, Wang said.
Noting that Brazil and China highly agree on many major issues, the Brazilian president said that he looks forward to working with China to improve global governance and enhance the overall strength and the voice of developing countries in international affairs.
Strong consensus in each other's core interests, as well as on most international affairs, is the solid foundation and prerequisite for China's ties with developing countries. Take the Taiwan question as an example, most developing countries keep a clear mind and stand firm with the one-China principle, while a few countries, willing to serve as US vassals, always seek to stir up confrontation with China on this question, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday.
Li said it is crucial for the Global South to assert its stance on the Taiwan question, making it clear to some Western nations that endorsing the one-China principle is the prevailing consensus and that any interference or provocation in the Taiwan Straits by these Western countries is unwelcome. The Western countries' provocations on the Taiwan question are only amusing themselves on the international stage, he said.
After Taiwan's regional election earlier this month, countries such as Canada, Japan, France and UK and the EU sent ""congratulations"" to the island. Later, the Chinese embassies in Canada, Japan, France and the UK as well as Mission of China to the EU expressed their strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to those countries and regions.
Stabilizing forces
Wang highlighted the increased uncertainty and instability the world is facing when he met with Celso Amorim, advisor to the Brazilian President. As independent emerging powers, China and Brazil should first manage their own affairs well, while strengthening unity, cooperation, and anchoring common goals to demonstrate their responsibilities as major countries and become crucial stabilizing forces in a multi-polar system, he said.
Observers said that as the world economy is still suffering from a sluggish recovery, it is high time for developing countries to huddle together. The closer they huddle, the stronger they will be in resisting the rising uncertainty.
Li pointed out that the biggest uncertainty lies in the US. A comeback of former president Donald Trump is predicted by many policy pundits to cause unease for the global economy.
Despite winning only one 2024 Republican nomination contest, global media outlets are abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of a Trump 2.0 presidency on the world economy. A CNBC article last week said that Trump's potential return to the White House dominated the conversation at this year's edition of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
""Every question I've gotten as I've walked up and down the [Davos] Promenade today is, 'is he coming back?'"" Tim Adams, president of the Institute of International Finance, told CNBC.
Moreover, many developing countries are attracted to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China's Global Security Initiative and the Global Development Initiative, along with other proposals, Li said. He noted that those plans connect Global South countries more closely, and better serve their own development plans.
Wang discussed the BRI with both the Jamaican leader and the Brazilian Foreign Minister. Wang and Vieira vowed to explore the strategic synergy between the Belt and Road cooperation and Brazil's reindustrialization and New Growth Acceleration Program and deepen cooperation in traditional areas, as well as expand cooperation in emerging fields."

20240123
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Ukraine has received almost $3.5 billion in military aid from Poland since February 2022, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on Monday.
""Poland provided Ukraine with weapons and equipment worth almost $3.5 billion,"" Shmygal said during a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk, in Kiev, as quoted by the RBC-Ukraine news agency.
Shmyhal noted that Warsaw sent to Kiev hundreds of tanks, aircraft, helicopters, air defense systems, anti-aircraft missile systems, infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers, anti-tank weapons and ammunition.
Western countries, including member states of the European Union, have been providing military and financial aid to Kiev since the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin has consistently warned against continued arms deliveries to Kiev, saying it would lead to further escalation of the conflict. In April 2022, Russia sent a diplomatic note to all NATO countries on the issue of arms supplies to Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that any cargo containing weapons for Ukraine will become a legitimate target for Russian strikes.

The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in Pakistan's southwestern Sindh Province has said it has arrested a suspect in the 2019 attempted assassination attempt on a top Pakistani cleric, accusing the arrested man of being a ""trained terrorist"" who belongs to the Zainebiyoun Brigade, a militant group allegedly backed by Iran.
The CTD said in a January 20 statement that Syed Mohammad Mehdi was arrested in an operation at a bazaar in Karachi. The CTD accused Mehdi of targeting clerics in the provincial capital and of working for Iranian intelligence.
Khuram Waris, who heads the CTD in Karachi, told Radio Mashaal on January 21 that Mehdi is a Pakistani citizen who received training in a ""neighboring country.""
""He is a member of the Zainabiyoun Brigade. He was involved in many attacks, including the attack on Mufti Taqi Usmani in Karachi.""
Usmani, a religious scholar and former top court judge in Pakistan, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Karachi in 2019. Two of Usmani's bodyguards were killed in the attack, for which no group claimed responsibility.
Waris claimed two associates of Mehdi's were also involved in recent attacks against clerics in Karachi.
The Zainabiyoun Brigade is alleged to have been formed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and believed to have up to 1,000 fighters.
The arrest comes amid heightened tensions between Islamabad and Tehran after the IRGC on January 16 launched unannounced missile and drone attacks against targets in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan.
The attacks against Jaish al-Adl, a U.S. designated terrorist group targeted that has been accused by Tehran of carrying out deadly attacks in Iran, were justified by Tehran as its ""legitimate and legal right to deter national security threats.""
Pakistan condemned the strike on its territory and responded on January 18 with air strikes against separatist groups allegedly hiding out on Iranian territory.

XA4T1Q4HZQ_NN5Y5EXJ6JBPKP5,Afghan Journalist Detained In Taliban's Continued Crackdown On Independent Media,_,_,20240123,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240122-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Radio Azadi January 22, 2024
The Taliban has detained another Afghan journalist in the country's capital, Kabul, in a continuing crackdown on independent media in Afghanistan.
Media watchdog the Afghanistan Journalist Center (AFJC) said Taliban intelligence officers detained Ehsan Akbari, an Afghan reporter for Japan's Kyodo news agency.
""The arrest of this journalist shows that the ruling group is trying to suppress the media and freedom of expression,"" Samia Walizadeh, the head of the communications and litigation at AFJC, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi on January 22.
The organization says the arrest violates the country's media law that was crafted by the previous, pro-Western Afghan republic.
After returning to power in August 2021, the Taliban suspended Afghanistan's constitution and most of the laws adopted over the two decades the militants were out of power. The hard-line Islamist group has issued a vague guideline for journalists, which requires them not to violate Afghan and Islamic values, since it came back to rule.
""We demand his immediate and unconditional release,"" the AFJC added in a statement.
The organization has demanded that the Taliban, and in particular its intelligence agency, ""should respect the country's media law and end the process of suppressing journalists and free media.""
Sayed Amir Akbari, a brother of the detained journalist, said that Ehsan Akbari was detained in the government's media and information center on January 17 after he was called there for questioning.
""The next morning, the Taliban intelligence officers took Ehsan Akbari to the news agency's office [in Kabul] and took away his laptop and camera,"" he told the AFJC.
He added that the militants forced him to call his family to hand over his mobile phone to Taliban officials when they arrived.
As per the Taliban's practice, the group has neither confirmed nor denied his arrest.
The detention of journalists has started to become more commonplace in Afghanistan.
On January 18, the Taliban detained journalists Jawad Rasouli and Abdul Haq Hamidi. Both worked for a local news agency, Gardesh-e Etilat.
They were released on January 20 after their families handed over an affidavit, which typically guarantees that they would not violate Taliban rules.
The AFJC said the Taliban arrested 61 journalists in 2023. While most were released after weeks or months of detentions, some were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
Overall, the AFJC documented 168 cases of violence and intimidation against journalists during the past year, highlighting the extensive censorship the authoritarian rulers are exercising over the media.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy announced on Wednesday that the aircraft carrier Shandong recently conducted a series of exercises while moored at its homeport, with analysts saying that the port drills can enhance the carrier's capabilities at sea.
One of the objectives practiced in the multi-course regular exercises was damage control, as being capable of putting out fire below deck is vital to the maintenance of a warship's endurance and combat capability, the PLA Navy said in a press release on Wednesday.
During a fire drill, sailors fully equipped with fire suits, hydraulic guns and thermometers rushed to cabins which were simulated to be on fire, overcame challenges including heavy smoke, limited lines of sight and narrow spaces, and rapidly completed the firefighting missions with consecutive procedures including confirming the cause of fire, targeted extinguishing and ventilating smoke, the PLA Navy said.
The time and location of the exercise was randomly designated, so it was closer to real combat, said Chen Xiao, a crew member on the aircraft carrier Shandong.
""We will continue to review and summarize to work out weaknesses, and provide safety guards for the carrier to carry out duties and missions,"" Chen said.
Another training course, held in the flight planning and dispatch center located in the island of the Shandong, was a dispatch, coordination and cooperation exercise simulating the launches and recoveries of carrier-based aircraft, according to the press release.
Scaled models of the Shandong's flight deck, multiple types of aircraft and small parts representing status of aircraft were used to assist dispatchers in coordinating dozens of aircraft on the flight deck to complete procedures in a short time, the PLA Navy said.
These procedures included aircraft takeoff and landing, maintenance, munitions loading and refueling, and when they were done, comprehensive information provided crew members on multiple positions including the deck and the hangar were taken into account.
""In 2024, we will enhance training in fields such as aviation support and emergency response, hold combat exercises in accordance with plans, and explore new potential in boosting the carrier's combat capabilities,"" said Gui Zhou, another crew member.
Following intensive exercises and patrol operations at sea, it is normal that the Shandong returns to homeport for regular replenishment and maintenance, but this does not mean that crew members on the carrier would stop training, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday.
Damage control and aircraft dispatch are important aspects of carrier operations, and they can be practiced not only at sea, but also at port, the expert said.
Commissioned on December 17, 2019, the Shandong, China's second aircraft carrier, also the first one domestically built, is homeported in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, according to openly available information.
According to media reports, the Shandong held multiple far seas exercises in the West Pacific in 2023, sailing to waters to the east of the island of Taiwan multiple times, where the carrier can cut off escape routes of ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and deny foreign military interference, analysts said.
Experts predicted that the Shandong will continue to hold similar far seas exercises in 2024 and further enhance its combat readiness and capabilities."

I have heard about the airplane crash, and I would like to offer my condolences in connection with the death of Russian soldiers on my own behalf and on behalf of our people.
I have come from a friendly and fraternal country, a sovereign country that would like to enhance its relations with this friendly country.
I would like once again to thank you for the invitation. I hope, and our people hope that we will actively work together after this historic visit. There are exchanges, and we will continue to develop them for the benefit of the entire nation.
Thank you.
Vladimir Putin: Mr President, I suggest that we organise our work in the following manner. We will allow our colleagues to speak, and then we can sum up certain results of our extended talks. After that, I would like to invite you for a working lunch where you and I can discuss issues of bilateral relations and international issues face to face.

By Liu Xin, Xing Xiaojing and Zhao Juecheng Published: Jan 23, 2024 06:30 PM Updated: Jan 23, 2024 10:16 PM
China on Tuesday released a white paper on its legal framework and measures for counter-terrorism, which sums up the characteristics of its counter-terrorism efforts over the past decades and exploration of the path of law-based counter-terrorism work.
This white paper released on Tuesday is China's first systematic exposition of the legal system and practice of its counter-terrorism work, which will help the outside world gain a comprehensive understanding of the country's counter-terrorism legislation and practices. It will also help dispel disinformation and refute rumors, especially on China's counter-terrorism efforts in its Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, analysts said.
The seven-part white paper, which was released by the State Council Information Office on Tuesday, is titled ""China's Legal Framework and Measures for Counter-terrorism."" In the preface, it expounds on the necessity of counter-terrorism legal governance and outlines the framework for implementing counter-terrorism legal governance construction.
In the main body, the white paper reviews the improvement of the legal framework concerning efforts in counter-terrorism in China, expounds on the clear provisions for determination and punishment of terrorist activities, shows how individuals' human rights have been protected in accordance with laws during the counter-terrorism work, and displays the achievements of China's efforts in fighting terrorism. The white paper also presents cases to enhance readability.
As China's first white paper to systematically elaborate on China's legal framework and practices for counter-terrorism, it details the substantive legal basis, operation and supervision mechanisms, rights protection mechanisms in handling terrorist activities, as well as the achievements China has made in conducting counter-terrorism work in accordance with the law, Li Changlin, a professor from the Human Rights Institute School of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times.
The release of the white paper will also help further clarify misunderstandings on China's counter-terrorism efforts, exposing the malicious intentions of those who distort the truth, Li said.
Systematic exposition
Besides the preface and conclusion, the white paper consists of five parts - ""An Improving Legal Framework for Counter-terrorism,"" ""Clear Provisions for the Determination and Punishment of Terrorist Activities,"" ""Standardized Exercise of Power in Fighting Terrorism,"" ""Protection of Human Rights in Counter-terrorism Practices"" and ""Effective Protection of People's Safety and National Security.""
While introducing the legal framework for counter-terrorism, the white paper noted that ""Relying on more than 40 years of experience, China has gradually formed a counter-terrorism legal framework based on the Constitution. With the Counter-terrorism Law as the center-piece and the criminal laws and National Security Law playing major roles and other laws as supplements, it also covers administrative regulations, judicial interpretations, local regulations, and departmental and local government rules.""
As a victim of terrorism, China has continuously attached great importance to law-based counterterrorism efforts and after a long exploration, it has gradually formed a comprehensive anti-terrorism legal framework. The white paper issued on Tuesday is a comprehensive introduction on China's approach to the issue and will help the public and those involved in the area to gain a deeper understanding of the anti-terrorism legal system, and thus clarifies how to safeguard national and social security, Wang Jian, an expert at the Institute of China's Borderland Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, told the Global Times.
The framework related to counter-terrorism in China conforms to realities on the ground and also complies with relevant international conventions, the practical standards of most countries in counter-terrorism, and responds to the calls of the United Nations, said Wang.
China's Xinjiang region is one of the main battlefields to fight against terrorism, analysts said, noting that the State Council Information Office released several white papers relating to counter-terrorism work in Xinjiang region and they mainly focused on counter-terrorism, de-radicalization, human rights protection, and vocational education and training.
Li told the Global Times that previous white papers on the Xinjiang region focused on showing the progress Xinjiang has made in terms of human rights protection. The white paper released on Tuesday is no longer limited to Xinjiang region, but eyes on the whole country, providing a more systematic exposition of China's counter-terrorism legal system.
The white paper also uses one part to expound on the clear provisions for determination and punishment of terrorist activities. It noted that ""Chinese law has clear provisions for the determination and punishment of terrorist activities. It distinguishes between administrative violations and criminal acts based on the degree of harm they cause, and affixes different legal liabilities accordingly.""
The criteria for the determination of terrorism-related violations and penalties are stipulated in the Counterterrorism Law, and the criteria for the determination and punishment of terrorist crimes are stipulated in the Criminal Law, according to the white paper.
While expounding on the determination of criminal terrorist activities, the white paper listed a case, which showed that between 2004 and 2010, a suspect surnamed Bai provided transfer, accommodation, and false identity certification for persons trying to leave China to conduct terrorist activities abroad, with full knowledge of their intentions.
Bai's actions had serious consequences. The case was tried in a court in Henan Province, which ruled that Bai's actions constituted the crime of sponsoring terrorist activities, in accordance with the Criminal Law.
Rebuking disinformation
Aside from detailing China's counter-terrorism measures in accordance with the law, the white paper also noted that China's counter-terrorism work also contributed to regional and global security and stability.
It added that China has joined 12 global counterterrorism conventions and facilitated the formulation of documents such as the Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Member States Agreement on Border Defense Cooperation, playing an important role in maintaining international and regional security and stability.
Terrorism is the number one enemy of human rights protection, and counter-terrorism is a global issue. China's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures, based on its own practical exploration, provide China's experience for global counterterrorism efforts and offer reference for combating terrorism worldwide, Duan Yangwei, a professor from the National Security School of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times.
Taking Xinjiang as an example, through combating terrorism according to laws, there have been no violent terrorist incidents in many years, and the infiltration of religious extremism has been effectively curbed, ensuring the rights and interests of people from all ethnic groups, such as the right to life, health, and freedom, said Duan.
However, some Western countries, led by the US, have attacked China's counter-terrorism efforts, especially in its Xinjiang region and spread disinformation to defame China's counter-terrorism work.
The white paper on Tuesday also noted in the conclusion part that some countries often disregard others' right to choose their own path of counter-terrorism under the rule of law and even interfere in others' internal affairs, and infringe on their national sovereignty under the pretext of defending the rule of law and human rights.
These actions have severely hampered the global effort to fight against terrorism under the rule of law, weakened the foundations of cooperation, and reduced operational effectiveness, according to the white paper.
Li said that some foreign media and personnel lack knowledge of China's legislation and they only speculate and judge China's legislation and practices based on their shallow understanding of their own country's laws and practices.
Some anti-China forces are fabricating disinformation on China's counter-terrorism work with malicious intention and spreading rumors, including those surrounding so-called ""forced labor.""
""This white paper will undoubtedly help foreigners who are willing to know more about China and help them see through those who maliciously distort facts about China,"" said Li.
China's counter-terrorism work conducted in accordance with the law not only respects and guarantees human rights in counter-terrorism, safeguards national security, public security, and the safety of people's lives and property, but also makes contributions to global and regional security and stability. The achievements made are obvious to all, said Li."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The talks on the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip have reached a stalemate as Israel rejects Hamas' demand for a constant ceasefire, NBC News reported on Monday, citing sources.
Israel's position led to an impasse despite the parties to the conflict already agreeing on some mechanisms for the possible hostage release, the report said. The preliminary agreement included a month-long ceasefire and the gradual release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the broadcaster reported.
On October 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages. Over 25,100 people have been killed so far in Gaza as a result of Israeli strikes, local authorities said.
On November 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on December 1.

The United States and Britain on January 23 followed Australia in imposing sanctions on Russian citizen Aleksandr Yermakov, who was designated for his alleged role in a cyberattack that compromised the personal information of 9.7 million Australians.
The U.S. Treasury Department announced its sanctions against Yermakov after Australian authorities said their investigation tied him to the breach of Australian private health insurer Medibank in October 2022.
The department said in a statement that the United States and Britain imposed sanctions on Yermakov because of the risk he poses. The U.S. action freezes any assets he holds in U.S. jurisdiction and generally bars Americans from dealing with him.
""Russian cyber actors continue to wage disruptive ransomware attacks against the United States and allied countries, targeting our businesses, including critical infrastructure, to steal sensitive data,"" said Brian Nelson, U.S. undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
""Today's trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom, the first such coordinated action, underscores our collective resolve to hold these criminals to account,"" he added in a statement.
Yermakov, 33, who used the online aliases blade_runner, GustaveDore, and JimJones, resides in Moscow, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.
The Australian government imposed its power to sanction an individual for cybercrime for the first time, applying the law against Yermakov after Australian Federal Police and intelligence agencies linked the Russian citizen to the Medibank cyberattack.
""This is the first time an Australian government has identified a cybercriminal and imposed cybersanctions of this kind and it won't be the last,"" Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil told reporters.
The cyberattack on Medibank, Australia's largest health insurer, involved sensitive medical records that were released on the dark web after the company refused to pay a ransom.
O'Neil said it was ""the single most devastating cyberattack we have experienced as a nation.""
The leaks targeted records related to drug abuse, sexually transmitted infections, and abortions.
""We all went through it, literally millions of people having personal data about themselves, their family members, taken from them and cruelly placed online for others to see,"" O'Neil said, calling the hackers ""cowards"" and ""scum bags.""
The Australian sanctions impose a travel ban and strict financial sanctions that make it a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment for anyone found guilty of providing assets to Yermakov or using his assets, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said.
Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said the sanctions are part of Australia's efforts to expose cybercriminals and debilitate groups engaging in cyberattacks.
""In our current strategic circumstances we continue to see governments, critical infrastructure, businesses, and households in Australia targeted by malicious cyberactors,"" Marles said in a statement.

January 23, the State Defence Council has approved the proposition of the Ministry of National Defence to add a new unit, an Infantry Division, to the Law on Establishing the Principal Structure of the Armed Forces, and the proposed choice of a heavy capability a division needs - the Leopard 2 tank platform.
The draft amendment to the law the principal structure of the Armed Forces and limit numbers of military personnel considered by the State Defence Council stipulates that the Infantry Division will be established by forming the necessary new or stepping up the existing units of the Lithuanian Armed Forces.
A new Artillery Regiment is proposed to be established and the existing units Col Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion and the Air Force Air Defence Battalion are proposed to be reorganized as Col Juozas Vitkus Engineer Regiment and the Air Force Air Defence Regiment.  Weaponry systems required for the reorganization have already been ordered. Also, King Mindaugas Hussar Battalion is planned to be reorganized as King Mindaugas Tank Battalion.
The draft amendment also proposes establishment of a Harbor and Littoral Defence Service of the Navy and a Cyber Defence Command which would integrate the Lithuanian Great Hetman Kristupas Radvila PerkÅ«nas Communications and Information Systems Battalion and the IT Service.
The other direction of the Infantry Brigade development is acquisition of new weaponry systems in order to increase combat power and maneuver defence of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Therefore, the State Defence Council has discussed the best heavy component (tank unit) platform to that end.
The decision that the German Leopard 2 tank platform was the most efficient choice was based on an additional assessment carried out by the Ministry of National Defence and other relevant institutions on the political, economic (industrial) and financial aspects of the matter.  Earlier, a military assessment also pointed out the Leopard 2 platform as the most efficient pick.
The State Defence Council also approved the increase of the maximum number of the mandatory military service conscripts, the decision should be implemented in several stages following the Seimas' approval of the conscription reform and would bring Lithuania closer to a universal conscription model. Draft amendment to the law the principal structure of the Armed Forces and limit numbers of military personnel  stipulates an increase in the overall limit personnel number from  20 840 to 29 380 and the number of the Initial Mandatory Military Service conscripts from 4 240 to 7 040.
The changes introduced to the structure of the Lithuanian Armed Forces by the establishment of the division and other new units, also the military service modifications, will require additional appropriations for national defence, however, the relentless and persistent Russian threat needs an urgent boost in defence."

21 January 2024

Your Excellency, President Yoweri Musevini,  Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen, all protocol observed,
It is a pleasure to join you for this very important summit.
I thank the Government of Uganda for its hospitality, and congratulate it on the leadership of the G77 plus China.
Sixty years ago, recognising the need for unity and solidarity in the face of common challenges, the G77 was born.
Over the decades, you have been an engine for South-South cooperation and development; lifted millions of people out of poverty; and provided a powerful voice for developing countries on the global stage.
Today, you are the largest grouping of the global South, representing 80 percent of the world's population.
And your solidarity and partnership are essential to building a sustainable, peaceful, and just world for all.
A world in which the United Nations Charter, international law and human rights prevail in global relations.
Excellencies,
Halfway to the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, far from leaving no one behind, we are leaving half the world behind.
Progress on poverty and hunger is stalling and, in some countries, going into reverse.
Many G-77 members are grappling with an economic hangover from the Covid-19 pandemic, crippling debts, a cost-of-living crisis and sky-high borrowing costs.
Hundreds of millions of people around the world, particularly women and girls, are living without the most basic respect for their human rights. And the lack of jobs is generating enormous frustration among young people.
Climate disasters most of you did little to create are knocking chunks out of your economies and increasing people's suffering.
Investment in sustainable development and climate action is slipping further out of reach.
And while South-South cooperation is strong and deepening, it does not replace the need for the respect of the commitments of the global North - for sustained engagement to reduce poverty and inequality, support growth, and build resilience in developing countries.
Digital technologies have enormous potential for good - but they are also inflaming inequalities. The International Monetary Fund warns that artificial intelligence could make things even worse.
And peace - the foundation of sustainable development - is breaking down amidst a climate of global impunity.
Around the world - from Sudan, to Ukraine, the Middle East and beyond - wars are devastating lives, fuelling mass movements of people, disrupting global supply chains, and threatening to set entire regions alight.
In Gaza, Israel's military operations have spread massive destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as Secretary General, including more than 150 members of our own staff, following the horrific terror attacks by Hamas on 7 October.
This is heart-breaking, and utterly unacceptable.
The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region.
And that starts with an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to relieve the suffering in Gaza, allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in need, and facilitate the release of hostages, which should be immediate and unconditional.
The repeated refusal yesterday to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians is totally unacceptable, as I told the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement.
The denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security; exacerbate polarization; and embolden extremists everywhere.
Excellencies,
Righting our troubled world depends on effective global action.
Yet the international system is out of date, out of time, and out of step, reflecting a bygone age when many of your countries were still colonized.
The United Nations Security Council is paralyzed by geopolitical divisions.
And its composition does not reflect the reality of today's world.
It must be reformed.
And the global financial system, including the Bretton Woods Institutions, has failed to provide a global safety net for developing countries in distress, as it was created after the Second World War in a totally different global economic situation.
Yet, amidst all this gloom, there is hope.
Last year, the SDG Summit issued a strong political declaration - thanks in large part to the advocacy and tenacity of G77 countries.
And this year we have an opportunity to build on that success.
The Summit of the Future, to be held in New York in September, is a generational opportunity.
It aims to reform and revitalize multilateralism so that it works for everyone, everywhere - and meets the challenges of today.
It is a chance to create the conditions for countries to achieve the SDGs. To find consensus on frameworks to address new challenges. And to build a better world for us all.
We rely on the G77 plus China to make the Summit of the Future a success.
To seize this opportunity and to find common solutions.
The Summit will consider deep reforms of the international financial architecture.
Financial institutions and frameworks created after the Second World War still largely correspond to the power relations and the global economy of that time.
They must be reformed so that they are truly universal; reflect with justice the realities of today; and are much more responsive to the needs of developing countries.
I have also proposed an SDG Stimulus of $500 billion a year in affordable, long-term finance for sustainable development and climate action in developing countries.   And Multilateral Development Banks must be adequately capitalized, and must change their business models to leverage far more private finance for developing countries at reasonable cost.
The SDG Stimulus calls for urgent action on debt, including breathing space for countries facing unbearable repayment schedules.
And it calls for the expansion of the contingency financing for countries in need, including through the rechannelling of Special Drawing Rights.
Momentum is building. All countries backed these proposals in the SDG Summit last year. But now we must turn them into reality.
Excellencies,
Beyond the Summit of the Future, I ask you to unite against climate catastrophe.
The very existence of some countries in this room depends on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius - in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.
I urge you to hold developed countries to account for climate justice, and for leading an equitable and just transition, based on the phaseout of fossil fuel and massive investment in renewable energy.
All financial commitments must be met.
Clarifying the delivery of the $100 billion, and doubling adaptation finance by 2025, are only starting points.
The Loss and Damage Fund is a step forward and a testament to the power of the Global South. But we must call for meaningful contributions that have not yet been announced.
And we must also advocate for an ambitious new finance goal for the future at COP29.
And we must not forget that the just and equitable energy transition includes producing and trading critical minerals in a way that is fair, sustainable, and provides maximum benefit to developing countries.
They must be more than simple exporters of raw materials.
Excellencies,
New technologies can turbocharge progress toward the SDGs.
Our proposed Global Digital Compact aims to ensure that in a new technological era, no one is left behind.
And I hope it will be agreed at the Summit of the Future.
And the High-Level Body on Artificial Intelligence that I created, which includes several experts from G77 countries and is balanced 50 percent North and 50 percent South, has already made preliminary recommendations on global Artificial Intelligence governance, including the objective of accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals.
The new Scientific Advisory Board is also working to ensure scientific breakthroughs are shared equally for the benefit of all.
And I praise the efforts done by the Presidency of Cuba to put science and technology in the center of G77 concerns.
I encourage you to engage in all these efforts.
The 21st century cannot replicate the vast inequalities of the twentieth.
Do not let new rules for new technologies be written by the rich, for the rich.
Excellencies,
Let us face it: those that benefit most from the present global governance system are unlikely to lead its reform.
So, momentum for change must come from you.
I urge you to keep driving these efforts forward.
We have a chance to cultivate a just, peaceful and prosperous future, where no one is left behind.
But for that, a lot needs to be changed and reformed. Together, let's unite and fight to make that a reality.
And I thank you."

Question: The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency decided that Sweden is not obliged to include in its national quota the 5.8 million tonnes of harmful substances that were released into the air due to the act of sabotage at the Nord Stream gas pipelines. What do you think about this?
Maria Zakharova: This decision shows that Stockholm is trying to avoid paying large fines for exceeding EU-established standards. It is trying to justify its decision by referring to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, insisting that the kingdom's jurisdiction cannot be applied to the foreign pipelines in Sweden's exclusive economic zone. Thus, they concluded that Sweden is not responsible for the harmful emissions into the environment due to the bombing of the gas pipelines that run between Russia and Germany.
In addition, more questions about Stockholm's role in this unseemly episode are raised in connection with Swedish media reports on the Swedish Belos rescue ship with its special equipment for underwater work. It arrived promptly at the site of the crime and collected some ""precious evidence,"" including explosives residue.
Far from facilitating a meticulous and unbiased investigation into the deliberate sabotage of the operation of a large international energy facility, the Swedish authorities are not willing to share out its environmental consequences.
The Danish authorities are not interested in a serious investigation into the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines either. Copenhagen and Stockholm continue to reject any interaction with Russia on this issue. In December 2023, the Prosecutor-General's Office of Denmark refused a request from its Russian counterpart to provide legal assistance in investigating the act of sabotage on the Nord Stream-1 and Nord Stream-2 gas pipelines.
Despite the artificial obstacles, we will continue insisting on a transparent and depoliticised investigation into these acts with the participation of competent Russian agencies and with Gazprom."

Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder; Senior Defense Official and Senior Military Official
MAJ. GEN. PAT RYDER: All right, well, good evening, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us this evening, so short notice. I'm Major General Pat Ryder, Pentagon Press Secretary, and I'll be facilitating tonight's background briefing on multinational strikes against military targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen intended to further disrupt and degrade the capabilities that the Houthis have used to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners.
Please note tonight's call is on background, which means you may attribute the comments of our briefers to a Senior Defense Official and a Senior Military Official. Appreciate your help with that [REDACTED]. Please note I'll call on reporters. We'll try to get to as many of your questions as possible in the time we have available. And before we begin, I'd ask that you please keep your phones on mute unless you're asking a question.
And with that, I will turn it over to our Senior Defense Official.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Since November 19th, 2023, Houthi rebels have launched attacks on at least 33 commercial vessels using a range of weaponry, including anti-ship ballistic missiles, close-range ballistic missiles, land attack cruise missiles, uncrewed aerial vehicles, and unmanned surface vehicles.
These assaults, notably the unprecedented use of anti-ship ballistic missiles, have significantly disrupted the free flow of commerce and navigational rights in one of the globe's most critical waterways. The Red Sea is a vital artery for nearly 15 percent of global seaborne trade, including eight percent of the world's grain trade, 12 percent of seaborne-traded oil, and eight percent of global liquified natural gas, and it's been compromised.
Incidents of concern include the seizure of a Japan-owned vessel with a multinational crew, a missile strike on a Norwegian tanker transporting vegetable oil, and an attack on a New York-bound vessel carrying 16.1 million gallons of U.S.-owned jet fuel.
U.S. military and merchant vessels have faced persistent threats from Houthi missiles and UAVs. Notable incidents include a January 14th attack on the USS Laboon and a barrage of nearly two dozen munitions on January 9th targeting U.S. Navy and U.S.-flagged merchant vessels.
U.S.-owned vessels, including the M/V Genco Picardy and the M/V GIBRALTAR EAGLE, were also struck in mid-January. Increasing danger has led over 14 shipping companies to cease Red Sea operations, severely impacting global commerce and the economies of Egypt and Jordan.
In response, President Biden has directed the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to execute precise strikes against select Houthi targets in Yemen. This action aims to deter further regional maritime attacks and diminish Houthi capabilities.
These strikes, while necessary, do not indicate a shift in our approach to the region. We remain committed to the rules-based international order and will defend ourselves as needed. This action, grounded in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, reflects our inherent right to self-defense. We stand ready to take further actions to neutralize threats or respond to attacks, ensuring the stability and security of the Red Sea region and international trade routes.
Thank you. I'll now turn it over to my colleague.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Hey, good evening. On January 22nd at approximately 4 pm Eastern Standard Time, U.S. Central Command forces, alongside the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom and with the support of allied and partner nations, conducted strikes on Houthi targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.
The strikes were launched from air, surface, and sub-surface platforms targeting eight locations consisting of Houthi missiles, unmanned aerial systems, and weapons storage areas. We conducted the strikes with Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, or TLAMs, and manned aircraft from the United States Navy and the UK Armed Forces. Precision-guided munitions were used to destroy the targets and also to minimize collateral damage.
We would like to emphasize that these strikes have no association and are completely separate from Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is a defensive coalition currently comprised of 22 countries operating in the Red Sea, Bab-al-Mandab, and the Gulf of Aden.
The U.S., UK, and partner forces that participated in these strikes this evening remain well prepared to defend themselves, as well as well prepared to continue to contribute to the defense of maritime traffic and other military vessels as part of the coalition in the Red Sea, Bab-al-Mandab, and Gulf of Aden.
And with that, Pat, we can move on to questions.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you both, gentlemen. Our first question will go to Associated Press, Lita Baldor.
Q: A couple questions. I think you said eight locations. Can you say how many targets were struck and whether you have even any preliminary BDA on any of them?
And then secondly, can you give us any estimate the perceived impact on the Houthis? What (inaudible) their capabilities do you think (inaudible) at this point? What is the overall impact? Thank you.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, thank you for your question. Yes, again, eight locations. They're - in some of these locations, there were multiple targets. I'm unable to give an exact target number at this point. We can tell you that we observed good impacts and effects at all eight locations, assessing that we did in fact destroy missiles, unmanned aerial systems, and weapons storage areas.
The - you know, we continue to collect battle damage assessment and we'll have - we'll have a better assessment going forward, but at this point, we do assess that the strike was successful and achieved the desired effect of removing these capabilities from the Houthis.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Next question will go to Missy Ryan, Washington Post.
Q: Hi. Sorry, I just had to unmute. I just wanted to clarify this is - is this - am I correct to think this is the eighth round of strikes since January 11th for the United States?
And just following up on the earlier questions, should we conclude from the fact that there hasn't been another large scale Houthi attack like the one on January 9th that - that it's - the - the group's ability to conduct the more disruptive attacks have actually been eroded because of these - because of these strikes, or do you have any sense that they're, you know, taking some sort of operational pause?
And can you address the whole question of whether this is now a named operation? Thanks.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: We definitely feel that the strikes we have taken, the strikes tonight, the January 11th strikes with the same coalition partners and a number of self-defense strikes against immanent threats that have taken place in the interim have removed significant Houthi capability.
That does not mean they have no more capability but we definitely believe that has had an impact. I don't want to access Houthi strategy because attacks have continued during this period. So we know that they remain capable and based on some motivation to do that.
But our intention when -- is to de-escalate, to restore calm in the Red Sea. And when we've seen the international community being attacked issue the necessary warnings, said consequences would follow and indeed they have followed. Regarding -- this is not a departmental named operation and I'd -- you know I'd refer you to the -- to the relevant combatant command for their designations for how they describe the operation.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Let's go to Courtney Kube, NBC.
Q: Thank you very much. The -- can you say how many munitions were dropped by the U.S.? I don't know if you're able to speak to how many the -- the British did as well. And if it's possible to break it out, how many were TLAMs versus how many were like precision guided munitions dropped from aircraft.
And then the statement that we got said they targeted -- you targeted underground storage facilities. Can you talk about what kind of munition was used for that please? Thank you.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, with regard to the weapon storage facilities, these were facilities that had -- had missiles and unmanned aerial systems so there was a combination of advanced convention weapons at these -- at these facilities. I don't -- I don't have the exact number of munitions at this point as we're still assessing the strike itself. But I would -- I would put it likely around probably in the 25 to 30 range right now but I don't have that exact number.
Q: And I'm so sorry, is that senior military official or defense official.
GEN. RYDER: Military official.
Q: OK. Thanks.
GEN. RYDER: All right, let's go to Eric Schmidt, New York Times.
Q: [REDACTED] Just to recap, eight locations (inaudible) an undetermined number of components (inaudible) 25 to 30 munitions, is that -- is that all correct?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, that's an approximate on the munitions. I -- I won't have the full accounting with the strikes just completing not to -- not to long ago, I won't have the full accounting until all our aircraft have returned and we get a full debrief from everything. So we'll have -- we'll have a refined number in the future on that but I -- I don't have the exact number of munitions.
Q: OK. And then -- and just in terms of the -- of this underground facility, this is -- is this the first time you stuck and underground bunker?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: This would -- this would be the first time we struck a storage facility of this type in Yemen.
Q: OK, is that --
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Other storage facilities were of a different type.
Q: OK. Is this bigger or broader or different -- more munitions, more complex munitions in it, what's different about what you struck than what you'd done before?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, the strike this evening, that -- the particular weapon storage facility was assessed to have more advanced conventional weaponry in it than in the -- in the first strike on the 11th.
GEN. RYDER: All right, I'll our next question will go to Liz Friden, Fox News.
Q: How many aircraft were used in this and how many Navy ships contribute -- U.S. Navy ships contributed?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, I can't reveal the number of -- the number of aircraft at this time but the -- the aircraft were from the U.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower and part of the Dwight D. Eisenhower's carrier strike group, which is currently located in the Red Sea. And additionally our -- we had a contribution of fighters from the United Kingdom that were part. But to avoid giving away our tactics and our operational approach, I can't give you the number of aircraft --
Q: Thank you. And --
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yes, go ahead.
Q: All right, were there any casualties assessed?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: There were no U.S. casualties.
Q: On the Houthis' side?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Unknown at this time. But I can point out that the targeting was very specific and very deliberate to go after the capability that they are using to attack Maritime vessels in the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb and Gulf of Aden. They were -- they were not intentionally selected for casualties. They were going after weapon systems.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Next question will go to Phil Stewart, Reuters.
Q: Hey, just -- I got a quick follow-up on that. Do you assess there's any risk of civilian casualties in these latest strikes? And also, could you give us kind of up to date account -- I don't have any idea of how many missiles or radar systems or UAVs you've -- you've struck so far since you started hitting targets inside Yemen.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: None of these targets had concerns for civilian casualties. Again, precision guided munitions used in -- in each of -- each of these events and the locations were carefully vetted for any collateral damage concerns. So no, we did not have any concern for civilian casualties at any of these eight locations.
I don't have an exact number for you. Again, this is -- this is part of our intelligence apparatus and -- and revealing the exact number, you know, could reveal some of that. So at this time I'm -- we're not able to give you a number that we've destroyed. I can, like I did on the --
Q: (Inaudible).
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: I can you that it is -- it is significant and it has definitely degraded their ability to conduct these maritime attacks.
GEN. RYDER: OK. Thank you. Let's go to Fadi Mansour - Aljazeera.
Q: Thank you, General. And thank you for doing this. So previously since, I believe January 11, all the strikes against Houthi positions were -- were framed as defensive in nature. Is this new round, does it imply a more sustained campaign against their capabilities? And I have a follow-up, please.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: This round of strikes is really of a similar character to those on January 11th for several weeks, as I outlined earlier. The Houthi have posed persistent threats and attacked on a an ongoing basis legitimate international shipping and innocent mariners and naval vessels as well.
And this is simply something that the international community can't really accept. The principle of freedom of navigation is fundamental. It has severe economic consequences when ships are forced to take a - take alternative routes.
And so as a number of nations came together on January 3rd to say this kind of aggression against international shipping is unacceptable and that there would be consequences if it continued, and it did continue and it has continued, that - a coalition of countries is now taking action, did on January 11th, did again tonight.
So it's really of the same character as those - those earlier strikes, intended to deter additional attacks and to degrade the Houthis' capabilities to conduct those attacks.
Q: And as part of that coalition, apart from the U.S. and the UK that took military action, can you be more specific about the type of support Canada, Australia, Bahrain, and the Netherlands offered? Thank you.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: I would defer to our coalition partners to describe their contributions. We're very satisfied that this coalition works well together and everybody in it does contribute. We know we have the political support of an additional number of countries, and I expect we'll hear from them as well. So - but I'll - I'll defer to each country to - to describe its own contribution.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Let's go to Tom Bowman, NPR.
Q: Yeah, we've been told that the Houthis are moving their missiles around, doing a better job of concealing them. Could you talk about that? And also, do you know the locations of their command and control nodes or is that just difficult because they're dispersed?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, I can't answer much of this due to - due to classification and - and the - the - the risk of revealing intelligence, but we - you know, we - we have the - the capability to - to locate - continue to locate these - these Houthi weapons systems and we have the capability to target them. And I think that's - I don't think I can get much more in - more into that. I - I - yeah, I'm sorry, that's about all I can tell you.
Q: OK. Can - also, do you see this as a long-term campaign, lasting weeks, if not months, as you keep striking and they keep firing missiles?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: You know, I don't want to make any projection about our future operations, and I obviously will not speculate about the Houthis' decisions and strategies. We've said that we aim to de-escalate, we aim to restore calm in the Red Sea, but when the international community is going to be attacked, there will be consequences. And that's what's happened again tonight.
Q: OK, thanks.
GEN. RYDER: Let's go to Lara Seligman, Politico.
Q: Hi, thanks so much for doing this. A couple of questions. First of all, can you just clarify that that - the storage facility of a different type that contained more advanced conventional weaponry was the underground storage facility that this - the statement mentioned?
And then I have a follow-up.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yes, that's correct.
Q: OK - OK, thank you. And then I - also wondering - I've seen some reports that the Houthis were - were starting to use naval mines in the Red Sea. Is - has that - has that occurred? Is that accurate?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: At this time, we have not seen the - the employment of naval mines. Our forces remain postured, well equipped, well trained to respond to - to any threat to maritime traffic, but at this point, we have not - we have not seen the employment of mines.
Q: OK. Thank you.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Let's - let's go to Jeff Schogol, Task & Purpose.
Q: Thank you. So the strategy of trying to bomb your enemy into submission didn't work in Vietnam and the strategy of trying to degrade but not defeat your enemy didn't work in Afghanistan. What makes you think the combination of these two strategies will allow the United States to prevail in Yemen?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Again, I'm not going to make projections about the future. I - I am going to say that the strikes that we and our coalition partners have undertaken thus far have removed significant Houthi capability, have degraded their capabilities to conduct the attacks. They have continued to conduct attacks and - and threaten imminent - imminent attacks that we've dealt with in self-defense strikes.
So this hasn't - you know, this has not been going on that long. The Houthi attacks have been going on since mid-December, as I mentioned. The coalition response has been going on since January 11th. So I think it would be premature to draw long-term conclusions anyway but our - our strategy is to defend international - legitimate international shipping that is under attack and degrade the ability to carry it out.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Let's go to Howard Altman, War Zone.
Q: Thanks. I've got a few questions here. Can you say what precision munition's been used besides the TLAMs? And what was used on the underground bunker? And then can you say what ships were involved besides the Ike? Thanks.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Unfortunately the answer to your first question is no. I can only tell you that they were Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, TLAMs, and then there were munitions that were released both by U.S. and UK fighters. As far as the other ships that were involved in the strike, it'd be the Philippine Sea, the Gravely, and the Mason.
GEN. RYDER: Thank you. Great. Let's go to James LaPorta, Messenger.
Q: Hi. I got - I got kind of a related question but - you know, about the strikes themselves but related to all this. The - the two Navy SEALs that are now deceased unfortunately, I wonder if the Pentagon views that as on the fault of the Houthis, in the - in the sense that, you know, if the Houthis - you know, if - if weapons hadn't - were not being shipped to the Houthis and targeting ships in the commercial shipping lanes, the Navy SEALs would not feel the need to even carry out that operation. So I'm wondering if - you know they were swept at - swept away at sea, it appears. I wonder if that's actually the fault of the Houthis, in - in the eyes of the Pentagon?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, this is the Senior Military Official. This was a - you know, that interdiction was separate from our ongoing, you know, maritime security operations in that region. We, for - for a very long time, have maintained a - a force that conducts routine interdictions, actions on intelligence related to the smuggling of - of arms, particularly advanced conventional weapons, throughout that region. And that - exactly what this mission was, was they acted on this intelligence, they interdicted a - a vessel that was in fact smuggling advanced conventional weaponry.
And so I view these as - as separate incidents and not specifically tie this, or as you put it, blame it on the Houthis. This is a problem that is prevalent in that region and something that we've -- we've had to deal with for a number of years.
GEN. RYDER: We have time for just a few more. Let's go to Carla Babb, VOA.
Q: Hey, thank you for doing this. Just two questions. First a follow-up. You said that it -- some of their capabilities have been significantly degraded. Can you give us any more detail into that without giving specific numbers, without going in to intelligence. But I mean how much are we talking about here, has a quarter of their missiles been wiped out?
I mean how -- just give us some sort of sense on how much you've been able to degrade their missile abilities. And then secondly for -- for the defense official. Iran is -- you know the Pentagon is saying that Iran is supplying the Houthis, Iran is supplying the proxies in Iraq that launch attacks on U.S. forces. Why have their not been any attacks on any Iran production facilities for ballistic missiles?
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: Yeah, going back to the first one. Again, I'm sorry without -- due to classification I can't reveal the -- you know our assessment on what the percentage. I can, as the defense official did, attribute the decline in the -- in the number and the ferocity of the maritime attack directly attribute that to the reduction in Houthi capability to carry out those attacks. So we -- we are having the intended affect.
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Regarding Iran, it's true Iran is a supplier of the Houthi and has provided equipment and training and expertise to other proxy organizations in the region. We have communicated in various our -- that we consider that activity to be unacceptable. We obviously address threats when we see them and when they're directed at us or directed at allies or at international shipping. And I won't speculate on any future -- any future operation.
GEN. RYDER: Go to military.com -- Constantine?
Q: Thank you. Thank you guys for doing this. My question is if you can speak at all to the U.S. warships that have been targeted. First of all, can you say which warships you assessed who have been targeted by the Houthis? And whether you've seen an uptick in the targeting of U.S. warships since the initial strike on January 11th? Thank you.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: So aside from the USS Laboon, which was specifically mentioned, no I don't have additional information on the -- on the -- the ships -- the ship names that were -- that were targeted. And then what was the second one?
Q: If there had been an uptick in the targeting of U.S. warships since the initial strike on January 11th?
SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: The Houthi have made some claims in that regard, which we won't respond to. But, you know, we've considered ships throughout that region to be subject to this kind of aggression. Sometimes a stable ship, sometimes it's commercial ships. And of course we mentioned two U.S. owned vessels that were struck in -- in -- within the last week. So the targeting is -- has some breadth to it.
GEN. RYDER: Right. And final question we'll go to Chris Gordon, Air and Space Forces Magazine.
Q: Thanks, Pat. And thank you to the senior officials for doing this. I -- you mentioned the underground storage site had more advanced capabilities than some previous targets. So are you beginning to strike a broader array of targets, more advanced targets, not just, you know, missiles ready to launch or are these strikes of the same nature?
Are you trying to put more of an emphasis on striking infrastructure to weaken Houthis' ability to carry out a prolonged campaign against shipping? Thank you.
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL: No these -- these are characterized as more of the same, this -- this particular location in -- was -- was different in what we -- what we knew was at that facility and the actual construction of the facility. But no it's more of the -- it's more of the same. Missiles, UAVs. You know the initial strike specifically targeted some -- some surveillance sites, both coastal surveillance radars and air surveillance radars.
This -- this strike did not include those. Based primarily on the success of the -- of the strike on the 11th. But no, we would characterize this as more of the same. And again, I have to reiterate that we are -- we're specifically avoiding escalation by selecting these -- these locations and individual targets that will remove capability used in maritime attacks.
We are -- we are not at this time expanding beyond that -- that target set. So that is -- that is why this is characterized the same as it was on the 11th. It is the -- the weapon systems and support systems they've used to carry out these maritime attacks and that's it.
GEN. RYDER: Right. Thank you very much again for joining us. As a reminder, tonight's discussion was on background, attributed to a senior defense official and a military defense official. We will be posting a transcript to the DOD website when available. Thanks for joining us.

UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on Wednesday asked Yemen's Houthi authorities to reconsider their decision to expel U.S. and British nationals working for the world body in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.
Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, confirmed that the United Nations has received communications from the Houthis, which gave the world body one month for all U.S. and British nationals to leave the areas under the control of the de facto authorities.
""What needs to be said is that any request or requirement for UN staff to leave based solely on the nationality of that staff is inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the UN,"" said Dujarric. ""It also, of course, impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to support all of the people in Yemen. And we call on all the authorities in Yemen to ensure that our staff can continue to perform their functions on behalf of the UN.""
He said UN staff serve impartially and serve the flag of the United Nations and none other.
The spokesman refused to say how many U.S. and British nationals are working for the United Nations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.
""I can find out the number of international staff. We do not give breakdowns of our staff's own nationality,"" said Dujarric.
The order of the Houthi militia came amid rising tensions between the U.S. and British forces stationed in the Red Sea and the Houthis who have been attacking ""Israeli-linked ships"" in the region since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct. 7, 2023.
The U.S.-Britain maritime coalition in the Red Sea has carried out multiple airstrikes on Houthi camps in various northern provinces of Yemen. It said these actions are aimed at preventing further Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea shipping lane.
The Houthi group vowed to continue targeting ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea until Israel ends its attacks and blockade on the Gaza Strip."

The General Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has denounced the opening of the controversial Hindu ""Ram Temple"" in place of the historic Babri Masjid (Babari Mosque) destroyed by Indian Hindu extremists in 1992.
""The General Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) expressed grave worry over the recent construction and inauguration of the ""Ram Temple"" at the site of the previously demolished Babri [Masjid] Mosque located in the Indian city of Ayodhya,"" the OIC said in a statement released on Tuesday.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the temple this week, branding it as a ""new era"" for India.
""In line with the OIC position expressed by the Council of Foreign Ministers in its previous sessions, the General Secretariat denounces these actions aimed at obliterating the Islamic landmarks represented by the Babri Mosque, which has stood tall in the exact location for five centuries,"" it added.
The OIC has in the past called on New Delhi to ensure the safety of the Muslim minority and the protection of Islamic holy places in India.
The OIC was founded on Sept. 25, 1969, in Morocco in reaction to an arson attack on Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem al-Quds in August of that year. It has 57 member countries and is headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."

Remarks to the Press  Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State  Angolan Foreign Minister TÃ©te AntÃ³nio  Ministry of External Relations  Luanda, Angola  January 25, 2024
MODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) His Excellency Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States of America; His Excellency Ambassador TÃ©te AntÃ³nio, Minister of External Relations of the Republic of Angola; distinguished members of both delegations; dear journalists - good afternoon, and welcome to the (inaudible) auditorium here at the headquarters of the Angolan diplomacy.
Excellencies, we know that you were shortly in the presidential palace at - and meeting with His Excellency JoÃ£o Manuel GonÃ§alves LourenÃ§o, the President of the Republic of Angola, where surely issues of common interest were discussed; regional and international issues also were deliberated.
At this auditorium we have the Angolan media resident and the U.S. correspondent who are eager to record and publish this essential visit.  I therefore ask your excellencies to summarize what was discussed, the conversation just concluded, starting with His Excellency Blinken, the Secretary of State of the United States of America, and then followed by Minister TÃ©te AntÃ³nio, Minister of External Relations of the Republic of Angola.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  (Inaudible.)  Ah, there we go.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
We started our trip in Cabo Verde.  We were then in Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and now here in Angola.  And I have to note at the outset that while we were in Cote d'Ivoire, I had an opportunity to participate in viewing one of the matches in the Cup of Nations, and of course as a diplomat, I would never take sides in this competition, but I have to note the extremely strong results thus far in the tournament of the Palancas Negras.  (Laughter.)  And we'll see what happens, but they're off to a very, very good start.
Foreign Minister TÃ©te, thank you so much for the warm welcome today.  It's wonderful to make this trip to Angola as Secretary, and I especially want to thank President LourenÃ§o for the very productive, important conversation that we've had, all (inaudible) dedicated, and the substance of our conversation.
I'm here in Angola and here in Africa as part of this four-country trip because we see America's future and Africa's future as joined.  Our peoples are joined; our prosperity and success in the future is linked.  African voices are shaping this century and leading on issues of global importance, including issues that matter to both of our peoples and their lives, from shared prosperity to dealing with climate change, to building greater food security.  And that's clearly true here in Angola.
At the White House in November, President Biden reaffirmed to President LourenÃ§o that this is a historic moment for the partnership between the United States and Angola.  Our relationship is stronger, it's more consequential, it's farther-reaching than at any point in our 30-year friendship.  And at this transformational moment, President Biden asked me to come to Luanda to help build on and accelerate our progress.
One of the most successful and dynamic demonstrations of this partnership between our countries - and we can see it in action - is our work to expand the critical Lobito Corridor that links Angola, Zambia, and the DRC.  We're doing that through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.  This project has genuinely transformative potential for this nation, for this region, and - I would argue - for the world.  It will spur investment in underdeveloped sectors like telecommunications and agriculture.  It will secure critical mineral supply chains that are essential to the economic futures of all of our countries, our industries, our workers, and our climate ambitions.  And it will more effectively connect Angola and its neighbors to global markets.
The United States has committed funding to refurbish the existing 1,300-kilometer Lobito Atlantic Rail Line, and we've taken the first steps to build out 800 kilometers of new rail (inaudible), including through a consortium with Angola and six other partners.  I had a chance today to see some of the dramatic progress that's already being made in building out this corridor.  It is moving faster and further, I think, than we even might have imagined when we set out to do it.  That rail investment, which is the biggest investment the United States has made in railways on the African continent in well over a generation, is at the heart of our Partnership for Global Investment and Infrastructure work in Angola.
But - and I saw this today as well - we're also looking beyond rail, investing in additional projects that will together catalyze even more growth and even more prosperity.  We're investing in a multi-billion-dollar solar energy project, which will provide clean electricity to half a million homes.  It'll, in so doing, create thousands of local jobs and support the U.S. manufacture of solar equipment.  We're helping construct steel bridges that will link communities across the country.  We're supporting a project to connect people without traditional banking to mobile money applications.  That includes family farmers who will now have access to capital that they can invest in more efficient food production (inaudible).
Food security is one of the areas that's genuinely foundational to our partnership with Angola as well as with countries around the continent.  One of the things that I've heard time and again from our partners, at a time when we've had an almost perfect storm leading to greater food insecurity - climate change, then COVID, and then conflict, including the Russian aggression against Ukraine - one of the things I've heard time and again is, as important and as greatly appreciated as emergency assistance is, what partners are really looking for is to build their own sustainable productive capacity.
So that's exactly what the United States is supporting: building long-term sustainable production in Africa, for Africans and, ultimately, for the rest of the world.  We can assure that African countries not only meet their own needs but can meet the needs of many others as well.
We're going to work with Angola and with the International Fund for Agriculture Development through a new initiative that we have, our Vision for Adapted Crops and Soil, or VACS, part of USAID's flagship Feed the Future program.  VACS rethinks what, where, and how we produce food in the face especially of the climate crisis.  It invests above ground, identifying the indigenous African crops that are most nutritious and most resilient to climate change, improves these varieties, and then delivers them to consumers and markets.  But it also invests below ground, mapping, conserving, building healthy soils.
Of course, we also discussed the challenges that we face in the region and beyond to security as well as to democracy.  The United States very much appreciates President LourenÃ§o's continued efforts to de-escalate tensions between Rwanda and the DRC.  We believe that the Luanda Process in tandem with the Nairobi Process is the best hope for enduring peace.  Angola is trusted by all sides; President LourenÃ§o's leadership is vital for a breakthrough.  Today, we had a chance to discuss that with the president, with the foreign minister, including meaningful steps that can be taken toward peace.
And we discussed other challenges on the continent.  We'll continue to count on partners like Angola to address democratic backsliding in the region and follow through on their commitments on civil society, free and fair elections, and other pillars of democracy in our countries.
Finally, we spoke about our partnership beyond the continent, including through the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation.  That coalition is bringing together 34 countries - excuse me, 32 countries throughout the Atlantic to drive blue economic development, protect our shared environment, collaborate on science and technology in ways that benefit everyone.  Angola is taking a lead on tackling some of the biggest shared ocean-related challenges; it will soon co-chair the Marine Spatial Planning working group, which will help sustainably develop the region's blue economies.
Finally, we're thrilled that Angola is now the 33rd country to join the Artemis Accords.  These are a set of practical principles to guide the safe, peaceful, and sustainable exploration of space for the benefit of all humankind.  I had a chance to visit the new science museum today here in Luanda, which is a wonderful facility, and I can just see generations of young Angolans having their own horizons expanded.  But I think it's also powerfully symbolic for the Artemis Accords that our partnership, our relationship is both literally as well as figuratively reaching new heights.  We couldn't be more pleased with that and grateful for it.
So Mr. Foreign Minister, TÃ©te, thank you for this very warm welcome.  Thank you for the quality of our conversations and the work we're doing together.  It's very good to be here.  Thank you.
FOREIGN MINISTER ANTÃNIO:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much, Mr. Antony.  You almost have said all the content of my speech, because you've said everything that we've been doing together as countries.  But mainly, I have to thank you for having chosen Angola as a destination - one of the destinations during your trip to Africa.  And also I'd like to thank for the way that his excellency the president of the republic has said he was received in Washington, D.C., and also in the same token to thank on how you received us when I went to Washington, D.C., to meet you at the State Department for a very long period of time where we discussed various issues.
We think that if we are to celebrate the 30 years of relationship with the U.S. last year, we consider that now we have gotten into a crucial stage, which is the stage of implementation of various agreements that we've signed.  We have 15 legal instruments that we've signed with the U.S.  We have established cooperation mechanisms that range from general policy to a memorandum on strategic partnership and goes down to sectoral dialogues.  And I believe that sectoral dialogues are very important, and we are satisfied that the results that we are seeing today on the ground are the aftermath of sectoral dialogues.  And we have to encourage those other sectors that need much more action amongst us, such as the vision that Secretary Blinken has mentioned, the VACS.
So we think that food security is key to development.  Within the framework of our economy diversification, agriculture has an outstanding role to play.  And we have plans that we have adopted as a country, and these plans surely - such as PlanagrÃ£o, which is the plan of cereals and the plan of livestock.  These will also benefit from this strategic partnership.
Secondly is the topic of knowledge transfer.  This has been discussed, which would be the best investment that we can make in a country, because we acknowledge we can bring all kind of competencies and all sectors, but it will not be possible to achieve tangible results, because in order to translate them into practice, we need knowledge.
You have mentioned other sectors such as health, telecommunications.  We are making progresses with the U.S. Africell company, and energy also has been discussed.  And of course, Lobito Corridor is the flagbearer in terms of our domestic and foreign action, given its impact, and above all we have interest of bringing in private sector in order to look at Angola as one of crucial destinations, but also looking at Angola as a well-located country strategically.  Angola is located between the Central and Southern African regions, and with Lobito Corridor we believe we can have the biggest ambition, apart from its multiplying effect as an enterprise, that is translated into logistical bases that we're creating - agriculture - and the possibility of having a major regional integration, and therefore a bigger market.  So that would lead us to materialize the ambition of having the two oceans - the Atlantic and the ocean connected.
So this is a great potential that it represents, and we also appreciate our cooperation in regional issues.  And I believe that all efforts that the president of the republic, JoÃ£o Manuel GonÃ§alves LourenÃ§o, has been conducting - who is the champion for peace and national reconciliation in Africa - and in this capacity, we also have added responsibility, and everything that we do complements the activities of the UN Security Council.  Therefore, the support of U.S. to Angola is important by leveraging and supporting those activities that we are undertaking.
Lastly, the Security Council - we have been following attentively the work that has just been termed, the adoption by the UN Security Council about the resolution on a peacekeeping mission deployed by African Union and its funding.  This is a great milestone.  Of course, we have not achieved as much as we wanted to; we have achieved 75 percent.  But that can constitute a basis for us to having the continent benefiting from this effort.  Because indeed, everything that we do in trying to find peace in the region is done on behalf of the international community.
So that's all I had to say at this point in time.
MODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Excellencies.  After concluding the addresses by the two entities, the coming moment is for questions and answers.  I would appreciate it if the four selected journalists introduce themselves, give their names, and the entity they represent, asking their question remembering that there are only two questions for the Angolan press and two questions for the American press.
QUESTION:  (Via interpreter) Good afternoon.  My name is Candido Calombe from the Angolan Public Television.  My question is addressed to - to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  First, I'd like to know if there is plan and talks for President Biden to visit Angola.  And the other question:  Apart from the investment mentioned, is there another portfolio to support the country?
Minister TÃ©te AntÃ³nio, I would like to know:  With this strengthening of strategic partnership, will be Angola in a position to mobilize U.S. investors to come and invest in our country?  Thank you.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.  I know because President Biden raises it so frequently that he would welcome an opportunity to come here.  Of course, we have an election this year in the United States, so there are challenges to schedules, but I know from both the importance that he attaches to the relationship, the truly historic meeting between President LourenÃ§o and President Biden in Washington, and all of our efforts here that I know he'd look forward to doing that at some point in the future.
At the same time, we've had - to Africa as well as to Angola specifically - a number of the President's most senior advisors coming, visiting, and working closely together.  I'm very pleased that I've had the opportunity to be here today, but of course the Secretary of Defense was here, other senior officials have been here, and we look forward to continuing that work together and also receiving our friends in Washington, as we did with TÃ©te recently.
In terms of what we're doing together, as I said, it's reached a depth and a breadth that we've never seen before in the relationship over 30 years.  I've mentioned some of the areas where we're working together and supporting each other.  The Lobito Corridor, as I said, is probably the most powerful, concrete example because it brings together so much, not just the physical infrastructure and physical connections but digital as well.  And also dealing with the climate challenge through (inaudible).
And in doing that, it's creating more good jobs here in Angola, and it's creating greater - greater opportunity as we address these challenges.  It's also making Angola, I think, a hub - a hub for transportation, a hub for communications, and in so many ways it's at the foundation of what we're doing.  But even as we're doing that, we're working more broadly to attract more private sector investment (inaudible) the tools of the United States Government to support that, and I expect that we'll see even more in the time to come.
The efforts that President LourenÃ§o is making, including combatting corruption, is also critical because it creates the best possible investment environment.  Finally, I just want to emphasize something that TÃ©te said because I think it's so important.  The assistance that the United States can provide, the investment we can generate, they're usually important and we will continue to do that.  But maybe even more important:  The way we do things together really is through the transfer of knowledge, the building up of capacity, of expertise, because that's the single best way to ensure that going forward and in the future our friends and partners can really do everything that they need to do for themselves as well as for others in the world.
And that's really at the heart of the relationship, whether it's economic, whether it's security, whether it's on democracy, it's sharing the experience that we've had, sharing the knowledge, the expertise that we've built up, and hopefully having that strengthen the capacity of our partners.  I - one thing I hope we see in the future, by the way, is even more exchange between us, between our peoples, starting with education - which is the first and most important way to transfer knowledge.  So we look forward to that as well.  Thank you.
FOREIGN MINISTER ANTÃNIO:  (Via interpreter)  Thank you.  Just to complement what Mr. Antony has just said with regard to invitation - invitation to President Biden has been extended.  We know that the trip of a head of state relies on various factors, and we all know and understand what these factors are.  And with regard to the coming of more U.S. companies, the role of diplomats is to pave the ways and establishing the environment for political and diplomatic relationship between countries so that the rest of sectors of society can follow suit.  And I believe this is our duty with Mr. Blinken.  That is what he's doing apart from other issues of common concern.
With regard to bilateral relations, this is a determining factor showing that the level of relationship that we've achieved already says about - says it all about the existence of good business environment so that U.S. investors and also Angolan investors do not forget that this is a two-way relationship we have constituting courage, our entrepreneurs, to take heed of the opportunities in the U.S.
Now, with regard to private sector, our belief is two.  We know that in our transformation agenda it is based on belief on the private sector, and that means we believe on the role of private sectors that is about U.S. companies that would be willing to invest in Angola.  We know that Ambassador Mushingi has a very good checklist, and that checklist, which he checks every day, will grow a lot as from now on.  And I believe this is the role that we are playing over here, and we believe that all of us do trust in this good relationship between the two countries that will generate a good business environment.
QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Thank you, Mr. Minister for having us.  Mr. Secretary, could - Shaun Tandon with AFP.  Mr. Secretary, could I follow up on a couple of things you mentioned in your opening remarks?  You mentioned DRC and Rwanda, and Mr. Minister, you mentioned that as well - the efforts by the president.  How hopeful are you that there could be more stability now?  You've spoken with Presidents Kagame and Tshisekedi in recent weeks.  Previous attempts to end the violence have not succeeded.  How optimistic are you that this could succeed now?
Could I also follow up - you mentioned democracy.  Opposition groups have called for the holding of local elections here in Angola.  Is that something that's come up?  To what extent did you discuss the situation here?  And Mr. Secretary, if I could also - something slightly further afield - but we're expecting a decision soon from the International Court of Justice regarding the suit filed by South Africa on Israel.  I know you've earlier said that it's meritless.  Does that judgement still stand?  How does this in a long term affect relations with South Africa, that they brought it forward?  Thanks very much.  Obrigado.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  Shaun, thank you very much.  So first, with regard to the DRC and Rwanda, as you know, we work closely together with our partners first and foremost to get through the recent election period in the DRC.  And I think as a result of some of the work that we did - and notably the work that the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines did in working with Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee, putting together a mechanism so that all sides were sharing information in real time and that there were no miscalculations made about what was happening on the ground - that was successful, I think, in helping making sure that we got through the election period.
Now that the election is done, we believe that it's an important moment to try to forge forward with diplomacy and particularly with the processes that have been established, notably Rwanda and also Nairobi, to work toward a durable peace.  And that's exactly what we talked to President LourenÃ§o about today.  I think in that effort Angola plays - and the president plays - an essential role, because President LourenÃ§o is trusted by all sides.  And that's vital.  That's the most important currency that we have.
And so we talked about concrete ways to have that process move forward.  And I - as you said, I had the opportunity to speak both to the president of the DRC and the president of Rwanda just in recent days.  We're going to continue our intense engagement in support of efforts that our African partners are making.  I don't want to evaluate prospects, but we did talk about concrete steps today with President LourenÃ§o that could be taken to move the diplomatic track forward.  And I think that's essential.
With regard to Angola itself, we also had a good conversation with President LourenÃ§o about some of the work that he's doing here at home in his own leadership.  I mentioned the (inaudible) that are being made to combat corruption and how important that is, first and foremost, for the Angolan people, but it's also important in terms of attracting foreign investment.
But we also discussed the way forward, including in local elections and including continuing to expand the space for media.  The president noted that he's just about to open a second academy to train journalists - there's already one here in Luanda - and we think that's an important and positive trajectory.
With the - with regard to the ICJ, look, I'm not going to get ahead of the opinion.  You know our views on the on the case; those views stand.  And of course, our relationship with South Africa is vitally important, and it is a very broad and deep relationship covering many, many issues.  So whether or not we have a disagreement on one particular matter doesn't take away from the important work that we're doing together in so many other areas and that we'll continue.
FOREIGN MINISTER AntÃ³nio:  (Via interpreter) I don't know if you are still waiting for an answer from my side after the answer given by Mr. Blinken.  Just to say that the way towards peace is not a straightforward line.  It's not a straight line.  This can find a lot of variation.  If we were in mathematics, a graph, it is never straight.  So as I said in my speech, we have been benefiting from U.S. activities towards the same actors.  I believe those who were in Luanda yesterday and followed the news have learned that the president of the republic spoke with President Felix Tshisekedi and President Paul Kagame.  That means the Luanda Process is still on and it is still engaged in the search for peace, mainly in the eastern DRC.
Of course, all peace processes go through various stages.  We know the history of that country.  And our task is not only to continue working with the parties, but also a hope that regional efforts - I'm talking about Nairobi Process with which we've been coordinating - there has to be some harmonization.  That's why Luanda was the capital that hosted the Quadripartite Summit that aimed at harmonizing the initiatives.  So I still believe that these efforts are still valid, and we'll continue to do them in order to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is not only neighboring country, but also a strategic country for Africa, for the world at large, can find peace.
QUESTION:  (Via interpreter)  Good afternoon.  I am Sany Funche from the Angolan national radio.  I would like to address my question to the U.S. Secretary of State to know whether the U.S. supports the initiatives by African leaders needed to bring about a change in the UN Security Council, a reform that will allow Africans to have a more active voice.
To the minister of external relations, I would like to know what understandings have been achieved after this visit by the U.S. Secretary of State?  Thank you.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you very much.  And the short answer to your question is: yes.  You may have heard President Biden speak to this at the General Assembly in New York this past year.  The United States supports reform in the Security Council.  We want to make sure that the Security Council and, for that matter, other international institutions and organizations, reflect today's realities, not just the realities that existed when those organizations were created, many - in some cases many, many decades ago.  And so we believe the Security Council needs to be more representative and to include African voices.
We've made some progress in that general direction this year, as you know, with American leadership.  The African Union was integrated into the G20.  But Security Council reform is critical, and the President's spoken to it - but not only speaking to it, we're going to try to work to act on it this year working with partners in Africa, and of course working with other members of the existing Security Council, to try to move forward on reform.
FOREIGN MINISTER AntÃ³nio: (Via interpreter) Thank you very much.  Just to complement on the issue of the UN Security Council reform, that also was one of the issues discussed in the meeting with the president of the republic.  We may recall that the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit had this as one of the most important topics in the speech by President Biden.  So this is the attention that the U.S. had been attaching to the request by the African continent, mainly in the framework of the Ezulwini Consensus that has to do with Africa's position towards the UN Security Council reform.
Secondly, about the understandings, I believe that the main understanding is for us to continue working in those fields that have been mentioned already and continue to encourage and animate our relationship with the U.S. on those issues that we think that we have not yet made big progress such as - we were talking a while ago about how know-how transfer.  We have signed various agreements, and the motto is the implementation of the main legal instruments that we've signed, including the strengthening of sectoral dialogues.
With regard to other issues, namely issue - regional issues, as mentioned here by Mr. Blinken, I think we don't need to get into details about the next steps to be taken regarding trying to find solution to the Democratic Republic of Congo conflict.  But there is mutual will for us to continue collaborating on this regard.  I believe we can limit ourselves to this understanding, this understanding can be translated into agreement or goodwill, and this goodwill does exist between us in those sectors that we have agreed upon already and those others that we'll continue pressing on.
QUESTION:  Hi.  Thanks very much to both of you for doing this.  I'm Michael Birnbaum from The Washington Post.  Mr. Secretary, I wanted to ask about this allegation from UNRWA that one of its compounds in Gaza was hit recently and at least 12 people were killed.  And they're saying that it was hit by tank rounds.  What's your assessment of whether Israel is responsible for it?  And more broadly, over the last couple of days we're seeing Israel demolish buildings along the border in Gaza, saying they're doing that to establish a buffer zone.  That's something that you've pushed them not to do.  How many times do you need to push the Israelis to protect civilians - are they living up to the commitments they've made to you - before they actually listen?
And Minister AntÃ³nio, I wanted to ask about your sense of - you've talked about deepening your partnership, orienting Angola more toward the United States through Lobito Corridor and these other projects you're talking about today.  What's your sense of the United States as a partner versus China and Russia, who both clearly have deep relationships in Angola?  And you mentioned last year, standing alongside Sergey Lavrov, that you wanted to avoid a third world war.  How has the war in Ukraine affected your assessment of Russia as a partner?  Brigado.    Thank you.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  So with regard to the reports of the incident at the UN facility, first, let me just emphasize again something that we have emphasized from day one, and that is the imperative of protecting civilians and protecting civilian infrastructure, as well as the humanitarian and UN infrastructure that is there in Gaza to help people who are in desperate need.  And the work that the UN is performing in Gaza is quite literally lifesaving, and no one else can do it - no one else is doing it.  And it only underscores the importance of making sure that its facilities - including facilities that it's erected or is maintaining that are housing the many, many displaced Palestinians until they can go back to their homes and neighborhoods, is essential and it has to be protected.  We've reaffirmed this with the Government of Israel, and it's my understanding that they are, as is necessary and appropriate, looking into this incident.
More broadly with regard to civilian infrastructure and with regard to the contours of Gaza itself, we've spoken very clearly about this and will continue to do so, both with the Government of Israel as well as in public.  We do not support any diminution of the territory of Gaza.  And similarly, it's vitally important that all of the civilian infrastructure be protected as best possible - understanding that this is a war brought about by the horrific attacks by Hamas on October 7th, that Hamas continues to hide in and under civilian infrastructure.  Nonetheless, there's a responsibility on the part of Israel to do everything possible to protect that infrastructure, and certainly not to destroy it.  So that's, again, something that we have and will continue to take up with the government.
And as I've said from the outset, from these now four months since October 7th, when we have important questions that we're pursuing, important needs that we're pursuing - when it comes to humanitarian assistance, when it comes to civilian protection, when it comes to any other aspect of this - it's an ongoing conversation, an ongoing dialogue.  And sometimes you don't get results immediately, flipping a light switch.  It's a process; we're at it every single day.  And I believe the engagements that we've had, the interventions we've made, the work that we've done, has made a real difference over these past four months - both in terms of humanitarian assistance and civilian protection.
Having said that, the suffering of civilians in Gaza - men, women, and children - remains heartbreaking, and it animates us to do everything we can to try to ensure the best we can that the right steps are being taken to protect civilians and to make sure that they're getting the assistance that they need.  Let me leave it at that.
FOREIGN MINISTER AntÃ³nio:  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much for your question.  With regard to the relationship with Russia, China, and the U.S., first of all I would like to say that Angola is a country that is open to the world.  Maybe I should borrow a word by Mr. Blinken during a visit to West African countries.  He said that in a country that needs so much that everybody has a space to cooperate with that country.  I can't recall which country was that, but Mr. Blinken is here, can testify to that.  So this also applies to the Republic of Angola.  And knowing our history, in terms of the development and transformation that we want to bring about in this country, but all partnerships that can fit into our needs and our policy in terms of our developmental policy are welcome.
With regard to the fact to which extent the war between Russia and Ukraine affect our relationships, we know that the premises for establishing diplomatic relations are well known, (inaudible) - mutual respect, respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.  These are the basic principles in the relation with Angola, the Republic of Congo, Angola with South Africa, Angola with Russia, or Angola with the United States of America.  These are base principle of all diplomatic relations.  And in these relationship, we can have also different standpoints in our relations.
And we believe as Angola that the best friends are the one who tells the truth, and I believe I could stop here and say that the difference that might exist in our relationship with one or another are applicable to this old adage, saying that the best friend is the one who tells the true.  Where we think that the principle that we've just mentioned - or the principles that I've mentioned - are not being upheld, and we had to warn our friends.  So this is the way that I'm trying to summarize my response.
With regard to the first question, this is an aspect that I've already mentioned.  I had the privilege of borrowing Mr. Antony's statement on the need of having partnership.  And maybe we should think deeper.  I think it's wrong when our interpretation for partnership development falls into temptation of saying, ""You must leave for me to get in.""  That's wrong, because in political terms, this could be misinterpreted.  It looks like the partner that we're going to have has to be under dominion of somebody else, whereas the world lives on complementarity, and this complementarity has various development levels.
Let me just give an example.  Maybe the structure of Angola's foreign trade with the U.S. might not be the same as that of foreign trade between Angola with Japan, or U.S. with Japan - because the level of development is different.  And in this difference, we will try to find solution for the needs for our development.  So I think we need to think out of the box and not get stuck into those paradigms that are no longer valid in this world of complementarity.  Thank you very much.
SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you, everyone.
MODERATOR:  (Via interpreter) Excellencies, thank you very much for your responses.  The - journalists, we have come to the close of our press conference.  Thank you very much for having come, and wish you a very good afternoon."

WASHINGTON -- Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets   Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on key officials of the forces of   Ansarallah, commonly known as the Houthis, for their support to acts of   terrorism targeting commercial shipping. Today's action targets four   individuals who have supported the Houthis' recent attacks against   commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, including holding   civilian crews hostage. Concurrent with OFAC's designations, the United   Kingdom is also imposing sanctions on these key figures of Houthi   forces.
""The Houthis' persistent terrorist attacks on merchant   vessels and their civilian crews lawfully transitting the Red Sea and   the Gulf of Aden threaten to disrupt international supply chains and the   freedom of navigation, which is critical to global security, stability,   and prosperity,"" said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and   Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. ""Today's joint action with the   United Kingdom demonstrates our collective action to leverage all   authorities to stop these attacks.""
On January 17, 2024, the U.S. Department of State announced the   designation of  Ansarallah as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist   (SDGT), effective February 16, 2024. Today's OFAC designation of Houthi   forces officials, taken in advance of the effective date of the   designation of Ansarallah, serves to further promote accountability for   the group's recent terrorist attacks. Individuals targeted today are   being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended,   which targets terrorist groups, their supporters, and those who aid acts   of terrorism.
Since   October 2023, the Houthis have launched numerous ballistic missiles and   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against vessels transiting the Red Sea   and surrounding waterways, striking and causing significant damage to   several merchant ships. In November, Houthi forces boarded and hijacked   the merchant vessel Galaxy Leader while it was underway in the Red Sea.
Mohamed al-Atifi (al-Atifi),   the so-called Houthi ""Minister of Defense,"" has publicly stated that   the Houthis will ""turn the Red Sea into a graveyard"" in response to any   perceived action against Yemen by the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity   Guardian, a coalition of ten nations deployed to the Red Sea to protect   civilian commercial vessels from Houthi attacks.
Muhammad Fadl Abd al-Nabi (al-Nabi) is the so-called ""Commander"" of the Houthis' maritime forces. Al-Nabi, alongside Mohamed Al-Atifi, visited the Galaxy Leader,   the vessel hijacked by the Houthis on November 19, 2023. Al-Nabi has   publicly committed to continuing attacks against vessels transiting the   Red Sea.
Muhammad Ali al-Qadiri (al-Qadiri),   the so-called Houthi ""Coastal Defense Forces Chief"" and ""Director of   the Houthi Naval College,"" was tasked with executing attacks against   vessels in the Red Sea. Al-Qadiri has publicly threatened to attack   international maritime traffic in the Red Sea using advanced weapons and   to expand the Houthis' attack campaign against vessels sailing along   the entire western coast of Yemen.
Muhammad Ahmad al-Talibi (al-Talibi),   who serves as the so-called ""Director of Procurement"" for the Houthi   forces, leads the Houthis' efforts to smuggle Iranian-provided weapons,   missiles, UAVs, and components needed to manufacture these weapons   systems into Yemen. In his role, al-Talibi coordinates arms shipments   through the smuggling networks of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard   Corps and answers directly to principal Houthi forces decision makers.
Muhammad   Ali al-Qadiri, Muhammad Ahmad al-Talibi, Mohamed al-Atifi, and Muhammad   Fadl Abd al-Nabi are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as   amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided   financial, material, or technological support for, or good or services   to or in support of an act of terrorism, as defined in section 3(d) of   E.O. 13224, as amended.
As   a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of   the designated persons described above that are in the United States or   in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be   reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or   indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one   or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general   or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC's regulations   generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or   transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in   property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.
In addition,   non-U.S. financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain   transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and individuals may   expose themselves to sanctions risk or be subject to an enforcement   action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or   provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any   designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of   funds, goods, or services from any such person.
The power and   integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC's ability to   designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness   to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The   ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a   positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for   seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer   to OFAC's Frequently Asked Question 897 here.

The Ain al-Asad air base housing US troops in Iraq has come under a fresh attack by resistance forces opposing Washington's support for the Israeli regime's war on Gaza.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) on Monday launched a drone attack on the base located in the western province of Anbar.
The attack came just two days after Iraqi resistance groups fired multiple ballistic missiles and rockets at Ain al-Asad, reportedly causing traumatic brain injury for the personnel in the base.
The US Central Command confirmed the attack Saturday evening and said in a statement that ""a number"" of US personnel are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries.
The Saturday attacks on US forces were the largest in scope and size since early October when resistance groups in Iraq began to target US positions in the country and in neighboring Syria in a bid to force the US to withdraw its support from Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
The IRI said on Monday that it had hit US military positions in Koniko, an area in Syria's eastern province of Dayr al-Zawr which is home to a key oilfield.
US forces in Koniko came under two rounds of attacks within an hour on midday Monday, said the IRI.
The IRI includes several paramilitary groups recognized by the Iraqi government as legitimate forces in the country's fight against terrorism.
The groups have been pressing for an end to the presence of foreign forces in Iraq more than a decade after a US-led coalition invaded the Arab country in blatant violation of international law and under the pretext of finding WMDs However, no such weapons were ever discovered in Iraq.
Attacks by Iraqi resistance forces on US and Israeli interests in the region have expanded in recent weeks to cover targets near or inside the occupied territories.
An IRI statement on Sunday said resistance forces had launched a first drone attack on a target controlled by the Israeli regime in Syria's Occupied Golan Heights."

U.S. and British warplanes, backed by surface ships and submarines, launched a series of strikes into Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen late Monday, aimed at further degrading the capabilities of Iranian-backed Houthi militants who have sought to carry out attacks against key shipping lanes in the Middle East.
U.S. defense officials said the strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.
The strike locations were intentionally selected to target weapons systems not to amass casualties, a senior military official told reporters. The official assessed the underground storage facility had ""more advanced conventional weaponry"" in it than sites hit in the first round of strikes on Jan. 11.
""These precision strikes ... are in response to a series of illegal, dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions,"" the U.S. and Britain said in a statement, noting the latest strikes were carried out with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
""We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,"" the statement added.
The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world's maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.
This is the eighth time U.S. military assets have struck Houthi targets in the past 10 days, but only the second time Washington has had help since Britain took part in the initial round of strikes earlier this month. A senior military official told reporters the strikes Monday had ""removed significant capability"" from the Houthis to launch attacks.
A U.S. defense official ""directly attributed ... the decline in the number and the ferocity of the [Houthi's] maritime attacks ... to the reduction in Houthi capability to carry out those attacks.""
""That does not mean they have no more capability, but we definitely believe that has had an impact,"" another U.S. official said.
Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched 33 attacks on international shipping lanes, according to the Pentagon. The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.
Defense experts worry the United States is now fighting a regional war in the Middle East amid a sharp increase in attacks on American forces over the weekend.
Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday there have been 151 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, including a ""barrage"" of ballistic missiles fired at Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq that constituted ""a larger-scale attack than we have seen before.""
Most of the missiles were shot down, Singh said, but those that landed on the base injured one Iraqi Security Forces member and caused traumatic brain injuries in two U.S. service members.
The 151 attacks since October have injured at least 83 Americans in Iraq and Syria, a U.S. defense official said on Monday. All but two have returned to duty.
""We do not seek escalation. We don't want to see it escalate,"" Singh said Monday in response to a question from VOA.
""If you're in a scrap with somebody and you can find a way to tie one or both of their hands behind their back, that's not escalating. That's de-escalating. That's taking ability away from the other party to inflict harm,"" John Kirby, National Security Council director of strategic communications, told reporters Monday at the White House.
Critics like Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, say the U.S. military's limited strikes against Iranian-backed targets across the Middle East amount to a ""shoulder shrug"" response to what he said was ""absolutely"" a ""low-level, and in some cases not-so-low-level regional war going on.""
""Don't expect to have good policy coming out of Washington if we can't be objective and honest and assessing where we sit. Full points for not wanting a regional war and trying to avoid a regional war, but news flash, we appear to have one,"" Bowman told VOA.
He added that as in any war, the adversary also gets a vote in whether the Middle East violence erupts into a full-blown war.
""Our adversary here is [the] Islamic Republic of Iran and its network of terror proxies, and they are repeatedly trying to kill Americans. And the only reason why we haven't had more American casualties [is] because we've taken measures to defend ourselves, and we've gotten lucky. And sooner or later, luck runs out,"" Bowman said.
Most of the attacks against U.S. forces inside Syria and Iraq have been claimed by an umbrella group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has said the attacks are in retaliation for Washington's support for Israel in the war.
Attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia on ships in and around the Red Sea for the past several weeks have bogged down trade between Asia and Europe and created fears of a widening war in the Middle East. Many of the attacks by the Houthis have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel.
Also on Monday, the U.S. sanctioned Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani, saying the airline provided assistance to Iran's military wing and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon."

Tehran, IRNA -- The United States has launched a new round of attacks against Yemen, media outlets have reported.
The Pentagon said that the US took out two Yemeni missiles about to launch toward the Red Sea, where the group has been targeting cargo ships, The Hill said on Wednesday.
US Central Command (CENTCOM) said it had conducted strikes against two Yemeni anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch at around 2:30 a.m. local time Wednesday in a post on X, the American newspaper added.
A military source in Yemen said on Tuesday that the futile attacks were carried out against bases that had been targeted dozens of times before, referring to the fresh US-UK aggression on the Arab country.
The US and the UK have recently attacked Yemen several times after a United Nations Security Council resolution on the Red Sea, but the attacks are made in violation of international laws to protect Israeli interests.
The US has once again blacklisted Yemen's Ansarullah Movement, sparking condemnations over Washington's unilateral moves in the region and beyond.

Z6PVHRNSCO_OFAY2UUM3WZFI8M,Moldovan Foreign Minister Resigns; Two New Ministers Appointed,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240124-rferl04.htm,"By RFE/RL's Moldovan Service January 24, 2024
Moldovan Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu announced his resignation during a press briefing in Chisinau on on January 24, saying that he has achieved the goal set for him by pro-Western President Maia Sandu to bring Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, closer to integration into the European Union.
Under Popescu's mandate, Moldova strongly condemned Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and hosted tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.
Moldova obtained the status of an EU candidate country in June 2022, together with Ukraine, and was given the green light to start membership negotiations in December.
""I have successfully fulfilled the objectives set for me at the beginning of my mandate and I now need a break,"" Popescu said.
Following Popescu's resignation, the Foreign Ministry will be led by Mihai Popsoi, the parliament's deputy speaker and a member of Sandu's governing Action and Solidarity (PAS) party, while Cristina Gherasimov, who is currently one of the three deputy foreign ministers, will be put in charge of a recently created European Integration Bureau.
During the government meeting on January 24 following Popescu's resignation, Prime Minister Dorin Recean had announced that Gherasimov would ""lead the European Affairs Ministry and would coordinate the activity of the European Integration Bureau,"" giving the impression that the foreign ministry would be split into two new ministries.
However, government spokesman Daniel Voda issued a clarification after the meeting, saying that Gherasimov will be a minister without portfolio and will lead the European Integration Bureau.
The two new ministers will be sworn in next week, after Popescu leaves his position on January 29. He will also step down from his position as deputy prime minister.
Politically unaffiliated, Popescu was appointed foreign minister in August 2021, after Sandu beat Moscow-backed incumbent Igor Dodon in a presidential election in November 2020.
The U.S.-educated Sandu has firmly steered Moldova toward the West and has had a steady ally in Popescu.
Moldova's diplomacy led by Popescu worked to distance the former Soviet republic from Russia, which still wields a strong influence in the country of 2.6 million sandwiched between EU and NATO member Romania and war-wracked Ukraine.
The Moldovan Foreign Ministry expelled 45 Russian diplomats from Moscow's embassy in Chisinau in August after a media investigation revealed that the embassy building had an unusually high number of antennas installed on its roof that were suspected of gathering information for Russian intelligence services.
Popescu worked to strengthen ties with its Western neighbor Romania, with which Moldova shares a common history, ethnicity, and language.
A political scientist and former researcher for the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies (CEPS), Popescu has boosted security and defense cooperation with the EU and NATO and worked to establish the EU Partnership Mission Moldova in May.
He first had a stint as foreign minister from June to November 2019 in a short-lived government led by Sandu.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says the Islamic Republic has bluntly warned the United States that its decision to carry out joint strikes with the United Kingdom on targets in Yemen constitutes ""a strategic mistake.""
Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in New York on Monday local time following his bilateral meetings. The top Iranian diplomat has traveled to New York to take part in a meeting of the UN Security Council on Palestine.
""We sent out a strongly-worded message and stern warning to Americans. The decision by the United States and the United Kingdom to jointly attack areas in Yemen poses threats to regional peace and security, and expands the scope of [Gaza] war,"" he added.
The Iranian foreign minister noted that satellite images show that approximately 230 merchant vessels and oil tankers were cruising in the Red Sea at the time that the US and UK carried out their strikes against Yemen.
""This means that they (Americans and Britons) have well understood Yemenis' point that only ships heading towards ports operated by the occupying Israeli regime will be blocked,"" Amir-Abdollahian said.
He emphasized that he had sharply criticized London for escalation of tensions in the Red Sea and launching military strikes against Yemen, and described the moves as ""a strategic mistake"" during a meeting with his British counterpart David Cameron on the sidelines of the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss city of Davos.
On Monday, US and British forces launched strikes at eight different locations in Yemen, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, according to a joint statement signed by the six countries.
A senior US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said roughly 25 to 30 munitions were fired, including from warplanes launched from a US aircraft carrier.
So far, eight rounds of strikes over the past month have failed to stop attacks by Yemeni Armed Forces against shipping linked to the Israeli regime.
Iran commander: Yemenis are independent, take orders from no side
Meanwhile, the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy says Yemeni Armed Forces are acting independently in their decision to launch attacks in the Red Sea on Israeli-owned ships or merchant vessels destined to the occupied territories.
""Yemen is an independent country with a strong army, and it also has a strong leader [Abdul-Malik al-Houthi], who acts independently and takes orders from no side,"" Alireza Tangsiri stated.
""Yemen's naval operations in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and their prevention of the transit of ships belonging to the Zionist regime or vessels choosing the occupying regime as a destination is in line with their support of Muslims,"" he noted.
Tangsiri noted that ""heroic Yemenis"" are trying to stop the massacre of Palestinians, and it is the Western world, the US and all those that support the ""bloodshed by Zionists"" that need to change their approach.
Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched a devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after the territory's Palestinian resistance movements carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The relentless Israeli military campaign against Gaza has killed at least 24,620 people, most of them women and children. Another 61,830 individuals have been wounded.
Reports revealed that Israeli shipping companies have already decided to reroute their vessels in fear of attacks by Yemeni forces.
Yemeni forces have also launched missile and drone attacks on targets in the Israeli-occupied territories after the regime's aggression on Gaza."

The actions taken by the United States, United Kingdom and the so-called coalition in the Red Sea are a crude violation of international law. Speaking at the January 12 session of the UN Security Council, Russian Permanent Representative  to the UN Vasily Nebenzya described in detail what these violations were all about.  In addition, on January 22, the UN Security Council disseminated the official document of the Russian Federation with comments on the US and UK's failed attempts to justify armed strikes at Yemen's territory.
These Anglo-Saxon actions are illegal for the following reason. Under the UN Charter, the use of force on the territory of a sovereign state (Yemen in this case) may be recognised as legal only if it is done (in the exercise of this right of self-defence) in response to the armed aggression against a sovereign state or if the use of force was sanctioned by the UN Security Council. There is no legal basis to support the US or UK's declared right to self-defence in the Red Sea. The goals (protection against attacks on civilian vessels and the need to ensure freedom of navigation) initially announced in the statement by President Joseph Biden on the day of the missile strike at Yemeni territory and the Defence Secretary's statement on December 18, 2023 do not give them the right to self-defence within the definition of Article 51 of the UN Charter.
Characteristically, the emphasis on threats to warships began to be backdated after the strikes at Yemeni territory began. It is still unclear whether these threats existed at all. Moreover, the Anglo-Saxons did not mention any victims or damage to their warships.
There are no UN Security Council resolutions giving anyone a mandate to use force in connection with the events in the Red Sea. Recent UN Security Council Resolution 2722 is no exception. On the contrary, it urges all states to act in line with international law and, importantly, to display caution and restrained for fear of aggravating the situation in the Red Sea and the region in general.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which the Anglo-Saxons are referring, does not regulate the right to use force or other military actions in this context at all.
To sum up, these US and UK actions violate Article 2 of the UN Charter, which obliges UN members to refrain from the use of force against the territorial inviolability of any state. Their actions are motivated by narrow, selfish interests and cannot be justified either by the standards of the international law of the sea or the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Moreover, these actions are fraught with the risk of escalating and spreading the situation in the Gaza Strip to the rest of the region. Current developments in the Red Sea vividly bear this out.
Shameless manipulations with standards of international law with a view to justifying any arbitrary action have long become routine for Washington and London. However, no manipulation can legitimise their actions. The Anglo-Saxons have long developed a habit of violating the UN Charter and the fundamental standards of international law, including the principle of the non-use of force. This is their way of life."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) â Moscow insists it has reliable information that suggests there are French mercenaries in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.
On January 17, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Russian armed forces destroyed a temporary deployment point for foreign fighters in Kharkov, most of whom were French mercenaries, adding that about 60 soldiers were killed.
The French Foreign Ministry has rejected the information that French citizens serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian military and said that the Russian statement is a ""gross manipulation"". The Russian Foreign Ministry later summoned the French Ambassador over the matter.
Dmitry Peskov emphasized that the French authorities should take better care of their citizens.
""We still insist that we have reliable information that suggests that there are French citizens in Ukraine, French mercenaries. And we also take note of the statements of French representatives that they cannot do anything with those who want to take part in this massacre in Ukraine. We regret this,"" he told reporters.
Peskov added that the Kremlin is paying attention to statements from French representatives claiming they ""cannot do anything"" about the situation regarding mercenaries.
""We therefore regret this fact,"" he said.
Despite substantial evidence indicating the presence of French mercenaries within the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the French Foreign Ministry attempted to distance itself from any knowledge of its citizens serving in Ukrainian units. Dismissing the information regarding the elimination of dozens of French mercenaries in Kharkov as ""a gross manipulation by the Russians,"" the French authorities expressed skepticism.
In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry took action by summoning the French ambassador to communicate that the responsibility for the deaths of these French citizens in Ukraine rests with Paris.
Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, announced that the legislative body would address the issue in its upcoming session. He emphasized the consideration of an appeal to the French parliament to investigate whether French legislators are aware of any individuals violating the republic's laws by sending mercenaries to Ukraine, thereby breaching its own laws.

ZHAHC87X6H_OOV2BNYE8V3PC86,Analysts: Assassination Plot Shows Extremes Iran Employs to Target Critics,_,_,20240122,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2024/iran-240121-voa01.htm,"By Liam Scott January 21, 2024
A thwarted Iranian plot to assassinate two journalists working for a Persian TV network in London has renewed focus on the ways hostile governments try to target critics outside their jurisdiction.
Details of the plot, uncovered by the British news outlet ITV News late last year, included a plan to kill the journalists Sima Sabet and Fardad Farahzad.
The details ""are a shocking reminder of the sinister lengths that the Iranian regime is willing to go to silence critical reporting from abroad,"" said Jessica White, who researches transnational repression at Freedom House.
""Reporters covering human rights violations by the Iranian authorities should not have to live and work in fear for themselves and their family members,"" White told VOA from London. ""Nor should the Iranian regime evade accountability for its actions.""
White is the author of a December report that found at least 26 governments had targeted reporters abroad in the past decade in a process known as transnational repression.
The Iranian government is among the worst perpetrators of transnational repression, the report found.
Among the cases Freedom House featured is that of Behrang Tajdin, a BBC Persian journalist who for years dealt with threats and harassment. Tajdin told the research group that the attacks ""have become so unbearable in the past few years and especially in the past year that we have no choice but to talk about it, to call it out.""
He added that he worries for relatives still in Iran, who can come under pressure over his reporting.
In the more recent London case, Sabet, a former presenter at the Persian language news channel Iran International, and her colleague Farahzad, were first made aware of the plot against them by ITV News.
The British broadcaster determined that Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is the main branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, was behind the plot.
During the fall of 2022, Iranian spies planned to strike Iran International's London studio with a car bomb. They initially wanted to kill five or six employees but later decided to target only Sabet and Farahzad in a knife attack.
The spies codenamed Sabet ""the bride,"" and Farahzad was referred to as ""the groom."" The assassination was codenamed ""the wedding.""
Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. But a spokesperson for the Iranian Embassy in London, Seyed Mehdi Hosseini Matin, rejected the report as ""unfounded"" in a post on the X platform, formerly Twitter.
""If I hadn't been influential, I wouldn't have been targeted. I already knew that we are standing against a regime that does not recognize neutrality,"" Sabet told VOA Persian.
The plan was ultimately thwarted by the people-smuggler-turned-double-agent whom the spies offered $200,000 to carry out the killings.
When British intelligence learned about the plot, they alerted Iran International, which prompted the outlet to begin broadcasting from the United States.
Sabet said she's concerned that Iranian operatives were able to work on British soil in the first place.
""As a tax-paying British citizen who lives and works here, I am surprised that an outfit like the IRGC can operate freely and threaten the life of a British citizen for committing what seems to be the sin of journalism,"" she said.
Freedom House has recommended that governments better support at-risk journalists and media outlets operating in exile by imposing coordinated sanctions on countries that use transnational repression, and to adopt safeguards against invasive surveillance technologies.
The research group says making it easier for exiled journalists to have permanent legal status in host countries could also improve safety.
This isn't the first time Tehran has been accused of trying to kill its critics abroad.
VOA Persian host Masih Alinejad was the target of a 2021 kidnapping attempt in New York, which the FBI says was part of a Tehran plot to bring her to Iran. The Justice Department last year indicted three people in a separate case who allegedly plotted to kill Alinejad.
""Transnational repression is not just a threat for us, for dissidents. It's a threat to democracy,"" Alinejad told VOA in December.
The threat facing Iranian critics around the world underscores the ever-present crackdown on independent media inside Iran.
This month, the Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Iran as the sixth-worst jailer of reporters in the world, with 17 journalists behind bars.
But for Sabet, the threat has not dampened her resolve.
""We have to stand against them [Tehran] and talk about what is happening,"" she said.
""I am a professional journalist, and my duty is to spread information,"" Sabet said. ""I am committed to my people, committed to the truth â even at the cost of my life. This is what I want to do, and I stand by my commitment.""
VOA's Persian Service contributed to this report."

WASHINGTON -- Ever since Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, starting Europe's biggest war in generations, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has been scrambling to unite the world against Moscow's aggression, highlighting its attacks on civilians and evidence of war crimes.
Two years later, that job is getting a lot tougher -- and not just because people around the world, including in the United States, are losing interest in the war.
Israel's pummeling military response to the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, has outraged governments and populaces in the Global South that the United States has been trying to woo.
The U.S. response to ally Israel's bombing of civilian infrastructure in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis it has exacerbated for the Palestinian population has been more muted than its criticism of Russia's attacks -- and those nations have taken notice, accusing Washington of applying a double standard.
""Global North countries are suddenly quiet as they watch humanitarian violations. Where's all the lectures they often give about human rights? Doesn't Palestine have the same rights as the rest of us?"" Retno Marsudi, the foreign minister of Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation by population, told a press conference on January 8.
For decades, critics have accused the United States of upholding what is often called the ""rules-based international order"" when it suits its needs and ignoring it when it doesn't. The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq in defiance of a UN vote may be the most explicit example this century.
Losing Leverage
That criticism has potentially become more consequential today as China and Russia seek to reshape the geopolitical world and undermine U.S. influence while increasing their own clout -- and, in Russia's case, attempting to alter the map by attacking Ukraine and occupying its territory. Beijing and Moscow are seizing on such perceived double standards to pull the countries of the Global South into their corner.
""The U.S. doesn't have the same leverage that it used to,"" Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, told RFE/RL, pointing to China's growing role on the world stage.
The United States has struggled to get countries in the Global South to go along with its sanctions against Russia over Moscow's war on Ukraine. Many also refused to support the U.S. designation of Beijing's persecution of Muslim Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang region as genocide.
Russian and Chinese officials and state media have used the U.S. response to Israel's bombing to discredit Washington's criticism of own their countries' policies and actions.
""Western politicians who didn't throw away any opportunity to accuse other countries of committing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity suddenly don't know how to describe the slaughtering of thousands of innocent civilians despite the tragedy being played out in front of media cameras,"" said an October 27 article in China Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's English-language propaganda outlet.
Israel has been besieging Gaza since Hamas forces invaded Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, in the deadliest attack on the Jewish state since its creation in 1948. More than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.
In the face of criticism over its approach to the Israel-Hamas war, the Biden administration has staunchly defended Israel's right to self-defense. Though it has urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change tactics and protect civilians and is leading international efforts to find a way to end the war, it has largely refrained from harsh public criticism and continued to supply weapons to Israel.
Biden has also suggested that the U.S. approaches on Russia's war against Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war are consistent, saying in a national address in October that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hamas ""represent different threats"" but ""both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy -- completely annihilate it.""
Western officials have also pointed out disparities between the two wars, including a major difference: Ukraine did not attack Russia.
'Enduring Consequences For Ukraine'
But for many people around the world, there is little difference between the Russian bombing of Ukrainian cities and Israel's bombing of Gaza.
""With every civilian casualty from an Israeli airstrike, the West's arguments in defense of a rules-based order ring hollower in the global South,"" Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in the U.S. magazine Foreign Affairs this month.
""This could have enduring consequences for Ukraine, which derives the legitimacy for its struggle from the order-breaking nature of Russia's aggression.""
Kupchan said there is more sympathy with the Palestinian cause than for Ukraine in the Global South, especially in the Middle East, and a broad perception that Israel's retaliation for the October 7 attack is causing too much death.
""And the U.S. -- as Israel's most visible backer -- ends up paying a reputational price. It's guilt by association,"" he said.
Moscow and Beijing's message that the West is simply trying to preserve its hegemony plays well in the Global South, Kupchan added.
""There is a lot of talk in Washington about the rules-based order, and at times China and Russia try to turn that talk against the United States and say, 'Well, what about Gaza? Where is the rules-based order right now?'"" he told RFE/RL.
Court Change
The United States also faced accusations of double standards in late July, a few months before Hamas invaded Israel, when Biden ordered his administration to start sharing evidence of suspected Russian war crimes in Ukraine with the International Criminal Court (ICC).
It was a major shift: In part because of fears that cooperation with the court could open the door to politicized prosecution of U.S. troops abroad, the United States has historically opposed the ICC extending its jurisdiction over nationals of countries that -- like itself -- are not members of the court.
In 2021, the United States opposed an ICC investigation into Israelis for their alleged crimes in Palestine on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member. But Russia isn't either.
The change in tack ""certainly undermines the credibility of the U.S. to speak out and to consider itself a promoter of justice and accountability for serious international crime,"" Elizabeth Evanson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch, told RFE/RL.
""It risks exacerbating perception problems of whether the international system is working on behalf of everyone fully,"" she said.
Not Alone
Even before the Israel-Hamas war, there was already plenty of talk about selective international justice, Evanson said.
The outpouring of international support for an ICC investigation into alleged Russian atrocities led people to ask, ""If this kind of response can happen here, why are we not seeing it in other places?"" she said.
While its diverse approaches to Russia and Israel are drawing particular attention to the United States, many other countries -- including those of the Global South -- also face accusations of hypocrisy in international affairs.
Indonesia has been at the forefront of criticism leveled at Israel for its bombing of Palestinian civilians but has remained quiet about China's detainment of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.
The same goes for South Africa. It has brought a genocide suit against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) but has kept silent about China's abuse of Uyghurs. It has abstained on UN resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
South Africa and Indonesia have at least one thing in common: Both have China as their largest trading partner. And China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, has not been shy about using its economic might to punish countries that publicly condemn its actions.
The Global South's frustration with the West and the world order had been growing for years, Bruce Jones, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told RFE/RL.
The West failed to meet its climate investment goals in the Global South or equitably distribute vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. Its uneven response to the war in Ukraine compared with horrific wars in Africa further underscored to the Global South that the world order wasn't working for them, he said.
In the eyes of many in the Global South, ""none of this seems to resonate"" with the United States and Europe, Jones said.
""The United States tends to look at these countries primarily in traditional bilateral terms and not to think much about how they perceived the international order writ large,"" he said.
Kupchan said the United States will simply have to face the consequences of its policies on attitudes around the world while the two wars continue.
""The big policy question is what we do when the dust settles,"" Kupchan told RFE/RL. ""How do we up our game and enhance our appeal in the Global South?""
It will start with listening more closely to their concerns, he said.

The foreign ministry spokesman says Iran's recent strikes on positions held by terrorists in neighboring countries conveyed ""a clear message"" to those who had to get it.
Nasser Kan'ani made the remarks at a weekly press briefing on Monday, almost a week after Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) launched missile strikes on an Israeli spy base in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and a gathering of anti-Iran terrorist groups, especially Daesh, in northwestern Syria.
The elite military force also carried out simultaneous drone and missile attacks on two bases belonging to the Jaish ul-Adl terrorist group in Pakistan.
""These actions were a clear message to those who should have received it,"" Kan'ani said.
""Iran is sensitive to national security and the security of its citizens. Simultaneously, it stresses friendly ties and implementation of bilateral agreements and understandings with its neighbors to ensure regional security, seeking to develop relations with neighboring states.""
He also provided details on the preemptive operation against terrorists in Pakistan.
""The attack came from an immediate necessity to deal with the terrorists who were ready to operate. Perhaps, they were only about half an hour away from the common border. They were ready to attack the Iranian border, the country's bases and possibly our citizens,"" he added.
Israel's anti-Iran acts won't go unanswered
The Iranian diplomat also referred to Israel's latest terrorist acts against Iran, saying they will not go unanswered.
Israel assassinated five IRGC military advisors in a Saturday airstrike on a residential building west of the Syrian capital Damascus.
The targeted killing came nearly a month after another terrorist Israeli strike martyred Brigadier General Seyyed Razi Mousavi, a senior IRGC military advisor, in a Damascus neighborhood.
Kan'ani said that Israel is constantly seeking to spark tensions and war in the region in a bid to get itself out of a self-made crisis and quagmire in the Gaza Strip.
""Iran will not play in the sinister plot devised by the Zionist regime,"" he emphasized.
Commenting on Israeli officials' anti-Iran rhetoric, Kan'ani said that the baseless claims show the level of the threat that the regime poses to regional and international security.
""Such claims are empty, but of course we will not leave any action against Iran unanswered,"" he said.
Tensions have ratcheted up in the region since the start of Israel's brutal war on Gaza that has so far killed at least 25,105 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 62,681 others.
South Africa has filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over Isarel's genocidal actions against Palestinians in besieged Gaza.
Kan'ani said Iran has supported ""the good, responsible, honorable and courageous action"" of the South African government and announced its political position in support of South Africa.
Touching on Iran's relations with Iraq, he said that the ties are strong and that Tehran-Baghdad contacts are continuous and on a daily basis.
He further noted that Iran's concerns can be eased by the full implementation of a security agreement signed between the two neighboring countries last year.
The spokesman also referred to recent reports about Saudi Arabia's intermediation between Iran and the United States, saying he did not confirm the news that the Saudis are going to play a role in this regard.
""However, the Americans use paths to send messages. The relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia are good and developing. There is a serious will to expand cooperation,"" he pointed out."

Australia has imposed further counter-terrorism financing sanctions on 12 persons and three entities linked to Hamas, Hizballah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This action is concurrent with further sanctions imposed on Hamas-linked targets by the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union.
Those sanctioned include Hamas leaders, financial facilitators, and persons who have provided training to terrorist operatives, as well as three entities that have facilitated the transfer of funds to Hamas.
Sanctioning and publicly listing these 12 persons and three entities for counter-terrorism financing sanctions shows they have engaged in the support and facilitation of terrorism.
Australia has already imposed sanctions on Hamas, Hizballah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in their entirety, and a further 17 persons and seven entities with links to these groups.
Once listed for sanctions, it is a criminal offence to use or deal with the person or entity's assets, or to make assets available to them. This is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment and/or heavy fines.
Australia continues to unequivocally condemn the attacks on Israel by Hamas as abhorrent acts of terror against innocent civilians.

NORTH MITROVICA, Kosovo -- It's a tough sell. Tens of thousands of ethnic Serbs who live and work in Kosovo but stubbornly reject the country's official currency have a week to ditch the dinar in their daily lives.
For two decades, encouraged by Belgrade and reluctantly ignored by Pristina, residents in 10 heavily ethnic Serbian municipalities have clung to the Serbian currency for everything from salaries and pensions to doctor's bills, restaurant tabs, and even taxi fares.
Then, last week, Kosovo's Central Bank issued a regulation restricting all cash transactions anywhere in the country to euros from February 1. It cited the constitution's stipulation of ""one single currency"" as legal tender. Dinars can still be held in bank accounts or exchanged for euros.
It may still take time to fully enforce the ban among Serbs who have resisted central authority on everything from license plates to cigarette stamps, usually with diplomatic and financial cover from Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.
But it's an unmistakable sign of Kosovar impatience toward perceived Serbian intransigence as normalization talks drag on and Prime Minister Albin Kurti begins to eye a reelection battle sometime in the next 13 months, compounding Western fears of increased friction in a Balkan hot spot.
""The state has to do something urgently,"" Milivoje, an ethnic Serb in North Mitrovica who requested his last name not be published, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service in a plea that was clearly directed to the government of Serbia, not Kosovo.
He and his wife both receive their salaries from Serbia, he said, mentioning that in the case of his wife, a professor, the amount is the dinar equivalent of 1,000 euros. Both of their daughters work in the Serbian-financed health-care system and are paid in dinars. Their son is unemployed.
They are part of a massive parallel infrastructure financed openly and behind the scenes by Belgrade to support and encourage Serbs who reject Kosovar independence, consuming tens of millions of euros from the Serbian budget over Pristina's objections.
Abolishing the dinar is ""catastrophic,"" Milivoje said, explaining he doesn't even have an account with any of the banks operating south of the Ibar, parlance for the rest of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians mostly predominate.
He and other Serbs who spoke to RFE/RL's Balkan Service expressed surprise and anger at the two-week deadline for compliance, although there were early warnings when reports emerged of an interruption in dinar shipments across the Serbian-Kosovar border.
One local Serb complained the restriction only became clear once one of the most popular banks among Serbs, NLB Komercijalna Bank, ""stopped working."" Another called it ""very hastily"" enforced and expressed hope that ""our president,"" an apparent reference to Vucic, would appeal for EU help ""to freeze or postpone it.""
With local tempers rising and international concerns already high following separate incidents last year that killed a Kosovar police officer and injured dozens of NATO peacekeepers in northern Kosovo, Pristina's and Belgrade's Western partners are watching events closely.
Hinting at possible consternation in Washington, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill initially called the dinar restriction an ""unnecessary surprise."" He repeated a call for Pristina to overcome a key sticking point by creating an association of Serbian municipalities, and suggested it was best to ""avoid topics that are not of common interest.""
Then on January 24, the U.S. Embassy in Pristina expressed fears that the ban would ""negatively impact the ethnic Serb community in Kosovo"" and cited commitments under the so-called Ahtisaari Plan that helped pave the way for Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008, saying that ""Serbia has the right to provide financial assistance to members of the ethnic Serb community in Kosovo.""
""We urge the government of Kosovo to revisit this decision, consult with the affected communities, respond to the concerns expressed by the international community, and provide ample time for decisions to be implemented in order to mitigate the impact those decisions will have on its citizens,"" the embassy said in a response to RFE/RL's Balkan Service.
Kosovar Deputy Prime Minister Besnik Bislimi, who has made himself the public face of the ban, responded at a press conference by suggesting officials might appear to be ""cherry-picking,"" but they're actually trying to avoid a selective application of Kosovo's constitution.
""If we have to cherry-pick, we do it,"" Bislimi said. ""If it must be implemented, then insist that it be implemented in all cases.""
Days earlier, European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said the bloc was still analyzing the currency clampdown but was ""seeking explanations."" He echoed warnings against ""uncoordinated actions"" that could hurt the normalization push.
Banking On The Dinar
Serbia's 2024 budget earmarks some 139 million euros ($151 million) for spending on Kosovo (85 million euros of it for institutions), up from 128 million euros ($139 million) last year. But experts caution that such allocations are difficult to track and that more expenditures could be ""hidden"" elsewhere in the budget.
Kosovar Serbs' reliance on the dinar has persisted throughout the postwar years, when the Deutsche mark was official currency until the adoption of the euro in 2002.
In 10 of Kosovo's 38 municipalities, where Serbs represent a majority, they have been able to make payments in dinars or withdraw dinars from the ATMs of Serbian-based banks.
Moreover, Serbs who work at institutions in Kosovo that are financed by Serbia, including schools, universities, and hospitals and other health facilities -- which represent the largest employers of Kosovar Serbs -- are paid in dinars. Pensions and child allowances from the Serbian state also arrive in dinars.
A retiree in North Mitrovica who only identified herself as Jadranka told RFE/RL's Balkan Service that as a result of the new regulation, she would have to travel to the Serbian border town of Raska every month to collect her pension.
""I don't know who is to blame,"" she said, ""but for them to act this like this, I don't know, I have no words.""
The dominant Serbian party in Kosovo, Serbian List, which has long-running ties to radical Serbian nationalists and Belgrade, accused Kosovar policymakers of trying to achieve the ""expulsion of Serbs without the use of weapons."" It said the ban on the dinar threatened ""the physical survival of the Serbian people.""
Kosovar Deputy Prime Minister Besnik Bislimi acknowledged that the Central Bank's new regulation would disrupt life under an informal system that, he argued, lends itself to potential abuse.
He said that ""insisting that money continue to be moved across state borders in duffel bags and private cars, and then distributed through unregistered and unlicensed offices, not only resembles a 19th-century idea but aims to keep the citizens who benefit from them dependent on such [practices].""
""Every citizen of the Republic of Kosovo who opposed [use of euros in banking and nonbanking transactions] has continuously been on the side of lawbreakers,"" he wrote on Facebook.
Belgrade Keeps Cash Coming
For years, dinars have arrived in Kosovo through the National Bank of Serbia, which has a vault in the northern Kosovo municipality of Leposavic. From there, it was transported by armored trucks operated by the Serbian arm of Henderson Asset Protection.
The regulation announced on January 17, which Bislimi said was green-lighted last month, designates the Central Bank as the exclusive importer of euro banknotes and coins.
It also restricts foreign currencies other than the euro to safekeeping in physical form or foreign-currency bank accounts for payments abroad or foreign-exchange activities.
""Currency exchange can be performed in the Republic of Kosovo only through institutions that are licensed by the Central Bank of Kosovo and offer this service,"" the regulation said.
Dinars have routinely been accepted and disbursed by Bank Postanske Stedionica, NLB Komercijalna Bank, and the Post of Serbia, a Serbian public enterprise.
Late last month, NLB Komercijalna Banka clients were informed via electronic messages, including some seen by RFE/RL's Balkan Service, that their accounts would be transferred to cities in Serbia near the border with Kosovo because the bank was closing its branches in Kosovo.
NLB Komercijalna Banka did not respond to an RFE/RL query about the reported closures.
NLB Komercijalna Banka is owned by the Slovenian NLB Group.
NLB has a bank elsewhere in Kosovo that operates in euros. The same clients were told that money could be withdrawn without commission from NLB ATMs throughout the region.
A former deputy governor of Kosovo's Central Bank, Sokol Havolli, said that while they won't be allowed for daily purchases, dinars can still be deposited in bank accounts and exchanged for euros. He said salaries could still be paid in outside currencies but that such funds would be converted into euros before they were withdrawn.
He suggested Serbia would be able to pay out salaries to employees in Kosovo, if the Kosovar and Serbian sides could agree on terms.
RFE/RL's Balkan Service asked the ProCredit, BKT, RaiffeisenBank, NLB, and TEB banks in Kosovo whether clients could open dinar accounts; only BKT said no, adding that their branches did not offer the exchange of dinars.
Mejdi Bektashi, a professor of economics at the University of Pristina, cites a number of potential reasons for the ban on cash payments in dinars, including fighting tax evasion or combating illegal transactions. For instance, he says, Kosovo's tax authorities have been unable to collect value-added tax (VAT) in northern Kosovo and other places where local Serbian majorities routinely circulate dinars.
But he also says such a decision requires more time to implement it. ""Many Serbs from Kosovo receive aid, pensions, and salaries from the state of Serbia, and an alternative solution should be found through negotiations by the competent institutions,"" he said.
He says the Kosovar and Serbian governments along with their respective central banks could negotiate an arrangement for converting funds arriving in dinars into euros.
Kosovar Elections On The Horizon
EU and U.S. efforts to promote a normalization of diplomatic and other relations between Kosovo and Serbia, which does not recognize Kosovo's statehood, appear to have stalled along with hopes of early progress to clear hurdles on Kosovo's path to international institutions.
Meanwhile, national elections are due in Kosovo by February 2025, and Kurti's government could be eager to show the ethnic Albanian majority that it is serious about limiting some of the deleterious effects of perceived Serbian revanchism.
Kurti came to office briefly in 2020 pledging to impose ""reciprocal"" measures to encourage Serbia to recognize Kosovar authority, including over license plates, identification documents, and customs and taxes. A year later, in March 2021, he returned to power vowing more of the same.
After tensions escalated, a compromise was eventually reached in November 2022 that has mostly held.
But the settlement was clouded by mass resignations among Kosovar Serb police and other officials who reportedly objected to enforcing it.
Violence broke out in 2023 after Pristina tried to forcibly install ethnic Albanian mayors in northern municipalities where Serbs had quit, injuring dozens of soldiers in NATO's KFOR peacekeeping mission.
In September, a group of suspected Serbian gunmen, including a longtime Serbian List leader, were involved in a confrontation in which a Kosovar police officer was killed and another injured, setting off alarm bells outside the region.
Kosovo's Interior Ministry this month announced it was arming all police officers with rifles, in a move that Belgrade called ""provocative.""
This month, some Serbian business owners in northern Kosovo complained or even closed their shops over an apparent push by Kosovar authorities to get them to report sales and pay the accompanying taxes.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said Wednesday that a US military ship had suffered a ""direct hit"" as a result of clashes between its forces and several American warships in the Gulf of Aden and the Bab al-Mandab Strait.
""A clash occurred today between a number of American destroyers and warships in the Gulf of Aden and Bab al-Mandab while they were protecting two American commercial ships. The result of the clash was as follows: - A direct hit on an American vessel. - Forcing the two American commercial vessels to withdraw and return,"" Saree said in a statement on X.
The spokesman said the movement used ""a number of ballistic missiles"" during clashes that lasted for more than two hours, adding that ""several missiles struck their targets despite warships' attempts to intercept them.""
Earlier in the day, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said the Houthis had attacked US-flagged, owned, and operated container ship Maersk Detroit in the Gulf of Aden, adding that one missile had landed in the sea and two other missiles had been shot down.
Yemen's Ansar Allah movement, also known as the Houthis, vowed in November 2023 to attack any ships associated with Israel until it halts military actions in the Gaza Strip. This led the US to announce the creation of a multinational operation to secure navigation in the Red Sea. Forces of the US and the United Kingdom later launched major strikes against Houthi positions in a bid to degrade the rebels' ability to target commercial vessels.
On Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that foreign ministers of the EU had ""agreed in principle"" to launch a maritime security mission in the Red Sea, but the bloc had yet to agree on when and how it would be launched.

A high-ranking Iraqi official has called on the United States to push for an end to the unreeling Israeli ground and air offensives against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, than to carry out strikes in Iraq against facilities run by the country's anti-terror resistance groups.
Qassim al-Araji, national security adviser, said in a post on X that the latest US air raids in Jurf al-Sakhar, south of the capital Baghdad, as well as in al-Qa'im area on the border with Syria are in violation of Iraq's sovereignty and ""do not help bring calm.""
""The US side should pile on pressure for a halt to the [Israeli] offensive in Gaza rather than target and bomb the bases of an Iraqi national body,"" Araji noted.
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin announced in a statement that the US military carried out airstrikes in Iraq on Tuesday, targeting facilities used by Kata'ib Hezbollah and other resistance groups.
Two people were killed and two others wounded in the bombardments in al-Qa'im sector, according to an official at the Iraqi Interior Ministry and a former member of the Hashd al-Sha'abi forces.
In response, Iraqi resistance forces targeted a US-occupied military facility in neighboring Syria and Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq's western province of Anbar.
Kata'ib Hezbollah military spokesperson Jaafar al-Husseini also said in a post on X that the group would continue to target ""enemy bases"" until the end of Israel's siege in Gaza and a halt in unqualified US support for Israel's campaign in the besieged coastal sliver.
PM: US strikes will lead to 'irresponsible escalation'
Meanwhile, the prime minister's office said in a statement on Wednesday that strikes by the United States on Iraqi military positions will lead to ""irresponsible escalation"" and violate the country's sovereignty.
Iraq will consider these operations ""aggressive actions,"" the Iraqi government statement noted.
Iraqi parliament: US strikes 'open aggression on national sovereignty'
The Iraqi parliament also condemned US strikes which targeted sites used by anti-terror resistance groups as ""open aggression"" on the country's sovereignty and a ""blatant violation"" of bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding.
""Iraq's sovereignty and the blood of its nation constitute a red line that cannot be crossed,"" the legislature said in a statement.
Iraq adopted the law to expel foreign forces after Washington's assassination of top Iraqi and Iranian anti-terror commanders four years ago.
General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), were martyred along with their comrades in a US drone strike that was authorized by then-president Donald Trump near Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020.
The two iconic anti-terror commanders are greatly admired for their instrumental role in fighting and decimating the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region, particularly in Iraq and Syria."

Amid rituals conducted by Hindu priests, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened a grand temple built in the northern town of Ayodhya in honor of one of Hinduism's most revered gods, Lord Rama.
The ornate, pink sandstone temple has risen on the site of a 16th century, Mughal-era mosque that was destroyed by Hindu mobs three decades ago.
""Our god Ram has come. Centuries of sacrifice and patience has paid off,"" Modi told a massive crowd after the black stone idol of Lord Ram was unveiled. He said that January 22 ""brings the dawn of a new era.""
The inauguration of the flower-bedecked Ram Mandir that sprawls over three hectares fulfils a pledge by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which led a decades-long movement to build the temple on the site of the mosque, which Hindus believe was built on the ruins of a temple that marked the birthplace of Lord Ram.
But for many Muslims, the temple is a reminder of the destruction of the mosque.
In December 1992, a huge mob of Hindu right-wing activists used hammers, axes and bare hands to demolish the mosque, sparking nationwide religious riots that killed nearly 2,000 people. It was the worst communal violence witnessed in India since its independence.
The religious event was showcased as one of historic and national importance in the Hindu majority country.
Among the more than 7,000 people who witnessed the ceremony, telecast on a giant screen outside the temple in the small town, were top politicians, billionaire tycoons and Bollywood stars. Air force helicopters showered flowers on the temple. The federal government declared a half day holiday.
In Ayodhya devotees beat drums and danced as loudspeakers played devotional songs. In cities, towns and villages, where excitement had been building for weeks, many lit earthen lamps as they heeded calls by Modi to celebrate the day like the biggest Hindu festival, Diwali. Saffron flags depicting Lord Ram fluttered outside many homes and shops. Millions watched the telecast of the ceremony in their homes.
However, some leading Hindu religious seers declined to attend, saying that it was against Hinduism to perform rituals in the temple since part of its construction has still to be completed.
Most opposition parties also stayed away, accusing the Prime Minister of using the temple's inauguration for political gain. Congress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, called it a ""completely political Narendra Modi function.""
Ahead of the temple's consecration, Modi embarked on an 11-day Hindu purification ritual that included fasting and visiting temples across the country. He presided over the religious ceremony.
Critics have accused Modi of blurring lines between religion and the state in the country with a secular constitution.
""The temple is being promoted by Modi as a highpoint in India's civilizational history,"" according to political analyst Rasheed Kidwai. ""The BJP makes no pretensions that the religious concerns of the majority Hindu community are on top of their political agenda.""
In the 1990's, the campaign to build the temple stirred up Hindu nationalism and catapulted the BJP, which until then was a marginal political party, into a dominant political force.
The mood was upbeat among many Hindus as the $217 million temple opened. Many said that seeing the 1.3 meter tall black stone sculpture of Lord Ram being unveiled in the temple was an emotional moment. ""I am really happy. It is a matter of faith for me,"" said Nitin Kumar in New Delhi.
The ornate temple, which stretches across a 28-hectare complex, has risen on a religious site that marked one of the most bitter disputes between Hindus and Muslims, who make up India's largest minority.
""Very systematically, Babri Masjid has been taken away from Indian Muslims. Had the Masjid not been demolished in 1992, we wouldn't have to see things how they are today,"" Asaduddin Owaisi, head of the Muslim party All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, and a member of parliament said Saturday.
Following a decades-long court battle over the site's ownership between Hindu and Muslim groups, the Supreme Court granted the site to Hindus in 2019 even as it called the mosque's destruction ""an egregious violation of the rule of law."" A year later, Modi laid the foundation stone of the temple.
The BJP and right-wing Hindu groups are portraying the rise of the temple as a moment of Hindu awakening following centuries of domination by Muslim and colonial powers, say analysts.
""After decades of fight and struggle, this is being presented as a victory, a victory ceremony with Modi as the head of it,"" according to author and political analyst, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, who called the temple a symbol of the ""politics of revenge and triumph.""
The spotlight on the grand new temple, ahead of national elections that are expected to begin in April, is likely to give momentum to the party's campaign. Modi rose to power in 2014 on the pledge of development, but he has also pushed what some commentators call a ""Hindu first"" agenda during his two terms in office.
""The fact that Modi has been in power for ten years could have led to some dip in support. That deficit could be bridged or topped-up with the inauguration of the temple, especially in North India, where the party has a strong support base,"" according to political analyst, Sandeep Shastri.
Critics have raised questions whether the prime minister's high-profile participation in a religious ceremony undermined the multicultural ethos on which India was founded.
""The BJP calls this a moment of national rejuvenation. But this rejuvenation is going to be singular in character, not reflecting the pluralistic nature of Indian society and the Indian state's commitment to it when we became independent,"" according to Mukhopadhyay."

January 23, 2024  13:30  The Kremlin, Moscow
The project to build Egypt's first nuclear power plant is being implemented by Rosatom State Corporation in accordance with the Russian-Egyptian Intergovernmental Agreement of 2015. Four power units with a total capacity of 4,800 megawatts are expected to be built.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends.
I would like to warmly welcome you and all the participants in today's ceremony for pouring the first concrete into the foundation of the fourth power unit of the El-Dabaa nuclear power plant.
In fact, this is the beginning of a new stage in the construction of the first nuclear power plant in Egypt, a project of major importance for Russian-Egyptian relations, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the development of the Egyptian economy and help strengthen its energy base.
We will contribute to the creation of modern production facilities, skilled jobs, and the resolution of social issues. We will do this together because the new energy system allows us to do all this. This is truly a flagship project in the best traditions of our bilateral cooperation.
Let me remind you that in the second half of the last century, Soviet specialists played a very active role in restoring Egypt's economy and improving its defence capability, and helped build large industrial and energy facilities, such as the Aswan Dam.
Many jointly created enterprises are still operating successfully and continue to bring tangible benefits to the people of Egypt. The multifaceted and mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries continues to develop consistently. It is true that Egypt is our close friend and strategic partner. Our interaction is based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and consideration of each other's interests, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Strategic Cooperation, which we signed with Mr el-Sisi in 2018 in Sochi.
Bilateral trade is growing actively and has increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of 2023. Major joint projects are being implemented, including in the fuel and energy sector, agriculture, and food cooperation. Work is underway to create a Russian industrial zone in the Suez Canal region.
New promising opportunities for boosting our fruitful cooperation are emerging in connection with Egypt's membership in BRICS. I want to emphasise that from the very beginning, Russia sincerely supported the Egyptian party's desire to become a full member of this association. During Russia's BRICS chairmanship this year, we will do our best to help Egypt in joining the organisation's work in the most efficient way.
We plan to hold over 200 BRICS events and we hope that Egyptian representatives will take an active part in them. And, of course, we look forward to your presence, Mr el-Sisi, at the BRICS summit in Kazan this October.
I must say that the El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant project was launched with mine and the President of Egypt's direct participation. Mr Minister just informed us about it.
I clearly recall that the document on the enactment of the contract for the construction of the power plant was signed during my visit to Egypt in December 2017. We have been monitoring the implementation of this contract together since then.
Overall, there is regular contact with Mr el-Sisi. Last year, we met during the second Russia-Africa Summit. We regularly discuss all issues on the international and regional agendas that are of importance to our countries. In particular, we exchange views and coordinate our positions regarding the tragic developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and we also address humanitarian issues.
As for nuclear power generation, I would like to say that Rosatom is building four power units with an aggregate capacity of 4,800 megawatts at the nuclear power plant in Egypt. This was already mentioned. The Generation III+ reactor units can produce up to 37 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, or about 10 percent of the country's electricity consumption. Unlike coal and gas power stations, nuclear power plants will not emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which will certainly have a beneficial effect on the environment and people's health.
Rosatom is a trusted leader in the field of nuclear power generation. They use the most advanced engineering solutions and economically effective and reliable technologies in the construction of nuclear power plants. At the same time, it strictly complies with Russian safety standards, IAEA standards and regulations and the strictest environmental requirements.
I would also like to mention the coordinated work of Russian and Egyptian engineers and workers at the El-Dabaa construction site. Thanks to their efforts, the construction of the power units is proceeding in accordance with the approved timeframe and solutions are being found to the most complicated engineering, assembly, and technical issues. Over 16,000 people work at the project every day, the majority of them Egyptians who are working side by side with Russian personnel.
Moreover, the implementation of a considerable number of contracts that are vital for the future nuclear power plant has been localised in Egypt, which offers great opportunities for involving Egyptian businesses in the project.
Incidentally, Russia is training highly skilled industry personnel for Egypt within the framework of cooperation under the El-Dabaa project, as a Rosatom representative, the company's head, has said. Over 90 Egyptian students have received education in nuclear engineering at our universities, and another 150 Egyptian students are now studying there. In other words, we are providing assistance to our Egyptian friends in all spheres of the nuclear project life cycle, including our obligations for long-term supply of nuclear fuel, technical maintenance of the nuclear power plant, and spent nuclear fuel handling. We are doing everything possible to help develop a fundamentally new industry - nuclear power engineering - in Egypt.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all the Russian and Egyptian participants in the project for their selfless and dedicated work and to wish them all the best.
Thank you for your attention.
President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (retranslated): In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful!
Mr President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin,
Ladies and gentlemen,
First, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for and joy over the noble participation of my dear friend, His Excellency President Vladimir Putin in this ceremony to mark the pouring of the first concrete into the foundation for the fourth power unit at the El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant; this means that the Republic of Egypt can start the main stage of construction of all power units.
I would also like to thank all those present at the ceremony.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am delighted and proud to share this historical moment with you, an event that will go down in the history and memory of our people as evidence of the undaunted resolve of our great people, whose determination and efforts have been creating our history over many centuries. Today, they are writing a new page in our history by realising the dream of all the Egyptians to have peaceful nuclear power plants and reaffirming their resolve to continue on the path of development and construction towards Egypt's bright future.
The great event that we are witnessing today represents a bright new page in the close cooperation between Egypt and the Russian Federation. This latest achievement has been added to the long history of achievements in Egyptian-Russian cooperation. It reflects the scale of both sides' efforts to work towards implementing Egypt's national project to build the El-Dabaa NPP. This project is moving faster than the agreed-upon schedule; it is overcoming the time restrictions and other difficulties. This reflects the fact that the Egyptian state attaches great significance to the energy sector, and that it believes in its vitally important role as the main driving force of economic growth and as a pillar of economic and social development in accordance with the Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS): Egypt Vision 2030.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The current crisis in global energy confirms the significance of the Egyptian state's strategic long-term policy on reinstating the national peaceful nuclear programme because it facilitates a safe, affordable, and long-term power supply and helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels and prevent price fluctuations.
Adding nuclear power to the energy balance on which Egypt relies for power-generation purposes has vital significance for meeting specific demands. It meets Egypt's demand for electricity needed to implement economic and social development plans. It also helps expand the use of new and renewable energy sources for attaining environmental sustainability and combating climate change.
In conclusion, I would like to thank His Excellency President Putin once again for taking part in this event. I would also like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to the staff of the Russian general contractor Atomstroyexport and the Nuclear Power Plants Authority of Egypt which oversee the implementation of this great national project. I wish you good luck in the upcoming stages of the project. Thank you very much.
Before I finish, I would like to address my brother, President Putin. I would like to express my deep gratitude regarding your support for this project. Owing to your personal support, I believe that we have been achieving major successes in implementing this project from December 2017 to this day. Thank you very much.
I would like to thank everyone.
May the peace of Allah descend on you and His mercy and blessings."

At the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs of Kenya Musalia Mudavadi will pay an official visit to China from January 24 to 26.
CCTV: We noted that the 19th Non-Aligned Movement Summit and the Third South Summit were held in Uganda a few days ago. Vice Premier of the State Council Liu Guozhong attended the summits. During the summits, representatives from many countries spoke highly of the Global Development Initiative and called on members of the Non-Aligned Movement to enhance solidarity and cooperation in international affairs and safeguard multilateralism and the common interests of Global South countries. Can you share more about Vice Premier Liu's visit?
Wang Wenbin: From January 19 to 21, President Xi Jinping's Special Representative, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Liu Guozhong attended the 19th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit and the Third South Summit in Kampala, Uganda and delivered remarks.
Vice Premier Liu Guozhong noted that the NAM, born at the climax of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America, has effectively advanced the cause of world peace and human progress. It is important that it remains committed to its strength of character in defending independence and opposing power politics, carries forward the spirit of seeking common ground while shelving differences and peaceful coexistence, takes on the common mission of seeking strength through solidarity and striving for common development, and champions the values of equality, fairness and justice.
Vice Premier Liu Guozhong pointed out that this year marks the 60th anniversary of the G77. Over the past six decades, Global South countries have found a right path of equality, mutual trust, mutual benefit, solidarity and mutual help. Independence is the defining political feature of Global South countries; seeking strength through solidarity is their proud tradition; development and revitalization are their historical mission; and fairness and justice are their common aspirations. At the moment, amid transformations of the world unseen in a century, Global South countries are faced with a complex international environment. We need to continue our endeavour under the new circumstances to explore the path to modernization, promote higher-level South-South cooperation, actively take part in the reform of the global governance system, and deepen the global partnership for development that is united, equal, balanced and beneficial to all.
Vice Premier Liu Guozhong stressed that China has invariably stood in solidarity with fellow developing countries through thick and thin. We are ready to work with other developing countries, under the guidance of building a community with a shared future for mankind, to implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, uphold the common values of mankind, advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and bring the world to a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress.
As the biggest developing country, a partner of the NAM and a member of the Global South, China will always stand on the side of fellow developing countries, especially medium-sized and smaller countries, and contribute to the common development of the Global South.
Xinhua News Agency: Today, China's State Council Information Office released a white paper titled ""China's Legal Framework and Measures for Counterterrorism."" Can you share more information?
Wang Wenbin: China has long faced the threat of terrorism and suffered from its scourge. Over the years, China has taken stock of the underlying dynamics, characteristics and practices of its own counterterrorism efforts and drawn on the useful experience of other countries. By doing so, China has adopted a counterterrorism approach rooted in China's realities and built on a sound legal footing, which has helped keep the nation, the public and people's lives and property secure and contributed to global and regional security and stability. The white paper you mentioned outlines China's legal framework and measures for counterterrorism in a comprehensive and systematic way, including the criteria for illegal and criminal terrorist activities and principles for their punishment, and the legal provisions and principles for the system on standardizing the exercise of power and protecting human rights in fighting terrorism. This reflects the value and basic principle of both effectively preventing and punishing terrorist activities, and earnestly respecting and protecting human rights, which shows the compatibility between the guiding principles for China's rule of law and international counterterrorism principles.
Terrorism is humanity's common enemy, which seriously threatens international peace and security. China stands ready to strengthen cooperation on counterterrorism with all countries, work together to combat all forms of terrorism, actively participate in the global governance on counterterrorism, draw on each other's experience and engage in exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality and respect, so as to promote healthy global counterterrorism endeavors and safeguard international and regional peace and stability.
Reuters: Geneva-based diplomats said that China is lobbying diplomats from other countries in Geneva to praise its human rights record. What's China's comment?
Wang Wenbin: The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is an important platform under the UN framework for countries to carry out equal-footed, candid exchanges and constructive dialogue and cooperation on human rights issues. China holds a people-centered human rights philosophy and believes that a happy life for the people is the most important human right. We have found a path toward better human rights that follows the trend of the times and fits our national realities. We have made historic progress in our human rights cause and the people are enjoying a greater sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security. The Chinese government attaches high importance to this round of UPR and will participate in the review with an open, candid attitude and communicate with all parties for mutual learning and joint progress. We hope that all parties will follow the UPR mechanism's principle of being constructive and non-politicized in their participation of the review.â
On your question, I want to stress that China always undergoes the UPR in strict accordance with the rules and procedures of the UN Human Rights Council.
News 1 Korea: The UK has provided satellite photographs of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia to a panel of UN experts as part of an attempt to trigger an official investigation into arms deals in violation of international sanctions.

Wang Wenbin: China welcomes the good progress that Iran and Pakistan have made in repairing their ties and supports them in further enhancing mutual trust and deepening cooperation through friendly consultation. We stand ready to work with Iran and Pakistan to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation and safeguard regional peace, stability and development."
ZUWM68JEHG_DII7ND3BBNUAHPR,'High-risk mission' delivers fuel to Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza,_,_,20240125,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240123-unnews04.htm,"23 January 2024 - The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners have delivered 19,000 litres of fuel to Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, the UN agency said late on Tuesday.
The ""high-risk mission"", carried out the previous day, was marked by delays at the checkpoint and severely damaged roads. Thousands of hungry civilians also surrounded the UN vehicles and fuel truck in a desperate search for food and water, further delaying the journey.
The team reported that functionality at the hospital has improved since the last humanitarian mission 10 days ago, with a significant decrease in the number of displaced people sheltering there - from 40,000 to 10,000.
Some services operational
Al-Shifa has 120 health care workers and 300 patients. Between five to 10 surgeries are conducted daily, mainly trauma cases that require immediate care.
Such essential services as basic laboratory and radiological facilities remain operational, along with emergency care, a surgical unit with three operation theatres, post-operative care and a dialysis unit. Plans are underway to re-open a nine-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in the coming days.
However, there are no maternity or pediatric services, and shortages of specialized doctors, medicines and medical supplies such as orthopedic equipment.
""These units could become operational again, but will require a consistent supply of fuel, oxygen, medical supplies and other aid,"" WHO said. Furthermore, the  primary oxygen plant was destroyed, and the hospital is now relying on a smaller plant.
Healthcare under fire
WHO continues to draw attention to the dire state of the healthcare system in Gaza, where 14 out of 36 hospitals remain partially functional after nearly four months of conflict.
Intensified military presence and hostilities in the south are severely obstructing the movement of health workers, ambulances and UN partners as well as their ability to resupply hospitals. Agency staff said the situation for hospitals in the city of Khan Younis is ""catastrophic and indescribable"".
WHO also expressed extreme concern over reports of Al-Kheir Hospital, a small NGO-run facility, facing military incursions and several health workers being detained. Communication with the hospital is no longer possible.
Staff digging graves
Due to evacuation orders in neighbourhoods surrounding Nasser Medical Complex - the largest hospital in the south - as well as continuous hostilities in its vicinity, large numbers of wounded people are on the hospital grounds, according to Gazan health authorities.
""UK Med, an international emergency medical team deployed at Nasser, says that no one can enter or exit the facility due to ongoing bombardment close by,"" the UN health agency said.
""Health staff are reported to be digging graves on hospital grounds due to the large numbers of deaths anticipated and the need to manage dead bodies. This horrifying situation should never take place in any hospital.""
WHO warned that Al-Amal Hospital is at risk of becoming non-functional, as ambulances and injured patients reportedly cannot access the facility.
The UN agency reiterated its calls for an immediate ceasefire, protection of civilians and healthcare and sustained access for the delivery of critical aid across the Gaza Strip."

January 23, 2024 - Montreal, Quebec - National Defence / Canadian Armed Forces
Today, the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence, participated virtually in the 18th   Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, hosted by United States   Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. The meeting brought together   representatives from more than 50 countries, who reaffirmed their   commitment to providing Ukraine with the critical military support it   needs.
At the meeting, Minister Blair announced a new donation of 10   Multirole Boats from Zodiac Hurricane Technologies, valued at   approximately $20 million. These multi-engine Rigid Hull Inflatable   Boats (RHIBs) will assist Ukraine in various maritime operations   including search and rescue, troop and cargo transport, surveillance,   and reconnaissance. Each boat will come with a sophisticated sensor,   navigation, and communications system. This donation includes the   provision of commercially contracted training for Ukrainian operators,   as well as trailers and spare parts. The delivery of these boats with   training is expected to be completed by late-spring 2024.
The Minister further announced that starting next month, in support   of Canada's membership in the F-16 Training Coalition for the Armed   Forces of Ukraine (AFU), we will provide civilian instructors, planes,   and support staff contracted from Montreal-based Top Aces Inc. to   contribute to Denmark and France's training efforts. This support is   valued at approximately $15 million. Training will begin in February   2024 and will continue into 2025.
Canada is also providing English language training to Ukrainian Air   Force personnel at the Canadian Forces Language School. This work will   be an important contribution to the mission to equip and enable the AFU   with F-16 fighter jets.
Minister Blair also announced Canada's participation in two   capability coalitions that will report to the Ukraine Defense Contact   Group - namely, the armour coalition, and the air force coalition.
Finally, Minister Blair noted that more shipments of previously   announced donations arrived for the AFU, including NATO-standard small   arms and ammunition, as well as winter clothing and gear. There will be   more shipments of these items in the coming weeks.
The donations announced today demonstrate Canada's ongoing   commitments and contributions to supporting Ukraine in its fight against   Russia's illegal and unjustifiable war.
""For almost two years, Canada has remained in   close contact with Allies and partners through the Ukraine Defence   Contact Group meetings to best understand and help address Ukraine's   urgent and longer-term defence priorities. We continue to strengthen our   collaboration and coordination to provide Ukraine with the military aid   it needs to defend its sovereignty and security.""
The Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence
The UDCG was created by the US Secretary of   Defense in April 2022 to allow Allies and partners to synchronize   donations, consult, and coordinate military assistance to Ukraine, and   build the capabilities of the AFU. Convening monthly at the ministerial   level, the UDCG now brings together more than 50 countries.
Since February 2022, Canada has committed over   $2.4 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. This includes Leopard 2   main battle tanks, one armoured recovery vehicle, armoured combat   support vehicles, anti-tank weapons, small arms, M777 howitzers and   associated ammunition, high-resolution drone cameras, winter clothing,   and more. Canada is also contributing to multinational efforts to train   pilots and maintain and support Ukraine's F-16s.
Since the launch of Operation UNIFIER, Canada has   trained almost 40,000 members of the AFU. Canada will extend this   mission until March 2026, providing significant capacity for the   Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) to respond to Ukraine's urgent training   needs.
Canada continues to train AFU members under   Operation UNIFIER, with more than 300 CAF members deployed in various   roles such as the provision and coordination of training, national   command support, and the facilitation and delivery of military donations   to Ukraine in coordination with Allies.
Since late March 2022, the CAF has been assisting   with the delivery of military aid for Ukraine within Europe from Canada   and on behalf of our Allies and partners, transporting over 15 million   pounds of military donations to date."

Today, the militaries of the United States and United Kingdom, at the direction of their respective governments with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes against 8 Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the Houthis' continued attacks against international and commercial shipping as well as naval vessels transiting the Red Sea. These precision strikes are intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities that the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners, and are in response to a series of illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi actions since our coalition strikes on January 11, including anti-ship ballistic missile and unmanned aerial system attacks that struck two U.S.-owned merchant vessels.
Today's strike specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis' missile and air surveillance capabilities.
The Houthis' now more than thirty attacks on international and commercial vessels since mid-November constitute an international challenge. Recognizing the broad consensus of the international community, we again acted as part of a coalition of like-minded countries committed to upholding the rules-based order, protecting freedom of navigation and international commerce, and holding the Houthis accountable for their illegal and unjustifiable attacks on mariners and commercial shipping.
Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.
