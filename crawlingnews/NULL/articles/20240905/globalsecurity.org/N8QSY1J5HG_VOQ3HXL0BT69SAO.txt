The European Union has taken note of the visit of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin to Mongolia on 3 September despite the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant issued against him.
The EU regrets that Mongolia, a State Party to the Rome Statute of the ICC, did not comply with its obligations under the statute to execute the arrest warrant.
President Putin is under an arrest warrant by the ICC for international crimes, specifically alleged crimes of unlawful deportation and unlawful transfer of children from temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories in the context of his illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.
The EU expresses its strongest support for efforts to ensure full accountability for war crimes and the other most serious crimes in connection with Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. In this regard, the EU supports the investigations by the Prosecutor of the ICC in Ukraine and calls for full cooperation by all State Parties.
The EU reiterates its unwavering support to the ICC and for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.
