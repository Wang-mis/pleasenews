Lebanon's former central bank governor, Riad Salameh, was arrested in Beirut on Tuesday over financial crimes linked to a brokerage company, three judicial sources said, his first arrest after years of accusations.Salameh, 73, was the bank governor for 30 years but his final months were marred by charges of financial crimes including illicit enrichment through public funds by authorities in Lebanon and several other countries.One judicial source told Reuters the specific charges that led to his arrest on Tuesday were embezzlement, money-laundering and fraud as part of commissions earned through the central bank's dealings with Optimum Invest between 2015-2018, a Lebanese firm that offers income brokerage services.  Neither Salameh, his lawyer or Optimum responded to requests for comment. Salameh has previously denied any accusations of financial crimes.Tuesday's charges are separate from previous financial crimes with which he was charged linked to Forry Associates, a company controlled by Salameh's brother, Raja. The brothers were accused of using Forry to divert $330 million in public funds through commissions.

He will be held for four days as a "precautionary arrest" before the case is transferred to the Beirut public prosecutor, another judicial source said.Central Bank dealings amid Lebanon's financial collapseTwo of the judicial sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Salameh was arrested following a hearing at Lebanon's justice palace about the central bank's dealings with Optimum Invest. They said Optimum had dealt with Lebanon's central bank to buy and sell treasury bonds and certificates of deposit with quick turnovers to make major profits. Optimum's CEO Reine Abboud told Reuters by phone that the company had not been present at the hearing and heard about the arrest through local media.Abboud referred Reuters to a statement on Optimum's website that said a financial audit in late 2023 had found "no evidence of wrongdoing or illegality" in the company's dealings with the central bank. Lebanon's caretaker justice minister Henry Khoury told Reuters that he did not have details of the file."There is no doubt that the Public Prosecutor did what was required of him and interrogated former governor Riad Salameh," he said. Caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati told pan-Arab broadcaster Al-Hadath that the government will not intervene in the case.   Stay updated with the latest news!
