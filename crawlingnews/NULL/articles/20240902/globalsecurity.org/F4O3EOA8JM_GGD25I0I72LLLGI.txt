The EU condemns the dangerous actions by Chinese Coast Guard vessels against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea on August 31. The incident is the latest of several such actions during the past months, which endanger the safety of life at sea, and violate the right to freedom of navigation and overflight to which all nations are entitled under international law.
The EU insists that the UN Charter, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other relevant international norms relating to the safety of life at sea, as well as the Arbitration Award of 2016, should be upheld and respected at all times. This includes, in particular, the prohibition on the use of force or coercion, and the right to freedom of navigation and overflight.
The EU condemns all unlawful, escalatory and coercive actions that undermine these principles of international law and threaten peace and stability in the region.
The European Union calls for de-escalation of tensions, and remains committed to supporting its partners seeking to exercise their legitimate rights, in the region and beyond.
