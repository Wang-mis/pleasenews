01MF4WS2P3_VZ6NKOL5A05SN07,Expert warns of major heating mistake as Brits overlook important house feature,Danielle Kate WroeLifestyle Writer,"11:10, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/expert-warns-major-heating-mistake-31937084,"As Britain is battered by Storm Isha causing havoc, there are a few things you can do to make sure your home stays warm during the miserable weather.
You'd like to think your home is insulated and energy efficient when you put the heating on, but experts have urged homeowners to make sure they don't make some expensive mistakes. With bills already sky-high, it's clear no one wants to be wasting any more money.
If you notice draughts in your home, expert Aiden Johnson-Hugill from Admiral has explained how to avoid unintentional cracks and gaps in your home to prevent feeling the chilly draughts - and warned it can happen in any home of any age.
Some householders are confusing draughts, with ventilation spaces. But if your house is not properly ventilated, it can be a serious problem and can cause condensation and mould to become an issue - two things you certainly want to avoid. Aidan said: ""Working out where to make your home more energy efficient can be as simple as using your common sense: can you feel warm air escaping anywhere or cold air getting in where it shouldn't?
""Don't confuse draughts with ventilation (such as fans or the little vents in your window frames) - draughts are unintentional and not part of how your house was designed to work. Letter boxes and sash windows are both famous for draughts, so well-made snug fittings are what you need.""
He said that if you ""feel a draught"", the first thing you should do is ""work out where it's coming from."" He continued: ""If your door opens straight into the front room, consider using a draught excluder, and fit them to your windows too. They're a great cost-effective way of preserving heat and excluding draughts.""
Other tips that he recommended are blocking the log burner if you have one, filling gaps between floorboards, adding insulation, and using renewable energy. Aiden said these steps will make you feel ""more comfortable in your home.""
Meanwhile, one savvy woman, called the Duchess of Thrift, also shared her top tips to stay warm in the morning without putting the central heating on.
One of her top tips was putting the electric blanket on to the hottest setting, and waiting until you're so hot you need to get out of bed. She also recommended putting clothes in the bed with the electric blanket on so they can warm up too.

05HW18Q0DV_0L8MCITK56U7VUD,Kate Garraway seen for first time since Derek Draper's death as puts on a brave face with friend,Zara WoodcockShowbiz Reporter,"16:37, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kate-garraway-seen-first-time-31977750,"Kate Garraway put on a brave face while out with a friend as she was pictured for the first time since her husband Derek Draper died.
Derek sadly passed away on January 5 at the age of 56, nearly four years after falling ill with Covid. He was struck down with the coronavirus shortly after the UK went into the first lockdown and was one of the worst affected patients in the world. He was in a coma for almost three months and was left unable to speak.
The psychologist and author remained in the hospital for more than a year and was finally allowed home in April 2021 but required round-the-clock care. In November last year, Kate flew Derek to Mexico to undergo a new treatment in hopes it would help his condition. However, he suffered a heart attack while there. Kate flew him back to the UK where he was treated in an intensive care unit but sadly passed away due to complications.
Several weeks since his death, Kate was seen meeting up with a friend ahead of his funeral in north London next Friday. In the pictures shared with The Sun, she was wrapped up in a pink coat, a blue-and-pink striped scarf and a cream-coloured beanie. She also donned flared blue jeans and white Doc Martens for the chilly occasion.
The Good Morning Britain star hugged her friend before they continued on their way. Following his death, Kate released a statement that was read out by her co-star Susanna Reid. The statement said: ""Hello everyone, thank you so much for all the wonderful messages you have sent me. It really does mean so much to me, Darcy, Billy and all of Derek's family. They are an extraordinary comfort and I am so lucky to feel connected to you all through these messages at this time when the raw pain of grief can be so isolating.
""And that is a wonderful thing about our Good Morning Britain family. All of us on the team and all of you watching from home are connected through the challenges of life, but also of the laugh at the fun and joy we share together. I am certain that it is the support that you have given me and sent to Derek that has sustained us through these tough nearly four years, motivating us to fight on for each other and for those who can't fight for themselves.
""It will sustain us to continue that fight in the weeks, months and years to come. I look forward to waking up with you very soon again on Good Morning Britain to celebrate life in all its wonder and challenge again. I hope you forgive me for taking some time to be at home. Family is so important and I'm grateful we could be with Derek in his final moments, something not all get to share...
""We are taking time to heal ourselves now that Darcy and Billy know their daddy is at peace and free from pain and struggle. I shall be thinking of you all until we're reunited. In the meantime, hug your loved ones. All my love, Kate.""

07MD7HUVT1_BTKU0TFG5QWCJ26,'I get fat-shamed on flights and people refuse to sit next to me - it's their problem',Danielle Kate WroeLifestyle Writer,"09:04, 24 Jan 2024Updated09:43, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/i-fat-shamed-flights-people-31952956,"Travel should be accessible for everyone, but unfortunately, many plus-size people may have struggled to navigate the world of flying and travelling - and Kirsty Leanne hopes to be the guiding light for these people.
But it's not been an easy journey for Kirsty, as she's shared she gets fat-shamed on flights and has had people refuse to sit next to her, just for the fact she inhabits a bigger body.
Kirsty shares travel advice online for larger-bodied people, but she has faced criticism for being plus-size, with some rudely suggesting she should just lose weight, rather than promoting travelling as a plus-sized person.
Kirsty, who posts online as @kirstyleannetravels has also had people behave cruelly in real life, including on a flight to Spain. While she travelling in a window seat, a woman sat in the middle seat made no secret of the fact she wasn't pleased.
""When she saw me sat in the window, she instantly made it clear she didn't want to sit there and started huffing and puffing"", Kirsty, who shares her tips on her blog, Plus Size Travel Too, said.
""I apologised that there wasn't much room and she didn't reply, so I did my usual and squashed myself against the window. For the whole flight, she was pushing the armrest as far down as she could - it was 98% down but that last 2% was super painful - and causing me to bruise.
""Eventually, she turned to her friend a few rows back [and said] 'I can't sit next to her anymore'. I pretended I didn't hear but I wanted the ground to swallow me up.""
But now Kirsty has promised herself in future situations, she will no longer let people's mean comments slide. ""I tend to ask flight attendants if I can move to a seat with more room and an extra seat next to it now, to help prevent this from happening and to ensure everyone is as comfortable as they can be"", she shared.
""Often I do have to sit next to people while they find me a seat so I do my best to be kind and understanding, in the hopes they return with the same sentiments.""
The traveller also says she can often tell when someone isn't pleased to be seated near her because they ""usually make it known."" She said: ""Most people are super friendly and understanding, but some people use it as an excuse to be mean and to lash out. While I understand it's uncomfortable, acting in that way is unnecessary and likely to be the worst way to come to a solution.""
On her videos, she often gets a mixed reaction, with some praising her saying: ""You shouldn't have to apologise for existing"", and: ""For those saying it's her fault - EVEN IF IT WAS - what is she meant to do in that very moment? Making her feel worthless doesn't get you more space.""
Some disagreed, however, with one writing: ""I get what you're saying but the seats aren't 'a little small'. I'm failing to see how this isn't your fault.""

08KDXV0K22_0RMIZS9QE3X6WOU,Family who lost both parents in one year left 'in shock' at verdict of their dad's killer,Ann Cusack,"14:34, 25 Jan 2024Updated14:44, 25 Jan 2024",20230125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/family-who-lost-both-parents-31965294,"A woman who lost both her parents in the space of a year has told of her shock and confusion at the sentencing of her dad's killer - after his jail term was reduced twice.
Jonathan Langston, 52, was killed instantly when reckless driver Adeel Safdar, 28, drove into him while driving at excessive speeds in Chorlton, Manchester, last year. Safdar was driving at 93mph in a 30mph zone. Just a year prior, Mr Langston's wife Helene died from bowel cancer, aged 49. The couple left behind four children, and their funerals were held on the same date, a year apart.
Safdar pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to eight years in prison. In court, he was ordered to serve two-thirds of his sentence in jail, equating to around five years and four months.
Mr Langston's daughter, 21-year-old Ella said: ""We were all in court, and we read statements, for Dad. But when the judge announced his sentencing, we couldn’t believe what we were hearing. It was so confusing. The sentence was reduced and reduced again, until he arrived at five years and four months in prison. We were in shock. It was such an anti-climax. Now it’s sinking in, I feel so angry. It absolutely does not reflect the enormity of the loss of my dad. The punishment is not fair. It is no deterrent to other dangerous drivers either.""
Judge Nicholas Dean KC, the Honorary Recorder of Manchester, said he arrived at the eight-year-long sentence after finding the case was in the most serious category of the sentencing guidelines - which gave it a starting point of 14 years in prison if Safdar pursued the case to trial.
Safdar's sentence was first reduced to 12 years for his remorse and ‘good character’, before it was reduced again by a third to reflect the fact he had pleaded guilty at the very start. Ella added: “I feel so angry about the sentence. It’s no punishment for taking away my dad’s life and it is certainly no deterrent to others. I cannot imagine how anyone can drive at more than three times the speed limit and not expect it to end in tragedy.”
Ella said she hopes her father's story may discourage others from speeding. She said: “When mum was having chemotherapy, she’d spend a lot of time in bed, and the speeding drivers outside kept her awake. She used to say they were driving far too fast. It’s a tragic irony that just one year after losing her, one of those speeding drivers killed our father too. We were heartbroken after losing Mum, but Dad really rallied round. He gave up smoking and he did all he could to help us through our grief. He was just starting to find a bit of happiness again when his life was so cruelly snatched away.""
Ella, along with her three siblings, grew up in Chorlton where mum Helene worked as a primary school teacher, while Jonathan worked in IT and ran after school care. Ella said: “The after-school club at my sister’s school folded and so Dad stepped in to take it over. That was the sort of person he was, always full of ideas, ambition and energy. He was really sociable and had lots of friends. Mum loved her work as a teacher, she was involved in the local church and did a lot of volunteering. We had many happy holidays in France and my parents had hoped to move over there.”
Helene became ill with suspected Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in 2019, but tests revealed she had stage four bowel cancer. The mum underwent chemotherapy treatment and surgery while the family rallied around to take care of her. Ella said: “We all had different roles, to help out. I did a lot of the cooking. Mum used to say she hated listening to drivers tearing up and down the roads near our home, she worried people would get hurt.”
Helene passed away aged 49 in March 2022. Her funeral was held at their local church, St John’s, on April 19, 2022. And a year after her Helene died, her dad was killed while crossing a road after enjoying drinks with friends in Chorlton. And when the crash took place, Ella was at university in Durham and was told the news by her brother, Paddy, now 18.
She said: “I was due to go home the next day for the Easter holidays, and I called Dad the night before and we were planning a Friday night curry. Instead I had to drive all the way back, through the early hours, knowing my dad was dead. My brother was on his own, aged 17, in the house. Our older sister, Georgia, came as quickly as she could too. We were all in shock. We could not believe we had lost both our parents, and in such appalling circumstances.
She continued: “Dad’s funeral was held exactly a year after Mum’s, April 19 2023, and at the same church. Dad’s death was entirely avoidable, which makes it very hard. The road where Dad died is a busy, residential area. It’s unthinkable that you would ever reach 90mph.
""If there were working speed cameras perhaps Safdar’s driving would have been picked up previously and Dad’s death might have been prevented. We have scattered Mum and Dad’s ashes at the place they loved in France and now we must somehow rebuild our lives without them. Georgia has returned to work, Paddy has started university.
""I’ve taken a year out of my studies, but I am determined to return next year. But it’s very hard, knowing Dad should be here with us. By sharing our story, we hope to encourage people to think twice about speeding unnecessarily in residential areas, so that other lives can be spared and tragedies such as ours can be avoided in the future."""
0DADZT9NQG_TKHJ89GKXZ6LX7Z,Meghan Markle 'broke royal protocol' and upset the Queen by ditching nude tights,Emma WilsonShowbiz Reporter,"11:11, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/meghan-markle-broke-royal-protocol-31936791,"Meghan Markle broke royal protocol numerous times over the years, but she faced disappointing the late Queen after ditching one bizarre tradition.
The former Suits actress was introduced to a dizzying world of decades-old traditions and unusual rules to live by when she married Prince Harry in a lavish ceremony in 2018, but she defiant Duchess of Sussex has not always abided by the rules. The spotlight was firmly on Meghan, and everything she said, did and wore was subjected to intense scrutiny, which made it easy for royal fans to spot when she broke protocol.
She previously spoke about the difficulties she faced when learning the traditions as a senior member of the monarchy, and in her and Harry’s Netflix docu-series, Meghan said there was “no class” to take to be told everything she needed to know. “There’s no class [where] some person goes, ‘Sit like this, cross your legs like this, use this fork, don’t do this, curtsy then, wear this kind of hat.’ It doesn’t happen. So I needed to learn a lot,” she admitted, dubbing it a “baptism of fire”.
Here, we take a look at five times the mother-of-two broke royal protocol…

Meghan defied the Queen over ‘nude tights’ rule
Since becoming engaged to Harry in 2017, the Duchess of Sussex has always opted to show off her bare legs, while other members of the Royal Family, including Kate Middleton and the late Queen, are wearing nude coloured stockings. Royal expert Victoria Arbiter claimed that the Queen had one rule when it came to dressing for public appearances, and that was nude tights. “I would say that's really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires,” she told Insider.
Wearing black to royal engagements
Dressing in black as a royal only occurs when there has been a death in the family, and can also be worn for evening black-tie dinners. But under no circumstances can black be work by a member of the Royal Family to public engagements - and this was yet another rule Meghan broke shortly after she and Harry tied the knot. She attended the WellChild Awards in 2018 and wore an all-black outfit, which many royal experts have claimed was a purposeful wardrobe choice.
“Whilst black has many different traits, looking at these specific events she attended they all have one thing in common,” colour psychologist Karen Haller told Fabulous. “The occasions when she is choosing to wear black suggest she isn’t seeking to be the centre of attention. She is OK with being in the background.”
Meghan and Harry got married on a weekend
While millions of people tie the knot on a weekend, members of the Royal Family are expected to marry during the week, thanks to a decades-old tradition. Prince William and Kate Middleton tied the knot on a Friday in 2011, while the Queen exchanged vows with Prince Philip on a Thursday in 1947, with her parents - King George VI and The Queen Mother - marrying on a Thursday in 1923.
It’s believed that the decision to marry on a weekday is so the scheduled hours of church worship aren’t disrupted, but despite this ‘rule’, Harry and Meghan decided to wed at St George’s Chapel in Windsor on a Saturday, delighting royal fans who were able to line the streets to see the happy couple.
Meghan avoided infamous hospital photo op
It’s a long-held tradition that female members of the Royal Family pose on the steps of the hospital with their newborn baby for waiting photographers and fans, just hours after giving birth. Princess Diana did this with both Prince William and Prince Harry in the 1980s, and Kate Middleton did the same after giving birth to Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.
However, when Meghan welcomed Prince Archie into the world in 2019, she opted to skip the traditional photocall outside the hospital, and shared privately posed photos instead. The couple only made their first appearance with their son at his christening, and when they welcomed Princess Lilibet into their family, they simply released a photo of her in a Christmas card.
Prince Archie’s private christening
Meghan and Harry invited just 25 guests to their son’s christening, with members of the press - including photographers - snubbed from the event. They chose to have a more intimate and private ceremony, and later released photographs of the christening to the press.
However, Meghan broke royal protocol again with her choice of outfit. Traditionally, senior female members of the monarchy have chosen to wear Alexander McQueen, but Meghan opted for a gown from French fashion house Dior.

Earlier this week, Australian swimwear brand Moana Bikini - which prides itself on inclusivity - sparked backlash after posting a male model donning one of its one-piece bikinis.
The video attracted a whopping 2,252 comments (compared to just 13 comments on the prior post) as offended users threatened to unfollow the account. One person even branded the post as 'devil evil worshipping' whilst another said it is 'ridiculous' for 'boys that keep trying to be a woman'.
Moana Bikini stood firmly behind the campaign, arguing: ""If Jake in our bikini upsets you that much we feel as though this may be a you problem."" Many shoppers agreed with the statement, with one person commenting: ""These comments are weird. The bathing suits are for anyone who wants to wear them. Why does someone in a bathing suit bother you so much lol?""
Another added: ""The trans/homophobia in this comment section is very much not passing the vibe check."" Now, model Jake Young has responded to the trolls
“There are many different types of women. Women with different anatomy to what you consider ‘normal’,"" he wrote. “I am not a woman nor have I ever claimed to be. This post is simply empowering a minority and I’m forever grateful for that.
“Your hate is a reflection of your own insecurities, not mine.” On his Instagram, Young can often be seen wearing clothes less associated with men, such as dresses, skirts, crop tops, and bikinis.

Back in April 2023, he penned a candid post on his decision to play with his wardrobe. ""My whole life I have had to prove that I am something other than authentically myself,"" the caption read.
""In the past, it was for men, for friends and even my family. I have had to dig so deeply within myself to find strength because that’s all I could do to survive. So if I want to wear a set of underwear or choose to wear a dress because I look SICKENING. I will and I’ll continue this iconic behaviour till I’m in the ground, so enjoy.""

0FUG9OI34X_H6SLYMOOW6ZR6YA,Christian Brueckner: Madeleine McCann suspect faces new charges while awaiting trial,Matthew YoungNews Reporter,"21:41, 25 Jan 2024Updated06:50, 26 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/christian-brueckner-madeleine-mccann-suspect-31970317,"Madeleine McCann's prime suspect Christian Brueckner is facing new charges over alleged jibes made at prison guards.
The convicted German sex offender became linked to the Madeleine case two years ago after it emerged he had reportedly been driving around the Praia da Luz resort around the time the three-year-old went missing in 2007.
The 47-year-old is currently serving a prison sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman. Brueckner - who will stand trial next month over five more alleged sex crimes - is now said to have described two prison officials at Oldenburg JVA in Germany as “torturers”.
He had used the phrase in a complaint to prison authorities about the treatment he received at the jail. Wardens complained to prosecutors after governors dismissed his complaint, saying his language was insulting.
A third prison officer has since joined the complaint, saying Brueckner called him a ""son of a b***h"". The Oldenburg public prosecutor’s office has filed charges of insulting public officials during the performance of their duties.
Brueckner is due to be tried next month over five alleged sex crimes, three involving minors. They include three rapes, one of an Irish girl, Hazel Behan, who was just 20 when she was said to have been attacked during a four-hour ordeal in Portugal.
Two other rapes are understood to have been filmed at the small farmhouse he rented just outside Praia da Luz, where British youngster Madeleine McCann was snatched in May 2007. The victims were allegedly a young teenage girl and an elderly woman in her late 50s or 60s, both of whom were tied to a post in the living room.
He is also facing the sexual assault of a young German girl, 10, on a beach near Praia da Luz, a month before Madeleine went missing. Lawyers for Brueckner say prosecutors are wasting time and money on the lesser allegations of prison official abuse.
His lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said: “This accusation is really farcical. First of all, the term ‘torturer’ in the context of a criminal complaint by the accused should not be punishable under Section 193 of the Criminal Code. Anyone who criticises a state measure may also do so in an exaggerated manner.”
He added: “However, even if admissible, public prosecutors regularly dismiss trivial cases if the punishment to be imposed is not significantly significant compared to the punishment that can be expected for another crime. This regulation cannot be more relevant than in the Christian B. case.” He also called the charges “a massive waste of tax money.”
The Mirror contacted Friedrich Fuelscher for comment."

Romeo Smalley has been jailed after sexually assaulting the boy having posted two videos of him online while he was tied up and bound.
His barrister said it is a ""game that young people play"", but Smalley, 18 at the time of the offences, admitted his motivations were sexual. A judge said it was clear that he was ""sexually aroused"" in one of the clips.
In one video, Smalley asked viewers to ""please like and subscribe"". The headteacher at the boy's school contacted the police after he was recognised online, Manchester Crown Court heard.
The two videos lasted a little over six minutes and just over five minutes. In one the boy was tied up with tape and was seen trying to escape. Smalley, now 20, had an interest in ""restraint"" and ""bondage"", prosecutor Peter Wilson said.
Officers found ""other videos of concern"", which he was not prosecuted for, Mr Wilson added. Smalley said he was ""aroused by the thought of people being tied up"", rather than being interested in children sexually. Smalley, from Oldham, gave the boy a mobile phone so they could message each other on Snapchat.
In one video he said he would be paid money if he completed the ""activity"", reported the Manchester Evening News. The boy said he ""didn't like"" being tied up. He was told not to tell his parents, the court heard. Smalley was arrested and denied sexually assaulting him. He claimed it was the boy's idea to film the videos and that the child had suggested posting them on YouTube ""for a laugh"".
The boy said Smalley ""never did anything funny"". Judge Tom Gilbart told Smalley: ""What you did was very serious. You have taken advantage of a much younger person. You sexually assaulted him on two occasions. There was evidence of grooming and manipulation in what you did.""
The boy's mother said the crime had affected him ""hugely"". She said: ""Romeo was devious in how he did this. He [the victim] thought it was him that had done something wrong."" Defending, Howard Bernstein claimed it was part of a ""game"".
He said: ""This was a game that young people play."" He said Smalley's sexual motivation ""raised it from an innocuous game to a sexual offence"". Mr Bernstein said Smalley, who has no previous convictions, has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and is ""lacking in maturity"". He said Smalley has been in custody for the past eight months.
""He has been bullied in prison, he is finding prison extremely difficult,"" he said. Smalley pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault of a child under the age of 13. He was sentenced to three years and three months in prison, and ordered to sign the sex offender register for life."

Donald Trump came out with 54.5 per cent of the votes in New Hampshire, gaining 11 delegates, while his now sole competitor Nikki Haley took 43.2 per cent of the votes, gaining eight delegates. It comes after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis decided to withdraw from the race, instead opting to endorse Trump for the Republican presidential candidate.
On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden came out on top as a write-in candidate. The latest results make a rematch in November between Trump and Biden more likely, with Biden even admitting the New Hampshire results make it clear he will face off against his 2020 rival once more.

""My message to the country is the stakes could not be higher,"" warned Biden. ""Our Democracy. Our personal freedoms - from the right to choose to the right to vote. Our economy - which has seen the strongest recovery in the world since COVID. Are all at stake.""
But how are the odds looking for those who have either put themselves forward as a presidential candidate, or who have had their name thrown into the race? Action Network shared the latest election odds, updated following Trump's success in the New Hampshire Republican primary.
Out of all the potential candidates, Trump currently leads the pack, with a 42.64 per cent chance of winning the election. Just over 10 per cent behind is incumbent Democrat Biden, who currently has a 31.01 per cent chance of winning.

Next up is a name not formally entered into the 2024 race for the White House - Michelle Obama. There have been rumours the former First Lady could throw her hat in the ring, potentially replacing President Biden for the Democrat bid. Currently, she's standing at a 5.02 per cent chance of winning the election.
For Trump's competitor Nikki Haley, things aren't looking so good with a 4.06 per cent chance of winning the election. It comes after Trump took aim at his rival in New Hampshire during his celebratory speech.
""This is not your typical victory speech, but let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night,"" Trump said. He complained Haley had come third in Iowa ""and she's still hanging around"", making his fury clear about the former UN Ambassador not dropping out.
Criticising her further for failing to exit the race after Trump's New Hampshire win, he said: ""You can't let people get away with bulls**t."" But Trump failed to pivot attention to the general election, instead repeating his claims about the 2020 election and slamming those who voted for Haley, saying they only did so ""'cause they want me to look as bad as possible"".
The latest odds, updated after the New Hampshire primary, show that it is the first time Trump's chances to win the 2024 presidency have been even money or better. His odds have steadily improved over the autumn and into the winter and appear to be continuing on an upward trajectory.
Biden has also seen a slight bounce back. With an implied probability of a 31.01 per cent chance of Biden winning, it's an improvement from several months ago when Biden's implied probability to win the election dropped below 30 per cent for the first time.
Both Trump and Biden's odds rose steadily from January to June last year. But in June, Biden saw a slight dip in his chances of retaining the White House while Trump saw his chances skyrocket, widening the gap between the two frontrunners."

Lord Markham annouced last January that he was “undertaking to sell my stake” in Cignpost, a private Covid testing firm which made a fortune from the pandemic. But Company House records for Cignpost Investments Limited still show Markham owning between 25% and 50% of the business.
Labour is demanding an explanation from the millionaire politician, while the Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment. A Labour spokesman said: ""Not only have the Conservatives run down our NHS and left it in the biggest crisis in its history, the Health Minister is profiting from its demise. Why should people trust the Tories with the NHS, when it is in their financial interests for the health service to fail? Lord Markham needs to explain why he has not sold his stake in Cignpost, one year after telling Parliament that he would.”
Cignpost has filed accounts showing that revenue soared by 467% to £278m in 2022, thanks to booming business helping firms comply with covid rules. The company has £52m cash in the bank and shareholder funds are up 150% from last year. Cignpost also offers mobile health screening, including heart health assessments and skin screening, which can be done in “your board room, staff car park or a third-party venue”.
Mirror analysis of the waiting times at scores of NHS trusts at the end of 2022 show that 43 out of 115 - or 32% - fail to meet the 18 week target for treatment for the majority of their cardiology patients. The average wait from GP referral to treatment is 16.3 weeks, according to the latest data. For dermatology treatment, the wait is even longer. Out of 83 trusts, 34 - or 41% - fail to meet the 18 week target for a majority of their patients and the average waiting time in 17.2 weeks.
Lord Markham is a businessman who was given a peerage and made Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Care by Liz Truss in September 2022. His biography on the Government website talks about his roles at firms like ITV, Laura Ashley and Top Up TV but fails to mention his healthcare investments.
Last January, after his ownership of Cignpost shares was first reported, he made a statement in the House of Lords: “Given the recent press, I want to start by setting out the position of Cignpost, the private sector Covid testing company in which, as many noble Lords will be aware, I own a stake.
“To be clear, Cignpost did not bid for any government PPE contracts and has only private sector clients. Nonetheless, upon taking up the role as an unpaid Minister of Health, I resigned my directorships, made an undertaking to sell my stake, and in conjunction with the Permanent Secretary, ensured that I was not engaged in any areas where there could be perceived to be a conflict. I just wanted to make that clear.”"

Lauren Ewings welcomed her baby boy Edward on January 22 - four weeks away from her due date. The 27-year-old began to feel in a state of discomfort, but pushed it to one sign, blaming it on Braxton Hucks (false labour pains). However, what she didn't realise was that there was nothing 'false' about what she was feeling. Carrying on her day as normal, she dropped her eldest off at school before popping to the shop to pick up her essentials. As she entered the supermarket, her water broke. Lauren bolted to the disabled toilets to clean herself up and called her partner to walk over from their nearby home to help her.
However, things soon escalated past the point of return. Realising the baby was coming, Lauren called her mother and auntie, who subsequently contacted an ambulance and the Tesco staff to inform them that she needed help.
Rushing to her aid, a staff member found the pregnant woman in the toilets and put up a privacy screen. In a heroic moment, first-aid-trained staff member Lisa Haymes delivered the baby within 30 minutes.
Lauren told DevonLive: ""I got into the disabled toilets, and five or 10 minutes later, I felt a heavy pressure down below, so I called my mum. She called the ambulance cause I was in so much pain. My auntie, who was with her at the time, called Tesco Tiverton to try and get someone to come and help me.
""I'd been on the phone for about 10 minutes, and then five minutes later Lisa, who works at Tesco, came in and then two minutes later, I crouched down, and he started coming out. Two minutes later, I delivered the placenta, and then about 15 minutes later, the paramedics arrived. I went in at 9:10 am and he was born by 9:40 am. It was really quick, especially because my two previous children were c-sections, and this was my first natural birth, so I didn't have any pain relief or anything.""
She continued: ""'I never expected to do that on a Monday morning. It's been a bit hectic, and we've only just come out this morning because he was a little bit jaundiced, and they were a bit concerned he had a heart murmur. But other than that, it's absolutely fine. He's technically four weeks early, so he weighed six pounds two, so he's proper dinky.
""It was a very unexpected day, considering it was my middle child's fourth birthday, and it's the day after my mum's birthday as well."" Unsurprisingly, Lauren has heaped enormous praise on all the staff that helped her. She beamed: ""The Tesco staff were all in shock and really excited. We've got a couple of friends that work there, and they were talking about it all day.""
In Lisa's 30 years of working at Tesco, she's never experienced a day quite like that. The 54-year-old said: ""In all my years working in many Tesco stores, I've never seen anything like what happened on Monday. And while I am first-aid trained, you're never taught how to deliver a baby.""
She added: ""So when I saw Lauren in the toilet cubicle in so much pain, I knew I had to deliver it there and then relying on adrenaline and instinct. Luckily, it all went well. I looked after Lauren and the baby boy, keeping her calm until paramedics arrived. I feel an incredible sense of pride that I made a difference in someone's life and was able to help deliver Eddie successfully.
""I am also so grateful for my colleague Caroline, who kept me company from outside the door, talking to paramedics and talking me through how to care for the newborn and mum. When I came back to work the next day I felt like a celebrity and all my Tesco colleagues have been so supportive not to mention the family who have been in touch to say a big thank you. I hope when Eddie grows he'll keep a special place in his heart for our store in Tiverton."""

The 34-year-old was released from jail last week, halfway into his 21 month sentence. He was found guilty of voyeurism and two counts of disclosing private, sexual photographs and films with Love Island star Georgia Harrison. He shared images and videos on his OnlyFans page without the consent of Georgia - who bravely waived her right to anonymity.
Bear was sent to prison and was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and also to pay Georgia the sum of £207,000 – the highest sum awarded in an image abuse case. On Friday (26 January), Bear appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court over the order to pay the £207,000 sum.
He was seen at the court alongside his dad and wore a black suit paired with flashy £800 trainers and £243 sunglasses. His hair has gone back to his signature cut and his long prison beard has gone. The Ex on the Beach star was ordered to pay Georgia the damages in July and he was also slapped with with an injunction preventing him from using the footage again.
Following his release, Bear was slapped with a restraining order against Harrison and must stay away from her for five years. He must also share his whereabouts with the police for a decade and is conditioned to stay at his parents' home for at least 12 months.
In light of the incident, Georgia became a political campaigner to fight revenge porn incidents and helped put Bear behind bars. She has recently returned to the Love Island villa for the show's All Star series. Ahead of her appearance on the programme, Georgia told The Mirror that she ""has confidence in the justice system"" regarding Bear's release.
She said: “It’s kind of ­irrelevant. I think he can’t say anything about me legally, unless he wants to risk going back to prison. So I don’t worry. That’s in my past, what happens with him, is his journey. Now my journey hopefully is going in a very fun, exciting, loving new direction.”
While giving evidence at the trial, Georgia had to identify herself in the images that violated her privacy. Georgia has since lobbied Parliament to introduce legislation against using sex images as a weapon. It led to the online safety bill being amended to make ­prosecution easier.
As he walked free from HMP Brixton on January 17, Bear looked unrecognisable. The former television personality ditched his trademark short black hair and instead had shoulder-length locks as well as a bushy beard. Having reportedly found religion while incarcerated, he also wore a set of black rosary beads around his neck as he headed towards an awaiting vehicle.
He has since whined that he has ""lost everything"" and cries himself to sleep. ""I've come out of prison and I was very overwhelmed, it was a lot,"" he said. ""I've had to adjust again to real life. That was the biggest shock, the biggest shock is, all I remembered is my old life. I went to prison and I was frozen in that mindset of my old life.
""You come out and you realise 'Oh, I've lost everything', everything is gone, everything you can imagine is gone. It's taken me a couple of days. I came home and the first night, I was crying, when I was in bed, I was crying. I was thinking of all the nice things that I had, it was like 'Wow, man I had it so good!', I cried myself to sleep.""

0OMFXQMVE3_4SKASHWVWS0DSK8,Furious Prince William's snub ahead of life-changing meeting with brother Harry,Emma MackenzieLifestyle Writer,"15:07, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/furious-prince-williams-snub-ahead-31975058,"When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they wanted to step back as senior members of the Royal Family and work towards financial independence, shockwaves were felt across Britain.
The Sussexes were accused of blindsiding even the late Queen Elizabeth with their announcement - something they strenuously deny - and the senior royals got together for what is now known as the 'Sandringham Summit' where it was decided just what the couple's future would look like.
When bringing the senior royals together to discuss what should happen next, a royal author has claimed that Queen Elizabeth was keen for the family to get together and break bread beforehand, but Prince William is alleged to have snubbed his younger brother and refused to attend the lunch.
Author Robert Lacey made the claim in his book Battle of the Brothers, which was published in 2020. Lacey alleged that in the end, Harry simply shared a meal with his grandmother, after his furious brother refused to eat with them.
""The Queen had suggested the family should gather for lunch before their big pow-wow in the library that afternoon, but he refused his grandmother's invitation.
""He would obviously turn up at 2 pm for the meeting, he said, but he only wanted to talk business. The Prince himself has not confirmed his friends' speculation that he was so furious with his younger brother that he would not be able to endure the hypocrisy of smiling at him over lunch,"" Lacey wrote.
Harry himself provided a behind-the-scenes look at the Sandringham Summit in his memoir Spare, where he detailed how the life-changing meeting had gone down from his perspective. While he made no mention of the meal that Lacey alleged his elder brother had rebuffed an invitation to, he noted that he had ""got there early, hoping to have a chat with Granny"" but his father and brother quickly joined them.
The Duke of Sussex also described that after the meeting was complete, he and William took a moment to themselves to chat, and during his depiction of the conversation he painted a very different picture than one of fury from William.
""I was braced for a lecture,"" Harry wrote, ""It didn't come. Willy was subdued. He wanted to listen. For the first time in a long time, my brother heard me out, and I was so grateful.""

Kenneth Smith became the first-ever inmate to be killed by nitrogen gas in Alabama, with his official time of death recorded at 20:25 on Thursday, 25 of January.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett. After the execution, Elizabeth's son Mike Sennett, joined by his brother Chuck, said: ""Nothing happened here today that's going to bring Mom back. It's kind of a bittersweet day. We're not going to be jumping around, hooting and hollering ""hooray"" and all that. That's not us. But we're glad this day is over.""
""All three of the people involved in this case years ago, we have forgiven. Not today but we have in the past. Some people may not believe that, you know, how do you forgive somebody. Well, in an effort to be more Christ-like, try to live his teachings and stuff, it is my duty and it is a weight off my shoulders.""

""I forgive him, I forgive him what he done, I don't like what he done but they are forgiven from us. The Bible says evil deeds have consequences - and Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions 35 years ago - and his debt was paid tonight.""
""Some of you may have heard us talk about over and over about 35 years, 35 years. 35 years - Kenneth Smith, Parker, Williams - Williams not so much because he died in the system, but Parker and Smith have been incarcerated almost twice as long as I knew my mom. Elizabeth Dorlene Thorne Sennett got her justice tonight.""

Just before the lethal gas was given, Smith spoke and made loving signs towards his family who were watching from behind a glass window. In his last words, he said: ""Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward. I am leaving with love, peace and light - thank you for supporting me. I love all of you.""
He also made an 'I love you' sign in sign-language with his hands which he directed towards his family while facing them. Authorities described how he appeared conscious for several minutes into the execution., before shaking and writhing on a gurney for two minutes followed by ""several' minutes of deep breaths before dying.""

Smith was scheduled for execution in a 30-hour window starting just after midnight on Thursday, January 25, for his part in a murder-for-hire plot of a pastor's wife. Having had his share of life-threatening experiences, Smith was understandably concerned about what lies ahead.
He expressed his fears in writing, saying: ""I am worried that we have told Alabama that these risks could happen - will happen - just like we warned them last year. And they will do nothing to prevent these dangers from happening."" Smith's own attorneys have said the state was looking to make him the ""test subject"" for a novel execution method. Currently, Alabama is just one of three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that authorizes the use of nitrogen gas in executions.

0XS61JDT8D_3FCETXYOJWOPY78,Women 'almost booted off flight' because crew found their outfits offensive,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"16:04, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/usa-canada/women-almost-booted-flight-because-31957184,"A mum claims she was told she couldn't board a flight unless she changed out of her outfit.
Karleeeee, as she is known on TikTok, arrived at Detroit Airport wearing the same outfit as her pal. The friends were sporting very bright orange tops and bottoms they had bought from online retailer Shein.
The video creator shared a clip of her and her pal walking alongside one another with the cropped t-shirts with coordinating mini skirts. ""When you almost get kicked off the flight because the flight attendant was ‘offended’ by your outfit,” a caption on the video read.
Further information on the side of the clip made clear that the women had to make an outfit change. ""Literally made my friend buy shirts because they were sooo offended by what we were wearing,” it read.
In a latter video answering some of the question about the incident, Karleeeee said the order clearly hadn't come because of how revealing the outfits were. “We were talking to the lady at the desk then right before we were about to board she stopped us,” she said.
She claimed that they were then told that ""one of our flight attendants is super offended by your outfits"" and that they would need to change, or they'd have to be put on another flight. Karleeeee says that ""nothing was showing beside our midriff, barely our stomach and our legs"" in their outfits.
Ultimately, the two friends went to a gift shop to buy t-shirts and then returned to the boarding gate and asked why they had been called out. Karleeeee and her plans are not the only ones who have ended up being dress coded when at the airport. Last year a woman said she was banned from boarding a flight at Navegantes Airport in Brazil because of how she was dressed.
Kine-Chan a Brazilian model, influencer, and OnlyFans creator says she was stopped from getting on the plane because she was wearing only a black bikini, turquoise wig, and black sandals.
The 21-year-old was dressed up as Rebecca, from the anime web series CyberPunk: Edgerunners. Taking to Instagram to lament the situation with her 612,000 followers, Kine-Chan wrote about the ""very annoying situation happened this weekend!""
“I tried to board at Navegantes airport dressed as Rebecca's Cosplay for an event. I already knew that I could be late, so I was dressed so as not to waste time and could go straight to my room. But I was told to go home and change clothes because the one I was wearing was not ‘appropriate’. I explained that I was going to an event. Anyway Rebecca barred,"" she wrote."

The TUC and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC) have called the proposal ""ill-judged proposal"". Last year, the Government was defeated in the High Court over moves to allow agencies to supply employers with strike-breaking staff.
Despite strong opposition from employers and unions, these plans are being brought back. A joint statement from the TUC and REC said: ""We both believe that using agency staff to cover strikes only prolongs and inflames the conflict between employers and their permanent staff.""
The statement also highlighted the risk of placing agency staff and recruitment businesses at the centre of complex disputes. It suggested that the focus should be on negotiation and resolution instead.
The proposal was deemed impractical due to the high number of vacancies for temporary agency workers. The statement added: ""The proposal is simply impractical.
""There are currently significant numbers of vacancies for temporary agency workers. This suggests that many can pick and choose the jobs they take and are unlikely to opt for roles that require them to undermine industrial action.""
Neil Carberry, REC chief executive, stated: ""Agencies across the country have been clear that they do not want the law changed again. The ban on direct replacement of striking workers reflects global good practice and protects temps and agencies from being drawn into disputes that are nothing to do with them.""
""Removal of the ban does nothing to resolve those disputes either. The REC was clear in 2022 that this is a step that only causes problems for businesses and workers in reality however good politicians think it sounds.""
TUC general secretary Paul Nowak stated: ""The humiliating High Court defeat should have been the final nail in the coffin for these unworkable, shoddy plans to overturn the long-standing ban on agency workers filling in for striking workers. Now they are trying to resurrect the proposal despite strong opposition from unions and employers. It's spiteful, cynical and it won't work.""
""Bringing in agency staff to deliver important services in place of strikers risks worsening disputes and poisoning industrial relations. Agency recruitment bodies have repeatedly made clear they don't want their staff to be put in the position where they have to cover strikes. It's time for ministers to listen and drop these plans for good.""
A Government spokesperson commented: ""We want to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between the right to strike and the rights of the general public to go about their daily lives and access vital public services. We believe there is a strong case for this change to help employers to manage any disruption, and people expect the Government to act in circumstances where their rights and freedoms are being disproportionately impacted.""

167Q98PA8F_1DI5A8EVS43Y5FC,Emotional moment twins separated and sold at birth are reunited thanks to TikTok video,Bradley JollyNews Reporter,"22:56, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/emotional-moment-twins-separated-sold-31976956,"This is the poignant moment a set of identical twins who were among tens of thousands of babies stolen from hospitals and sold are reunited after more than 20 years.
Amy Khvitia and Ano Sartania, who were born at a hospital in Georgia in 2002, now want answers as to what happened to the scores of tots since, after they only discovered each other by chance thanks to TikTok and a TV talent show. They've also finally met their birth mother, Aza, for the first time in more than two decades.
When Amy was at her godmother's house near the Black Sea watching her favourite TV programme, Georgia's Got Talent, she saw a girl who looked exactly like her - identical, in fact, but her family brushed it off. Amy said: ""Everyone was calling my mum and asking: 'Why is Amy dancing under another name?'"" Her mother said: ""Everyone has a doppelganger.""
Seven years elapsed and, in November 2021, Amy posted a video of herself with blue hair getting her eyebrow pierced on TikTok. Two hundred miles away in Tbilisi, Georgia, another 19-year-old, Ano, was sent the video by a friend. She thought it was ""cool that she looks like me"".
Ano tried to trace the girl with the pierced eyebrow online but couldn't find her, so she shared the video on a university WhatsApp group to see if anyone could help. Someone who knew Amy saw the message and connected them on Facebook. Amy instantly knew Ano was the girl she had seen all those years ago on Georgia's Got Talent.
And now they've met - and met their birth mother. The encounter was captured in a hotel in Leipzig, Germany, more than 2,000 miles from Tbilisi. They decided to confront their families and for the first time they learned the truth. They had been adopted, separately, a few weeks apart in 2002, according to BBC News.
Emotional footage taken in Leipzig shows the sister embracing their biological mum. Amy is visibly moved by the encounter, fighting back tears.
They were both born in Kirtskhi Maternity Hospital - which no longer exists - in western Georgia but, according to their birth certificates, their birthdays were a couple of weeks apart. Amy, though, knew then that they were twins. She said: ""It was like looking in a mirror, the exact same face, exact same voice. I am her and she is me.""
Both sisters said they were upset with their family. Ano said she was ""angry and upset with my family, but I just wanted the difficult conversations to be over so that we could all move on"".
And, digging deeper, the twins found the details on their official birth certificates, including the date they were born, were wrong. It reports Amy's mother was unable to have children, and was told by a friendthere was an unwanted baby at the local hospital. She would need to pay the doctors but she could take her home and raise her as her own. Ano's mother was told the same story.
The twins traced their birth mother after finding a Facebook group dedicated to reuniting Georgian families with children suspected to have been illegally adopted at birth and she shared their story. A young woman in Germany replied, saying her mother had given birth to twin girls in Kirtskhi Maternity Hospital in 2002 and that despite being told they had died, she now had some doubts. The group, which has more than 230,000 members, was set up by journalist Tamuna Museridze in 2021 after she discovered she was adopted.
In 2022, the Georgian government launched an investigation into historic child trafficking. It told the BBC it has spoken to more than 40 people but the cases were ""very old and historic data has been lost"". The case features in BBC documentary Georgia's Stolen Children, which can be watched on iPlayer."

Zeus turned on his new owner and another man who both suffered injuries as they tried to defend themselves before armed police stepped in and shot the large dog with a Taser. Despite the volts the animal continued mauling the pair and was eventually shot dead by officers in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire.
The dog had been rescued from England and brought to Scotland just two weeks earlier it has been revealed. His owner was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital with serious lower limb injuries. His current condition is unknown. A second man was taken to Hairmyres Hospital and treated for minor injuries.
An eyewitness said: “A knife was thrown to the owner to try and kill the dog. He stabbed it but it didn't make any difference."" Another witness, named Kevin, said: ""I heard a lot of commotion and looked out the window to see two men wrestling with the dog. It was a big dog, probably about eight or nine stone. It had hold of one of the guys and wouldn't let go.
""They were hitting it with stuff and shouting at it to stop, but it was so distressed and angry. There was blood everywhere. The owner was covered in blood. His legs, hands and wrists looked badly injured. I phoned the police and when they came the dog was still attacking anyone who went near it. One of the guys managed to get away but the owner was still being attacked.
""Police showed up and Tasered him but he still wouldn't stop. Then armed police came and he was shot four times. The first 2 shots didn't take him out. It was awful to witness, but I know why they had to do it. If he hadn't been killed, he would have killed someone.""
CCTV footage from before the attack show the dog happily wagging his tail and jumping up at the counter of a local shop when he is fed a biscuit. The sweet scene was soon replaced with another full of blood when the dog suddenly mauled his owner and another man.
Local Day Today shopkeeper Numan Saifi told the Daily Record : “Zeus was in here with his owner just before the attack. I can't believe this has happened. He always seemed calm and friendly. The dog would come into our shop most days and always seemed very well-behaved. He would jump up on the counter to get his dog treats and had a little innocent face. He had been rescued a few weeks ago after he was beaten and abandoned. You could tell he hasn't been treated well in the past because he was covered in scars. It's tragic this has happened.""
Police Scotland confirmed the dog was shot dead by specialist armed cops after it also attempted to attack an officer. The incident will now be referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner because a firearm was discharged during the response to the incident.
Superintendent Steven Espie said: “This was a distressing incident for those involved. I would like to reassure the local community this was a contained incident and there is no further risk to the public. There will be a continued police presence in the area while our enquiries continue. Enquiries are also ongoing to establish the breed of the dog.”
The Mirror is calling for these changes:
1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.
2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.
3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training."
18FSTLX2DI_EDCJWTPNIOJ5768,Vladimir Putin hands troops Harry Potter-style 'invisibility cloaks' for camouflage,Graeme MurrayNews Reporter,"16:47, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-hands-troops-harry-31938992,"Vladimir Putin's troops reportedly have a new tool in their arsenal against Ukraine - invisibility cloaks
The lightweight Harry Potter-style camouflage outfit will allegedly protect the wearer from thermal imaging equipment. Reports claim they are already being deployed with Russian special forces. As well as the camouflage cloaks, there are additional jackets and trousers as well as balaclava headwear.
Manufacturer HiderX has published footage showing how the garments reduce the chance of Russian troops being spotted. The invention supposedly blurs the silhouettes of soldiers at the frontline and HiderX is now said to be supplying the invisible cloaks to Russian armed forces.
A spokesman for the company said: “We are developing a fundamentally new product - a camouflage suit that breaks and blurs the silhouette. This is a completely Russian technology based on coating fabrics with a certain composition - our know-how, and its details are not disclosed. The suit will make it possible to effectively camouflage Russian military personnel from enemy thermal imaging equipment.”
‌Fine-tuning is still to be done , but they are expected to be completed this month. The “invisible suits” - which roll up and fit in a pocket - will be supplied more widely to the army.
Ukraine has its own version of such technology, but it is believed to be ineffective during rapid movement of troops. A spokesman for the Russian company added: ""The material and technology applied to the fabric make it possible to achieve a minimum weight of 350 grams. We use a different technology—shielding,""

The Mirror has previously reported how military experts have suggested three things Europe could do to bring about the defeat of Russia. As the war against Ukraine enters its third year, the question of how to bring the conflict to an end remains a live one. The two countries' forces appear locked in a stalemate after a counter-offensive by Ukrainian soldiers failed to break through Russian lines and they continue to make drone and missile strikes on each other's territory.
Analysts have given their insights into how European countries might help Ukraine defeat the Russian forces and stop dictator Vladimir Putin from enacting further offensives that could lead to a third world war. They offered three militaristic solutions: Strengthening NATO, increasing funding to Ukraine and shoring up cyber forces.
General Sir Richard Barrons, former Joint Forces chief, has warned that Putin poses ""the biggest risk to our security"" in the UK. This week Admiral Rob Bauer, who chairs the bloc's Military Committee, said people should get ready for conscription within the next two decades in NATO countries.
Many NATO nations, although not directly involved in the war, are supplying Kyiv with non-lethal support but also weapons, ammunition, warplanes and tanks. Countries such as the UK and the US have been actively involved in helping to train Ukraine’s troops."
18IRVFPISG_319U22WB4QWYZKK,101 Squadron RAF hero Rusty dies at 100 - remembered as daring legend,Matt RoperFeatures Writer,"20:35, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/101-squadron-raf-hero-rusty-31950284,"When Russell “Rusty” Waughman first flew daring, heart-stopping bombing raids over Nazi Germany, he wasn’t much more than a boy full of bravado.
When he died last month, he was one of the last pilots of Bomber Command, up there with the most dangerous assignments of World War II. And it wasn’t lost on those who attended the memorial service for the veteran last week that he was just one month shy of turning 101 – the number of the Special Duty Squadron in which he served. That Rusty even survived the war, let alone lived to see his 100th year, is in itself remarkable.
The lifespan of a typical airman in 101 Squadron was just a handful of sorties. Their Lancaster Bombers were equipped with a special apparatus that searched out and then jammed enemy radio transmissions. But that also allowed German Luftwaffe to track and attack them, and the squadron suffered the highest casualties of any, losing 1,176 aircrew killed in action.
When Rusty’s crew completed their set of 30 operations, they found out they were the first from the squadron to survive a full tour for more than six months.
“Survival was 99% luck,” he later said. “We had bits shot off us and holes knocked into us. It was a very strange feeling because we were all genuinely convinced we’d all be killed, it was just a matter of when.”
Born in County Durham and plagued with ill-health from childhood tuberculosis as he grew up, Rusty had meant to sign up for the Navy when war broke out. But when he saw that the naval recruiting officer was his own doctor and most likely would not approve him, he went next door and joined the RAF instead. He was only 18 when he earned his wings and just 20 when, in November 1943, he flew his first operation, straight to Berlin.
“We’d only just got over Europe when we had five fighter attacks, one after another,” he recalled in video recordings in the International Bomber Command Centre Digital Archive, managed by the University of Lincoln. “Our rear gunner Harry Nunn, who was Canadian, basically kept us alive.”
When, on his next sortie as he flew over the Ruhr region for the first time, Rusty remembered his terror as he saw the searchlights, German fighters and the heavy flak.
“My knees were shaking, I was shaking... I really was terrorised. So I dropped my seat so I couldn’t look out and funnily enough, I don’t know why, but I said a little prayer that my mum and dad used to say when I was about six years old by the side of the bed, which ended, ‘If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul will take’. And I said this little prayer, and the terror disappeared. I raised my seat and carried on. I was still apprehensive and frightened, but the terror went.”
But Rusty’s brushes with death got closer with each mission, as the squadron, flying out of RAF Ludford Magna in Lincolnshire, stepped up their raids ahed of D-Day.
During one sortie, Rusty and his crew fortunate to survive when, after they had attacked a German tank depot, another Lancaster exploded right underneath them, blowing them upside down. He remembered: “We lost about 10,000ft and our wireless operator, little Taffy, ended up with the contents of the pee can tipped all over him. He wasn’t exactly flavour of the month, I can tell you.”
Another time they were hit by anti-aircraft fire over Stettin and had to fly back to base without two engines, arriving home so late they were presumed dead. “The committee of adjustment had been in and started to take our kit away.”
His final sortie was a diversionary raid intended to convince the Germans the Allies would not land in Normandy.
Rusty remained in the RAF after the war and became a highly qualified instructor-examiner with Transport Command, and married Pat Burditt, who died in 1952. He was later remarried to headmistress Diana Lea and the couple had four children. Feeling the Lancaster crews’ contribution to victory wasn’t talked about enough, Rusty never stopped telling his extraordinary stories. And his tenacity was rewarded in 2012, when the RAF Bomber Command Memorial was unveiled in Green Park, London.
But the veteran, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Force Cross, also admitted that with age his heroics haunted him more. He said: “The unfortunate thing is... you suddenly realise: how many people have I killed? And this came to me very seriously after the war. In 1991, when they were rebuilding Berlin I said to a lady, ‘They’re not doing much to mend that church,’ and she said, ‘No, that’s going to be kept as a memorial to the 260 children who were killed when we were bombed’. And you suddenly realised, I could’ve done that. But, at the time you had no consciousness about it at all, you’re just doing a job.”
The Veterans’ Foundation hailed Rusty as “not just a pilot, he was a living testament to dedication, courage, and unwavering commitment. His legacy extends far beyond the cockpit, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of all who knew him.”"

The PM has voiced his ""strong view"" in favour of Saturday deliveries, emphasising their importance for businesses. He has said he would not accept seeing them scrapped.
Royal Mail has asked Ofcom to axe Saturday deliveries, reducing the service from six days a week to five. Ofcom is expected to publish its recommendations on the universal service this week.
Asked about plans, Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister's strong view is that Saturday deliveries provide flexibility and convenience. They're important for businesses and particularly publishers. The Prime Minister would not countenance seeing Saturday deliveries scrapped."" He added ""we'll see exactly what Ofcom's recommendations are"" before taking the next steps.
Industry regulator Ofcom is set to outline its options to reform Royal Mail. It is understood part of the plans include cancelling deliveries at the weekend. Another option is to copy services in countries such as Germany which deliver mail on alternate days. It comes after Royal Mail was referred to Ofcom last year when MPs accused the firm of failing to deliver letters six days a week.
Royal Mail bosses have been pushing for a five-day week from Monday to Friday after it reported huge losses to profits. In June last year the Government blocked the company from stopping Saturday deliveries.
Kevin Hollinrake, a minister at the Department for Business and Trade, wrote: “We currently have no plans to change the minimum requirements of the universal postal service as set out in the Postal Services Act 2011 … including six-day letter deliveries.”
At the time, a Royal Mail spokesman said: “The government has said before that it has no current plans to change the USO, but it is clear that when letter volumes have declined by more than 60% since their peak in 2004-05, in order to be financially sustainable, the [USO] requires urgent reform."" Continuing to deliver post on Saturdays “increases the threat to the sustainability of the universal service”, they added."

The 47-year-old comedian has been unlucky in love since the collapse of his marriage in 2022. And while fans had been encouraged to see him going public with a younger man named Callum Heslop, 27, he has now revealed he is single again.
Alan recently took Callum on tour with him while he was performing stand-up in North America - and reports stated that he had introduced him to his close A-List friend Adele. But now the pair have gone their separate ways - realising they are better as “friends”.
Alan is, however, still looking for love. The Sun has quoted the comedy star saying: “I’m looking, I’m looking. If you know any chubby chasers, let me know.” Last November, Alan and Callum were first linked with the pair looking loved up while the TV star was on tour in the Americas.
Reports suggested the pair spent time at Adele's plush pad in LA for Thanksgiving dinner and Alan even appeared to go 'Instagram official' with Callum on the trip as he shared some sweet snaps of the pair living it up together.
Sources said at the time: “[Alan and Callum] have a really nice friendship and that has been the base for a relationship to blossom. He meets celebs through his job, so isn’t fazed. It takes a lot to introduce a partner to someone as famous as Adele but she couldn’t have been friendlier.”
Alan was previously married to party planner and actor Paul Drayton. The couple had been together for 13 years and married for three when news broke that their romance had come to an end in 2022. Alan mentioned the split during an interview in January of that year, saying: “My marriage broke down in lockdown. No, it's fine – people head tilt when you've got bad news.”
The couple confirmed their split with a joint statement, saying: “After 13 years as a couple and three years of marriage, Alan Carr and Paul Drayton would like to announce they are separating. They have jointly and amicably made the difficult decision to divorce and go their separate way.”
In early 2023, Alan spoke out about his relationship with his ex after their split, saying: “I don't hate him. It takes up too much energy. We have all got to move on.” He went on to explain he struggled with dating apps, saying: ""People ask if I am doing the apps but I find it quite triggering… I used to work at a singles bar in Northampton and I was like the goat who gets lowered in that crate in Jurassic Park.""
The Mirror approached Alan's spokesperson for comment.

The 58-year-old became the first-ever inmate in the USA to be put to death by toxic gas following an execution at Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility. Following the execution, dubbed ""human experimentation"" by human rights advocate groups, officials described how the procedure of nitrogen gas poisoning manifested in Smith's body as he was strapped to a gurney.
With his official time of death recorded at 20:25 on Thursday, 25 of January, Smith was said to have held his breath for as long as possible. Officials said he ""appeared conscious"" for several minutes into the execution, before shaking and writing on a gurney for two minutes followed by ""several"" minutes of deep breaths before dying. Officials went on to describe how his actions while strapped to the gurney appeared involuntary - adding that it was ""all expected"" and ""nothing was out of the ordinary.""

The nitrogen gas flowed for 15 minutes as witnesses, including Smith's family, his victim's family and reporters watched on from behind a glass screen. In his final statement, he said: ""Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward. I am leaving with love, peace and light - thank you for supporting me. I love all of you."" He also made an 'I love you' sign in sign-language with his hands which he directed towards his family while facing them.
His nitrogen execution came after a last-ditch appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the killing, but judges ruled it could go ahead and refused to grant a stay of execution. But not all the judges were in agreement. Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the method as ""untested"" and said Smith faced choking to death on his own vomit while wearing the face mask. And Justice Elena Kagan said nitrogen execution was ""entirely novel"".

In the hours ahead of the scheduled execution, Smith met with family members and Rev Hood, according to a prison spokesperson. He ate a final meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Hood said by telephone.

Critics of the controversial death penalty method said it was unclear what Smith would feel after the warden switched on the gas, according to medics. ""What effect the condemned person will feel from the nitrogen gas itself, no one knows,"" Dr Jeffrey Keller, president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, wrote in an email. ""This has never been done before. It is an experimental procedure.""
Keller, who was not involved in developing the Alabama protocol, said the plan was to ""eliminate all of the oxygen from the air"" that Smith is breathing by replacing it with nitrogen. The execution is the first attempt to use a new method since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. Three states - Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma - have authorised nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. Some states are exploring new methods as lethal injection drugs have become more difficult to find.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable euthanasia method for most mammals because the anoxic environment ""is distressing."" Experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife. Prosecutors said the men were paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett, 45, on behalf of her husband, who wanted to collect on insurance. The coroner testified Sennett was stabbed repeatedly. Her husband killed himself when he became a suspect. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted, was executed in 2010."

Matthew Turner, 24, was given a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Chester Crown Court after admitting the burglary of three watches taken from Hugh Grosvenor, Duke of Westminster's bedroom.
He had been carrying out renovation work at Eaton Hall, on the outskirts of Chester, in August 2022.  The court heard Turner, who was addicted to cocaine at the time, took a Cartier London Tank JC watch, bought for £18,000, a Panerai Luminor Marina watch, worth £7,000, and a Breitling watch, worth about £7,000.
The burglary was only revealed when Harry Fane, who had sold the Cartier watch to the duke, spotted it for sale on an auction site in November that year, in what was described in court as an ""astonishing coincidence"".
The other two watches have never been recovered, the court heard. In a statement read to the court, the duke said: ""They are of huge sentimental value, beyond their financial worth. My bedroom is a private, extremely personal space within my home, I feel very uncomfortable knowing someone who is trusted to do a job has entered my room and stolen my personal possessions.""  Sentencing, Honorary Recorder of Chester Judge Steven Everett told Turner: ""You have escaped prison by the skin of your teeth.""  He said it was clear Turner had declined to tell police where the other two watches were. The judge said: ""You made that decision not to, suggesting at least one of the watches went to your drug dealer.""  At the time of the offence, Turner was employed by a firm that had worked on the duke's estate for more than 50 years and was ""well and truly trusted"" by the family, the court heard. The Duke of Westminster, one of the UK's richest men, is godfather to Prince George.  The 32-year-old took over his family's billion-pound fortune and estate when his father Gerald died in 2016. Myles Wilson, defending, said Turner had been spending hundreds of pounds on cocaine. He said: ""It's a typical scenario where his debts increase, his dealers become more desperate, he becomes more desperate and he's committed crime and really self-destructed.""  Peter Hussey, prosecuting, said Turner had admitted a separate offence of theft after stealing £60 from colleague Callum Parry's wallet while working at Top Gear Tyres in Ellesmere Port in December 2022. Judge Everett said although the financial backgrounds of both victims were ""entirely different"" the end result was the same.  Turner, who was supported in court by his father and stepmother, nodded in the dock when he was told he must complete 200 hours of unpaid work and 30 days of rehabilitation activity. The judge ordered he pay £500 compensation to Mr Parry but said no order he could make could ""possibly compensate"" for the loss to the duke."

The recruitment manager, 32, was among the Faithfuls on the second series of the BBC show. She was banished at a round table that featured in the ninth episode, with her having narrowly missed out on making it to the final week.
Charlotte spoke to the Mirror recently about her time at Ardross Castle in Scotland, where it's filmed. She recalled getting ""cold feet"" in the application process but said she ended up coming away from the show feeling ""validated"".
Discussing the process, Charlotte said that she applied for the Traitors at Christmas in 2022 after becoming ""hooked"" on the first series that launched then. She said: ""One stage just goes to the next stage [and then] to the next stage.""
She recalled later going into a ""panic"" about the prospect of being on TV but said that those behind the BBC show were supportive. Charlotte told us: ""When you get told you're going on it ... I then went into panic and thought 'oh reality television - it can go really bad. Like do I wanna do this?'""
The former participant continued: ""I had cold feet and I was like 'I don't think I can do this. Like I'm really worried. I think I'm really boring. No one's gonna like me'. All this stuff. And they were like 'no, no, no - we really want you on it. Please, please, what can we do to support you?' And they were really, really good actually. And they still are really good.""
Sharing her motivation for applying to be on the BAFTA-winning show, Charlotte said that after turning 30 and some health issues, she wanted to ""push her boundaries"". She added that she had wanted to ""say yes to everything"".
Charlotte further discussed experiencing anxiety whilst discussing being apart from her loved ones. She said being away from her wife Laura Chilton and their dogs, Lady and Lolly, whom she refers to as her ""kids"", was ""very difficult"".
She commented: ""It was really tricky because you're in your head thinking 'I'm doing it for them so if I get this I can do something amazing for us'."" Charlotte added that she then ""quickly learned"" that even without winning she would gain many new friends that would ""change"" her family's lives.
""I just kept telling myself ... this will be a good thing for you and for me I found the whole experience validating. I've had real issues with anxiety and self-confidence, which y'know sometimes they say the loudest person in the room is the most insecure - that's a classic case of me,"" she continued.
Charlotte shared: ""I've worked on myself a hell of a lot to actually start to appreciate who I am and like myself. So when I went in there, I was really scared because I thought 'well I don't have the highest opinion of myself' and so to go in there where people are out to banish or murder you, I thought 'this could really tip me on the wrong side'.""
She added: ""It was the opposite [though] because I had 21 people who should want to hate me and they didn't. They all loved me and they all offered support. We're all so so close, I can't put it into words how close we all are. And so far that reason like I came out feeling so much better about myself.""
The Faithful described the cast of the second series as a ""family,"" telling us: ""It's a family in the end."" And when asked to sum up her experience in five words, she said: ""Absolutely magnificent, fabulous, fantastic [and] exhilarating.""

Jeff Capps, 33, now works in freezing -60C temperatures, sees the Southern Lights every day, and lives 2,000 miles from the nearest shop. He was working in a car dealership when an old friend told him about a job opportunity at the US-government-owned Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
He said: ""I used to work in a car dealership as a mechanic. One day an old friend came by and said they needed a mechanic to work on snowmobiles in the South Pole I thought 'sign me up!'.""

The £63k-a-year role sees Jeff work six-month stints in the South Pole. He started his job in 2019 and describes the facility as like ""living on a ship"". He even met his partner, Michelle, 33, while in the South Pole - where she worked in catering.
Scientists at the station do important work on climate change and how the universe began. Jeff said: ""We call it our spaceship, as it's 700 miles from the next nearest research station. We're totally isolated from everything.""
Jeff says living there feels normal. ""If you don't open the door it just seems like you're in a nice hotel,"" he explained. ""We have great team of chefs. It's room temperature inside and you can just walk around in a t-shirt.""
Only a few people share the place last time Jeff counted, there were 43. ""You build an extremely close community as you see the same people every day, it's all pretty nice until you open the door outside then that all changes,"" he said.
Jeff often has to work outside in very cold weather, fixing vehicles. Once, he worked in a biting -76C, which he described as ""surreal"". He said: ""You'd think you'd freeze to death instantly, but it's a dry cold, so it's actually not as bad as it sounds.
""The weirdest thing is I never felt shivering or chilled to the bone. The worst bit is if the cold hits any part of your skin which is uncovered, you get a sharp burning sensation it feels like your skin is being stabbed with a knife.""
He added: ""In winter it's crazy outside it's always dark as the sun sets once a year so it's six months daylight then six months darkness."" One of the best parts of living in the South Pole, Jeff claims, is the social life.
""We are all like a big family we have arguments and stuff but you still kind of respect each other. We all give each other crap, but then we all have parties and drink whiskey together. You have no one else to go so you have to make it work.""
Jeff proudly said that the parties at the centre are ""legendary"", explaining: ""You have to be much more creative down there. Last time in July we had a Christmas-themed party, and we also did a South Pole Olympics - complete with an opening ceremony.""
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
""We were supposed to do outdoor winter events but the weather was especially bad so we just stayed inside and drank whiskey."" Talking about the time he met his partner at the facility two years ago, he said: ""There are some women down there. We ended up going to a game night, there were a bunch of us hanging out and playing board games.
""Michelle was working as part of the catering team down there. We stayed together during our time off and ended up going travelling,"" he added. The couple, who are currently in Oman, have travelled through New Zealand, Australia, Turkey, the UAE and Yemen, and plan on returning to the South Pole next year. Jeff mentioned they see the Southern Lights ""almost every day"", adding: ""It's good work if you can get it.""

1I6TKSVOJM_84C9JUQV906H6C8,Josef Fritzl's dungeon lair where he kept sex slave daughter as incest monster to be freed,Jeremy ArmstrongNews Reporter,"10:02, 25 Jan 2024Updated13:35, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/josef-fritzls-dungeon-lair-kept-31963232,"Incest monster, Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter as a sex slave beneath the family home for more than two decades has been granted a conditional release from prison.
The 88-year-old pervert appeared at Landesgericht District Court at 7.20am UK time for a hearing, which is the first time he has been seen outside prison for 15 years. It comes after he was allegedly seen visiting local cafes near Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau, Austria. He is set to be moved to a regular prison before he is eligible for release in March - though the decision is not yet legally binding.
Fritzl's attorney, Astrid Wagner, said after the hearing: ""We were successful. It was a long hearing. He told again how he regrets what he did. He was actually close to tears. In summary, the court came to the conclusion that my client is actually no longer dangerous.""
Five years ago, the Mirror visited the site of Fritzl's horrifying dungeon lair where he kept his daughter, Elisabeth, imprisoned for 24 years. During her horrifying captivity, Elizabeth was forced to have seven of her own father's children before she finally broke free in April, 2008. Here is Jeremy Armstrong's account of what he saw in the cellar.
Standing in the cellar of Josef ­Fritzl ’s House of Horrors, ­memories of the monster who shocked the world still send a shiver down the spine. It was here, beneath 40 Ybbsstrasse, that Fritzl dragged his terrified daughter Elisabeth, then 18, into the dungeon lair that would be her prison for 24 years.
He used her as his sex slave, beating and drugging her into submission so she did not try to escape. She gave birth to seven of his children during 8,642 days in captivity. Kerstin, Stefan and Felix were aged 19, 18 and five when they were freed in April 2008. Their fellow incest siblings Lisa, Monika, and Alexander, then 16, 14 and 12, had been granted freedom by Fritzl to live “upstairs” with his wife Rosemarie.
To the citizens of Amstetten, 70 miles from Austrian capital Vienna, he was a dedicated, hard-working grandfather. He covered his tracks by telling police Elisabeth had run away to a sect on August 29, 1984 – the day he drugged her and dragged her to his dungeon prison – and only returned to drop the three children as babies on his door step.
Incredibly, police, neighbours, family and friends all accepted his story. Fate prevented Elisabeth ending her days imprisoned, however. Kerstin fell seriously ill on April 19, 2008 and Elisabeth begged her father to take her to hospital. Doctors were so baffled by her condition – a Vitamin D deficiency caused by a life without sunlight – they broadcast an appeal for her mother to come forward.
Fritzl had granted Elisabeth a TV and on seeing the appeal, she begged him to allow her to go to hospital. There, doctors and then police wanted to know what really happened. And in a confession that shocked the world, on April 26th 2018, she told her harrowing story. She has since rebuilt her life.
Ten years on, we tracked down Fritzl’s son-in-law Horst Herlbauer, the partner of Fritzl’s second eldest child Rosemarie. He said the cellar ­children were “doing well” and came to live with the siblings they never saw early in their lives. None of the family has had contact with Josef.
Horst declines to say what he thinks should happen to him if he is freed for good. He said: “I am no judge. That is for the authorities.” For businessman Herbert Houska, 59, who converted the former Fritzl home into 10 flats after buying it for around £160,000 in 2016, the new residents there offer a fresh start for the entire community.
Much of the huge cellar has been filled in with concrete, but the stairs and a single room remain. Herbert said: “From the worst possible situation, we have found the best solution. ""After 10 years, we don’t speak about the Fritzl case any more. It is not the Fritzl house any more. We can move on.”
Tenant “Jose E”, 31, from the Dominican Republic, is paying 500 Euros a month rent. The factory worker said: “I already knew who had lived here because a friend was in the flat before me. I was not in Austria at that time, but it did shock me when I read about it. I did not feel it was so extreme that I could not live here.”
The bakery next door is owned by Gunter Pramreiter, 49. He never suspected anything untoward. “I would see him and Rosemarie sporadically,” he said. “She bought bread buns, came in with the kids. Her husband was well respected before all this came out. He was well known, and the children looked after by his wife were well cared for. It is easy to look back and say things should have been different afterwards.”
Another neighbour does not agree. “The authorities are to blame,” he said. “Their response was weak.” England-born Reporter Mark Perry, who works on Austria’s Kronen newspaper, was the first to cover the story when Fritzl’s daughter by Elisabeth was supposedly left at the door step.
And he was the last person to speak to Fritzl before his arrest. Mark recalled: “He said, ‘Don’t pester me, I don’t want to talk about this.” He continued: “I made the call to police one Saturday in April and they said they had a very big case and I had to go around to see the police on Sunday. I headed off early and that was when ­Elizabeth had been interviewed.
""When they took Felix out of the dungeon, he had never seen the light of day and he was pressing his nose to the window. He had not known even a street light, he had never seen the moon. As a dad that struck me the most, it was the saddest part of the story.”
Fritzl still shows no remorse. “He is a psychopath, and yet he seemed so normal,” added Mark. In the office of Inspector Willi Reitner, the policeman who interviewed ­Elisabeth on the day of her release, there is a car showing a lake and mountain – symbols of the freedom she now enjoys.
In a touching message, she wrote inside: “Thank you for helping us. You were there for us in a difficult situation. When we needed your support the most you took care of us.” For the officers who finally set her free, there can be no better reward."

David Caves, who has played the role of Jack since 2013, is in a relationship with his colleague, portrayed by Emilia Fox, in the popular BBC crime drama. But when the cameras stop rolling, the 44-year-old goes home to his wife and children.
The Northern Irish actor keeps his family life relatively private, however is known to have tied the knot with finance manager, Verity Cunningham, in 2019. The couple share two kids and welcomed their second baby in January last year. David was previously linked to his co-star, actress Lisa Dillon, who he met on The Taming of Shrew production in 2012.
David's on-screen persona Jack is a boxer, amateur cage fighter, and mixed martial arts fighter - and his character's hobbies have hugely influenced his own. After securing his Silent Witness role in 2012, David said he wanted to take up fighting so he could learn as much as possible for the fight scenes. He's now known to enjoy martial arts.
The TV star grew up in Belfast and attended the prestigious Campbell College, where his parents Michael and Naomi, were both teachers. The family lived on-site until David went to study modern languages at the University of St Andrews. In 2002, he graduated and spent a year teaching in France, before pursuing his love of acting.
David previously told Belfast Live: ""I was rubbish at maths but enjoyed rugby. And now that I'm playing a member of the pathology team some people seem to think it would be a natural job for me, but it would be a disaster. I was really rubbish at the sciences at school - really rubbish. My parents were very surprised when I told them I wanted to be an actor but they were shocked.""
He continued: ""After all the effort they had put in, all the encouragement, all the money spent on fees and uniforms and everything else, they were surprised by my choice but they always supported me and never once stood in my way."" In 2005, David graduated from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and starred in a number of productions, including Romeo and Juliet.
The dad-of-two made a name for himself in theatre and took on roles in Twelfth Night, Wuthering Heights, Macbeth, Hercules and The Changeling, before he bagged the role of Jack in the 16th series of Silent Witness. David has since appeared on the big screen in the 2014 war film, Ironclad: Battle for Blood, and 2016 drama film, Jackie."

John Rose, 53, a former fire chief from Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, had resigned from Oak Bluffs Fire Department due to sexual harassment allegations in 2020.
Recently, Rose secured a new job in West Tisbury but was indefinitely suspended after a harassment protection order was filed against him. He is now being held without bail on charges of ""photographing, videotaping, or electronically surveilling a partially nude or nude persons"", as per the district attorney's office.
The police were alerted about the allegation on December 14 and initiated an investigation that involved state police. Rose was arrested at Logan Airport in Boston over the weekend, although it's unclear if he was trying to escape.

A male co-worker sought the harassment prevention order against Rose on December 4. It hasn't been confirmed whether this order and Rose's arrest are linked.
Rose has a history of alleged workplace corruption. While working in Oak Bluffs, he was compelled to settle with a former fire department administrator for $97,500 over harassment and discrimination claims. Cynthia Hatt, who worked for the department from 2013 to 2019, filed a grievance against Rose with the state in April of that year, before filing a lawsuit in July.
Hatt confessed to a year-long relationship with Rose starting in 2015, after he made advances towards her at work. After they split up, Rose started dating a volunteer firefighter but kept sending Hatt 'unceasing, harassing text messages and phone calls' to win her back.

She turned him down and claims he took revenge on her at work for doing so. Hatt alleged that Rose moved her desk into his office, stopped her extra time payments, took away her job duties and singled out her new boyfriend for punishment, even stalking her outside the fire station using fire department vehicles.
She also claimed that Rose ""assigned himself a locker"" in the women's locker room at the fire station and used it to shower and dress twice a day. The case was eventually dismissed and a settlement was reached without Rose or the town of Oak Bluffs admitting any wrongdoing. Hatt dropped all claims.
She was awarded $97,500 in the settlement, more than the $25,000 she asked for in lost overtime pay. The settlement states the extra money is for damages that ""do not involve wage-related wrongdoing on the part of the town.""
A month after he resigned, it was revealed he'd received $100,000 in a retirement package that includes a $65,000 lump-sum payout, three months of paid leave, and 18 months of town health benefits. The fire department, under Rose's leadership, even came under an FBI investigation for its billing practices.
Rose was given another shot as a firefighter in West Tisbury until a harassment protection order was filed. He didn't fight his suspension. In 2022, a fellow firefighter who tried to expose Rose's alleged harassment sued him, according to The MV Times.
Back in 2014, when Rose was still the boss, a state ethics commission looked into him for hiring his own family at the fire department, NBC10 reported. They later decided not to take any formal action against Rose.
Rose's lawyer, Mark Miliotis, told the Vineyard Gazette he hadn't heard about these charges before and didn't say anything else.
Right now, Rose is in a state prison in Bourne. He's due back in court on Monday."
1LZ4TKBXI9_OSOUYB0N657BMA8,"Sarah Ferguson's age, family, net worth and living arrangement with Prince Andrew",Gemma StrongLifestyle Writer,"15:42, 22 Jan 2024Updated10:14, 23 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/sarah-ferguson-net-worth-fergie-31939241,"Sarah Ferguson recently announced that she has been diagnosed with skin cancer just a few months after undergoing a mastectomy. The 64-year-old expressed her ""shock"" at discovering she has a malignant melanoma, but told fans she remains in ""good spirits"".
Dubbed 'Fergie', Sarah first stepped into the spotlight through her marriage to Prince Andrew, which lasted from 1986 until 1996. Together they share two children, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, and three grandchildren. She is patron of various charities and has worked to rasie awareness of cancer symptoms through her openness about her own diagnoses.
But how much do you really know about the Duchess of York? Let's take a closer look...
Sarah was born on 15 October 1959 at London Welbeck Hospital, the second daughter of Major Ronald Ferguson (1931–2003) and Susan Barrantes (née Wright; 1937–1998). She has one older full sister, Jane. She was raised in Dummer, Hampshire, and attended the Queen's Secretarial College before working for public relations firms in London, and then for a publishing company. She is now 64.
Should the Royal Family be as open about their health? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
Sarah and Prince Andrew first met when they were children, but they were not romantically involved until they met again at a party at Floors Castle in 1985. They began their relationship that same year, after a party held at Windsor Castle in honour of the Royal Ascot races. Diana, the late Princess of Wales, played a hand in matchmaking the couple as Andrew's sister-in-law, and the two women later formed a strong friendship.
Andrew popped the question on 19 February 1986, his 26th birthday, and their engagement was announced to the public on 17 March 1986. They were married four months later, on 23 July 1986, at Westminster Abbey in London.
But Andrew's duties as a naval officer required him to stay away from home for long periods. According to Sarah, the couple saw each other 40 days a year in the first five years of their marriage. By 1991, the marriage was in trouble, and Sarah was finding life as a member of the royal family increasingly difficult.
The Duke and Duchess of York announced their separation on 19 March 1992 and confirmed their mutual decision to divorce in April 1996.
Sarah and Andrew welcomed two children together, daughters Princess Beatrice ( born 8 August 1988) and Princess Eugenie ( born 23 March 1990). Sarah is incredibly close to her children and often speaks of her pride in them.
The Duchess is also a grandmother to Beatrice's daughter Sienna, who was born 18 September 2021, and Eugenie's sons, August, who arrived on 9 February 2021, and Ernest, born on 30 May 2023.
As of 2023, Sarah's net worth was estimated to be around £1million. Her autobiography, My Story, earned her an advance of £800,000 and her books The Royal Switch and Bright Lights earned her an estimated £500,000.
Other book titles which earned her impressive deals include Tea For Ruby, Heart For A Compass, and Finding Sarah. And she also wrote the Budgie The Little Helicopter series of picture books, which was adapted into a TV series.
The Duchess has also earned money from writing Mills & Boon romances, and in 2022 she reportedly signed a major book deal with Serendipity Press agreeing to pen a staggering 22 books for the company, NBD.
According to senior sources quoted in The Sunday Telegraph, the Duchess' divorce settlement amounted to roughly £3million in total. At the time, it was reported that she also received £500,000 from the Queen  in order to buy a new house for her and her children.
Following their divorce, Andrew and Fergie reached a settlement meaning she still received £15,853 ($19,800) per year from the Royal Family.
Despite the fact that their fairytale marriage came to an end in 1996, Sarah and Prince Andrew continue to live together at Royal Lodge in Windsor.
The Duchess has spoken in the past about her life at the Royal Lodge. Prince Andrew moved in there with their girls once renovation work was completed in 2004, and it's thought his ex-wife joined them in 2008.
Despite having resided there for many years, Sarah has said does not class it as 'home'. ""When I'm in the UK I'm lucky enough to stay at Royal Lodge,"" she told the Telegraph. ""I wouldn't call it my home as that would be presumptuous.""
The 30-room property is a Grade II-listed residence and has a grand exterior and beautiful interiors.
Speaking about her unusual living arrangements on  USA Today , the Duchess previously said: ""Andrew and I, we're the happiest divorced couple in the world – extraordinary, really, isn't it. We live in the same house, but then, it's a big house, so that's ok. But I think it's really good that we believe in compromise and communication and compassion. And family.""

1NZOJ6KCUA_O6TOW77L493OUL2,Culture Secretary says 'thank you' to BP for £50m British Museum donation,Lawrence Matheson,"08:29, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/culture-secretary-says-thank-you-31971621,"Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer has praised oil companies for their donations to museums and art galleries, despite recent criticism from environmental groups.
Speaking at the launch of a report by think tank Onward, she said: ""It has to start with applauding not seeking to find fault with those organisations who give generously, whether that's through sponsorships or donations. Just look at the past few years.
""The Science Museum forced to abandon its backing by Shell. The National Portrait Gallery received a great deal of unwarranted criticism for its sponsorship by a law firm.""
She also thanked BP for its £50 million donation to the British Museum, calling it the biggest donation of its kind. Frazer argued that these sponsorship deals ultimately benefit everyone by helping to keep institutions accessible.
Ms Frazer stated that donations and sponsorships are crucial for maintaining free access to our top museums and art galleries. ""They help to drive tourism into the UK and help us retain our soft power abroad."" she added.
In December, the British Museum announced a £50 million deal with BP to fund its renovation plans. The museum said this would be used to redevelop the Bloomsbury site in central London and ensure its collection will be available to the public for ""generations to come"".
However, Chris Garrard, co-director of campaign group Culture Unstained, criticised the decision to renew the contract with BP as ""astonishingly out-of-touch and completely indefensible. We believe this decision is illegitimate and in breach of the museum's own climate commitments and sector-wide codes and will be seeking legal advice in order to mount a formal challenge to it.""
The National Portrait Gallery also faced backlash last year when it replaced BP as the sponsor for its portrait prize with a law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills, which has worked with the fossil fuel company. In 2021, young climate activists protested over the London Science Museum's sponsorship deal with Shell and Adani Green Energy by ""occupying"" the venue overnight.
They complained that the museum was accepting cash ""from some of the worst perpetrators of the climate crisis"". In her talk, Ms Frazer mentioned three main things she's working on making Gift Aid simpler; looking at better training for giving money to good causes; and helping people give more in their local areas and together with others.
She agreed that the government must ""protect and support those in our society, particularly the most disadvantaged"". But she also said that it ""cannot and should not always be the whole answer"".

Emily Kelly, who posts as thehungryflightattendant on Youtube, has explained what it is like to be working the aisles when the likes of Jamie Foxx and Mary-Kate Olsen turn up. The social media flight attendant was on shift when both the A-listers boarded.
She said that Jamie was travelling with his daughter, adding: ""Jamie was super friendly. He smiled a lot and was very nice, and he didn't ask for anything on the flight. His daughter was so sweet and so down to earth.""
When Mary-Kate settled herself onto the plane a short while later, the Emily said her ""inner child freaked out"" - having grown ""up watching the Olsen twins on everything"".
She added: ""When I saw that I was going to have her on my flight, oh my gosh. She was so tiny and so cute. She smiled, greeted us, made eye contact, was very friendly when she came on, but she went right to sleep and didn't ask for anything.""
Mary-Kate and Jamie F are far from the only VIPs Emily has spotted during her time in the skies. On one occasion she met Australian actor Joel Edgerton, who she described as ""one of the most, humble kind people I've ever met"". She was also excited to have met not one but two celebrity chefs throughout her travels - being an enthusiastic foodie herself and regular posting cooking tips on her social media channels.
The first was Paula Deen who the cabin crew member described as ""so friendly and so warm"" and ""just like a sweet, little warm grandma"". She also got to fly alongside celebrity chef Bobby Flay.
""He was in First Class and I was in the class right behind so I watched him the whole flight,"" she joked, adding that after the journey she braved asking for a selfie which he kindly obliged.
Comedian Michael Blackson was another star where she had a memorable encounter, after he shared a photo of them on Instagram. Although Emily noted she had an influx of followers, the rumours quickly appeared with people asking her if the pair were dating.
She recalled: ""I mean, he already had a million followers on Instagram, so that's famous, but this was before he was very, very famous. He put a picture of us on his Instagram and I got like 500 new followers from that.
""He was like 'this is my flight attendant' and tagged me and then people thought we were dating and were commenting on my Instagram. I was like 'oh my gosh, this is crazy' but he was super friendly [and] super, super kind.""

For those who are yet to watch some of the iconic movies that have been nominated for Oscars this year, all is not lost just because they're not on at the cinema any longer, thanks to some of them being available on streaming platforms.
For just £4.99, viewers can tune in to the world of Barbie Land on Amazon Prime, while Oppenheimer is also available on the streaming service. Meanwhile, Emma Stone's Poor Things is sadly only out in cinemas, and has not yet hit streaming platforms.

Saltburn may have become one of the most talked about films in recent weeks, but the movie was dramatically snubbed at the Oscars nominations.
The film, which stars Barry Keoghan, failed to get a single nomination. People have been sharing their thoughts on social media. One person wrote: ""Maestro did really well, that’s my biggest surprise in this list. Plus absolutely nothing for Saltburn. I thought they might get one.""

1PZRYH9EMN_T9Z1RRNYZVWE1KN,Luxury property with choice of slide or fireman's pole could be yours for £12k a month,Bradley JollyNews Reporter,"16:19, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/luxury-property-choice-slide-firemans-31949511,"This luxury property could be the ultimate fun house - as it has a tube slide and a fireman's pole to get downstairs.
The nine bed mansion in Lymington, Hampshire, offers the occupants the two fun alternatives to the stairs to get from the first and ground floors. The unique £5million mansion has been finished to an incredibly high standard and has CCTV, a cinema room and a hot tub. But it is the unusual whimsical additions of the stainless steel tube slide and fireman's pole that are likely to appeal to renters looking for something a bit different.
Monmouth House is available to rent at £12,000 a month, or as a short let for £22,000 a month with a minimum stay of six weeks, with estate agents John D Wood & Co.
Other quirky features include his and hers side-by-side baths facing a television and a motorbike bar in the living room. The Grade II Listed townhouse dates back to the 17th century but has been given a thoroughly modern makeover. It has six reception rooms, nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, as well as an additional one-bedroom annexe. Outside there is a hot tub, double garage and gated off-road parking.
The property is in the heart of Lymington, a stone's throw from the town quay and close to the New Forest National Park.  Kat Mitchell, senior lettings manager at John D Wood & Co., said: ""This property presents a rare opportunity for a tenant to experience a thoughtfully designed residence with lots of fun features.
""It's not just a dwelling; it's an invitation to a distinctive way of living, where unexpected elements add a touch of joy to your daily routine. A viewing of this one-of-a-kind property is highly recommended to fully appreciate the level of accommodation and style provided.""
It comes after a “peaceful” London studio flat went up for rent, with a very unique feature - a shower attached to a kitchenette. The rental property in Wood Green, north London - dubbed “excellent value for money” on the listing - also features a bed just inches away from the kitchen sink.
It means you must eat, sleep, and shower all in the same room - however the flat does come with the small grace of an en-suite toilet separate to the rest of the room. On top of this, the ""property"" also has no living room - but there it does feature a single chair, crammed in next to the wardrobe."
1T2CRBUPEK_2M1SW2ND79HSPGH,Princess Charlotte's extraordinary gesture from late Queen that changed royals forever,Beth Hardie,"15:40, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/princess-charlottes-extraordinary-gesture-late-31967611,"Princess Charlotte was saved from an unfair law affecting her and other female royals' futures when the late Queen agreed an outdated tradition needed to be changed.
The late Queen will be remembered as one of the leading figures of the 20th century who was greatly admired for her dedication to duty. But to her great-grandchildren, she will always be their beloved 'Gan-Gan' who cherished spending time with her family.
In her latter years, her youngest relatives including the Prince and Princess of Wales' children are said to have brought her much joy. One part of her legacy that she left behind was carrying out a touching gesture that directly affected her great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte - and saved her from an unfair shift in royal status that had impacted the late Queen's daughter Princess Anne.
The gesture actually came before the birth of Prince George over 10 years ago as at the time, males always took precedence in the line of succession. When Anne was born as the Queen's second child, she was just behind older brother King Charles in the pecking order.
But the law at the time meant Anne was moved down the line of succession when her brothers Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were born because sons took precedence over daughters. However, in 2013, the Queen issued the Succession of the Crown Act, which updated royal laws and meant that children would have equal rights to the throne regardless of their gender. As a boy, George's place as then third - and now second - in line to the throne did not change, but the Queen's rule meant that Charlotte kept her place and was not bumped down when Prince Louis arrived in 2018.
Constitutional expert Iain MacMarthanne explained: ""The 2013 Act sought to bring multiple pieces of outdated and discriminatory legislation relating to the monarchy up to date. Through this Act male primogeniture was abolished, allowing the firstborn child irrespective of gender to become heir apparent.
""The disqualification from inheriting the throne by marrying a Catholic was removed; and the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 was repealed, resulting in only the first six in line to the throne being required to obtain the sovereign's permission.""
Meanwhile, it is not the only link that eight-year-old Charlotte has to her great-grandmother the late Queen. One of her middle names is Elizabeth, a sweet nod to the former monarch with the young princess's full name being Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. Similarly, when Prince Harry and Meghan welcomed their daughter in 2021, she was named Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - with Lilibet being a pet name that the late Queen was given. Incredibly, nine of the late monarch's descendants are named in her honour.
Other members of the family to be named after the former monarch include Princess Beatrice (Beatrice Elizabeth Mary), Zara Tindall (Zara Anne Elizabeth) Isla Phillips (Isla Elizabeth) and Lady Louise Windsor (Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary).

Research has shown that around 25 percent of adults use the mouth rinse daily, but Dr Sermed Mezher has highlighted that the product could destroy 'good' bacteria and increase the risk of high blood pressure.
High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can be defined as having sustained blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above, explains NHS Inform. The 'silent killer' is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks.
Taking to TikTok, the London doctor alerted followers: ""Don't use mouthwash, your health will thank you for it."" He added: ""Your mouth is filled with millions of this bacteria and even though a human mouth is technically dirtier than a dog's mouth, not all of the bacteria want to see you on a spit roast.
""See, some of the bacteria actually produce a chemical that's very important called nitric oxide and when we kill them, what actually happens?"" He then referenced a study, carried out by dentist and epidemiologist Kaumudi Joshipura, who explored the impact of mouthwash on blood pressure.
Around 1,000 participants were enrolled for the research, with nearly 50 percent of them using mouthwash regularly. Across the duration of the longitudinal study, around 12 percent of candidates developed high blood pressure. ""This blew my mind, but the people who were taking mouthwash were twice as likely to get high blood pressure compared to those who weren't,"" Dr Mezher said.
He added: ""This is very important as high blood pressure is linked to so many adverse health outcomes like heart attacks and strokes and even vascular problems with the legs. So these mouth bacteria help lower your blood pressure - don't kill them.""
Another study discovered that Chlorhexidine mouthwash could alter your mouth's microbiome, increasing acidity and heightening the risk of tooth damage, reports Real Simple. The same research found that antibacterial mouthwash could reduce the blood-pressure-lowering effect of exercise by around 60 percent.
However, mouthwash has also been linked to various health benefits, especially for preventing tooth problems. Dentist Parneet Sehmi said: ""Particularly with the spread of viruses, mouthwash can help disinfect the mouth and lower the risk of bacteria.""
Shocking statistics have shown that almost three-quarters of Brits are without their full set of natural teeth, and six percent have none left at all. Dr Abel Azizi, from Harley Private Dentist Clinic, has revealed his top tips for improving oral hygiene. These include:
Brush after eating - Brush your teeth about 30-minutes after eating sugary foods. This allows time for your saliva to naturally neutralise some of the acids produced by the sugar. Use a fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristle toothbrush for effective cleaning.
Floss regularly - Flossing helps remove food particles and plaque from between your teeth where a toothbrush can’t reach effectively, reducing the risk of decay between teeth.
Use mouthwash - Consider using an antimicrobial or fluoride mouthwash after brushing. This can help kill bacteria, strengthen enamel, and maintain a healthier oral environment.
Chew sugar-free gum - Chewing sugar-free gum can stimulate saliva production, which aids in neutralising acids and washing away food particles. Look for gum with xylitol, a sugar substitute that can help inhibit bacterial growth.
Stay hydrated - Drinking water throughout the day helps rinse your mouth and dilute sugars and acids, reducing their impact on your teeth.
Rinse with water - After consuming sugary foods, rinse your mouth with water to help wash away residual sugars and acids."

The ice cream chain closed its last permanent branch in 2015 but has returned every now and then in the form of pop-up shops, including one within John Lewis’ flagship on Oxford Street. Franchise World reports that Häagen-Dazs, which was established in 1960, will focus on Greater London as one of its first locations for new stores.
Häagen-Dazs shops offer a selection of 24 flavours, as well as signature creations, drinks, pastries and cakes. Globally, the ice cream brand has 850 shops across 40 countries.
Häagen-Dazs is looking for franchise partners to run its stores, and said they should be passionate about these three things: ""Continuing to empower its reputation of excellence. Providing its customers with the highest quality ice cream in the world. And providing its franchisees with exceptional support and successful opportunities.""
But Häagen-Dazs is not the only much-missed brand that could be making a comeback. The German CEO who now runs Woolworths says the high street chain could also return to the UK.
Roman Heini is leading an expansion of Woolworth Germany in Europe and says new UK shops are on his “bucket list”. Once famed for their pick and mix sweet counters, the stores vanished from town centres when it collapsed into administration in 2009.
Mr Heini said: “I don’t know of any brands where the recognition will be as high as it is in Britain, without having any stores. We have secured all the trademarks for the brand for the whole of Europe, so we could operate if we make the decision. It may be in the mix for the mid or long-term future.”
Woolworth Germany also collapsed into insolvency in 2009 but made a comeback, expanding into Austria and Poland. It has over 600 shops, does not sell online and specialises in own-brand household goods and clothing, including underwear.
Mr Heini, previously boss of Aldi and Lidl, told trade mag Retail Week: “There are over 300 million potential consumers in Europe and no dominating player. The market is still there to be divided between the potential players for the future.”"

The heir to the throne has been seen visiting his wife during her stay at The London Clinic, where she underwent a successful operation last week. Kate is not expected to resume public duties until at least Easter following the procedure. The nature of the princess's condition has not been revealed although Kensington Palace confirmed it was not cancerous. It is serious enough, however, for William to be postponing official duties too while his wife is in hospital and in the immediate aftermath.
William and Kate will celebrate their 13th wedding anniversary this year and have known each other for more than 20 years after meeting as students at St Andrews University. The pair had massively different upbringings with William born into royalty while Kate enjoyed a relatively normal middle-class childhood.
So when she agreed to marry William after he popped the question during a romantic trip to Kenya, she would have known it would be life-changing in more than one way. And to prove his love for his future wife, at the time he is said to have made a personal vow to Kate's parents Carole and Michael - he would take care of her.
Will Prince Harry ever heal the rift with the Royal Family? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
According to the Daily Mail's royal correspondent Rebecca English: ""He, more than anyone, knew the personal sacrifices she was making to be with the man she loved."" And given Kate's current health struggle, she added: ""It’s why I know he will bend heaven and earth to be at her side now and do the best for their little family. However long it takes.""
With William stepping back from official duties for several weeks he will juggle looking after children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis and care for his wife. The family live in Adelaide Cottage in Windsor's Home Park and will also be supported by their staff, including loyal, long-standing nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. Kate's family including her parents and siblings Pippa Matthews and James Middleton are also expected to be hands-on in helping the Waleses navigate the next few months as the princess recovers.
With the King due in hospital this week for corrective treatment for his benign condition and William – the next in line to the throne – and Kate out of action for the immediate future, Charles’s slimmed down monarchy – with three of the most senior royals missing – has been put under pressure in a way not seen before during his reign.
Queen Camilla is still carrying out engagements, joining the Princess Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra as the current working monarchy – with the latter two appearing increasingly frail in recent years. All are in their 70s and 80s except for Edward, who turns 60 in March, and Sophie, who celebrates her 59th birthday on Saturday. Prince Harry, whose controversial accusations have left the royals reeling, and disgraced Prince Andrew remain in the line of succession but both have stepped down as working royals."

Citizens Advice says it expects this to be its busiest ever winter for helping people who cannot afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its analysis reveals that last year 1.7 million people disconnected at least once a month.
Its warning comes just as energy suppliers have been allowed to restart forced installations of prepayment meters after past controversy. And 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity, unable to make a hot meal or take a warm shower, because they couldn’t afford to top up.
Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Our frontline advisers are helping more people than ever who can’t pay their energy bill. Record numbers are in debt to their supplier and millions with a prepayment meter are too often going without heating and hot meals because they can’t afford to top up.
“The government has not provided new energy bill support for those in need and has run out of time to develop the long-term approach it promised by April 2024. Without immediate action, we risk re-running this same crisis every winter.”
Has your energy supply been cut off? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk
Peter Smith, director of policy at fuel poverty group National Energy, said: “Households underheating their homes can be dangerous both physically and mentally, and even fatal. Prepayment meter customers, in particular, are at risk of not being able to top up. They have had to pay dearly from day one of the energy crisis and are still facing energy bills almost double what they were at the start of it, two years ago.”
An Ofgem spokesman said: ""Ofgem shares the concerns of Citizens Advice about the issue of rising debt and customers self-disconnecting from their energy supply amid the wider cost of living pressures. We already have introduced tougher rules to make sure that energy companies do more to spot the signs when a customer may be struggling and step in to offer support, including working out affordable payment plans and providing emergency credit to reduce the risk of self-disconnection.
""We work closely with Citizens Advice and other consumer groups and charities to address the issues people are facing and we will continue to explore more options to help struggling and vulnerable customers."" Vulnerable customers can sign up for assistance via the free priority services register via the Ofgem website."

The banking group, which also owns Halifax and the Bank of Scotland (BoS), said it will also be creating around 830 new roles as part of the strategy, resulting in a ""net reduction"" of 769 jobs. The new jobs will be part of the group's expanded Relationship Growth team, which is part of its Consumer Relationships business.
Lloyds said the new roles will help deliver an ""improved service"" which will give customers more opportunities to see Lloyds staff in branch, through video meetings, or over the phone - without having to wait for appointments as often. The move is part of plans launched in 2022 which aimed to make the group a ""leading digital bank"".
Lloyds said it will be ""supporting"" its staff whether they are taking up one of the 830 new roles, moving to a different role elsewhere, or leaving the Group. It also notes that there will be ""no role reductions"" for most of its junior positions and it will be offering voluntary redundancy in some situations.
A spokeswoman for the bank said: ""As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it's important our people are available when it matters most. We're introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.""
According to the banking group, only 8% of its more than 21 million banking customers choose to bank with them exclusively through its high street branches, whilst four out of five now use online banking.
Over the last year, like other major high street banks, Lloyds announced a whole raft of branch closures across the country. In November 2023, the bank shared that it would be closing a further 45 more branches which took the total of sites closed across Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland in 2023 and 2023 to 276.
Last year, 152 Lloyds, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland branches closed and this year 123 are planned to shut their doors."
279G1IB9C9_MG3C1FK9LGCQK11,Brits told they can opt out of flights on plane model which lost door mid-flight,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"12:25, 24 Jan 2024",20240117,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/brits-told-can-opt-out-31955171,"Passengers can now avoid flying on a particular plane which spectacularly lost a door mid-flight this month.
Online travel agent Kayak has added filters to let users exclude flights that use Boeing’s 737 Max planes. The option comes after a piece of fuselage fell off an Alaska Airlines flight using the aircraft. The incident has led to a surge of people trying to avoid flying on the airline, the Guardian reports.
Passengers have been able to choose or exclude specific models of planes on Kayak since 2019. However, after the little used and known-about tool received a 15 time boost in popularity following the door incident.
Kayak first introduced an aircraft filter in March 2019, to add and exclude specific models of plane, but the company says it saw little use compared with the more prominent filters of the number of stops or airports.
This has prompted the online travel agent to make the setting more prominent on the search page and let passengers choose between 737 Max 8 and Max 9 planes - only the latter has been grounded by America’s Federal Aviation Administration.
""Whether you’re searching by cabin class, flight quality or aircraft type, Kayak’s filters aim to provide travellers with all the information they need to make smart decisions and travel with confidence,"" a company spokesperson said.
At the end of last week the USA's Federal Aviation Administration recommended that airlines inspect the door plugs on certain Boeing 737s that are older than the Max 9 jetliner that suffered a blowout. The FAA said door plugs on one older version of the 737, called the 737-900ER, are identical in design to those on the Max 9, and some airlines ""have noted findings with bolts during the maintenance inspections"".
The FAA issued a safety alert late Sunday. As soon as possible, airlines should visually inspect four places where a bolt, nut and pin secure the door plug to the plane, the agency said. The door plugs are panels that seal holes left for extra doors when the number of seats is not enough to trigger a requirement for more emergency-evacuation exits. From inside the plane, they look like a regular window.
The FAA said that 737-900ERs have logged 3.9 million flights without any known issues involving the door plugs. By contrast, the Max 9 that suffered the blowout had made only 145 flights.
One of the two door plugs on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 flew off the plane in midflight on January 5. Passengers and investigators have described a violent decompression as air rushed out of the pressurized cabin at 16,000 feet over Oregon.
The plane made an emergency landing with a hole in its side, and no serious injuries were reported. On a mostly full plane, no one was sitting in the two seats nearest the panel that blew out.
The FAA has grounded all Max 9s with door plugs instead of regular doors in the back of the cabin. Alaska and United Airlines are the only U.S. carriers to use the plane. ""We fully support the FAA and our customers in this action,"" a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement Monday."

Host Fiona Bruce was forced to intervene during the fiery exchange in Thursday night's show, which was filmed in Gillingham, Kent.
Right-wing pundit Konstantin Kisin said: ""I think at a cultural level there's something perhaps even more important which is we've got to stop talking down our country.

The 88-year-old convicted rapist has been granted conditional release from a prison for the mentally ill following appeal. It comes after he was allegedly seen visiting local cafes near Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau, Austria. Fritzl is set to be moved to a regular prison before he is eligible for release in March - though the decision is not yet legally binding.
Fritzl kept his daughter Elisabeth as his sex slave, locked in the cellar of his house of horrors in Amstetten in Lower Austria State, from the age of 18 to 42. It wasn't until he took one of the children born to his daughter to hospital due to a life-threatening illness that his heinous crimes were discovered and she was able to escape.
The pensioner is eligible for parole in March of this year under Austria's lenient sentencing laws, and may live in a care home until he dies. Those who have been given a life sentence in the country can apply for a conditional release after 15 years. Inmates who are judged ready for parole can be freed, depending on their conduct and mental and physical condition.
After the court hearing today, Fritzl's attorney, Astrid Wagner, said: ""We were successful. It was a long hearing. He told again how he regrets what he did. He was actually close to tears. In summary, the court came to the conclusion that my client is actually no longer dangerous.""
Fritzl, who changed his name to Mayrhoff in an alleged attempt to evade physical attacks by other inmates, has reportedly applied for an early release several times in the past two years. His lawyer Wagner, who last year published a book based on a series of his letters, suggested that a new life in a care home is ""within the bounds of possibility"".
She said: ""This man is almost 90 years old and his mental condition is deteriorating. He needs support and care."" She explained that she is able to communicate normally with him most of the time apart from the ""odd lapses"", including a delusion that his daughter had married Boris Becker. ""The next time I saw him, he told me they had broken up"", she said.
Fritzl's daughter Elisabeth has since changed her name and has received support from the authorities in protecting her identity and the well-being of her children. One of them, who died at birth with breathing difficulties, was heartlessly tossed in a furnace by Fritzl. Three were brought up in the basement with their mother, and three others were brought up as foundlings by sick Fritzl and his wife Rosemarie.
In an interview last year with The Sun, Fritzl said he hoped to see his family one day and wanted a reconciliation with his 84-year-old former wife. ""I definitely believe that I am going to see them again one day,"" he said. ""I do understand people who want me to die in jail. But I want to experience freedom one day.""
Fritzl's wife Rosemarie reportedly fled the home she shared with Fritzl soon after the scandal broke, and now tries to supplement her meager pension by selling homemade bags and paintings of flowers. She has reportedly mended her relationship with Elisabeth and visits her grandchildren once a week.
Fritzl is now suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is said to be so frail that he now needs a walking frame to get around. In 2019, it was reported that Fritzl's health was declining rapidly and that he lives apart from the rest of the prison population. A fellow prisoner told local media: ""Fritzl was and still is separated from everyone else. He has totally withdrawn himself and barely leaves his cell. He doesn't want contact with others, and all together it looks as though he has resigned himself to dying.""
In a bizarre statement, Ms Wagner told German newspaper Bild: ""Fritzl is completely harmless today. I wouldn't be afraid to move into a shared apartment with him or live in a home with him. He has no sex drive anymore. He barricades himself in his solitary cell, watches a lot of TV, grows tomatoes, writes about his life as an electrical engineer. He sunbathes through the bars, does gymnastics, cares a lot about his figure and wants to live to be 100.""
Ms Wagner claims the depraved father 'regrets' what he did. She added: ""He says he has nightmares and wakes up in the middle of the night. He's not a monster, he's still human. He committed terrible acts for years, became delirious, and says himself that he was overwhelmed by his sexual drive. But he regrets his actions - very sincerely in my opinion. Of course he often represses his great, great guilt, otherwise he wouldn't be able to continue living."""

Doctors tried to save the baby girl after the young mother, Hanadi Abu Amsha, was killed in an air strike, according to reports by Palestinian news outlets. After the young mother died, doctors quickly removed the baby from her womb and treated her in an incubator.
The baby girl is currently in the intensive care unit at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, which is in central Gaza, according to reports. It is presumed that all of the child's family are dead. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was recently described as the ""stuff of nightmares"" by an American doctor.
Photos shared from the hospital yesterday show the tiny baby being cared for by nurses working there. She is pictured in the incubator being fed with a bottle. The baby was brought to the hospital in December, the Palestinian Wafa News Agency said in a video report.
It is believed her mother was killed at the site of where a school once stood in Gaza, although this has not been independently verified. The newborn girl initially struggled for oxygen when she was born, but this was expected after her mother died.
And as yet the authorities have been unable to track down any other relatives of the baby. It is understood that she will be put up for adoption when she has been nursed back to health at the hospital.
Estimates suggest around 10,000 children, or one in every 150, have been killed since the war broke out. And nearly 20,000 babies have been born into conditions ‘beyond belief’ in Gaza since last October, according to UNICEF, the UN children’s agency.
The organisation last week described Gaza as the “most dangerous place in the world to be a child” as the war continues. Speaking after his most recent visit to Gaza, Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF Ted Chaiban said Gaza’s situation has moved from “catastrophic to near collapse”.
He added: “This is a war against children. But these truths do not seem to be getting across. Of the nearly 25,000 people who have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the escalation of hostilities, up to 70% are women and children.”
It is believed pressure from the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital has increased in recent days, with people inside believed to be fleeing for their lives, according to Al Jazeera. In an NPR report on 10 January, Dr Seema Jilani from the US described how in the hospital there were “children lying on the ground, a double amputation on one child, and there are no beds available”.
She added: “There's not really room or space for us to breathe or think. I've always told myself there's not much we can do in medicine, but we can treat pain and it's no longer true anymore, so we cannot even offer any comfort here. There is no death with dignity when you're lying on the ground of an emergency room in Gaza.”
She described how the hospital is close to collapse, with 500 patients arriving in a single night and a severe lack of supplies to treat people."

The fan-favourite character - played by Lucy Pargeter - was urged by her lover Dr Liam Cavanagh to go to the doctor after he spotted a lump in her breast whilst the pair were being intimate. Worried, given that her mother Faith Dingle - played by Sally Dexter, died of breast cancer, she headed to the doctors, where she was seen quickly and given a biopsy.
Tonight, she was given the results that she has triple negative breast cancer, no doubt giving her fears about the future. Her mother Faith died of breast cancer in sad scenes to mark the soap's 50th anniversary.
Speaking about the storyline previously, Lucy - who plays Chas - shared: ""When the producers first discussed this storyline with me I knew I didn’t want us to shy away from any aspect of this diagnosis for Chas. She saw her own mother ultimately die after an incurable breast cancer diagnosis, so for Chas to receive a breast cancer diagnosis herself, makes it all the more poignant.
""Our audience knows her so well, they have seen her relationships, know her faults, her passions, her insecurities, quirks and fears. So for them to see this story play out will be more meaningful given everything that has happened to both her and her mother. I think this is the beauty of our genre ‘Soap’. However, I am more than aware of the huge responsibility with us telling this story. I hope we can do it justice. It won’t be all doom and gloom, there will be ups and downs just like with anything. But I hope it looks and feels real. And if just a few people get help for breast changes that do not feel or look right, it could do some good too.""
Kate Brooks, show producer, added: ""When this story was first pitched, we were acutely aware how important it was to explore this. With Chas’s family history of breast cancer and Chas being such a strong character, and in many ways the bedrock of the Dingles, we wanted to show the impact on not just her, but her immediate family. With Lucy Pargeter’s innate ability to showcase Chas’s vulnerabilities beneath her hardened exterior, we knew she was absolutely the right character to play this with.""
Triple-negative breast cancer is described by Cancer Research UK as a type of cancer which does not have receptors for either the hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, or a protein known as Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2.
A biopsy is usually taken and tested by a doctor, who will test to see if they can locate these receptors. Triple-negative breast cancer usually develops in women under 40 years and is much more rare in men.

A TV source recently said that Coronation bosses have always backed Bill and shows their full support. They added: ""He knows he has a job for life and the thing is, he needs it now. The tax issue has been rumbling on a long time but it is still quite shocking. ""
Speaking to The Sun, the source continued: ""Obviously, everyone is worried about the impact all of this could have on someone of Bill’s age. The risk of being made bankrupt is tough for anyone, but for a 91-year-old it’s a huge worry.But Bill’s doing fine in the circumstances and is in a determined mood.He just wants to get it all sorted out and is getting the advice he needs.""
Bill has now told friends that he has no plans to stop working and with his drama with HMRC still looming over his head, he ""doesn't exactly have much choice now."" Papers at lodged at the High Court in London listed Bill as the debtor with HMRC - and the governing body as the petitioner. A Coronation Street spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry to hear of Bill’s financial situation. Bill has an ongoing contract and remains a much-loved member of the cast.""
HMRC said: ""We take a supportive approach to dealing with customers who have tax debts, and do everything we can to help those who engage with us to get out of debt. We only petition for bankruptcy as a last resort."" In 2018 the Mirror revealed that the star faced a huge bill after investing in a £500million Cayman Islands tax avoidance scheme. It was not known how much he had invested in Twofold First Services LLP, which is owned by a company in the Cayman Islands. It was reported that Bill was one of 288 investors who entered the scheme and put in an estimated £1.75million.
Earlier this week, papers seen by The Mirror showed he joined the scheme in 2012. It involved claiming tax relief from the artificial losses of a land-owning business. The arrangement meant investors could use the paper loss to reduce their income tax.
A tribunal ruled in favour of HMRC, who argued that Twofold was ""a tax avoidance arrangement"". It was branded ""abusive and artificial"" by the Treasury. Explaining why a bankruptcy petition is issued, a spokesperson for HMRC said: ""When we file a petition for bankruptcy that is us applying to the court in order to allow us to obtain a bankruptcy order.""
He added: ""We might have an outstanding tax debt, if someone refused to engage with us and pay the tax that is due, then as a last resort we will issue a bankruptcy action and issuing petition for bankruptcy is obviously how we go about that in terms of the correct legal process. That is in order to recover the tax that they owe but as I say, it is the sort of thing we do as a last resort.""
Bill was declared bankrupt 24 years ago after he sued a newspaper for describing him as “boring”. He was awarded £50,000 in damages but this was the same amount he had previously turned down in an out of court settlement, leaving him liable to pay £120,000 in legal fees.

Despite winning the primary and thanking his supporters, the former president took time to repeatedly insult Haley, who came second in the race, and left him the runaway favourite for the Republican nomination.
Trump said: ""Let's not have someone take a victory when she had a very bad night,"" and added, ""Just a little note to Nikki: She's not going to win."" He also referred to her as an ""imposter"".

This isn't the first time Trump has targeted Haley with personal insults. Last week, he was accused of using a racist dog whistle against her by suggesting she wasn't eligible for presidency because her parents are Indian immigrants.

Days later, Trump referred to her as Nikki ""Nimrada"" Haley, hinting there was something suspicious about her being born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa.
Despite clarifying that she has used her middle name, Haley, from birth and stating it's her married name, Trump didn't relent despite facing accusations of racism. He took to his platform, Truth Social, to further his critique, awkwardly misspelling Haley's name as ""Nimbra"", not once, but three times in a single post leaving no room for anyone to presume it as a typo.
The robust Haley ignored the subtle abuse, reflecting it upon Trump's typical behaviour. ""The name-calling - I know President Trump well. That's what he does when he feels threatened. That's what he does when he feels insecure,"" she said, according to The Hill. ""I don't take these things personally; it doesn't bother me. I know him very well, and this is what he does. I know that I am a threat; I know that's why he's doing that.""
A few days later on January 19, during a New Hampshire rally, Trump intensified his attack on Haley, branding her a ""birdbrain"". He questioned her presidential potential stating that former South Carolina governor ""is not presidential timber"", adding ""she's not going to be chosen as the vice president"".
""She's not going to fight like we fight. We fight and we had four of the greatest years,"" continued Trump about Haley, labelling his own administration as ""one of the greatest"".

2NR14ZGFE0_DQIJ8KTAC8ZE272,Jamie Dornan's glitzy love life from Keira Knighley and Sienna Miller splits to famous wife,Frances KindonFeatures Editor,"12:40, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/jamie-dornans-glitzy-love-life-31947015,"Before settling down, actor Jamie Dornan was linked to a slew a Hollywood's female stars.
The Northern Irish star - who was recently treated for a suspected heart attack -started dating actor-turned-musician Amelia Warner in 2010 after meeting her at a mutual friend's party, and they tied the knot three years later. They went on to have three daughters, Dulcie, 10, Elva, seven, and Alberta, four, and reportedly live in a £1.75million farmhouse in the Cotswolds, having moved from LA.
But before that Jamie, 41, was previously linked to Kiera Knightley, Sienna Miller, Lindsay Lohan and Kate Moss. He dated Keira from 2003 until 2005, and was quoted as saying that he felt inferior as her fame increased. ""There is a big pressure when you go out with someone like Keira,"" he once told the Mail on Sunday.
""You can feel a bit second-rate and that's what started to happen. It's not like I was bringing the bread to the table - and that can start to affect everything. Keira could see what I was going through and it would have been better if I'd kept it hidden from her.""
He went on to reportedly date Sienna, but also crushed on his wife Amelia, 41, long before they met. He said on Face to Face in 2018: ""I had this weird thing where I always felt that if I met her that we would just get on. It was just a strange thing. Something about her eyes. I just thought that we would work.""
The actor revealed more details about their first meeting on The Late Late Show when he told James Corden: ""She'd been an actor so I knew who she was. I always fancied her, and we were doing karaoke and... a friend of ours said, 'Listen, Amelia Warner's at a house party up by Los Feliz and she's single.' I literally dropped the mic and was like, you know, ran for the hills.""
While the Belfast star had previously dated Keira Knightley, Amelia had a short non-legal marriage with Colin Farrell which only lasted four months. Speaking about getting together with Amelia, Jamie told the Belfast Telegraph: ""I was smitten with her from the start, I really was. I'm more in love with her today than I was at the start.""
A few years after they got married, Jamie admitted he was 'delighted' to have a wife so he no longer has to clear up speculation about his love life. When asked about not having to deal with rumours, he told Marie Claire: ""Absolutely delighted. But saying that, people like to go after your family and sh*t as well. It's one of the main reasons I left social media. They say horrific things about your loved ones, and so it opens up fast... but yes, the idea of being single makes me instantly sweat.""
The Irish actor was also quick to rubbish any rumours of a rift with his Fifty Shades co-star, Dakota Johnson. He said: ""We get on very well, we make each other laugh and we're comfortable with each other, which is very important because Jesus, if I didn't get on with her... I've heard horror stories of that happening. Actors who have to do intimate things with another actor and they just don't get on... It's not good.""
Jamie is best known for playing Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades franchise and is currently on screens portraying Elliot Stanley in the drama series The Tourist, while Amelia is an award-winning composer with music in numerous films including Wild Mountain Thyme - which her husband co-starred in alongside Emily Blunt."

Some customers claimed they weren’t told their order was cancelled until hours after it was due to arrive. Others complained they couldn't even visit their nearest Tesco in person to do their food shop, due to supermarkets closing early on Sundays. Tesco has since apologised and blamed “technical issues” for the cancellations.
It is unclear exactly how many people were affected. Anyone who had their order cancelled is being advised by the supermarket to replace their order. Reports of problems peaked at 9am on the Downdetector website, with over 1,200 complaints logged.
Customers took to X/Twitter to express their frustration. One person said: “My delivery was meant to be here between 7-8 but there’s no updates to say it’s delayed. Order not cancelled and you’ve taken my money.” Another posted: “Grocery shop cancelled less than 3 hours before delivery slot. No explanation, no compensation offered. Surely you can do better than this Tesco?”
A third said: “Tesco you are a shambles today and I want answers because you’ve took money from my account yet no shopping and no updates.” Tesco issued the following statement yesterday afternoon and warned its customer service team was experiencing high call volumes.
The supermarket said: “Due to technical issues we’ve had to cancel some orders and our customer service team are experiencing high contact volumes. Unfortunately, we’re unable to reschedule these orders. To place a new order visit Tesco.com/groceries. We apologise for the inconvenience.”

A Tesco spokesperson told The Mirror this morning: “We’ve fixed a technical issue that meant we had to cancel some online orders yesterday. Our technical team worked around the clock to fix it and customers who were impacted have been contacted directly. We apologise again for the inconvenience.”
It comes after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons all agreed to start selling smaller vegetables after weather disrupted crop growth. Heavy rainfall over late autumn, Christmas and into the New Year, has affected crops of cauliflowers, sprouts, cabbages and leeks in Lincolnshire, East Anglia, Cornwall and Scotland.
Due to this, there has been a relaxation on size requirements for these items. This means supermarkets will be selling the items, but they will be smaller than usual. Under the arrangement, farmers will supply grocers with more of their crop so they do not have to sell at lower prices on the open market."

The ex-president was speaking at an event in Rochester when he made odd comments about forts and their renaming, saying: ""We won world wars out of forts. Fort Benning, Fort This, Fort That, many forts,"" in his usual style.
He continued: ""They changed the name, we won wars out of these forts, they changed the name, they changed the name of the forts. A lot of people aren't too happy about that,"" It's thought he was talking about the nine US military institutions named after Confederate generals, which have since been renamed in honour of people who didn't fight against the United States.

Trump repeated: ""They changed the name of a lot of our forts. We won two world wars out of a lot of these forts and they changed the name,"" adding, ""It's unbelievable."" His remarks sparked confusion and worry about his mental state, with Democrat strategist Keith Edwards stating: "" Donald Trump is experiencing huge mental decline. The media has to start taking this seriously.""
A closer look at the renamed institutions raises further questions over Trump's rant. Fort Benning in Georgia was named after Henry L. Benning, a Confederate general and known ""virulent white supremacist"". Last year, it was renamed in honour of Lt. Gen. Hal Moore and his wife, Julie Compton Moore - dubbed by Military.com as ""one of the Army's most influential couples"".

The renaming of the forts was an effort to remove an ""entire category of memorials venerating the Confederacy"", according to NPR journalist Juana Summers on flagship program All Things Considered. The program was celebrating the final name change of the nine U.S. Army bases, with a Georgia institution turning from Fort Gordon into Fort Eisenhower.
""The bases were named for men who fought against the very army that uses them and for the right to own slaves. The new names are different,"" explained Jay Price, military reporter for WUNC. ""Bases were renamed for the first woman to win the Medal of Honor, a Hispanic Army hero and now Eisenhower, the general who planned and led the D-Day invasion and later became president, people who did big things for their nation rather than against it.""
In his last rally before today's New Hampshire primaries, Donald Trump was joined on stage in Laconia by his former rivals for the Republican nomination, Sen. Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy and Gov. Doug Burgum. This move was meant to show that the Republican Party is ""united and ready to take on Joe Biden,"" a source told Fox News Digital.
Recent polls suggest it will likely be an easy win for Trump, who is ahead of his opponent Gov. Nikki Haley by double-digits. The race narrowed down to two after Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out and endorsed Trump on Sunday.

2QZVBZEDWE_5QLBMQ24T1JCHHI,"MoD lied for 40 years that irradiated British troops had a ""zero dose""",Susie BonifaceReporter,"19:52, 24 Jan 2024Updated19:56, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mod-lied-years-zero-radiation-31957784,"For 40 years, the Ministry of Defence has been clear about the cause of Kenneth Measures’ death from a rare type of lung cancer.
A letter written in February 1984 by a junior minister told his family: “The information from the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment shows Mr Measures received a zero radiation dose from the United Kingdom nuclear tests.”
Now the Mirror can reveal proof that the official line is part of a cover-up, in which thousands of families, inquests and court hearings, have been misled, to deny a multi-million pound liability.
The truth is that British and Commonwealth troops were deliberately exposed to the equivalent of up to 800 dental x-rays in just a day during Cold War radiation experiments - dramatically raising their risk of cancer.
Kenneth, of Helston, Cornwall, was just 54 when he died at the end of 1983. It had been 36 years since he had followed orders to witness four nuclear bombs, with a combined yield 200 times that of the atomic blast which flattened Hiroshima.
A pathologist noted at his post mortem that secondary tumours had grown on his spine, and that he had wasted away to almost nothing.
His widow Valerie did not believe her fighting-fit husband, whose job had been to service the helicopters flying in and out of Ground Zero, would have contracted the disease had he not been irradiated.
His type of cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, is rarely seen in anyone so young, and can be caused by radiation exposure.
Valerie battled for years, fought for an inquest, and badgered the coroner’s officer to have her husband’s body tested for radiation. She wrote to her MP and demanded answers, but got back the official line from the MoD that, according to the atomic scientists in charge of the records, Ken had a ""zero radiation dose"".
“She just hit a brick wall, and in the end it made her mentally and physically ill. The inquest came back saying natural causes. She got depression, and it was decided that it was better to just shelve it,” said daughter Melanie.
“She put all my dad’s stuff in a box and put it away. A few years ago she was diagnosed with dementia, and when we applied for dad’s nuclear test medal on her behalf we showed it to her, but she didn’t really know what it was. She died just before Christmas, and she never did find out the truth.”
Around 22,000 servicemen took part in bomb tests in Australia and the Pacific between 1952 and 1967. Most were ordered to watch explosions, and live near Ground Zero. Others were ordered to fly, sail, and crawl through fallout in horrifying experiments.
The Ministry of Defence admits that just 23% of them were monitored for radiation. They were given a badge made from camera film, which could be developed to detect exposure.
The results - claiming almost two-thirds of them had a ‘zero dose’ - have been relied upon by the MoD ever since to reject war pensions, block wrongful death rulings from coroners, and to defeat compensation lawsuits.
As Valerie began asking questions, other wives and veterans were doing the same. In September 1984, the Mirror's sister paper the Sunday People launched a front page investigation into ‘Our Atom Bomb Kids’, and demanded action.
The scandal exploded, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was forced into ordering a scientific study of the veterans’ deaths from the National Radiological Protection Board. In Parliament, she insisted: “No special measures to monitor the long-term health of military personnel were taken, because the radiation exposure records indicated that they had not been exposed to any significant health hazard.”
But the scientists discovered the records were bogus. That damning fact was never made public when a summary of their research was announced in 1988, five years after Ken died. Instead, it was hidden in a 140-page “description of methodology” that was referenced in a footnote.
This shadow report was given an ISBN number, but the Stationary Office confirmed not a single copy was ever published or sold, and veterans campaigning at the time never knew about it.
It states the badge data was collected by atomic scientists and summarised in the 1960s, and the badges destroyed. When it was shared 20 years later with the NRPB, they were told the only notes made were from badges showing above the “minimum recordable level” - which kept changing.
Their report says: “At the end of the test programme in the 1960s the minimum recordable level was 0.1 miliSievert, but the normal figure in Australia was 0.2 mSv, though, on occasions, 0.3 mSv or 0.5 mSv were used.”
A dental x-ray involves 0.005 mSv of radiation, and even that low dose can increase the risk of cancer. It means that servicemen who received the equivalent of 100 such x-rays in a single day would have been recorded as a “zero dose”.
The report goes on to say that at Operation Buffalo, a 1956 human experiment in Australia in which officers were ordered to walk, crawl and run through fallout to see how much stuck to their uniforms, “the minimum recordable level was 4 mSv”, due to poor-quality badges.
More than 200 officers could have been exposed to the equivalent of 800 x-rays, and would still be recorded as having zero radiation. According to official figures, more than 70 per cent of those who took part in Buffalo later developed tumours. As the badges were all destroyed 60 years ago, it is impossible to to re-examine them and confirm the readings.
Campaigners are calling for a review of the false badge data.
Tory grandee Sir John Hayes said: “These records must now be urgently reviewed, as they can no longer relied on by the MoD to defend its claim to have done right by these men. We know there is no safe limit for radiation, and therefore any dose - no matter how small - could have had devastating consequences.”
Rishi Sunak promised to meet veterans in 2022, but has since said he is too busy. Repeated requests to his office to discuss the issues have been ignored.
Alan Owen, who founded campaign group Labrats, added: “The MoD has relied on lies, and wasted millions, just to refuse veterans a small pension.
“We know that all war pension claims are still checked against this dodgy data, and if it says zero the pension gets thrown out. The MoD has known for 40 years the whole thing was bogus, and thousands have been affected. The time for lies is over.”
In repeated government studies, researchers could not explain why veterans who were recorded having low doses showed high rates of cancer. The MoD claimed the disease must have been caused by chance, and never admitted the recorded dose might be wrong.
We specifically asked the MoD to comment on whether it considered the dose badge records to be reliable or not.
A spokesman responded: “We are grateful to all service personnel who participated in the British nuclear testing programme and contributed to keeping our nation secure and are pleased that they will now be receiving a medal in recognition. Nuclear test veterans who believe they have suffered ill health due to service have the right to apply for no-fault compensation under the War Pensions Scheme.”
Kenneth’s service, with the Royal Navy aboard aircraft carrier HMS Warrior and the tank landing ship HMS Narvik, was at Operation Grapple, held in 1957 and 1958 at Christmas Island in the Pacific.
The NRPB has found Kenneth and his comrades had a 28% increased risk of lung cancer - and only a handful were ever given a dose badge.
There were also Whitehall orders that navy crews at Grapple should have blood tests taken, which would have been more accurate, but the results have never been found. At the time of Kenneth’s death, many of those who had carried out the work were alive, still working at AWRE, and available for questioning.
Yet at his inquest, a “government scientist” called to give evidence refused to provide any details, beyond claiming that no helicopters had been contaminated and any fallout Ken had ingested would have ""decayed rapidly within the body"". He did not tell the coroner that the ""zero dose"" might be wrong.
Valerie vowed afterwards: “I will fight on, and investigate in my own quiet way. There must be something there... there was a lot not said, a lot that could not be said.”
But by the time the 1988 report was finally uncovered, and the blood testing discovered, Valerie had advanced dementia. She died aged 94, having spent longer as a widow than she did as a wife.
“Luckily my sister and I were born before he went to the tests, so we didn’t have the birth defects other families have been afflicted by,” said Melanie, of Kirkcaldy, Fife. “What mattered to my mum is the way people were treated, not just with the lack of information but being brushed off like they were nobody. Just like the Post Office, just like all the other scandals.”
The last bomb Kenneth saw, codenamed Grapple X, was Britain’s first thermonuclear weapon, and its explosion guaranteed our place in the world.
He and his comrades knew nothing of the risks, and were told we had to have The Bomb to be safe - and they had faith the government would keep them safe in return.
Melanie said: “I just want the truth to come out. My dad was so proud of being in the navy, and serving the Queen. Yet when he needed help there was none.”"

Sarah Ferguson said she would turn her “distress into a positive” after doctors told her she was suffering from malignant melanoma, which is the most serious form of skin cancer. The Duchess revealed to friends she will use her time and profile to spur others to get checked, in honour of pal Carolyn Cotterell, who died from the disease.
Fergie lived with Carolyn before her marriage to Prince Andrew in 1986. She died from skin cancer in 1999. A close friend said of her campaign plan: “Sarah is a trooper. Typically, it was the first thing she did, thinking of others while she was recuperating herself. She wants to be a driving force. Sarah realises she has a big role to play on top of her public platform and she will put it to good use.”
A source close to the duchess said she would use her links with the Teenage Cancer Trust, of which she is a patron. She could also join forces with eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, patron of the British Skin Foundation. Her father, Major Ronald Ferguson, had skin cancer when he died in 2003. Fergie yesterday shared a photo of herself thought to have been taken near a clinic in Austria where she has had treatment for the melanoma.

Cancer Research UK says the disease kills around 2,300 in the UK annually. The Duchess added: “I have been taking some time to myself as I have been diagnosed with malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer, my second cancer diagnosis within a year.” She mentioned her breast cancer this summer followed by a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, adding: “It was thanks to the great vigilance of my dermatologist that the melanoma was detected. Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock but I’m in good spirits.”
She added: “My experience underlines the importance of checking the size, shape, colour and texture and emergence of new moles.” Her diagnosis was before Christmas but was not announced until Sunday. It was just days after the Princess of Wales was hospitalised for abdominal surgery and as the King prepares for a prostate procedure. Fergie, 64, is now at home with ex Prince Andrew, 63, in the Royal Lodge, Windsor."

There were distressing reports of civilian casualties after Russia deployed its strategic missile aircraft to unleash missiles onto cities. A total of three dead and 13 wounded were reported across Ukraine, amid fears the numbers would rise. Nine were reported wounded in Kyiv where black smoke rose over the skyline with a residential building hit, and one was killed in a separate missile strike on Pavlohrad.
‌Kyiv was rocked by 10 thunderous explosions. Kharkiv faced at least seven explosions with power lost in a number of districts. A multi-storey residential building in Kharkiv was completely destroyed as a result of Russian missile fire. Two were reported killed, 13 wounded hospitalised including a girl, 10. Children were reported with shrapnel wounds. Two women were in serious condition.
Rescuers were removing the rubble, where people might be trapped, the local authorities reported. Explosions were also reported in the Sumy region, Dnepropetrovsk region and Zhitomyr.
In Kyiv’s Svyatoshinsky district, a building and cars were on fire, and there were claims of debris hitting a kindergarten. In Solomensky district, windows in an apartment building were smashed by a blast wave. One victim was hospitalised.
In Pechersky district, a non-residential building was hit. Emergency services were at the scene. At least eight were hospitalised in Kyiv. A Kh-101 missile was seen firing heat traps during a strike on Kyiv.
Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klitchko said: “An unexploded warhead of a rocket was found in one of the apartments in a residential building in Sviatoshynsky district. People are being evacuated from the house.”
The wave of strikes will be seen as Russian revenge for an attack on a market in the Tekstilshchiki district of Donetsk city on Sunday in which 27 were killed and at least 20 wounded. The deaths were blamed by Moscow on Ukrainian shelling of civilians.
Ukraine strongly denied responsibility and said Russia had hit the market in the Putin-controlled invaded territory. Ukraine has in recent days hit targets in Putin’s home city St Petersburg and the surrounding Leningrad region. Pro-Kremlin online media outlet Mash said Russia had staged “A large-scale attack on military-industrial complex facilities and the fuel infrastructure of Ukraine”."

Norman was a seven-time Oscar nominee. Over the course of his career, Norman won plenty of awards and was given the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences in 1999.
He also won the United Nations Award at the British Academy Film Awards in 1967 and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film in the same year. Before moving into film work, Norman got his break directing musical specials for TV.
Norman was known for focusing on social injustice in his work. Speaking to NPR in 2011, he recalled his first experience of racial prejudice. The director said he was 18 years old and hitchhiking in Chicago, when he eventually made it to Memphis. As the Canadian headed toward a seat in the back of a bus, the vehicle started and then stopped.
""The bus driver looked at me. He said, 'Can't you read the sign?' And there was a little sign, made of tin, swinging off a wire in the centre of the bus and it said, 'Coloured people to the rear',"" Norman told the publication.
He added: ""And I turned around and I saw two or three Black citizens sitting around me, and … a few white people sitting way at the top of the bus. And I didn’t know what to do, I was just embarrassed. So I just got off the bus and he left me there."" Norman admitted the experience ""really stuck with me"".
In his autobiography, This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me, he noted that racism and injustice became his most common themes. ""Every time a film deals with racism, many Americans feel uncomfortable,"" he wrote.
""Yet it has to be confronted. We have to deal with prejudice and injustice or we will never understand what is good and evil, right and wrong; we need to feel how 'the other' feels.""
He drew upon his experiences for 1967's In the Heat of the Night, starring Rod Steiger as a white racist small-town sheriff and Sidney Poitier as a Black detective from Philadelphia trying to help solve a murder and eventually forming a working relationship with the hostile local lawman. The New York Times' Bosley Crowther was among the critics who found the movie powerful and inspiring.
Norman, honoured by Canada in 2003 with a Governor General's Performing Arts Award, remained close to his home country. When he wasn't working, he lived on a 200-acre farm near Toronto, where he raised horses and cattle and produced maple syrup. He founded the Canadian Film Centre in 1988 and for years hosted barbecues during the Toronto Film Festival.
Norman and his wife Margaret Ann Dixon (nicknamed Dixie) had three children, sons Kevin and Michael and daughter Jennifer Ann, who became an actress and appeared in the films Agnes of God and Best Friends. Norman and Margaret were married for 51 years, until her death in 2004. He married Lynne St. David in 2010.

2XLLYS1TYF_7V81LCV8N9SU9RM,Furious Kate Middleton gave Prince William ultimatum after 'unacceptable' behaviour,Emma MackenzieLifestyle Writer,"12:31, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/furious-kate-middleton-gave-prince-31973237,"These days Princess Kate and Prince William seem to have a picture-perfect relationship, but it was not always such smooth sailing between the two of them. Their well-documented love story began at the University of St. Andrews, and for most of their twenties, they dated on and off, before they got married in 2011 in a lavish wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey.
One of the periods they spent apart was reportedly caused by an ultimatum issued by a furious Kate after William's unacceptable behaviour left her feeling totally ""humiliated"" and as though he was treating her like a ""doormat"".
A report that appeared in the Daily Mail back in 2007 when Kate and William were briefly broken up claimed that Kate had issued the ultimatum after William had twice in quick succession been caught in nightclubs getting up close and personal with other women.
It was the first time, Katie Nicholl reported, that Kate had ever issued a warning like this, and it was because she had been left utterly ""humiliated"" by the photographs of William clubbing, after years of having to brush off the fact other women so regularly made advances on her boyfriend.
Nicholl quoted one of Kate's friends as anonymously saying: ""She has coped for years with girls flinging themselves at her boyfriend and for a while she found it humorous and even flattering. But after his recent behaviour she gave him an ultimatum and told him that every time he behaved like that in public he was cheapening her image as well as his own.
""She told him she wasn't prepared to be treated like a doormat and that his carefree behaviour was affecting her image. She gave him quite a pasting. In the past she had always let go of things like that, but this really bothered her.""
The first incident had happened in the London nightclub Boujis - which was once one of William's regular haunts - where he had been spotted in a ""drunken embrace with a pretty blonde"".
The second time this happened, just a few days later, photographs of William dancing with another woman whilst he had been out drinking in Bournemouth were published widely in the press.

2ZRF5TT9JY_MUKNSVK1O66S7WM,Turkey weight loss surgeon who operated on Brit who died says he 'did nothing wrong',Adam Aspinall in Istanbul,"20:40, 24 Jan 2024Updated08:20, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/turkey-weight-loss-surgeon-who-31960702,"The Mirror has traced the doctor who performed weight loss surgery in Turkey on a Brit who died.
Dr Serkan Bayil denied botching the operation on tragic Morgan Ribeiro, 20, and insisted he did nothing wrong.
Grieving mum Erin wants a cosmetic tourism ban. She said: “It must stop.”
Morgan Ribeiro, 20, used her own trust fund to pay for gastric sleeve surgery by Dr Serkan Bayil in Istanbul but collapsed on her flight home and died later in hospital.
Dr Bayil told us at the private hospital where he works that her death had nothing to do with the operation and claimed she died due to an embolism on the plane. But his assessment angered Morgan’s grieving mum Erin Gibson, 44, who said surgeons had told her that her small intestine had been cut.
Gastric sleeve surgery involves the insertion of a silicone band which pinches the stomach so people feel fuller sooner. The cost for private treatment in the UK is £8,000 to £10,000, but in Turkey it was just £2,500.
Morgan went under the knife on January 5 and was cleared by Dr Bayil to return home to South London on January 9. But during her flight back to Gatwick she developed complications and is believed to have gone into septic shock. The plane was diverted to Serbia for her to receive emergency medical treatment but she sadly died four days later.
Dr Bayil told us at the Medivita hospital in Istanbul that Morgan’s death had nothing to do with her surgery there. He said: “She died due to an embolism on the flight, not due to complications from the surgery.
“Her vital signs were good when she left us. The most fearful thing in these operations is leakage and she had zero leakage and because of this I think she had an embolism.”
Mum Erin said a post-mortem was currently being carried out on Morgan in the UK. She said doctors in Belgrade had told her that Morgan’s small intestine was damaged during the operation.
Responding to the doctor’s claims that Morgan had an embolism, she said: “That is preposterous. It wasn’t an embolism. It was a laceration. It had been cut, we were told during the operation.. I was told that she was showing signs of fever immediately because her body was already going into septic shock. She had broken-down food leaking into her bloodstream. She was already on the way down when she was still in that hospital.
“If that is true, how can they not have picked that up and then release her from their hospital? She was complaining that she wasn’t well. There aftercare was ‘make sure you get up and walk around’.
“Can you imagine the pain that poor child was in? There needs to be some accountability. This isn’t just ‘she had an embolism’, she was cut in the small intestine, and I believe he didn’t pick it up. We were told this by the Serbian surgeons. This cosmetic tourism must stop.”
The Medivita hospital is in the suburbs in the west of Istanbul, just beside a motorway. The walls outside are grimy and the reception area is grubby, feeling more like a GP’s surgery than a Harley Street clinic.
We watched a procession of patients going in and out for appointments. Some were on crutches while others had visible scars and bandages from procedures such as nose jobs and hair transplants. Dr Bayil is very active on social media, proudly boasting about his success stories.
He posted on Instagram on January 5, the same day Morgan went under the knife, how unlikely it is that a stomach bubble may explode.
Dr Bayil, a respected surgeon for 20 years, told us the Turkish authorities visited him on Monday to begin investigating the case and took away all reports but that he is allowed to continue working in the meantime. He also expressed his sorrow at Morgan’s death, but insisted Turkey was a safe place to have surgery.
He said: “I am sad, so, so sad, she was so young I wish that this had never happened, it is the first time in my career. Two others from England that had the same surgery are very happy with it. But in surgery there are always complications, always risk. I would say it is safe to come to Turkey, this is just a tragic incident.”
Morgan’s boyfriend, Jamie Brewster, 19, said that he was told by doctors she had gone into septic shock. They explained that medics in Istanbul must have perforated her small intestine, causing an infection.
Serbian prosecutors and the British authorities have since launched investigations into Morgan’s death after the Serbian medics in Belgrade were forced to remove 3in of her small intestine in a bid to contain the infection.
Morgan is just the latest in a growing list of Britons who have died or suffered complications after opting for cheaper surgery in Turkey’s massive foreign medical industry.
Fearing hefty medical bills or waiting lists, an increasing number of Britons are choosing medical treatments abroad in what’s often called “medical tourism”.
According to Patient Beyond Borders, a global tourism guide, Turkey is now among the world’s top 10 medical tourism destinations.
In 2022 alone a whopping 1.3 million foreign patients flocked to the country for procedures such as hair transplants, bum lifts or “Turkey teeth”.
Last year the Government said it is aware of more than 25 British nationals who have died in Turkey since January 2019 following medical procedures.
There have also been reports of an outbreak of botulism linked to weight loss treatments performed in Istanbul and Izmir in February 2023.
The advice on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for those interested in such procedures is to be aware that the standard of medical facilities and available treatments can vary widely globally.
They also encourage Britons to discuss plans with their GP before going ahead with any medical procedures abroad, as well as doing do your own research, warning how private companies have a financial interest in arranging your medical treatment abroad.
Last year the Turkish Government responded robustly to growing criticism of its medical tourism industry. A spokesman for the Embassy in London said: “Turkey is a leading destination for health tourism, offering high-quality healthcare services.
“Patient safety is a top priority in the Turkish healthcare system. Patients are provided with detailed information about the services offered, and they can report any complaints they have.
“This helps to ensure that patients receive the best possible care. Healthcare services in Turkey are provided by authorised institutions and surgeons in accordance with international standards. These institutions are regularly audited by the Turkish authorities to ensure that they meet the highest standards of quality and safety. These annual assessments are obligatory for health institutions.”"

Cases of the bacterial infection, known as the ""100-day cough"", have risen rapidly in Wales in particular in the first weeks of 2024. The NHS for those with symptoms must take antibiotics and avoid work, school or nursery for 48 hours after taking the first lot.
Those who haven't taken antibiotics are recommended to isolate for three weeks after symptoms start, NHS advises. It says babies aged six months or less are particularly susceptible to catching whooping cough, which in some cases could cause dehydration, seizures and breathing difficulties.
There have already been 135 notified cases of the infection in Wales so far in January, the BBC reported, compared to 200 in the whole of last year. Public Health Wales (PHW) said in a recent alert: ""Whooping cough has waves of increased infection every three to four years and in the last few weeks, notifications of whooping cough have risen sharply.
""Following reduced circulation in 2020-2022, current notifications are at levels not seen since 2012 and 2015... Laboratory confirmed cases have not yet risen in line with notifications but are likely to increase as test results are reported.""
The unpleasant illness may last for several weeks or months, hence the name ""the 100-day cough"". It typically causes cold-like symptoms within the first few days before progressing to coughing bouts which are worse at night and you might emit the characteristic ""whoop"" sound as you gasp for air between coughs.
Dr Christopher Johnson, consultant epidemiologist and head of PHW's Vaccine Preventable Disease Programme said babies under six months old are especially vulnerable to whooping cough.
He warned: ""It can be very serious and lead to pneumonia and permanent brain damage. Young babies with whooping cough are at risk of dying from the disease.""
Explaining why cases in Wales seem to be rising so sharply, Dr Johnson said: “We typically see high rates of whooping cough peaking every three to four years, and with rates suppressed during the lockdowns of the pandemic we are naturally seeing a resurgence this year.
“Whooping cough is highly contagious and is spread by breathing in small droplets in the air from other people’s coughs and sneezes,"" the doctor added.
As of January 14, 220 cases of whooping cough were reported in England and Wales, according to the UK Health Security Agency's weekly Notification of Infectious Diseases report (NOIDs). That's up from 167 on January 7 and 137 on December 31."
34GIJPD0BH_DV1CKJWTR0IPI18,Labour promises huge clampdown on pay-offs for ex-ministers after Tory £1million giveaway,John StevensPolitical Editor,"22:30, 26 Jan 2024Updated09:21, 29 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-promises-huge-clampdown-pay-31972708,"Labour is promising a major clampdown on pay-offs given to ex-ministers after the Tories pocketed almost £1million in golden goodbyes.
The overhaul would mark the biggest shake-up of the rules since they were introduced more than 30 years ago.
Figures show £933,086 in taxpayers’ money was handed out in a year as the changes in PM from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss and then Rishi Sunak led to an unprecedented turnover in ministers.
Departing ministers are entitled to a payment equivalent to a quarter of their annual salary no matter how long they have been in their post or the circumstances under which they leave their jobs. They must only give back that money if they are re-appointed to another role within three weeks.
Under Labour’s proposed changes, ministers will only receive a quarter of what they actually earned in the past 12 months, stopping those who have only been in post for a few weeks getting a large sum. Those who return to Government within three months’ will have their entitlement slashed. And any minister who leaves their job while under investigation for allegations of misconduct or breaches of the ministerial code would not get a pay-off unless and until they are cleared.
Should severance payments to ministers be axed? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
The party will also properly enforce rules that mean ex-ministers over the age of 65 should not get anything.
Labour said its package of reforms would have slashed the severance payments bill by almost £380,000, which is more than 40%. It comes after the Mirror revealed earlier this week that a string of former ministers, including Peter Bone, has wrongly received pay-offs when ousted despite being over 65.
Under Labour’s crackdown, sex pest Chris Pincher would have missed out on his £7,929 golden goodbye when he was forced out as Deputy Chief Whip over groping claims. Greg Clark and Shailesh Vara, who both spent fewer than nine weeks as Cabinet ministers in the last days of Mr Johnson's administration, would have had their entitlements reduced from £16,876 each to just £2,775.
Brendan Clarke-Smith, who spent sixteen weeks as a junior minister under Mr Johnson and Ms Truss would have had his severance claim cut from £5,593 to £1,684. Rehman Chishti, who spent two months as a Foreign Office minister, would have had his payout cut from £5,593 to £936.
And Liz Truss, whose ministerial pay-off was boosted thanks to her disastrous 49 days as PM, would have seen her golden goodbye slightly reduced from £18,860 to £17,143.
Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: “When the drafters of the 1991 legislation put the 'loss of office' rules in place, they surely never expected them to produce the kind of payments that we saw in 2022/23 under this shambles of a government: £933,086 going direct from the taxpayer into the pockets of Tory MPs as a reward for political chaos and a crashed economy, including almost £50,000 of payments to ministers who were over the age limit to claim them.
""Among the beneficiaries were MPs who had never served as ministers before filling out the front bench in the dying days of the [Boris] Johnson administration; acolytes of Liz Truss, whose time in government began and ended with her own short reign in No.10; and a host of Rishi Sunak favourites quitting their jobs to put pressure on his predecessors, then returning a few weeks later when he became Prime Minister. Most disgraceful of all, we saw individuals who were never fit for ministerial office in the first place being forced to quit after their shameful conduct was exposed, but still walking away with a payout from the taxpayer.
Under the current rules, every single one of those Tory ministers was legally entitled to three months of severance at their final salary level, no matter how long they had been in post, no matter the circumstances of their departure, and - in most cases - no matter how quickly they returned to the front bench. These are the glaring loopholes that Labour's proposed reforms will seek to close."""
359P0ZBX2U_12UZDJLNS7PR1B4,Fury as Grade-II 17th century building turned into bright pink American sweet shop,Faye Mayern,"21:48, 24 Jan 2024Updated21:50, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fury-grade-ii-17th-century-31960979,"A bright pink American candy store has angered many by revamping a 17th-century Grade II listed building.
The startling transformation is ""not acceptable"", according to the council chiefs, who've given the owner until the month's end to seek approval for the changes.
Ipswich, known as one of the UK's oldest towns with over 600 listed buildings and structures, cherishes its historic architecture. The American Candy shop, synonymous with the Tudor and Victorian periods, was listed in 1977 due to its timber frame and ornamental bargeboards.
Previously, it was decorated in mint green with pink accents as a gift shop and later turned into Miss A's Chic Beauty Salon with an unassuming blue-grey exterior. It sits beside The Spread Eagle pub, reputed as one of the UK's oldest pubs and harks back to Tudor times.
Carole Jones, who is in charge of planning at Ipswich Borough Council, reiterated that the shop's current appearance is ""not acceptable"". She expressed her disappointment saying: ""That shop has been various things over the years, even a gift shop, but it's never looked like that before.""
According to Heritage England, a Grade II listed building should be considered a highly significant structure beyond just special interest.
""We have many listed buildings in Ipswich and they are an important part of our heritage."" said a local official. ""We have already contacted the tenants, who - we understand - have appointed a local architect who is drawing up a listed building application.""
She expects the shop to be painted a ""more suitable"" colour, with the removal of any signs, including the illuminated ones. Abdi Mishevan, director of the shop, said: ""I was just trying to bring a good idea to Ipswich.""
""I've travelled around the world so I was just trying to help our community to have the kinds of products you can't buy elsewhere in the UK."" he added. ""When we took over it was something that we weren't aware of that listed buildings needed to have separate applications, now we have done it properly.""
Mr Mishevan confirmed he had sent an application to the council and they hoped to get a designer in for mid-February if approved. John Cook, councillor for the area the building falls under, said: ""In Ipswich, we have many buildings of historical value.""
""Planning rules exist for a reason, and we expect property and business owners to comply with them,"" he stated. ""Before undertaking work, especially on listed buildings or in conservation areas, it is wise to check what is appropriate with planners, and whether planning permission is required."" Ipswich now has four American candy shops in the main shopping district of the town centre.

37F6WF3BFK_440G1UADBZ5WBQD,Rishi Sunak’s aide joins plot to oust him with warning country deserves better,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"08:19, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunaks-aide-joins-plot-31962132,"Troubled PM Rishi Sunak has been rocked after one of his top aides quit, warning the Tory Party could be destroyed by Christmas.
Will Dry, a special advisor responsible for polling and opinion research at No10, said the Conservatives are heading for ""the most almighty of defeats"". Mr Dry, 26, added that the public want better and said Tory MPs ""owe to the country"" to reflect on who leads them as they continue to tear strips out of each other.
He helped produce a blistering YouGov poll, funded by Tory donors, which found Mr Sunak and co are headed for a general election wipeout this year, winning just 169 seats. In a statement the former aide said he quit after becoming ""dispirited"" - as the Government ""won't provide the leadership we need"".
Mr Dry wrote: ""Everyone in this country can see just how colossal the challenges we face are. Sadly, it became clear to me we weren't providing the bold, decisive action required to overcome those challenges.""
And he warned that Nigel Farage could do fatal damage to the party in the upcoming election. Mr Dry said he'd concluded the Conservatives face ""the most almighty of defeats"", and went on: ""Be in no doubt we are on course for at least a decade of Labour rule. And if Farage comes back, the Conservative Party essentially won't exist by Christmas.""
He said that since quitting late last year, he has been working to alert the party to ""the danger the country and it is in"". And hinting that a change of leader might be necessary he said: ""Conservative MPs decide who leads the Conservative Party, not unelected advisors like me. And it looks like they may not want to change leader.
""But this is a big decision they owe it to the country's future to reflect on. Those who think we can't do much better than this are dead wrong. Those who think the public don't want much better than this are also dead wrong.""
He said that Mr Sunak and his team were ""good people"" who ""do what they think is right for the country"". But he continued: ""We have a government that won't provide the leadership we need but will deliver a different government that also won't deliver the change we need. You can see why the British people are so depressed with politics.""
The intervention comes as Tory in-fighting again takes centre stage following an astonishing broadside by former minister Sir Simon Clarke. Sir Simon - who has been widely condemned and insulted by his colleagues - penned a blistering call for Mr Sunak to step down.
After provoking an outcry the Liz Truss supporter doubled down, telling the BBC: ""No one likes that guy that's shouting 'iceberg' but I suspect that people will be even less happy if we hit the iceberg. And we are on course to do that. That is the point that I need to land with colleagues respectfully and calmly. We are not at the moment responding to the situation with the seriousness that it warrants.""
In a jab at the Tory chaos, Keir Starmer told the Commons at PMQs: ""We have seen this story time and time again with this lot: party first, country second. Safely ensconced in Westminster, they get down to the real business of fighting each other to death. The country forced to endure their division and chaos, the longest episode of EastEnders ever put to film."""

The 42-year-old Duchess of Sussex had to follow strict royal protocol over the colour of her nails while a working senior member of the Royal Family, as it was reported the late Queen hated coloured nail polish and fake nails. Instead, Her Majesty preferred Meghan and Kate Middleton to wear a simple nude polish, and have their nails short and neat.
Since her and Harry stepped down as senior royals in 2020 and relocated to the US, Meghan has enjoyed expressing herself through her style choices after being under strict guidelines while in the monarchy. Now, she’s chosen to ditch the Queen’s rules over nail polish and indulged in a classic square-tip French manicure as she stepped out with husband Harry earlier this week.

Meghan and Harry made a surprise appearance at the Bob Marley: One Love premiere in Jamaica on Tuesday, and looked loved-up and relaxed as they posed for pictures on the red carpet. While the mother-of-two looked stunning in a black Carolina Herrera ballgown skirt and camisole, eagle-eyed onlookers couldn’t help but notice she had the French manicure on her nails. However, her nails were still kept relatively short, which could be a sweet nod to the Queen’s preference for a neat manicure.
Her Majesty’s favourite nail polish was the pale pink Ballet Slippers shade by Essie, and had been wearing the colour since 1989 until her death in 2022. Women in the Royal Family tend to opt for nude or pale pink colours, but according to royal expert Omid Scobie, the Queen had no rule about dark nail polish. “It’s simply about being appropriate,” he told  Harper’s Bazaar.
For her wedding day, Meghan also chose a subdued pink hue for her nails, and it was revealed she had a custom blend of colours for the royal event in May 2018. According to reports, Meghan used one base layer of CND Shellac’s Unmasked colour, with their Negligee colour and Cashmere Wrap pink shade on top. The timeless look was also seen on Kate Middleton for her wedding to Prince William in 2011, and her pink shade was made from a combination of Bourjois' nude shade Rose Lounge and Essie's Allure.
While pregnant with Archie in 2019, Meghan bucked royal protocol and wore a burgundy shade of nail polish as she attended the Cirque du Soleil premiere of Totem with Prince Harry. She rocked the shade on both her fingers and toes, and the dark-red hue was perfectly complemented by her blue sequinned Givenchy gown that highlighted her baby bump.

38FGHUSNOE_LO6JYKHF14PGBAV,Couple's spooky dream holiday after realising they're the only guests at 5-star Mexico resort,Jeremiah HasselUS News Reporter,"17:39, 26 Jan 2024Updated10:45, 27 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/couples-spooky-dream-holiday-after-31978492,"Imagine taking a romantic vacation to a beautiful, sweeping resort on the ocean with your spouse only to discover that you had the entire place to yourself — would you feel ecstatic? Overwhelmed? Maybe a little bit creeped out?
TikTok user Cameron, whose handle is @freedomhustler, and his wife found themselves in exactly such a situation when they ventured down to the Grand Velas Boutique in Los Cabos, Mexico, to celebrate their babymoon — a honeymoon of sorts but for couples about to have their first baby.
The resort was a dream, the American said in a video he posted to his account, which featured clips of the 5-star ""luxurious and intimate"" retreat that markets itself as ""Mexico's prestigious coastal haven"" that provides ""a romantic escape"" that includes ""five-star culinary artistry,"" pools, jacuzzis and a private beach, according to the resort's website.

As Cameron strolled along the sprawling property, he began to notice its emptiness, quickly realising that he and his wife appeared to be the only guests there. He began to seek out others but found no one, just the employees and contractors tasked with upkeeping the gorgeous facades and foliage around the massive resort.
""This was kind of creepy, but we had this whole entire resort to ourselves,"" Cameron began the video. ""At first, it started as a joke, so I started recording on our first day and not seeing anybody but employees.""
He continued: ""But you can see as the days progress, it starts to freak us out and felt more like an episode from Black Mirror."" They began to explore, he said, but then noted that ""things started getting a little creepier"" once they began attending the activities planned for them at the resort, realising that those were also empty save for themselves.

""Day two, we walked to the farthest part of the resort to look for live people,"" Cameron continued. ""The immaculate outdoor seating was just empty. You'll see my camera start to go a little crazier as this joke turns into more panic when I'm sending it to my friends. Every time I think I see someone that's not wearing a white uniform, I get excited, only to realise, 'No, more contractors working on the place,' which, again, was kind of cool until it wasn't.""
He added: ""I would find myself at night just looking over the whole place trying to find someone."" He added that he's a real estate investor and that he began to wonder how the place was paying for its upkeep — all the constantly burning fires, the lights, everything. ""Who is paying for all this?"" he asked.
He admitted that, after a while, they saw an older couple during their first dinner and then a younger couple during their second morning, but they didn't see anyone else. Nevertheless, they said the food and accommodations were immaculate. ""I do not know why this place was not jam-packed,"" he said.
The TikTok garnered around 6.7 million views and over 300,000 likes, and many users were quick to comment under it with their thoughts on the ordeal, with many demanding if they had asked the front desk what was going on with it. One user stated that it might be because it's January, and not many people vacation in January, they said.
Others yet commented that it might be because of the prices — ranging anywhere from $1,100 to over $2,000 per night, they said not many people would be able to afford the place, with others saying that it's one of Mexico's most expensive all-inclusive resorts. Most reviews, including that in the video, were positive, however.
Megan Taylor, a spokesperson for the resort, wrote in a statement to The Mirror US: ""While we cannot comment specifically on if a guest is staying at any of our resorts, the property shown in the video is Grand Velas Boutique Los Cabos, the newest resort in the Velas Resorts' collection. Grand Velas Boutique Los Cabos opened on Jan 8th and in its soft opening phase, we are limiting the number of suites available for booking until we are confident that all aspects of the resort from accommodations and restaurants to design and service will surpass travelers' expectations.""
She added: ""Velas Resorts operate at 100% regardless of the number of actual guests staying on the property. That is a staff to guest ratio of 3 to 1, versus at many other resorts that are the opposite (3 guests to every 1 staff).""
She continued: ""Comparatively higher than others in the destination, our nightly rates reflect the value that one receives when visiting Velas Resorts.

One of the best parts of having to work is still being paid whilst jetting off on a two-week holiday in the sun. Of course, we all wish we could have more annual leave, as it never seems to last and often dries up before the start of the new year.
But, Brits have been hit with a newfound appreciation of their jobs, after discovering how many holidays Americans are entitled to. According to business expansion experts Foothold America, US workers are not actually entitled to any paid holiday at all. Yes, you read that right: none at all.
Of course, most US employers do offer paid holiday to workers - but the average worker only receives around 10 days of paid holiday each year. It's also common for this annual leave to be accrued, meaning employees will have to work at a company for 12 months before getting access to the 'perk'.
Now, workers over in the US may get more 'buck' for their hours, but is the additional cash worth the holiday sacrifice? The UK government says that almost all people classed as a worker* should be legally entitled to take holiday time off. For the majority of workers on a five-day week, this amounts to 5.6 weeks of paid annual leave (28 days).
Part-time workers are also entitled to statutory leave, which is pro-rated based on how many days a week they work. For example, someone working four days a week will get at least 16.8 days off each year. While bank holidays do not have to be given as paid leave, many companies in the UK allow workers to have these days off on top of their annual leave allowance.

Andrea Celleste is a content creator living in the UK, originally from Los Angeles. She has amassed more than 132,000 Instagram followers for her commentary on the cultural differences of living in the UK compared to the US.
Celleste posted a skit showing how US employers often discourage workers from taking annual leave - even if the company offers it as a perk. In the video, she pretends to be the boss - who informs the employee they'll have to 'catch up' on their workload when they return from a two-day holiday.
In contrast, she shows how some UK employers remind staff when they still have leftover annual leave and show an interest as to what they'll be doing outside of work. The post garnered hundreds of comments from shocked Brits - and Americans.
""Why would anyone from another developed country want to move to the US?"" one person wrote. Another commented: ""I’m from Texas but have lived in Wales for 20 years now and every second of this clip rings true."" While a third added: ""What's the point in vacation days if you have to 'make up for it'?""

The character, played by actress Shona McGarty, found out her stepmother Bianca Jackson had been dumped by her partner Terry, after almost a decade together. Pregnant Whitney told partner Zack Hudson that she needed to go to Milton Keynes for a while to support Bianca, leaving him worried.
But given we know that Whitney will soon leave the show, with actress Shona quitting the role after more than 15 years on the soap, will Whitney actually return? Here's all we know about Whitney's exit storyline and when she might depart Walford for good.
Whitney Dean debuted on the show back in 2008 as part of the Jackson family, arriving with her stepmother Bianca. Whitney has been on the show ever since and has been at the centre of some huge storylines, including sexual abuse, killing someone in self-defence and a tragic recent storyline that saw her baby daughter Peach die after being diagnosed with Edwards' syndrome during the pregnancy.
It's not yet known for sure when her final scenes will air, but recent pictures from filming suggest she is still on the soap for the time being, while Whitney is away at the moment. It's thought her exit might be filmed in the coming weeks but this is not confirmed.
It seems her exit is linked to the return of Bianca, with actress Patsy Palmer reprising her role but details are yet to be confirmed. Actress Patsy said of her comeback: ""I’m so excited to be reprising the role of Bianca. EastEnders holds such a special place in my heart so it’s always a pleasure to be back.""
Shona confirmed her exit last year, revealing it was time to move on to new challenges after so long in Walford. Speaking to Inside Soap, she said: ""It wasn’t an easy decision because I've made so many friends. I’ve seen people come and go, and meanwhile, Whitney has been one of the longest-standing characters.
""I've had so much fun and done so many storylines, some of which have been sensitive, and I've been honoured to be trusted with such heavy stuff year after year. So I'm going to be sad to say goodbye to my friends and family, but it was the right decision for me as I want to do other things. After 15 years, I’ve had a pretty good run!""
She also said: ""I have decided to spread my wings and will be leaving EastEnders. I have loved my years in the show. I have been trusted with some incredible storylines and have made amazing friendships — and family — which will endure.""

3D5UBSOWUH_IVM4ZJFUYCD4LKT,Is Chas leaving Emmerdale? Lucy Pargeter's future on ITV soap confirmed after health diagnosis,Jasmine AlldayTV Reporter,"21:35, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/chas-leaving-emmerdale-lucy-pargeter-31943133,"Lucy Pargeter's future on Emmerdale has been revealed after Chas Dingle's breast cancer diagnosis.
Chas found out tonight, that like her mother Faith Dingle, she had been diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. It left her reeling and struggling to cope after she sent Liam Cavanagh away and told him she needed some time alone.
Fans have grown concerned this will be the beginning of the end for Lucy's character Chas Dingle, but the ITV soap has yet to confirm whether Chas will sadly suffer the same fate as Faith or whether she'll make a full recovery.
Speaking during tonight's show, the doctor revealed to Chas: ""So we did a biopsy to extract samples of tissue from your breast and we had a look at those samples under a microscope and we did find cancer cells.
""You have breast cancer, triple negative. If you think of cancer as a house, the front door has three different locks called receptors. We use three different keys to get into the house to destroy the cells. With triple negative, it doesn’t have any receptors.""
When Chas remarked it was the same as her mum's, and that it had been very aggressive, the doctor tried to reassure her: ""Every cancer diagnosis is unique but generally yes it can be a more aggressive type of tumour, with faster growth rates.""
She later confirmed she'd been told she was ""lucky"" to have caught it early, as the doctors had described it as a ""superficial"" tumour.
Speaking about the storyline, Lucy revealed: ""When the producers first discussed this storyline with me I knew I didn’t want us to shy away from any aspect of this diagnosis for Chas. She saw her own mother ultimately die after an incurable breast cancer diagnosis, so for Chas to receive a breast cancer diagnosis herself, makes it all the more poignant.
""Our audience knows her so well, they have seen her relationships, know her faults, her passions, her insecurities, quirks and fears. So for them to see this story play out will be more meaningful given everything that has happened to both her and her mother. I think this is the beauty of our genre ‘Soap’. However, I am more than aware of the huge responsibility with us telling this story. I hope we can do it justice. It won’t be all doom and gloom, there will be ups and downs just like with anything. But I hope it looks and feels real. And if just a few people get help for breast changes that do not feel or look right, it could do some good too.""

Royal sources said Charles and Camilla were keen to see how Kate was doing after she was admitted to hospital for planned surgery last Tuesday. The Princess is due to stay at the London Clinic for up to two weeks before recovering at home for a further 8-12 weeks.
The King was admitted today to the same private hospital in Marylebone for an operation after being diagnosed with an enlarged prostate last week. The King was keen to spread awareness of his condition that thousands of men suffer from every year across the U.K.
A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: ""The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment. His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.""
Royal aides said the palace would not be providing further guidance on how long the King is likely to remain in hospital or further details of the treatment he will be receiving beyond those already shared.
It comes following reports the Princess of Wales being admitted to hospital came as a surprise for those close to the family, as well as those who work with them. It was just over a week ago that Kate was admitted for her successful, planned operation. Her husband Prince William has cleared his diary of official visits and meetings, with no mentions of William in the Court Circular – the daily record of royal engagements – since his wife was admitted.
Kate's last public appearance came on Christmas Day when she accompanied the rest of the Royal Family for the traditional walk to church in Sandringham - and there was no indication of any impending health issues.
Kensington Palace announced news of the princess’s surgery last Wednesday, with Buckingham Palace sparking a double royal health scare just 90 minutes later by revealing the King was preparing for treatment for an enlarged prostate. The King has also cancelled engagements ready for his corrective procedure in hospital this week.
A spokesman previously said: ""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible, and her wish that her personal medical information remains private."""
3KEM3192Q3_GNVWYQ1PUOZTWFM,Donald Trump's youngest brother and 'best friend' who sued niece over memoir 'disgrace',Alex Croft,"12:53, 22 Jan 2024Updated13:07, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trumps-youngest-brother-best-31938123,"Family feuds, big business, multiple wives, and the Trump family name - despite similarities with his infamous brother, Robert Stewart Trump led a very different life.
Robert was always seen as being a very different character to his brash, showbiz-minded older brother. According to one Trump biographer, Robert was the “quietest of Trumps” who was “glad to stay out of the spotlight” - apparently a world away from Donald, the world’s biggest headline-grabber since his entry into politics in 2015.
The business tycoon took a different path to Donald after studying at Boston University, first going to work on Wall Street instead of joining the family business owned by his father - before later joining the Trump Organisation to manage their property holdings outside of Manhattan. For 25 years he was married to Blaine Trump, until their divorce in 2008. Later, the year that he died aged 71, he married Trump Organization employee Ann Marie Pallan in 2020.

Born in 1948 as the youngest son to Fred Sr and Mary Trump, Robert was the fifth of the Trump siblings, including Maryanne, Fred Jr., Elizabeth and Donald. But despite a quieter demeanour than Donald, Robert’s life was no less marred by controversy, feud, and incredible riches.
Former Trump Organization executive Jack O’Donnell claimed Robert was an entirely different character to Donald, describing him as “dignified”, “quiet” and “good to work with”. O’Donnell added that he had no sense of entitlement, a personality trait now associated with the Trump name. “He had zero sense of entitlement. Robert was very comfortable being Donald Trump ’s brother and not being like him,” he said according to the New York Times.
But Donald’s regular rages when things went wrong would occasionally be targeted at Robert, and as the disgraced former president’s fame grew, Robert reportedly found working with him increasingly difficult. After Donald put Robert in charge of the Taj Mahal casino in New Jersey - after the previous three executives overseeing it were killed in a helicopter accident - one of these blowouts led to years of estrangement.

Problems with the financial controls in the slot machines caused problems with the opening of the casino, taking months and costing millions to rectify. Regulators in the gaming industry didn’t permit the casino to open citing the lack of financial control, meaning on the opening night just a tiny section of the casino floor was open.
According to O’Donnell, Donald yelled and screamed at his brother, placing the blame for the faulty machines entirely on him. In response, “Robert calmly got up, walked out of the room, and that’s the last time I ever saw him,” according to O’Donnell. Robert stopped reporting to Donald and stepped out from the core of the business - but he was said to be “devastated” by the rift which had grown between himself and Donald.
As Donald’s political career began to take off, Robert committed himself “1000%” to his brother’s bid. He told the New York Post in 2016: “If he were to need me in any way, I’d be there.” Ever since 2015, Robert was a dedicated supporter of his brother as a politician.
This led to him leading the family’s legal charge against the memoir of his niece, Mary, after she wrote a memoir which exposed alleged truths about the family’s history of conflict. Mary, daughter of Fred Trump Jr, described major dysfunction in the family and claimed it turned Trump into a ruthless and reckless leader.
But Robert sued her in June 2020, describing the decision to write the book as “truly a disgrace”. In a statement released at the time, he said: “Her attempt to sensationalise and mischaracterise our family relationship after all of these years for her own financial gain is both a travesty and injustice to the memory of my late brother, Fred, and our beloved parents.”

Later that year in August, Robert passed away aged 71, as months of poor health and hospitalizations finally caught up with him. In the days before his death and before going to visit his brother in hospital, Donald said at a news conference: “I have a wonderful brother. We’ve had a great relationship for a long time, from Day 1.”
After holding his brother’s funeral service at the White House, Donald said in a statement that Robert was “not just my brother, he was my best friend,” adding: “He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever.”"

No wonder sales of super-yachts, Rolls-Royces and private jets are at an all-time high.
The average price of a house on Britain’s most expensive street has soared to a mind-blowing £23million – but you could buy several streets in my constituency for that. If we don’t change things pronto, this inequality of wealth that divides our nation is going to get worse and worse. On current trends, Britain’s super-rich are set to multiply their fortunes by 91 times more than everyone else by 2028.
Yet in my Birmingham constituency, I have food banks running out of food. We have falling life expectancy for Britain’s poorest citizens. We have people going into hospital with the diseases of poverty, such as malnutrition and rickets. This is 21st century Britain. So, what is going on?
Since I was born in 1970, the wealth of our nation has grown 100-fold to an incredible £12trillion. That’s enough to pave a path five gold bars wide from John O’Groats to Land’s End.
For most of my life, wealth inequality was falling, as people got on in life, bought a home, sent kids to university and tucked away a bit for a pension. But since the Tories came to power after the financial crash, the wealth we create together is no longer shared.
In fact, since 2010, the richest 1% have multiplied their wealth 31 times faster than the rest of us. That is simply not fair. And it’s bad for economics, society – and politics.
Indeed, when you look around the world at countries that are very unequal, you see they’ve got three things in common.
They become poorer, because dodging taxes becomes a real problem. They become corrupt, because too many with large fortunes begin meddling in politics to change the laws to suit themselves. And social mobility collapses, because the kids of the luckiest tend to access the privileges that boost them on in life faster than anyone else.
Isn’t that starting to sound just a little bit like Tory Britain? Polling I’ve done has found that people think we’re becoming an ‘inheritocracy’, where the only people who can get on in life are those born into wealth.
‘Hard work’ is just fourth on the list of things people believe we need to succeed. We have the worst inequality of any major European country. Our living standards are going backwards. Growth is low, national debt has doubled since Gordon Brown left office – and it now takes five generations for the heirs of someone born poor to earn average wages.
The British public already think the top 1% has the most power in Britain – more power than the Government – and it could be about to get worse. As the baby boomers die, some will inherit fortunes. But many will inherit only bills.
Today’s young people may be about to become the most unequal generation in half a century. So, how do we fix it?
First, we must raise the rate of economic growth. All politicians say this, but look at the fastest growing countries around the world, and they’re investing in innovation.
We need to spend more on science because it’s the source of jobs that pay £163 a week more than average. Half of those jobs are in London and the South East. So, we need to get spending out to the cities and regions.
Second, we must end the race to the bottom that drives down average wages. That means transforming rights at work and harnessing the power of pension savers to invest in companies that are not screwing their workers, dodging their taxes or poisoning the planet.
Third, we must boost savings with what I call universal basic capital. We should open a Universal Savings Account for everyone when they start work, into which they save automatically. It’s just been tested by the National Endowment & Savings Trust and proved a huge success.
Into these accounts should go a special one-off dividend for young people worth up to £10,000 to help them with a home deposit – like a Premium Bond paid out by the nation to the next generation. The money would come from a new national savings fund.
If we had saved the money from North Sea oil – like the Norwegians – we would have a sovereign wealth fund worth over £500billion. But we didn’t. Let’s learn from that mistake and join the 80 countries around the world that have built national social wealth funds.
We could do it faster if we restored fairness to our tax system. Our tax code simply doesn’t reflect our moral code. Rishi Sunak earns £2million a year but only pays 21% tax because so much of his income comes from investments.
I think that’s wrong when one in five taxpayers are paying 40%. We deserve a fair shot and a fair share – not just for a few, or for some, but for all.

Umar Gul, 24, was sentenced to 16 months in prison after he was caught zooming along a dual carriageway at more than double the speed limit.
In the video, filmed by a friend in his back seat, Gul shows off his high-performance C63 Mercedes and its challenger, a red Audi RS3. After they pass a set of traffic lights, the two drivers begin to rapidly accelerate and reach shocking speeds on the empty road.
Lancashire Police launched an investigation into Gul after a member of the public spotted some of his videos on social media. Their Vehicle Data Investigation Unit then compiled a dossier of evidence against Gul as part of Operation Snap, where the public can submit incriminating footage.
This showed him driving several other cars dangerously and at excess speeds, including a Nissan GTR and a BMW M135i. Gul, Accrington, Lancs, later pleaded guilty to five counts of dangerous driving and was jailed at Preston Crown Court on January 11.
After his sentencing, PC Simon Grounds from the force said they would continue to target drivers who put other road users' lives in danger. He said: ""Umar Gul put both himself and others at risk through his dangerous driving and I welcome this custodial sentence. As well as proactively targeting dangerous driving on our roads we welcome reports from members of the public through our Operation Snap and, as this case shows, we will act on those reports and look to put people before the courts.""

Kathleen Crane was handed a 12-month community order and ordered to repay the money she was accused of taking from her branch in Eastbourne, East Sussex when she was sentenced for fraud in 2010.
She was one of hundreds of postmasters who were put through traumatising criminal proceedings after the Post Office’s defective Horizon accounting system incorrectly produced figures which suggested money was missing at their branches.
At a hearing in London on Thursday, three appeal judges ruled there was “no doubt” that Mrs Crane’s conviction was unsafe, adding that she was “kept in ignorance” over Horizon’s defects.
Giving their judgment, Lord Justice Holroyde said: “We have no doubt that her prosecution was an abuse of process. Nor do we have any doubt that her conviction is unsafe.” Mother-of-two Mrs Crane, 68, attended Thursday’s hearing and was seen in tears when her conviction was quashed.
Speaking to ITV outside the Royal Courts of Justice following the decision, Mrs Crane said her “horrible” experience was “over now” and urged others affected by the scandal to come forward, saying: “If you’re innocent, you should have your conviction quashed.”
Her daughter, Katy Crane, who joined her mother in court alongside her sister, Lucy Crane, said: “I actually don’t know how they [the Post Office] sleep at night. I absolutely think someone should serve some jail time. I think somebody needs to be held to account.”
Mrs Crane’s case is the first of many expected to reach the Court of Appeal as a result of the Post Office’s own case review. The company had contacted her last June to say it believed there had been a miscarriage of justice. Mrs Crane lodged an appeal with the support of her daughter on January 10 this year, which the Post Office did not resist.
Flora Page, representing her in court, said Mrs Crane had “suffered in silence” since her “appalling experience”, adding that a “fraud she had not committed brought its own humiliation”. She added: “She is somewhat overcome with the prospect of clearing her name. She works in a care home and she will no longer have to contend, we hope, with the fact that this conviction comes up every year when they do their enhanced checks. It will close a very long and painful chapter in Mrs Crane’s blameless life.”
Mrs Crane’s husband, Robert, became subpostmaster of the Old Town Post Office in Eastbourne in October 2000, but took over the running of the branch when he became ill. Mr Crane died in 2016, and Mrs Crane was seen wearing his scarf during Thursday’s hearing.
An audit in January 2010 found a financial shortfall, but after voluntarily attending an interview with Post Office investigators Mrs Crane was accused of defrauding the company of £18,721.52. During the investigation, she said she had been aware of inexplicable shortfalls since 2008 and asked for them to be investigated, but no action was taken.
Mrs Crane later pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after legal advice made her feel that the Horizon system was infallible. On top of her sentence, she was ordered by a judge at Lewes Crown Court in July 2010 to pay £1,550 in costs and complete 200 hours of unpaid work.
The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Crane maintained that she and her husband were “at a loss” to explain the shortfall. Simon Baker KC, representing the Post Office on Thursday, said that while the company was duty-bound to investigate the case based on evidence available at the time, he told the court the case “amounts to an abuse of process”. He also told the court that three appeals against convictions arising from the scandal had been lodged in the last week.
Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Picken and Mrs Justice Farbey, said: “No leap of imagination is needed to understand the anxiety and fear which Mrs Crane and her late husband, who is since sadly deceased, and their two daughters must have experienced.” He added: “She pleaded guilty because she and those representing her had been kept in ignorance.”
Following the ruling, a Post Office spokesman said: “We are deeply sorry for past wrongs and are doing all we can to put these right, including extensive work to support overturning wrongful convictions. As part of this work, we contacted Mrs Crane and other individuals who were unjustly convicted, on the evidence that we hold, to encourage them to mount an appeal and we are pleased that Mrs Crane’s conviction has been overturned.
“Additionally, in 2020 we contacted all current and former postmasters about the launch of the Horizon Shortfall Scheme to encourage more victims to come forward. We continue to work with the Government to support efforts to speed up the exoneration of people with wrongful convictions and ensure compensation is paid.”
As well as the cases brought to court, at least 4,000 branch managers were forced to pay back cash based on the flawed data collected by the Horizon system between 1999 and 2015. Some victims, whose plight was highlighted in the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, were left financially ruined and shunned by their communities, while others took their own lives. Others died without ever seeing justice.
In the wake of the scandal, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the Government intended to introduce blanket legislation to exonerate those wrongly prosecuted in England and Wales."

The former president is now up against ex-U.N Ambassador Nikki Haley, after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis withdrew from the race and grudgingly backed Trump on Sunday. However, questions have been raised about the 77 year old's ""mental fitness"" following a series of gaffes at his Iowa campaign rally.
Trump was caught out confusing Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley while discussing the Capitol Hill attack on January 6. He told the lively crowd: ""You know when [Haley] comes here she gets like nine people, and the press never reports the crowds you know.""
He added: ""By the way, they never report the crowd on Jan. 6. You know Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they - do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it.""
The Democrats were quick to seize on Trump's confusion, tweeting: ""A deeply confused Trump confuses Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley multiple times: Nikki Haley was in charge on January 6. They don't want to talk about that.""

Andrew Rudalevige, a Professor of Government at Bowdoin College, told The Mirror that Trump's verbal mix-ups aren't new but they give his rivals a chance to highlight his weaknesses. He said: ""Trump's verbal slips are not new, but (Nikki) Haley's seizing on them as evidence of his potential mental decline has propelled them into the limelight. A Republican criticizing Trump makes news news that Biden's camp has been delighted to spread further with its own ads and social media campaign.""

Department of International Politics at City, University of London, Professor Inderjeet, exclusively told The Mirror it is "".
Meanwhile, Inderjeet Parmar, a Professor of International Politics at City, University of London, told The Mirror it's ""desperate"" for Democrats to target Trump's ""mental fitness"".
He commented: ""It sounds quite desperate to me that Democrats want to play that game, given the concerns about the age and mental health of their own candidate.

Melissa Oakes was booked in for a planned c-section seven months into her first pregnancy after being told her baby was sitting breech in the womb - and when she had her exact time and date for the surgery, she booked herself in for a full beauty transformation.
However, despite all the effort she went to, she still said that after welcoming her baby into the world she ended up looking ""horrific.""
On the day of her planned birth, Melissa forked out £50 to have a set of Russian lashes applied and spent £15 getting her eyebrows waxed. She said that she was ""so bothered by how she looked"" when giving birth that she also got a spray tan for £25 in her kitchen the night before, and she had blue gel nails done for £25.
She also pampered herself before heading to the hospital by having a bath, moisturising, and curling her hair.
The 28-year-old said her boyfriend Matthew Shaw, also 28, and her lash technician thought she was ""crazy"" for having her lash and brow appointments so close to giving birth.
Despite shelling out over £100 on beauty treatments, the mum-of-one said she would now opt for a less ""extravagant"" hospital look if she were to have another child.
Melissa, from Wigan in Greater Manchester, said: ""Throughout my whole pregnancy my little girl was breech so her head was sitting in my rib cage. [Due to this] at my seven-month mark, I was booked in for a planned c-section and was given a date and time my baby would be born.
""I was absolutely petrified of giving birth and pushing so I think even if she wasn't breech, I would have still opted for a planned caesarean. Getting a c-section allowed me to prepare which is why I got my lashes and eyebrows done. Having my appointment the morning of [my c-section] helped calm my nerves. My eye lash technician did think I was crazy having it the morning of but they needed to be perfect.
""My boyfriend also thought I was crazy but I think he is used to it at this point as I get beauty treatments every two weeks. I don't think he expected anything less. I really didn't like being pregnant. It took a massive toll on my body and mental health and I think he knew that going to these beauty treatments made me feel better and this made him happy.
""Originally, the only appointment she had was 12pm [for my lashes] and I told her I couldn't do this as I was having my c-section so she had to bump me forward. On the morning of my c-section, I spent the whole morning pampering myself and I had a bath and did my full moisturiser routine when I got out and curled all my hair.
""I was just trying to keep as relaxed as possible as I was a bit frightened. Looking back now, I was so bothered by how I looked, but I wish I hadn't gone through with all the treatment. I was rushing around before her birth trying to get to all the treatments and the end outcome wasn't about me it was about her [my daughter].
""The pictures my boyfriend has of me honestly, they are the most horrific things that cannot surface this earth and I thought even after all the work I had done, it didn't make me look any better if I'm honest.""
After arriving at the hospital at midday, Melissa gave birth to her 7lbs 3oz daughter Leonora Shaw at 5pm on August 5th, 2021.
She said before being pregnant she was obsessed with social media and how she looked but now says she doesn't prioritise her online appearance.
Melissa said: ""I am a firm believer in having no regrets and I think if I was to go through it [giving birth] again I may not go as extravagant because, in the end, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that your baby is safe and healthy and I won't put as much effort next time. I don't regret it but I have learnt a lesson of what is important. Before having a baby, I was so concerned about my social media and now I don't care about this.""
On social media, some joked that you had ""to be looking your best for meeting your baby"", with others saying it was a ""slay"" that she made so much effort.

Ewan Harvey, 25, denied causing the injuries and wept in the dock when his verdict was read out. The geography student told Dundee Sheriff Court he had been the victim of a conspiracy by some of his flatmates, but a judge ruled his evidence was not 'credible or reliable'.
Sheriff Brown told him: ""I was not impressed by your evidence which I considered to be unconvincing and self-serving. I did not consider your evidence to be credible or reliable and nothing said by you in your evidence caused me to have a reasonable doubt about the Crown case.
""The position of your defence is that the Crown witnesses have conspired and, in effect, fabricated or embellished evidence and have been telling lies. I believed their evidence"", he added.
Harvey, who is due to be sentenced in March, claimed he and his Norwegian flatmate Amanda Meum shared a close relationship but denied they were lovers as he already had a long-term girlfriend. He also denied causing Miss Meum's injuries, which included chasing her around the table with a knife and holding it to her throat.
The court heard that one of Harvey's violent attacks left Miss Meum covered in bruises. After repeated problematic behaviour, the 25-year-old was eventually thrown out of the rented accommodation he shared with his flatmates.
Management student Sebastian Flame told the trial he thought Harvey was ""unhinged"" during the incident, adding the student often carried out attention-seeking behaviours and was confronted by his flatmates for severe bruising on Miss Meum's legs.
Mr Flame said he thought Harvey had just been showing off, but his flatmates grew extremely concerned when he produced the knife and refused to put it down. Mr Flame said: ""Amanda was sitting on his lap. She was saying the same as myself, that he should stop, and she was asking him to hand the knife over to her. He did not.
""Ewan started chasing her round the table with the knife. Ewan was a bit crazy, it was probably part of the act he was trying to portray. It was very crazy and alarming. Amanda was worried but was trying to look cool in the situation. There were nervous giggles. It wasn't a very big table. It was perhaps four times round the table.
""He then put the knife to her throat. It was about one centimetre away. It was not touching her, but it was very close. It lasted five to ten seconds. I think he then put the knife on the table because at that point everyone was shouting at him to put the knife down. He was unhinged.
""That incident felt a lot more full-on than being a joke. We were shocked. It was worrying because it was a dangerous situation for everyone. I spoke to Amanda. She said she was shaken up but she didn't think Ewan would hurt her. In December I went up to her room to see her.
""Very quickly into that conversation she showed me a myriad of bruises across her legs, and laughing, said 'look what Ewan gave me.'
""The humour was her way of saying the truth. She didn't know how else to say it. It wasn't funny to anyone. They were everywhere on her legs, and big"", he added.
Harvey was then confronted by a deputation of concerned flatmates who ordered him to leave the property.
Mr Flame continued: ""He said that he would never hurt her, that he loved her and that he was very sorry. He also said he didn't do the bruises and that they were accidents. We were worried for Amanda. We were concerned to have an individual who would do that living in the house.""
Harvey eventually left the property five days later, but when he returned to the flat after Christmas break, the incidents were reported to police.
Harvey, formerly of Auchtochter, Laurencekirk, denied his offences, which occured in the Fife university town between September 10 and November 28 of 2020. But he was found guilty of acting in a threatening or abusive manner by chasing Miss Meum with a knife, placing it against her throat, throwing it and stabbing it into a table on October 3.
The student was also found guilty of culpably and recklessly setting fire to an empty chocolate bag until it was destroyed on November 10.
He was found guilty of assaulting Miss Meum in North Street on November 28 after pushing her into a wall, pouring vodka into her eyes. On the same day, he threw a glass bowl at her, placed her in a chokehold, and punched and kicked her to her injury.
A further charge which involved the attack of Ethan Shapiro was dropped by the Crown during the trial."

Dad Adi Whiting suffered critical injuries and was put into an induced coma following reports of an attack outside The Carpenters Arms pub in Boston, Lincolnshire. However, in a heartbreaking update on Tuesday, bar manager Mr Whiting's family confirmed he had passed away surrounded by his fiancé and mum.
Officers from Lincolnshire Police were called to the pub on Sunday, January 14, following reports of an assault. A man in his 30s - understood to be Mr Whiting - was rushed to hospital with what was deemed ""serious injuries"".
Mr Whiting's brother Sid confirmed the sad news on Tuesday afternoon in a statement posted on social media. He said: ""It is with a heavy heart I write to inform you all of Adi's passing. He never showed any responses to treatment and his final moments were spent with [fiancée] Sarah-Lilly and [mum] Debbie by his side.""
Mr Whiting, who leaves behind an 11-month-old son, was named through a GoFundMe page set up by the community to support his family, Lincolnshire Live reports, with more than £15,000 raised so far. His brother Sid continued: ""The love from the community and beyond this last week has been unbelievable.
""We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being so supportive and it fills us with such pride to see how loved he was. We are all devastated beyond belief and will need time to fully come to terms with what's happened.""
He extended a heartfelt thanks to the staff at Pilgrim Hospital and in the intensive care unit at the Nottingham hospital for giving him the ""best care possible,"" as well as officers from Lincolnshire Police for their ""amazing work"". Following the incident last Sunday, police confirmed a 35-year-old man named Maksim Illiev, of Union Street, Boston, had been charged with GBH in connection. Following Tuesday's update, The Mirror contacted the force for further updates.
Mr Whiting closed with a tribute to his ""only brother"" who ""infected everyone with joy"". He said: ""So long, my brother. My little brother. My only brother. You always thought you were the black sheep, but you had no idea how similar we were.""
""I got you. I always did. Sylvester will always know what a wonderful man you were. A pain in the **** at times, but your heart was big enough to infect everybody you met with joy. We'll take good care of him for you."" A spokesperson for the Carpenters Arms said in a brief statement: ""RIP Adi. We are totally destroyed today and apologise for the lack of words."""

In the snaps, the former Superbad star showed off his keen sense of street style sporting a loose-fitting light blue and brown flannel paired with baggy light wash jeans. The star tried to maintain a lowkey presence as he accessorised the casual look with both a black beanie and dark black shades. The star appeared tense as following the outing as he seemed to be calling out to someone in the distance as he walked down the street.
The 40-year-old actor looked almost unrecognisable as he flashed his new shiny grills, stubble, and thinner-than-ever physique. Jonah underwent a dramatic weight loss over the past couple years after hiring a personal trainer and nutritionist dropping a whopping 40 pounds (2.9 stone).

The sighting of the former 21 Jump Street star comes as he moves on from a difficult year in the spotlight as his ex-girlfriend professional surfer Sarah Brady took to social media bashing the star and claiming that he was ""emotionally abusive"" throughout their relationship.
Sarah claimed that after she posted snaps of herself in a bikini on Instagram the actor forced her to take them down. Reposting the photo after their breakup, she wrote: ""Reviving a pic I took down by request of a narcissistic misogynist.""
After their messy split, Sarah shared a number of screenshots of text messages with the actor revealing his controversial response to her swimsuit photos. In the screenshot, Sarah wrote: ""Three removed, not the video yet, it is my best surfing video. Would you feel better if the cover frame was different? Any more specific ones that bother you?"" To which Jonah replied: ""Yes. One that isn't of your a** in a thong.""
Many fans were shocked by Jonah's behaviour as he has been an advocate for therapy and mental health advocacy throughout his career in Hollywood. In an effort to care for his own mental health, the actor stopped promoting his films, asked fans to not comment on his body image, and even went on to release a documentary titled Stutz sharing inspiring messages from his therapist Dr. Phil Stutz.

The 44-year-old star - who has been married to Robbie, 49, since 2010 and shares a son named Charlton, nine, and daughters Theo, 11, and Colette, five with him - alarmed fans when she revealed she had been hospitalised earlier this week. Ayda shared a photo via social media of herself looking glum while hooked up to a heart monitor and with a drip attached to her arm late on Sunday.
She wrote at the time: ""After a picture perfect evening, a less than picture perfect ending."" However she didn't elaborate further on the reason for her hospital visit - but added she was glad to have her husband Robbie at her side.
Now the former Loose Women star has given a new update - showing her back in a medical facility and undergoing further tests. Taking to Instagram Stories on Tuesday, the star first shared a snap of herself alongside her mother, Gwen.
She wrote: “Mom came with me to my doctors appointment today,” and while Gwen had an expression that had concern, Ayda was flashing a defiant smile as she prepared to meet with a doctor. A subsequent slide showed Ayda lying on a hospital bed with a number of monitors attached to her body.
With electrodes on her shoulders, chest and stomach, Ayda looked very still in the image. She added a simple, and teasing, caption, stating: “And after running a few tests…”
The following slide showed the TV star looking very happy and showcasing a beaming smile. She added: “The doctor gave me the all clear. So grateful.” She also added that she was feeling “f**king fantastic” thanks to the test results, and her doctor was happy to pose alongside her.
It seemed Ayda was raring to get back out to celebrate her life, as she later took to Instagram to share a snap of herself at a glamorous party. Ayda was dressed in a shimmering dress to attend a fashion party - where she rubbed shoulders with Kardashians star Kris Jenner, Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger, and businesswoman Veronica Smiley Grazer.
Another snap showed Ayda and Dee posing happily alongside their husbands Robbie Williams and Tommy Hilfiger respectively. The group were out in force to celebrate the birthday of Lauren Sanchez - the fiancée of Amazon billionaire owner Jeff Bezos.
Fans were encouraged to see Ayda up and about and back on the party scene. One follower commented on Instagram: “AYDA, you and ROB look fabulous! Everyone else can take a step back. So glad the doctor cleared you today. Hope that means you're feeling better.”

Staff Sergeant Michelle Young, 34, served two tours in Afghanistan and was a much-loved fitness and fashion Instagram influencer in her spare time, according to her friends. The mum-of-one, who had served in the army for 16 years, had just shared a post celebrating her daughter Gracie's 12th birthday to her 100,000 followers days earlier.
""Happy birthday to the sweetest girl I’ve ever known,' Young wrote. ""She’s a force to be reckoned with, she’s witty, ambitious, kind, compassionate, intelligent, hardworking, hilarious, and selfless. ""'I cried the entire time I made this. I love you forever, kiddo. The best part about my life is being your momma.""

“Michelle was a beautiful soul, an amazing friend, a single mother, a soldier, and is proof you never know what someone is going through or what demons they may be fighting"", her friend Sarah Maine wrote on her GoFundMe Page. ""We will never fill the gaps in our hearts and will always be left with questions.""
Young, from Arizona, joined the Army at 17 years old and returned from her first deployment seven years later. ""I was in the military before I became a mother,' the 34-year-old wrote on Instagram. ""I volunteered for this life, she didn’t. She’s had to be away from her only parent during multiple deployments, TDYs, and training, yet she never complains."" It remains unclear what led to the soldier's suicide.

In September, Michelle shared a post saying that her passion for service was due to her own brother's tragic suicide. when she was 14-years-old. She encouraged anybody struggling to reach out and talk.

Friend Sarah wrote on the GoFundMe Page, which has raised nearly $25,000 (£22,00) and will go to her daughter: “From the outside looking in it looked like she had it all. Mental illness is so prevalent, especially in the military. We need to find a way to do better.”

45REBHJTW2_860N8MZ7A3631TP,Reverend fears death as he sits by Alabama killer for first-ever nitrogen execution,Jeremiah HasselUS News Reporter,"21:03, 25 Jan 2024Updated23:25, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/reverend-fears-death-sits-alabama-31969668,"A reverend fears he will be killed while sitting by a death row inmate's side as he becomes the first American ever to be executed using toxic gas.
Rev Dr Jeff Hood says he hugged his five children extra hard and said ""I love you"" multiple times before travelling to the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.
Tonight, convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith is scheduled to be put to death using nitrogen gas, which causes suffocation as the body is starved of oxygen. Hood will sit by Smith's side as his spiritual advisor while the ""barbaric"" death takes place.
It is feared Hood too could be killed as the murderer's breathing mask is filled with nitrogen - and the state of Alabama even forced Hood to sign a waiver in the event that he is also killed by any chemicals leaking from the gas mask.
""This is like putting a bag over your dog’s head and holding it as hard as you can until the dog is dead,"" Hood told The Mirror US about the method, which has never before been used or even tested. ""That’s what nitrogen does to a living thing, and that’s what we’re going to see.""
Smith, 58 - who was sentenced to death in 1989 for acting as a hitman to murder a preacher's wife - previously survived an execution attempt in 2022 because medics could not find the veins to deliver the lethal injection. Smith later described the experience as ""like being up under a sewing machine"".

Hood, who has witnessed four lethal injections in various states, says this method is generally ""very peaceful-looking,"" but he believes nitrogen hypoxia is likely to cause an ""incredibly visceral"" reaction in Smith as he suffocates.
Hood said: ""If he throws up in the mask and chokes to death, I think you’re looking at a horrific moment. That mask is very quickly going to look like a volcano exploding out of his face.""
To make matters worse, he said the state wouldn't care if that happened. If he chokes to death on his own vomit, he will still have died, Hood said, and to the Alabama Department of Corrections, that's a successful execution. The Mirror US reached out to the DOC for comment but didn't immediately hear back.
But what if, in another horror scenario, the mask slips off Smith's face and the seal around his airways is broken, allowing the toxic gas to leak into the tiny chamber, where Hood will be next to provide his friend comfort as the executioners perform their jobs? The spiritual advisor said the results could be catastrophic, even apocalyptic.
""If the seal breaks and nitrogen is released into the room, you are talking about an incredibly small room where there’s very little ventilation and very little means for the gas to get out, for the nitrogen to get out,"" he said. ""Yeah, it certainly is terrifying.""
For all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US
Hood's fear of a nitrogen leak is so extreme he said goodbye to his five young children before his trip to Alabama, in the belief there is a chance he wouldn't make it back to see them if something went wrong in the chamber.
""I did hug my kids extra hard and tell them I love them multiple times before I left the house,"" he said, adding that with Alabama's recent history of botched executions, including the first attempt to kill Smith, he doesn't trust the state's record.
""This is a state that has bungled and botched multiple executions in recent years, and it’s hard to believe that this is the group of people that is supposed to carry this out for the first time,"" he said. ""These people are buffoons. I saw them at work in November. These are people who are very unprofessional, and they just don’t know what they’re doing.""
He continued: ""It’s frightening. I don’t trust them not to kill themselves, much less not to kill me. We do know that nitrogen is incredibly dangerous.” He had been referring to the string of incidents — one in 2018 and two in 2022 — during which the state had to stop the execution and reschedule it because of issues with the process.
In 2018, the execution of Doyle Hamm was called off because the executioners were having problems connecting the intravenous lines carrying the deadly chemicals. He later died of natural causes in prison. Then, in July 2022, it took executioners hours to find veins in Joe Nathan James, making for a torturous, painful death by the time the chemicals set in.
A couple of months later, the same thing happened to Smith, with executioners unable to find his veins, eventually leading, in his case, to the execution being called off altogether — which has led to a year of psychological torture related to trauma from the ordeal, Smith has said in interviews and that Hood has also confirmed.
Hood said: ""Kenny describes the initial botched execution like being up under a sewing machine — just consistently being poked over and over and over again. It’s horrific to think about."" He added: ""This is a group of people that just simply could not kill Kenny, who just bungled the whole thing, and he’s supposed to trust them to get it right this next time. That’s absurd, absolutely absurd.""
With all of this in mind and the potentially dangerous nature of the nitrogen hypoxia execution, Hood noted that he was asked to sign a legal waiver before he would be allowed to enter the chamber, which essentially provides immunity to the state and removes any liability should injury or death occur to anyone other than Smith himself.
""I've never been in another execution where I've had to sign another waiver like that,"" Hood said. ""It's strange. It's bizarre. And it's just absurd that's even something that had to be a part of this.""
""There’s an assumption that it’s sort of like nitrous oxide and you just giggle a bit and go,"" he added. ""People don’t realise the dangers, — of course, the dangers he is facing are fatal — but also the dangers the people in the room are facing.
""It’s terrifying what’s possible, but of course, nobody knows. This has never been tried before in the history of humanity — a nitrogen suffocation hypoxia execution. We just don’t know.""
In one of his last conversations with Smith before the execution, Hood said the inmate was thankful for his support, especially his willingness to accompany him into the chamber.
“He told me yesterday, he said, ‘Jeff, if this happens, it’s just me and you together. All the way.’ When he says that, it’s complicated, because there’s a very real risk to me,"" Hood said. ""It certainly is frightening. I have five kids and a family.""
But risks and all, Hood said he'll accompany his friend, whom he said he met and began speaking to in a spiritual capacity just a few months ago in November 2023, into the chamber, because not only is it his job but because he feels a connection with the man and said he'll fight for him and be by his side until the end.
The pair remained hopeful until the execution day arrived, he said, stating: ""Hope dies last, and we remain hopeful."" Hood had led protests and petitions, garnering ""tens of thousands"" of signatures that were sent to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey in the hopes that she would stay the execution and allow the case to be reexamined.
But she didn't, and the U.S. Supreme Court didn't overturn the ruling or allow for more time, either — despite a jury deciding 11-1 to recommend a life sentence without parole back in 1996, which was then overturned by a judge who exercised judicial override to impose the death sentence despite the recommendation. Judicial override was abolished in Alabama — the last state to do so — in April 2017, well after Smith's second trial.
Smith was originally convicted and sentenced to death in 1989 after he killed Elizabeth Sennett, the 45-year-old wife of a preacher from Colbert County, Alabama, who allegedly hired Smith and John Forrest Parker as hitmen to kill her. She was stabbed eight times in the chest and twice, once on each side of her neck, on or around March 18, 1988, at her home. Charles Sennett, Sr., killed himself during the investigation.
Hood warned that going through with the nitrogen hypoxia execution on Thursday would set a dangerous precedent given the ""visceral"" and ""barbaric"" nature of the execution method. ""This is a form of execution that is barbaric, and I think that we are going to see the barbarism of the state of Alabama on full display on Thursday night. I hope the rest of the country pays attention,"" Hood said.
He added that if it goes wrong and doesn't end up killing Smith as intended, the nitrogen could leave him suffering from seizures or put him in a permanent vegetative state. He said that ultimately, no form of execution is humane but said that this one appears to be particularly dangerous and vile.
Hood called attention to the chemical leak in Georgia that occurred in 2021 at a poultry plant that left six workers at the plant dead after refrigerant spilled, causing deadly liquid nitrogen to fill the air.
“I don’t know how anyone could say that such a death is more peaceful or more humane or more gentle or any of those words rather than any other execution form. Let’s not forget that there was a point in history where the electric chair was considered to be more humane,"" Hood explained. “We’ve always been searching as a society for more humane ways to kill people, and I think we need to stop searching for more humane ways to kill people and think about what it means to simply stop killing people.”
The method isn't even used on animals, he added, stating that the very discourse surrounding the possibility that it could be used on animals dehumanises Smith. He said: “This conversation about veterinarians and animals I think really speaks to the level at which we are dehumanizing each other. The baseline to talk about whether this is humane or not for Kenny is to go to a dog or cat or some kind of animal.""
But ""Kenny is not an animal,"" Hood said, adding that the convict ""has really sort of given himself over to his family, his friends, trying to fill every second he has left with love.""
“The state of Alabama is walking us into an atomic bomb of barbarism and inhumanity,"" he concluded. ""And I hope that the rest of the country doesn’t turn its head, doesn’t look away but looks to this moment and says, ‘My God, what have we become?’”"

Vladimir Putin reignited conflict with Ukraine on February 24, 2022 and launched a full blown invasion of the country. Reports at the time claimed that the Kremlin leader had been aiming for a lightning strike on the country that would see Kyiv fall into his hands.
But almost seven hundred days later, he finds his forces trapped in a bloody slow-crawling war with Ukraine - with no end in sight, let alone a conquest of Kyiv. Professor Anthony Glees said he believes there is currently a ""stalemate"" in the conflict that will continue for the next few months.
Fighting into the winter saw conditions grow increasingly harsh, and they will remain so until spring, the politics and security professor said. But whilst some may call for peace, he warned that any peace could be a ""catastrophe"" for the west, the Daily Star reported.
Speaking to the outlet, Professor Glees said: ""Not much is happening in terms of big shifts, and General Valery Zaluzhny's suggestion, that the offensive against Russia has to date now halted in stalemate, must be heeded, despite the fact that it's winter now and no one could expect much to change until spring.
""Russia has taken massive hits. From February 2022 to November 2023 we believe some 280,000 Russian troops have been wounded and 70,000 killed; Wagner troops have lost 20,000 and taken 40,000 in casualties.""
Despite huge numbers of dead on both sides, there remains ""no sign of a breakthrough"" for either side. The professor warned that Russia was in no place to take Kyiv, nor Ukraine to take Crimea back. He continued: ""Brave Zelensky is looking increasingly perplexed; the very thing that was sustaining him, Western and particularly US support for the courage of his nation, is now beginning to seem less secure for the medium term that he could ever have imagined.
""This has always been about the Ukrainians fighting the war albeit with US and NATO weapons and assistance. There will be no NATO armies joining in the fighting, no US cavalry. I suspect much of 2024 will see pressure being put on Zelensky to let Putin take what he's already got and make a peace with him.
""Of course, this will be a catastrophe for Ukraine and for us. We may get peace, Putin's peace, in 2024. But if we do, we have Putin's and Russia's aggression in 2025 and every year thereafter.""
This comes as Russian troops are reportedly being held in desperate conditions and even being “beaten and abused”. The Independent reported that troops were reportedly being beaten, forced to sleep in unheated tents at a training ground in the Volgograd Oblast, and made to purchase their own uniform.
Shelling took the lives of 27 people in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, reports have claimed, as the Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the attack and Vladimir Zelensky did not address the bombing during his latest night time briefing. Meanwhile, North Korea has said it’s ""ready to greet"" Putin according to state media. This would mark the Russian leader’s first trip to Pyongyang in 24 years."

The telecoms and telly giant has just announced the software update in a blog posted on its community pages and there are plenty of small but significant changes coming to living rooms from today.
The free upgrade - named 5.06 and 5.07 - is available on both Virgin Media's Stream and 360 devices with customers expected to see the reboot arriving on screens from today.
So, what's actually new?
This revamp is all about making the experience better for users with Virgin tweaking things. Firstly, the firm is switching its programme tiles from a squeezed portrait view into a more visually appealing landscape option. Virgin says this has been done to ""make the programme tiles more visible."" From the screenshots posted online, see below, it certainly looks better than before.
Next up, Virgin has improved the Settings menu with users now seeing an explanation of what each mode does. When you scroll onto a specific option a box pops up alongside it with a full description. ""For a better understanding of the various settings options available, these will now display a description next to the setting,"" Virgin explained.
Another change is the addition of improved categories when setting up profiles. This should make it easier to see only the content that interests you rather than being bombarded with inappropriate shows.
If you never finish watching things, Virgin has revamped the progress bar which now means you'll only see how much of a show you've seen when you tap on it. Before, the tiles would show the progress of everything which made things look pretty cluttered. The idea is to make things more simplified with Virgin saying, ""The progress bar which shows how much of a show has been watched will now only display on the highlighted programme.""
Finally, the My Watchlist functionality has been improved. Whereas previously you could only add upcoming shows to your watchlist you can now add any programme, including those that have already aired through Catch Up.
There's no word on when a full rollout is taking place but it's worth checking your box to see if things are updated with the new features.
Virgin is also teasing that more changes could be inbound. ""We will keep you updated on future updates,"" the company confirmed so watch this space."

Navarro was convicted of contempt of Congress last September after he failed to cooperate with the investigation into the infamous attack on the U.S. Capitol by right-wing Trump supporters. He now faces a four-month stretch behind bars, after being sentenced today (January 25) at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in Washington D.C.
The 74-year-old is the second of Trump’s aides to face charges for contempt of Congress, following in the footsteps of disgraced White House adviser Steve Bannon. Navarro refused to provide documents requested by by the House Jan. 6 committee, for which he was found guilty.

Navarro was one of those who promoted the former president’s deluded claims about mass voter fraud following the 2020 election loss to President Biden. He served a stretch working as a White House trade adviser under Trump, before he was ousted in disgrace and accused of inciting the riot on Capitol.
The Massachusetts-born adviser previously said he would appeal the verdict and claims he was unable to cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege - when a president orders a branch of government to withhold information in the public interest. But a judge barred him from making that argument at trial after finding that he couldn’t prove that Trump had actually invoked the privilege, the Associated Press reported.

Navarro said before his sentencing on Thursday that the House committee had suggested to him it would accept his plea of executive privilege, pleading with the judge: “Nobody in my position should be put in conflict between the legislative branch and the executive branch.” But the judge dismissed him, stating it took “chutzpah” for him to claim he accepts responsibility for his actions while arguing his prosecution was politically motivated.
“You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution,” the judge said in scathing remarks. “These are circumstances of your own making."" Despite being warned by his lawyers not to address the judge, Navarro spoke up after hearing the judge's disappointment in him. When asked why he didn’t seek advice from a lawyer earlier on in the case, Navarro said: “I didn’t know what to do, sir.”
Navarro will be allowed to submit a request to remain free pending an appeal against the sentence. But prosecutors for the Justice Department argue the adviser, who unsuccessfully ran for office five times in California, was trying to “hide behind claims of privilege” before he even know what the committee wanted.

They argue this shows enough “disdain” for the committee that he should in fact face a longer sentence, initially requested a 6-month prison term alongside a $200,000 fine. Defense attorneys for Navarro requested just a probation sentence alongside a $100 fine, arguing that Trump did claim executive privilege leaving Navarro in an “untenable position”.
Navarro also made a bid for a new trial, with his attorneys arguing jurors had been influenced by political protestors stationed outside the courthouse which they had encountered during a break from deliberations. After the break, jurors found Navarro guilty of two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress.
But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected the request, ruling that Navarro couldn’t show enough to suggest that the eight-minute break in deliberations had an effect on September’s verdict. Judge Mehta found that no protest was underway at the time and no one approached the jurors, who spoke only with each other and the court officer designated to them."

Inside his financial struggles,Mia O'HareShowbiz Reporter,"12:27, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/how-bill-roache-facing-bankruptcy-31973333,"Coronation Street actor Bill Roache is facing bankruptcy despite taking home £250,000 a year.
The soap star, who has played Ken Barlow since 1960, is believed to be the highest paid cast member as he takes home a huge pay cheque. However, the Mirror has revealed the 91-year-old is facing bankruptcy after HMRC filed a petition against him. In a statement to us, HMRC said: ""We take a supportive approach to dealing with customers who have tax debts, and do everything we can to help those who engage with us to get out of debt, such as offering instalment plans.
“We only petition for bankruptcy as a last resort.” A spokesperson for Coronation Street added: ""We're really sorry to hear of Bill's financial situation. Bill has an ongoing contract with Coronation Street and remains a much-loved member of the cast."" It is the second time Bill has faced bankruptcy.
Back in 2018, the Mirror revealed Bill was facing a huge bill after investing in a £500million Cayman Islands tax avoidance scheme. He had invested in Twofold First Services LLP, owned by a company in the Caymans. It is not known how much Bill had put into the scheme, but he was one of 288 investors who entered the scheme and put in, on average, £1.75million.
Papers showed Bill had joined in March 2012. The complex scheme involved claiming tax relief from the artificial losses of a land-owning business and meant investors could use the paper loss to reduce their income tax. A tribunal ruled in favour of HMRC, which successfully argued Twofold was ""a tax avoidance arrangement"". It was branded ""abusive and artificial"" by the Treasury.
The soap actor was declared bankrupt 24 years ago. He successfully sued a newspaper for describing him as “boring” and was awarded £50,000 in damages. However, it was the same amount he had turned down in an out-of-court settlement before the case. It left him liable for £120,000 in costs. Bill sued his law firm for negligence but was declared bankrupt in 1999.
During the coronavirus lockdown, Bill decided to bring in some cash by selling videos to fans. He decided to sign up to Celebrity Video Messages, a service where fans can pay a fee to certain big names and receive a greeting from their idol. Bill was charging £35 for a video, and would send it in four to seven working days.
He has also signed up to Cameo, where he continues to sell personalised videos. Bill has upped his price on the site as he now charges £51 to film a video for fans.
Bill, who is Coronation Street's longest serving star, is believed to be earning £250,000 a year for his role as Ken Barlow and is the highest-paid member of the Corrie cast. Ahead of his 90th birthday, it was reported he'd landed a six figure contract to keep him playing Ken Barlow.
Despite being 91-years-old, Bill has said he doesn't plan on retiring anytime soon. He is even listed in the Guinness World Records as the longest-serving television star in a continuous role. As he turned 90, he was celebrated with an ITV documentary. In the show, he said:  ""People will say when are you retiring? Are you going to take a break? But then what happens?
""Whilst I can do it, and whilst they will have me, I have no intention of retiring. I am so fortunate to work for an organisation that is happy to have me.""

4D2IJODNZE_PM6ZO4XKFUXHZDM,British Gas profits 'set to rocket to more than £800million' as families struggle,Graham HiscottHead of Business,"14:33, 23 Jan 2024Updated16:01, 23 Jan 2024",20230123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/british-gas-profits-set-rocket-31948020,"British Gas is set to spark fresh anger by revealing profits rocketed to more than £800million last year.
The country’s biggest supplier, like rivals, has benefited from industry watchdog Ofgem allowing it to claw back money through higher bills. British Gas, with 7.5 million customers, made £72million in profit in 2022, lower than in 2021 because of soaring wholesale energy costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
But analysts expect a big turnaround when owner Centrica reports group results on February 15. Investment bank Investec predicts British Gas’s supply arm raked in £816million last year. Rival UBS has pencilled in a haul of £895million.
Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: “These outrageous profits will come as a kick in the teeth to households who’ve spent the best part of a week shivering in cold homes. Last winter we saw around 5,000 excess winter deaths caused by living in cold homes and we know people are turning off their heating because they can’t afford the bills.”
Last July British Gas announced it made a record £969million in the first six months of 2023. The haul was boosted by a one-off of around £500million after regulator Ofgem allowed suppliers to recoup past losses through its price cap mechanism.
Forecasts suggest British Gas made a loss in the second half of last year. Analysts predict profits at Centrica as a whole dropped from £3.3billion in 2022 to anywhere between £2.5billion and £2.7billion last year.
Investec analyst Martin Young said Centrica’s cash position was “significantly better than we had previously estimated.” Centrica declined to comment on the estimated profits at British Gas and the group.
It came as Chris O’Shea, boss of Centrica, recently admitted he could not justify his £4.5million pay and perks payout for 2022. The package was 77 times more than Centrica’s average worker got, and 128 times its 25% lowest paid staff.
Quizzed on the BBC Breakfast, Mr O’Shea, 50, said: “I’m incredibly fortunate. I don’t set my own pay, that’s set by our remuneration committee. You can’t justify a salary of that size.”
Mr O’Shea turned down a £1.1million bonus in 2021, but took one worth £1.4million for 2022. He has yet to reveal if he will waive his 2023 annual bonus, if offered one. It could be worth up to double his salary - or £1.6million.
His base salary rose from £790,000 to £815,000 in April last year. Most households are on standard energy tariffs which are subject to Ofgem’s price cap. The cap rose to £1,928 a year at the start of January for a typical household on a standard tariff paying by direct debit.
But experts predict it will fall to an average £1,620 in April, then tumble to £1,497 a year in July. Ofgem allows suppliers to make a certain profit margin on standard tariffs, which has increased from 1.9% to 2.34% to allow them to recover the impact of customer bad debts."
4DFMW398IB_T8WXWNEUCKQ4ZLO,Alice Evans breaks silence after ex-husband Ioan Gruffudd announces engagement,Daniel BirdAssistant Showbiz Editor,"10:41, 23 Jan 2024Updated20:07, 6 Feb 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-alice-evans-breaks-silence-31930182,"Alice Evans has broken her silence following the news that her ex-husband, Ioan Gruffudd, is set to marry again.
The 55-year-old British-American actress was married to 50-year-old Welsh actor Ioan in 2007, but they endured an explosive marriage breakdown that resulted in a divorce being finalised in July 2023. On Saturday 20 January 2024, it was revealed that Ioan had asked his 37-year-old actress girlfriend Bianca Wallace for her hand in marriage - and she was more than happy to say yes.
Bianca took to Instagram to share the happy news, lifting her hand to the camera while sporting an impossible-to-miss engagement ring as she leaned forward to kiss Ioan. She shared the snap alongside a caption reading: “The most precious thing happened…” with a red heart emoji and an engagement ring emoji.
Now Alice, who shares daughters Elsie and Ella with Ioan, has broken her silence in light of the news. She took to Instagram to share a snap of her dog, Emma, and replied to fans who asked how she was doing. Sharing a post of Emma, she said: ""Ok so this was not meant to be Emma’s account but I can’t help myself.
""Yesterday she got groomed! I cannot speak highly enough of @Barkbus (check out the account it’s too cute for words). Emma barely even flinched! It was like she was enjoying it (she does NOT enjoy baths or nail trims when we do it!) I did feel a bit bad this morning because if you look at the last pic she has that ‘new haircut face’ that we all used to have when we had our haircut and it was a bit fresh and short and we had to go back to school? She’s lucky it’s raining today though so she can stay home and won’t bump into any of her friends on the street. But she's way more comfortable and it will grow back. ( well that’s what we keep telling her anyway) Bless her cottons.""
Taking to the comment section of her post, one follower asked Alice how she and ""the girls"" were doing, to which she responded: ""We're good thank you! How are you doing Anette?"" Another penned: ""aliceevansgruff WHAT A LUCKY FAMILY YOU HAVE. The girls, the pup and YOU! Just so PRECIOUS and SPECIAL!"" Alice replied: ""Aw thank you! I am quite proud of our little fam! So sweet of you to say.""
Meanwhile, a third typed: ""Emma is a sweetheart and she has been the best friend and family that you and the girls have needed over the last few years."" Alice didn't hold back as she commented back: ""She really has. It's amazing seeing what it has done for the girls - how having Emma has injected positivity and love and security into their lives. I'm so glad we got her!""
Back in January 2021, it was Alice who broke news about the sudden end of her relationship with Ioan as she shared a heartbreaking announcement online. She explained she had been left devastated after the father of her two children allegedly walked out.
She wrote online at the time: “Sad news. My beloved husband/soul mate of 20 years, Ioan Gruffudd, has announced he is to leave his family, starting next week. Me and our young daughters are very confused and sad. We haven't been given a reason except that he ‘no longer loves me’. I'm so sorry.”
There then followed months of brutal swipes in the public sphere as both parties struggled to move on with their lives. By September last year, reports suggested that Alice was struggling to make rent - having moved herself and her daughters into rented accommodation so as to escape the broken marital home.
While Ioan has found happiness in a new relationship, reports last year suggested that Alice too had started to move on. On 2 August 2023, she hinted that she was enjoying a new relationship as she celebrated her 55th birthday.
She wrote alongside a batch of photos as the time: ""We had the BEST TIME EVER. Instagram won’t let me put in all the pics in one go. ( wisely, probably!) I am SO in love right now and cannot believe I only felt this level of intense love at 55. More info coming. Love you all for being so kind to me. I will never forget. I may sound cryptic but life has taught me ( at least on small measures) to be cautious. All will become clear. Love love love love you all.""
And fans noticed she soon after was sporting a giant ring on her finger. When one fan asked online: ""What’s that on your hand??"", Alice responded: ""It's a gift. From one of my favorite people in the world. I hope that person will notice.""

The victim was walking along Featherstall Road North in Oldham, Manchester at around 9:30pm on December 31 when he was approached by 'a group of people'. The group demanded that the boy hand over his bag and threatened him, but he refused to give it to them.
He was then attacked and left with an injury to his head while the suspects fled the scene with his bag. The boy was rushed to hospital after calling the police.
Police have released photos of four people they want to speak to about the attack, which took place on New Year's Eve last year, as part of an investigation launched today, January 26.
Officers believe the people in the photo 'may have further information regarding this incident that could help with the investigation'.

There comes a time in your 20s when you realise the man sitting across from you at the dinner table is not your Prince Charming. Perhaps he's rude to the waiter, or tells you too many times he's 'actually a feminist' and expects a standing ovation. Or maybe, he doesn't like your body hair.
That's exactly what happened to Esther Calixte-Bea, who hasn't shaved since 22 yet feels sexier than ever. Growing up in a predominantly white neighbourhood, Calixte-Bea spent her childhood fretting over what people would think if they saw her natural hairiness, which she described as a 'burden'.
In a recent interview, she told the Mirror: ""I wouldn't go swimming because I didn't want to spend so much time removing my body hair to then seeing it grow back after two days, getting ingrown hair and scars. I remember constantly lifting up my shirt making sure it was properly covering my chest hair because I was so afraid someone would see it and that I would get bullied.""
However, now 27, Calixte-Bea (also known online as Queen Esie) decided to embrace her natural hair and refuses to be part of a system that teaches women their body is 'unhygienic, ugly, or undesirable'. She says she now feels 'free' and is 'much happier' than before - even when it causes issues with her love life.
Speaking about her experiences, she explained: “There was one time when I was seeing this guy who did make a comment saying that he wouldn’t date a girl that’s hairier than him. And I thought how odd.
“So I ended up ending that relationship entirely because I didn’t feel like that was productive or that I wanted to be with a man like that. He was not a very kind person.""

However, since the awkward encounter, Queen Esie has found 'plenty of men' who have been comfortable with her body hair. ""There was a guy who was really into me and I had never told him about the fact I had chest hair,"" she added.
“I decided to tell him because I kinda knew he was in love with me, so I thought that by telling or showing him that I have chest hair, he would stop liking me because I didn’t like him. Once I showed it to him, he still liked me, he was like 'I really don’t care'.""
Back in 2019, the social media star created the Lavender Project - where she showed off her chest hair in a V-neck purple dress. The movement inspired woman around the globe to share their stories and start celebrating their body hair.
""I wanted to share my story and start a discussion about femininity, female body hair and beauty,"" she told the Mirror. ""I wanted to show people that you, as a woman, can be beautiful with your body hair.""

4K0Z2XDKS2_B4K1DK6UT3O901X,Stark measles warning that one in five children who catch it will be hospitalised,Martin BagotHealth and Science editor,"17:57, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/stark-measles-warning-one-five-31941908,"One in five children who catch measles during the current outbreak will be hospitalised with it, the Government has warned.
Health Minister Maria Caulfield updated the House of Commons on the national outbreak and admitted “not enough” had been done to improve vaccination rates in the last decade.
It has seen the UK lose its measles-free status and England is now in the grip of a national outbreak. Nearly a third of under-16s are vulnerable to measles because they were not fully vaccinated with both MMR jab doses at ages one and three.
In a written ministerial statement, Ms Caulfield said: “Analysis shows that one infected child in a classroom can infect up to nine other unvaccinated children, making it one of the most infectious diseases worldwide and more infectious than Covid-19
“One in five children with measles will need to be admitted to a hospital for treatment – which could put additional pressure on the NHS. Measles is not just a childhood disease and can be serious at any age. If caught during pregnancy it can be very serious causing stillbirth, miscarriage and low birth weight.”
Measles cases have doubled in a year amid the biggest outbreak since the 1990s and unvaccinated children in parts of the Midlands are being forced to isolate off school for up to three weeks. One in 5,000 children who catch it will die from the disease, while other complications include pneumonia and a dangerous brain infection.
Health minister Maria Caulfield, responding to an urgent question, told MPs: ""For our MMR vaccine to be working, the World Health Organisation recommends at least 95% coverage to maintain population coverage; at the moment our MMR reach is 89.3% for the first dose of 24 months and 84.5% for the second dose at five years. This is not a new issue, this has been a gradual 10-year decline in coverage.”
Outbreaks centred on the Midlands and London could spread to other towns and cities if a catch up vaccine programme is not successful, health chiefs have warned.
Ms Caulfield added: ""We've not been waiting. The NHS carried out a catch-up effort over the last 12 months, proactively contacting parents and carers of unvaccinated children aged five and younger, and we've seen a 10% increase in vaccination compared to the previous year. But that is not enough. NHS figures show almost 3.5 million under the age of 16 are unprotected and at risk of catching this serious and preventable disease."""
4LJ81HV8P5_ETD3IJEMTYRVIEP,British bases put on high alert for backlash after second RAF bombing of Houthi rebels,Chris HughesDefence and Security Editor,"22:44, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/british-bases-put-high-alert-31952045,"The RAF’s second bombing blitz on Houthi rebels was self-defence, Rishi Sunak said on Tuesday as British bases were put on high alert for a backlash.
Four UK Typhoons joined US forces to smash targets in Yemen on Monday night after attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden continued. Prime Minister Mr Sunak vowed Britain would not hesitate to launch further air strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis unless they stopped.
Mr Sunak said: “We are not seeking a confrontation. We urge the Houthis and those who enable them to stop these illegal and unacceptable attacks. But, if necessary, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence. We cannot stand by and allow these attacks to go unchallenged. Inaction is also a choice.”
Sources said Western bases in places such as Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East are under increased risk of Tehran-sponsored retaliation. One said: “Iranian groups in Iraq have increasingly launched attacks on US and UK targets and there is a risk of this elsewhere in the region.”
The RAF Typhoons and two Voyager tankers were involved in the latest action, refuelling the attack craft mid-air during the 3,200-mile round trip.
Two military sites north of Yemen’s capital Sanaa were hit in the attacks launched from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. All intended targets were destroyed, said Mr Sunak.
The Houthis have been targeting shipping they claim is linked to Israel and the conflict with Hamas. The latest air strikes – which follow the first joint blitz on January 11 – appear to have done little to deter them, with reports of drone activity in the region on Tuesday.
Mr Sunak told MPs the military action against the Houthis was just one part of a strategy which includes disrupting supplies of arms, sanctions and talks with regional powers.
A rocket strike by Hamas killed 21 Israeli soldiers, their biggest death toll in a single attack.
As Israelis encircled Khan Younis in Gaza, a rocket-propelled grenade fired at a tank set off an explosion that brought two buildings down on the soldiers.
It happened a day after the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza stormed the Knesset, trying to force Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government to strike a deal for their release. In Lebanon, Hezbollah militants fired missiles at an Israeli air base on Mount Meron. The group said it was in response to “recent assass-inations in Lebanon and Syria”.

Keir Starmer said Labour backed the “targeted action to reinforce maritime security in the Red Sea”. He told MPs: “The Houthi attacks must stop. They are designed to destabilise us so we must stand united and strong. They bring danger to ordinary civilians who are working hard at sea, so we must protect them. And they aim to disrupt the flow of goods, food and medicines, so we must not let them go unaddressed.”
MPs will get the chance to debate the situation on Wednesday. The PM’s official spokesman said: “It’s important that parliamentarians are able to have their say but we are acting in line with precedence. The powers to make a decision on this action rests with the Prime Minister.”"

Valdo Calocane claimed three lives and left three others badly injured during an early morning knife and van attack across Nottingham on June 13 last year.
The 32-year-old killed university students Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19, as they walked home from a night out, celebrating the end of their academic year. Calocane then stabbed beloved school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, 15 times, leaving him for dead as he stole his van and rammed into three people. The court heard they were extremely fortunate to have survived.
Officers chased Calocane down, before finding him behind the wheel of the van with a ""dagger"" in hand where they Tasered him. The prosecution accepted Calocane’s pleas of not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter - after consulting with the families. Today (Thursday), Caloncane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at a high security hospital, subject to special restrictions.
But, after Calocane killed the two university students, he made his way to a residential hostel where he arrived around 5am. Just minutes later, the killer was captured on CCTV trying to force his way into the hostel through a ground-floor window. Calocane can be seen climbing on the ledge and trying to haul himself up and in.
It raises the chilling prospect of the killer gaining entry into the hostel and continuing his stabbing spree there. However, he was stopped by an unknown hero. On CCTV a hand can be seen reaching out to Calocane and shoving him back from the window. The killer is clearly discouraged, and walks away, and just 10 minutes later he attacked and killed Mr Coates.
In court, the families of the three victims spoke movingly in their victim impact statements, often directly addressing Calocane. In the moments before she died, Grace bravely tried to fight off the attacker.
In an interview with Sky News, her brother James, 17, said: “Grace's last moments were in pain and that's something that really hurts me to think about and she was a hero, that was her character. She tried her best to save her friend. That was how Grace lost her life in the most vulnerable manner. She would never leave a friend, never, and that was very evident from her last moments. She passed fighting.""
Grace’s father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, spoke in court about his pride that his daughter had followed in his footsteps. He said: “When she decided to study medicine I was so proud. She aspired to be in the Royal Army Medical Corps and then in the NHS, she had a moral code she used to beat people with. She was my best friend and the love of my life and I thought I was the luckiest man in the world having my daughter and son.
""You planned your attack, you bought multiple knives and picked children to attack. Our children. Then you went and attacked an elderly man, the weakest members of society and that is cowardly and unforgivable. You showed yourself to be a cold, calculating and cowardly killer, you brought violence to our shores and to our doors."""
4OCSB989DG_7QWR9X13Y43Q1IV,Norfolk house deaths: Six unanswered questions after four bodies found dead in home,Kieren WilliamsNews Reporter,"13:53, 23 Jan 2024Updated08:15, 24 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/six-unanswered-questions-after-four-31947750,"There are a number of unanswered questions around the horrific incident that saw four people, including two young girls, killed.
Police were called by a member of the public to a property in Costessey, Norfolk, on Friday 19 January around 7am. A previous 999 call had been made by the property at just before 6am, but officers did not respond.
Upon arrival, police had to force their way into the property where they tragically found four bodies. These belonged to Bartlomiej Jakub Kuczynski, 46, seven-year-old Downreuang and Jasmin, 12, and Bartlomiej’s sister-in-law Kanticha Noon, 36.
Police had made previous contact with the address, on December 14 of last year, in relation to a missing person enquiry. The force have now referred themselves to the Independent Office of Police Conduct. Norfolk’s Chief Constable Paul Sanford said: “This is a tragic and horrific incident and my thoughts, and that of the entire constabulary, remain with the family of those involved.
“I’m aware this incident has also caused great upset and shock in Costessey, the wider community and beyond. I know the family and the public will rightly want to know whether there was an ability to prevent this tragedy, and this is a question that must be answered.”
He said there would be an inquest into the incident, and that he welcomed the scrutiny around the force’s actions. But there remains a number of unanswered questions regarding the tragedy as the community reels from what happened.
A first 999 call was made from the house, believed to be by Bartlomiej, almost an hour before officers responded to a call from a member of the public.
The first emergency call was made from a ""man inside the address"" just before 6am, but police were not deployed. The force has not explained why this was, and said such answers would come on the back of an IOPC investigation. Questions now hang over the force about whether had they responded to this call, could lives have been saved.
Mr Sandford said: “Following the identification of the earlier 999 call, the constabulary referred itself to the IOPC who will now investigate. It is because of this process that I choose my words carefully; not because I don’t want to be open and honest, but because I have a duty to protect the integrity of any investigation that needs to follow.
“It will be for this investigation to identify and consider the circumstances and to consider if there were any issues with the response.”
Whilst it has been said that all four people tragically died, the series of events leading to that are still unclear.
Whilst we know that both Bartlomiej and Kanticha died of stab wounds to the neck, a post-mortem into the girls will take place tomorrow. It isn’t clear who had stabbed whom, or what had taken place that left a father, his sister-in-law and his two kids all dead.
Despite this, following extensive enquiries, police have confirmed that they are looking for nobody else in relation to the incident. Formal identification is yet to take place and the next of kin is being kept informed of developments and supported by specialist officers.
It still isn’t known where the mother is. Kanticha, the mum’s sister, was amongst the four who tragically died, and her friend Naty Wathanakul spoke to the Mirror about the tragedy.
But Naty wasn’t sure where the mother way and little is known about her. Naty said she worked as a caretaker and ran the children’s clothing shop Malishop. Despite this, she thought she was in the UK still, but didn’t know where, or whether she had been living with her family at the time.
Kanticha had travelled from Thailand to visit her sister’s family, a friend told the Mirror, but it isn’t apparent if there was any meaning behind this trip.
Especially given the mother’s absence, there are all the more questions about Kanticha’s presence. Kanticha's best friend Naty Wathanakul told the Mirror she was due to fly home some point next month after flying out on December 27. The girls' mum was said to work as a caretaker, she said.
Describing her friend, Naty said: ""She was very nice and caring to all friends of her, a really big supportive person, she helped everyone. We have been shocked and depressed since we knew about her death. I wasn't expecting that my friend wouldn't be able to come back alive. She was just a petite woman, i cant believe this happened to her. It was too cruel to handle, I was crying.""
Another key element of the unanswered question relates to the earliest confirmed interaction the family had with police.
On December 14, the police had previous contact with the address in relation to a missing person enquiry. Officers offered no detail on what happened and it remains unclear what exactly happened regarding this incident, and if the family were offered any support afterwards.
On of the hardest questions around this tragic incident is about how the two youngsters, seven-year-old Downreuang and Jasmin, 12, both ended up dead.
It’s know that both adults died of knife wounds, but it hasn’t been confirmed yet who wielded the knife, and how the youngsters ended up dead too. A post-mortem for their both is due to take place on Wednesday which could shed more light."

The current policy for those who do not qualify for maternity, primary adopter, or other primary parental leave, is just a fortnight off work – and often on reduced pay.
However, 69% feel this is not long enough to bond with their newborn, and adapt to becoming a parent – with 61% wanting to take more time off.
Four in 10 (41%) claim this extra time with their child would have helped them to feel more relaxed, with 32% saying it could have helped them grow closer to their infant.
However, over half of those (54%), who would have liked additional time off work, felt they couldn't afford to take it – and 23% believed it was not an option.
As such, the survey of 500 adults, who have had a baby in the last five years, or plan to do so, found that 48% feel parental leave policies have played a major part in their decision about whether to start a family.
It emerged that those who have had a baby typically took almost three weeks off in paid leave – but 10% only had a maximum of a week at home with their little one.
The study was commissioned by Kellanova, the parent company of Kellogg’s and Pringles, to announce a new co-parent policy for its employees – offering up to 10 weeks of paid leave within a year of the baby’s birth.
This applies to fathers or same-sex female relationships, where only one parent is currently entitled to take maternity leave.
Elly Campbell Godkin, senior HR manager at Kellanova, which will also offer paid time off for employees who have pregnant partners to attend antenatal classes and appointments, said: “When I had my first child last year, I knew that I didn’t want to take a full year out from work.
“I’d recently been appointed into a new role that I really wanted to get started in, so my husband and I fully shared our leave. We both wanted quality time off with our daughter, and taking five months off each allowed us to learn how to be the best parents we could be – as individuals and together.”
The study, carried out via OnePoll, also revealed one in three parents (32%) believe they would get just the statutory paternity or co-parent leave of up to two weeks paid if they had a child.
Others worried about the stigma – particularly for men – around taking time off (15%), or what their colleagues would think (13%), while 12% felt it was frowned upon in their workplace.
But a quarter claim that taking time off meant they would have missed out on fewer milestones, such as their child's first smile.
Simon Kelleher, head of policy and influencing at Working Families, said: “We welcome Kellanova’s decision to offer an enhanced parental leave package, particularly given that all of its employees will be offered it as a day one right.
“Our research indicates that individuals may hesitate to take parental leave, due to the negative implications on their finances.
“We encourage other employers to follow suit in implementing enhanced parental leave policies. This not only supports employees during the crucial first year of their child’s life, but also underscores the need for action from government.
“As our Working Families Index polling reveals that only 29% of lower income working parents have access to enhanced leave, policymakers need to review statutory pay levels, and introduce extended leave for fathers or secondary caregivers.”"

Ben picked the former Gladiators host as his celebrity crush according to former Celebs Go Dating star Ryan-Mark Parsons. In a clip of Ben and Ryan-Mark shared on social media, Ulrika commented a heart emoji, with the former The Apprentice star suggesting that there may be a spark between the pair.
Ben has been keeping a low profile in the wake of his split from Vanessa Feltz last year. The TalkTV presenter, 61, dumped the Phats and Small star, 51, after finding out he'd been unfaithful multiple times across their 16-year relationship, despite his denial that he is a serial cheat.
Ryan-Mark sat down for a chat with his pal Ben and revealed that he grilled him on his love life, who he would like to date and his split from Vanessa which will be shared online this weekend. But he insists that both Ulrika and Ben could be the perfect match after noticing they have similar interests.
The youngest ever Apprentice candidate, says he knows the pair very well and thinks they would make a perfect match. He told The Mirror: ""Ben is very much interested like a lot of men are, who can blame him? She is stunning. Ulrika has always been someone admired by men.
""The fact she left a love heart on the trailer? Well, you can make your own mind up about that. I worked with Ulrika for three months, I know Ben very well, and I know they would get on like a house on fire. Ben loves red wine, Ulrika loves rum - go and have a drink together.
""They would make a very good pairing. Ben was candid in the interview and I think people will see a whole new side to him. He's very open about what he thinks of Ulrika too. I think it's been bubbling away and I hope they take things forward and see if there's a spark there.""
Ulrika offered Vanessa advice weeks after her relationship crumbled. She said: ""Painful as it is, you’ve got to just endure it. It doesn’t matter how strong, how independent or how smart you are, heartbreak is an absolute swine."" The pair appeared on Celebrity Big Brother together in 2010.
Vanessa kicked Ben out of their North London home and blocked his calls in the aftermath of their split. Ben told the Mirror weeks after: “I’ve broken her trust. She gave me another chance. I’ve gone and destroyed that.” Spelling out his cheating last March, Ben went on: “So many people have been hurt, not just Vanessa. I was so close to her grandchildren, her daughters, and their husbands. We’re a close-knit family.
“My family have been appalled by it as well. There’s been a lot of pain. “My last conversation with Vanessa was me saying how wonderful she was, how she was the love of my life and saying how much I loved her and that I’m so, so sorry it’s happened. ‘Please find it in your heart to forgive me’. Those were the last words I said. Then she blocked me on her phone, on social media and never answered my emails.""

4RG5A7K5N5_W7SOSNOHR3IZDAV,'I tried the 'perfect' cuppa made by American scientists - and it contains salt',Niamh KirkLifestyle Writer,"16:15, 24 Jan 2024Updated16:27, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-tried-perfect-cuppa-made-31958395,"Us Brits love a brew, it's something we're known for - and it's widely known that we make tea better than anyone else.
But an American scientist reckons she's concocted up the ""perfect"" equation for the best cup of tea - and it contains salt.
According to Professor Michelle Francl, a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College, the perfect cuppa features loose-leaf tea leaves instead of a tea bag and that the hot drink should be served in a short and stout mug.
Francl analysed research papers and ancient texts dating back more than 1,000 years to devise the best brew, and recorded these experiments in her new book, Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea.
Now I am all for trying new things, especially when it comes to tea, but for me, putting salt in my steaming hot brew made the hairs stand up on my arms. Surely this can't be real? So of course, I had to try it. Anything to make my beloved cup of tea better, right?
The claim has landed the professor in hot water, with even the US embassy hitting back at the suggestion to add salt, saying in a post on X: ""We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our Special Relationship.
""Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, a sacred bond that unites our nations. Therefore we want to ensure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy. And never will be.
""Let us unite in our steeped solidarity and show the world that when it comes to tea, we stand as one. The US embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way - by microwaving it.""
The Cabinet Office has also waded into the row, saying it ""must disagree wholeheartedly"" with the US embassy's statement.
""Tea can only be made using a kettle,"" it sternly rebutted.
I feared I would get disowned by my gran when I told her I was putting salt in my tea, but she calmly responded: ""It's us who are famous for tea, so I don't know how they can give us lessons... good luck.""
And with her well wishes, off I went to go and buy some loose-leaf tea.
The professor says that the mug should be heated up at a higher temperature while steeping to increase the amount of caffeine and antioxidants.
Now, if you are telling me I can get an even bigger caffeine hit with a cup of tea, I am all ears. I also like this idea as it will keep my tea hotter for longer. Apparently, the shorter mug keeps the tea hotter for longer too.
So, with the mug heated up, boiling water in and tea infuser in the mug I let the leaves do their work. As I strained the leaves, it very quickly gave a strong tea colour and I was impressed - it saved me from having to squeeze the life out of a tea bag. Professor Michelle claims that using loose-leaf tea leaves means there's ""more room for the tea to circulate"" and will ""extract more of their fragrant compounds"".
Next up I heated the milk, and according to the expert, this reduces the chance of the milk curdling. I can't say I have ever had this issue before, but again it will keep my tea hotter for longer, and I add warm milk to my coffee so I wasn't too offended by this idea either.
However, what I, and probably the rest of Britain will be offended by is the idea of adding salt. Yes, table salt. So, go with me on this, the expert claimed: ""The sodium ion reduces the bitterness in your cuppa."" Now, I was very reluctant to do this but she said all you need is a pinch.
Adding the salt I stirred cautiously and couldn't believe I was about to ruin what looked like a glorious steamy cup of tea. However, in the name of science, I was happy to give it a whirl. Professor Michelle also urged to only use the leaves once as she warned: ""Virtually all of the caffeine and antioxidants are gone within a minute of steeping."" That's us told.
Anyway, I decided it was time to take a sip of my science experiment and I was actually pleasantly surprised. I couldn't taste the salt at all. So I added a little more, and still couldn't taste it. I have to say, it was actually a really good cup of tea but I'm not sure the salt made any difference.
Overall I enjoyed my tea, but out of deference to everything I have ever known, I probably won't be adding salt again. Instead, I'll save it for my chips. I also feel as if it goes against everything we Brits have worked towards to hold the crown for the best brew.

4U7QOBWBE9_OJL3DDYKX7HLSQR,How Sir David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst's relationship deteriorated over the years,Zoe DelaneyAssistant Showbiz Editor,"11:14, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/how-sir-david-jason-nicholas-31945451,"Only Fools and Horses fans may be desperate for one more episode of the much-loved comedy but it will sadly never happen.
Sir David Jason, 83, recently admitted he would love to reprise his role as Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter one final time but knows it's not meant to be following the death of the BBC show's creator John Sullivan.
But it's not only John's passing that is putting a stop to Only Fools and Horses gracing our TV screens once again. Sir David and his former co-star Nicholas Lyndhurst, 62, aren't exactly the best of friends these days - with the pair no longer speaking despite once having a close bond.
Sir David and Nicholas, both best known for their time playing market trader brothers Del Boy and Rodney Trotter, lost contact after filming together as Trotters for a one-off charity special in 2014 and things have been frosty ever since.
But problems between the two actors possibly began long before 2014, with Sir David previously admitting an on-set ""row"" between himself and Nicholas left an Only Fools and Horses producer ""fuming"" back in the 1980s!
Speaking in 1989, David recalled: ""One day, Nick and I were in our very small caravan on location. We were all fed up because nothing was happening so [we] said 'why don't we stage a huge row and you can storm out and say you're leaving and I can shout at you saying don't you ever come back again'.""
He continued: ""'I never want to work with you'. The whole crew went stiff. Five minutes went by and the producer and director came to see me and they were quaking in their boots. They asked what's going on and I told them to go see Nick. When they got to him, I couldn't contain myself any longer and roared with laughter. They went from white to purple in their faces. I don't think the producer was much impressed.""
While their ""row"" in the late eighties was staged, Sir David and Nicholas' close bond deteriorated over the years - despite the pair previously admitting to being close friends away from the Only Fools and Horses set. Sir David said once in an interview: ""You couldn't have had a better co-partner than Nic. We liked and respected each other so much, we were genuinely good friends.""
Likewise, Nicholas told Red Carpet News in 2017: ""We had a very similar work ethic and ethos - that we wanted to do our best as quickly as possible. You didn't have very long to record an episode [...] We didn't have much time to rehearse it so we had to have each other's back.""
However, by 2022 things had clearly changed. Sir David admitted in an interview that he and Nicholas no longer talk, admitting: ""He's much more, how can I say, self-contained, perhaps, than he used to be. So, unfortunately, we don't see each other as much as I'd like to. But that's how things work out sometimes.""
It's believed that Nicholas has also stayed out of the limelight after his 20-year-old son Archie died suddenly in 2020. Archie tragically died from a brain haemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Sir David admitted that he's sad they aren't doing the series together any more. He explained: ""I miss it terribly. It wasn't like going to work. It was going to have some fun with your mates. We loved each other.""

4VWX7LFIQP_WSJV0PFNLDH6A93,Nottingham stabbing victim's family says police boss has 'blood on hands' after sentencing,Ryan MerrifieldNews Reporter,"13:03, 25 Jan 2024Updated13:11, 25 Jan 2024",20230125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nottingham-stabbing-victims-family-says-31965561,"The family of one of the victims of the ""monster"" Nottingham knifeman has accused the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of misleading them, and said a police boss has ""blood on his hands"".
Attacker Valdo Calocane has paranoid schizophrenia, and killed three people and attacked three others in a spate of ""atrocities"" in the city. He has today been sentenced to an indefinite hospital order.
Judge Mr Justice Turner said the 32-year-old would ""very probably"" be detained in a high-security hospital for the rest of his life after ""deliberately and mercilessly"" stabbing students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, in the early hours of June 13 last year.
Emma Webber, mother of Barnaby, said outside court that “true justice has not been served today”, adding the families of Calocane’s victims had been “let down” by the CPS, claiming they lied about consulting them before bringing charges.
""We trusted in our system - foolishly, as it turns out,"" she says, adding she has been ""rushed and railroaded"". ""Our darling son, his dear friend Grace and a wonderful grandfather Ian have been stolen from us."" The families describe Calocane as a ""monster"".

Referring to an arrest order issued but not carried out nine months before the deaths, Mrs Webber said the assistant chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police has ""blood on his hands"". In a message directed at Rob Griffin, she said: ""If you had just done your job properly, there's a very good chance my beautiful boy would be alive today.""
She says there is ""much more to say"" and ""serious questions"" remain. ""But for today, our darling son, his dear friend Grace, and a wonderfully kind grandfather, Ian, have been stolen from us forever and let down by the very system that should have been protecting them,"" she said.
Mrs Webber said: “We as a devastated family have been let down by multiple agency failings and ineffectiveness. The CPS did not consult us as has been reported – instead we have been rushed, hastened and railroaded.”
She said the first meeting with them was on November 24. She said: “We were presented with a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges. At no point during the previous five-and-a-half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder.
“We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out. We do not dispute that the murderer is mentally unwell and has been for a number of years. However the pre-mediated planning, the collection of lethal weapons, hiding in the shadows and brutality of the attacks are that of an individual who knew exactly what he was doing. He knew entirely that it was wrong but he did it anyway.”
Mr Griffin said in a statement on Wednesday that the force ""should have done more"" to arrest Calocane before the fatal attacks of June 13. In August 2022, Calocane was reported for summons after assaulting a police officer and was due to attend court in September for that assault, but failed to appear and a warrant for his arrest was issued.
""The defendant was never arrested for that warrant which was still outstanding at the point of his arrest in June 2023,"" Mr Griffin said. ""I have personally reviewed this matter and we should have done more to arrest him.""
Sentencing, Mr Justice Turner told the killer: ""You committed a series of atrocities in this city which ended the lives of three people. Your sickening crimes both shocked the nation and wrecked the lives of your surviving victims and the families of them all.""
He said the ""harrowing"" details of the attacks have been ""fully recounted and explored"" in court over the past days and Calocane sentenced many relatives and friends to ""a life of grief and pain"".
The judge told the triple killer: ""There was never any doubt that it was you who had committed these appalling crimes.
What can you be sentenced to under the Mental Health Act?
""It soon became clear however, that the central issue in this case would relate to whether at the time of committing these offences you were suffering from symptoms of severe mental disorder.""
The judge added that the psychiatric evidence did not detract from the ""horror"" and ""disastrous"" impact of the offences, but he said, in his view, Calocane's abnormality of mind had ""significantly contributed"" to him perpetrating the string of attacks.
Despite being detained in high-security Ashworth Hospital since November, Mr Justice Turner said he still ""remains dangerous"".
During the three-day hearing, the court heard how Calocane, a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Nottingham, hid in the shadows in Ilkeston Road at around 4am on June 13 armed with a dagger before beginning his attack on Barnaby and Grace as they walked back to their student accommodation after an end-of-term night out.
Witness evidence read to the court described ""an awful, blood curdling scream"" as Calocane, dressed all in black, inflicted at least 10 stab wounds on Barnaby and then 23 separate dagger wounds on Grace, who was attacked as she tried to protect her friend from the blows.
Commenting after the case, Janine McKinney, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Valdo Calocane's actions that morning sent shockwaves through our entire community.
""He left three bereaved families devastated by grief and others with life-changing physical and emotional injuries. These were savage, ferocious attacks against entirely innocent people who had no way of defending themselves. His pleas to manslaughter were only accepted after very careful analysis of the evidence.
""We reached this conclusion because the expert medical evidence was overwhelming; namely that his actions were substantially impaired by psychosis resulting from paranoid schizophrenia."""

Dave Chen-Williams collapses in front of his horrified loved ones in upcoming scenes, resulting in him being rushed to hospital. A recent trailer teased the shocking moment on the E4 and Channel 4 soap, and now new spoilers have given extra details.
Earlier this month, a new character as well as two existing characters were killed off in jaw-dropping scenes. The unnamed newcomer and teen Ella Richardson were killed in the devastating car crash pile-up, seemingly caused by Ste Hay.
Meanwhile, Rafe Harcourt was murdered by his secret wife and fake sister Dilly Harcourt, amid their plan against Sienna Blake. Next week, Cindy Cunningham is still struggling to cope with her pal Mandy's daughter Ella's tragic death.
Cindy has been caring for Ella in her mother's absence, after Mandy moved away. As her loved ones try to support her, Cindy is desperate for answers about what happened to Ella.
She ends up pushing partner Dave further and further away, leaving him feeling down. He's soon tempted and begins taking drugs again, months on from his drug issues becoming apparent. He contacts his dealer, and ends up dragging Peri Lomax down with him. Later on, as Dave and Cindy's loved ones gather to support her at The Dog, Dave suddenly collapses leaving them all in a panic.
Peri is forced to come clean about Dave taking drugs as she explains his sudden collapse. Dave then suffers an episode and requires morphine urgently, but Peri struggles to draw it up. She's watched by nurse Misbah who realises what is going on and stops her, as she suspects Peri is experiencing adrenaline. But will Dave be okay, and what will happen to Peri?

A sign says it must be kept on at all times. It provides company for Alfie, an African grey, and neighbour Merlin, a 16-year-old orange-winged beauty from the Amazon. Their favourite station is Radio Two.
Alfie has spent 10 months at the RSPCA shelter after she was rescued from a house full of other parrots amid concern over their welfare. Merlin was taken to a vet to be put down after his owner fell ill and could no longer care for him. They are among the 600 dogs, cats, rabbits, rodents, birds and reptiles cared for each year at the centre.
Branch manager Jenny Eden said pet abandonment is at a record high, explaining: “The combined effects of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis have created a perfect storm.”
Nationally, the RSPCA is bracing for “an unprecedented winter crisis”. As well as rescuing, rehoming and rehabilitating the animals, this branch in Patcham, East Sussex, runs a subsidised neutering scheme, and has the only dedicated RSPCA reptile rescue house in the country.
Nibbles and Dinky, three-year-old sister lop-eared rabbits, have been at the shelter for more than a year. Among the 35 cats currently at the shelter are Poppy, aged one or two, and four-month-old kitten Ace, who were rescued from a house that had more than 80 other cats.
Tuxedo cat Monty, 10, is looking for a home after his owner passed away, while stray Travolta arrived at the shelter needing treatment after he had been bitten by another cat. The two-year-old had been on the streets for some time. Jenny said: “He was very nervous and very distrusting of people. Bit by bit he has slowly come round. He is definitely ready for a new home.”
Seven-year-old Shih Tzu/Jack Russell crossbreeds Tommy and Polly were found in a filthy shed covered in excrement. But after a month at the shelter, the brother and sister have been found a home, where they will move this month.
Frank, a 10-year-old British bulldog, arrived last month via an RSPCA inspector after a change in circumstances for his owner. He hasn’t walked much recently and Jenny said: “He need to build up his exercise levels slowly.”
These stories are just a snapshot of the thousands of the animals’ lives hanging in the balance. The charity was called out to more than 18,000 cases of animal abandonment in England and Wales in 2023. The figure rises each year in recent times. The RSPCA said: “That’s why we need people to help with our winter appeal – and support our dedicated frontline teams to continue to help more animals in need.”"

After going out for food and drinks at The Shard on December 8, 2015, they took Shepherd's speedboat out onto the River Thames, with a trip past the Houses of Parliament. According to Shepherd, he let Charlotte take over the steering before the boat crashed and capsized - claims her parents have long disputed.
Neither were wearing life jackets. The 24-year-old was pulled out of the water unconscious and a post-mortem found she had died from cold water immersion. Her body temperature was just 25C. Shepherd was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and walked free today after serving just half of his six-year prison sentence. Here, we take a look at what happened on that fateful date...
Charlotte, from Essex, was described as ""the biggest personality in the room"" by her friend. At the time of her killing, the business consultant was about to start a new job, with a bright future ahead of her.
She started talking to the then-28 website designer Shepherd, from Devon, online via a dating app, and he asked her out for some drinks. Nicknamed 'Champagne Casanova', he later admitted to drinking heavily that night during their champagne-fulled rendezvous and confessed to being an 'alcoholic'.
The pair boarded his defect-laden 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte GTO - which he had bought from Gumtree to 'pull women' - at Hammersmith Bridge, and he set off driving at speeds of 26 to 34 knots, more than twice the speed limit. They made it up to Westminster Bridge before turning around. The boat crashed into a floating piece of wood around Wandsworth Bridge, flipping the vehicle. Shepherd, who maintained his innocence, was found clinging to the boat's hull.
In harrowing footage recovered from Charlotte's phone after the crash, she could be heard shouting, ""Oh my god, you're going so fast!""
He agreed that he bears ""some of the moral responsibility"" for the 24-year-old's death, but rejected the charge that he is to blame. As he insisted he was not solely responsible for the Thames tragedy, he ""absolutely, unreservedly"" apologised for the role he played.
Speaking to the Mirror last Christmas, Charlotte's father, Graham Brown, demanded her daughter's killer to stay in jail until he reveals the truth about his victim's final moments. He said: ""The only one who knows what really happened is Shepherd. We want to know what happened. But evil men like this who do these sorts of things never admit or tell anyone.
""He will never admit it, I know he won't. He will say it's not his fault. In my mind he murdered my daughter and should be doing a proper life sentence. He shouldn't be released until he tells us what he did.""
Mr Brown, who describes Charlotte as 'Mrs Sensible' says there is no way she would have driven the boat at high-speed. ""I believe she thought it was going to be a toddle up the Thames. I'm sure she had no idea he was going to put his foot down,"" he added.
During Shepherd's trial in July 2018, the jury heard how he had purchased the second-hand 1980s boat in a bid to impress women. Mr Brown said it was his 'dangerous party trick' and an accident waiting to happen. The father continued: ""Sometimes people say to me, ‘It was just an accident’.
""Let’s be clear, Jack Shepherd’s routine, his modus operandi, was to go on a dating site, take them to the Shard and then on his speedboat. He did this with multiple women, he’d just move on to the next woman. The speedboat that he bought on Gumtree would never have passed a speedboat MOT, if they existed.
""What Jack Shepherd did was the equivalent of taking a car which was 30 years old, would never have passed an MOT, and then driving it at speed on the wrong side of the motorway. That’s how dangerous his party trick was. The speedboat was unsuitable for the River Thames and he broke the speed limits. It was an accident waiting to happen.""
Following the crash, Shepherd fled to Georgia in March 2018 and was convicted in his absence in July. He eventually turned himself in to the Georgian authorities, telling the court: ""I know it's caused them even more suffering and that's why I handed myself in to draw to a close this horrible accident and the terrible consequences.""
Shepherd was sentenced to six years, plus another four to run consecutively after he admitted ""unlawfully and maliciously"" smashing ex-soldier and barman David Beech in the face with a glass bottle. Shepherd served his sentence atHMP Woodhill, near Milton Keynes.
A Ministry of Justice source told The Sun: ""He has kept his head down and quietly done his time. He knows that a determinate sentence means his case doesn’t have to go to the Parole Board for its approval.
""If he behaves then there is no reason to keep him in jail beyond his halfway point. He will be free to simply walk out the door."""
5750WGV2KD_AB02QER3483IQF1,Vladimir Putin set to simulate nuclear explosions with new 'secret technology',Will StewartRussia Correspondent,"23:33, 24 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-set-simulate-nuclear-31961597,"Vladimir Putin is set to utilise his new technology to simulate nuclear war, according to reports.
The Russian President has developed a new method to mimic an incoming atomic bomb, and will consequently stage several military drills. The latest news comes amid his nation threatening to take the violence in Ukraine up a level by engaging in nuclear war.
Experts have declared that Khrulev Military Academy in St Petersburg is responsible for creating the technology which can simulate the mushroom cloud impact that nuclear explosions are renowned for. According to state news agency, ITAR_TASS, the patent document claims: “The purpose of the model is to simulate what a nuclear strike looks like - the shock effect, flash of light and the mushroom cloud of a ground-based nuclear explosion.”
‌The Moscow Times reported that the invention will be utilised to: ""Train radiation, chemical and biological intelligence units to determine the parameters of the epicentre of a nuclear explosion.""
Fearing the potential consequences of nuclear war, the International Institue for Strategic Studies warns of Russia's potential readiness to deploy non-strategic or tactical - nuclear weapons. Their report claimed: ""A particularly troubling trend from a Western perspective is Russia’s belief in its ability to achieve and maintain dominance in an escalating environment, and to compensate for losses of personnel and equipment to a degree unimaginable to the West.
“In its war on Ukraine, Russia has used direct nuclear signalling to the US and NATO with its strategic and theatre nuclear forces. More recently, it has shown with Belarus that it sees NSNW [non-strategic nuclear weapons] as a useful tool to exert further control over its near-abroad and increase its coercive power against NATO.”
The report added: ""The more that can be understood of Russian doctrine and military thought related to NSNW, the more likely it is that deterrence with Russia can be maintained. Understanding Russia and maintaining deterrence vis-à-vis Russia is a matter of survival for the West.”
Revoking Russia's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Putin is allegedly planning to restart atomic bomb testing in the Arctic, supposedly ordering defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to imminently prepare to resume proceedings.
The notorious President is currently mocking the West with a major exhibition in Moscow. Putin is showcasing the most powerful bomb in human history - the infamous 50-megaton AN602 'Tsar Bomba'. The massive statement is proof of the 71-year-old's defiance of the West, indicating that he will not let their concerns prevent him from restarting nuclear tests.
Supporting his longtime associate, the head of Kurchatov Nuclear Institute, Mikhail Kovalchuk, said: ""I think this is a correct idea."""
5DPOE476UV_STPVUEQFQXGG3CM,Couple forced to stop swinging as trolls say they're 'fat' and 'look like mum and son',Joseph GampAssistant News Editor,"15:12, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/couple-forced-stop-swinging-trolls-31948451,"Two former swingers were forced to give up their hobby after they were sent death threats by cruel trolls - who said they ""look like mother and son"".
Elvis Sharps, 43, and his partner Tracy Doncaster, 55, from Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, used to be swingers. However, they've now given up their spicy hobby after they were abused by online trolls, who also barraged them with online threats. The couple started swinging 12 years ago - but now they are advising others to avoid the sexual activity.
They claim they were subjected to a flood of nasty comments, including being called ""fat"" - and were even told they ""look like mother and son"". Now, they're calling for the closure of websites and clubs that promote the sexual activity. Elvis shared with the Southern Daily Echo that he and his partner began swinging to bring ""more excitement"" to their relationship and to ""make friends"".
Mr Sharps explained: ""We got a lot of abuse from the first time we did it, with people calling us fat, saying we look like mother and son. People were judging us by our looks. We met one couple about three times, but they turned against us for no reason. We stopped swinging in January 2023 because things got so bad.""
Tracy has since warned the swinging scene is ""not as pretty"" as one might think. She regrets getting involved and advises others to stay away, especially if they are ""plus size"". The couple are now calling for swinging websites to be shut down, saying that these sites don't check who's signing up and that means anyone can join. Elvis also warned of ""strange people"" who use them.
The pair say there are not enough security checks, meaning people of any age can join. Speaking of the dangers, Elvis continued: “We want to warn people of the dangers of swinging and dogging – the drama, the drugs, it all happens. There’s a whole other side to swinging and dogging; we have been abused and singled out.""
Elvis and Tracy now say they're over the moon now they've stopped swinging - and are even getting ready to tie the knot. Elvis said: ""We are stronger in our relationship and we are planning on getting married.”

5FQV1TSTTV_3PDQ9G29Z6ELGSV,Farmers stage protest calling for protection from unfair treatment by supermarkets,Lawrence Matheson,"15:13, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/farmers-stage-protest-calling-protection-31940101,"Farmers are urging MPs to back stronger rules to shield them from ""unfair"" treatment by the major supermarkets.
A demonstration involving dozens of 'scarecrows' outside Parliament is planned for Monday, as MPs prepare to discuss changes to the grocery supply chain following a petition signed by over 110,000 people. The petition, started by veg box company Riverford Organic, calls for regulations ensuring supermarkets stick to ""fair"" buying agreements.
This includes purchasing agreed amounts and paying the agreed sum on time ""without exception"". The firm says the scarecrows symbolise fruit and veg farmers who fear they may go out of business within a year, largely blaming supermarket buying practices.
Riverford argues that current government policies don't offer enough support for farmers and are seldom enforced. The campaign has won the backing of celebs and top food industry figures like Ray Mears, Julia Bradbury, Chris Packham, Jimmy Doherty, Rick Stein and Deborah Meaden, as well as groups like Sustain and The Soil Association.
Guy Singh-Watson, the founder of Riverford Organic, said: ""British agriculture is on its knees. The livelihoods of our farmers are being laid to waste. Our 49 scarecrows outside Parliament illustrate the 49% of farmers on the brink of leaving our industry, and I hope this hammers home to those in power the sheer scale of the problem and the urgent need for change.
""Without fairer treatment for farmers, the reality is the destruction of British farming along with the landscape, wildlife and rural communities it once supported. For farmers, the clock is ticking. We urge the Government to take action now to safeguard the future of British agriculture.""
William White, sustainable farming campaign co-ordinator at Sustain, insisted: ""Riverford's scarecrow protest sends a stark message: only strong regulation from the Government can ensure farmers get a fair deal for the food they produce."" He suggested two thirds of growers have little confidence in their future, given the soaring production costs.
The cost of production had increased by 18p per 400g pack since 2021, and while retail shelf prices had risen by 27p pack over this period an increase of 14.8% average grower returns were up by just 2.3% or 3.6p."" Nick Marston, the chairman of industry body British Berry Growers, said a survey suggested two thirds of growers had little confidence in their future.
He said: ""Growers are struggling with static returns and ever-increasing costs, especially labour costs. This is creating a crisis for British producers who cannot now grow fresh berries on a financially sustainable basis.
""Currently there is no requirement for fair dealing on pricing in the grocery supply code of practice. Supermarkets can put up their prices to shoppers at a push of a button; growers cannot. Growers would like this addressed.""
""We need stronger, clearer legislation which will get retailers to commit to being long term partners, paying growers a fair price and buying British when in season. We also need to impose rules to prevent legislation avoidance by retailers by inserting service providers into the chain and for Government to take a strong line on protocol breaches.""
Andrew Opie, Director of Food and Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.
""However, retailers are also facing additional costs and are working incredibly hard to limit price increases for consumers during a cost-of-living crisis where many people are struggling to afford the essentials."" A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stated: ""Our fruit and vegetable farmers are crucial to the resilience of our food system to the wider economy, with 60% of all the food we need being produced in the UK.
""It is only right that British farmers and growers should be paid a fair price, and our review into the fairness of the supply chain will help address these concerns. That is alongside delivering on our wider commitments from the Farm to Fork Summit to provide greater stability and resilience for the fresh produce sector.""

The help is being provided through the Government's Household Support Fund. This scheme gives each local council a pot of cash which it can spend on supporting struggling households in their area. Bath and North East Somerset Council have launched its new Winter Energy Support Fund which is giving households free one off cash payments worth up to £250 to help with their energy bills.
Households that are on a low income can receive a payment of £150, whilst households that receive Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Personal Independence Payments (PIP), or Attendance Allowance can also qualify for an extra £100 giving them £250.
To qualify, residents must be aged over 18 with a permanent address in Bath and North East Somerset and savings of no more than £6,000. They also need to be in receipt of a qualifying benefit or be on a low combined income of less than £500 per week.
The qualifying benefits include:
Anyone in the household who receives Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payments, or Attendance Allowance will qualify for an extra £100 in addition to the £150 standard payment.
According to the council's website, applications from residents who are classed as being in ""financial crisis"" due to circumstances beyond their control. Only one payment will be made per household unless ""exceptional circumstances"" apply.
You can make an application for the cash through the council's website here and you will need to provide evidence of your savings and capital as well as personal information for you and your household. If you are unable to access the web form and want a paper copy, or you would have difficulty in completing either form and want help from a member of staff to complete your application you can call the council on: 01225 47 72 77.
Once the application has been made, the council aims to make a decision within 14 working days although it could take longer due to the number of applications. Applications for the scheme will remain open until the funding has been spent.
Cllr Mark Elliott, cabinet member for resources, commented: “We know that many households continue to struggle to pay energy bills and want to make sure that families are supported through these harsh winter months. I don’t want to see any residents go cold this winter. If you think you qualify for this vital help, please apply to us as soon as possible.”"

Ex-anaesthetic theatre practitioner Mathew Pickering, 49, has denied killing his girlfriend Georgina Dowey at his home in Cadoxton, Neath on May 7, 2023. Ms Dowey's body was found with a black bag over her head and prosecutors say she suffered ""vicious and intentional violence"" at the hands of Pickering.
When asked about what he did after her death, Pickering said he went to the shop to buy bleach, but that it was to mop up cat urine from the kitchen. He was also grilled about why he put black bins out in the street that night despite the rubbish not being collected for a number of days. He said it was ""just an automatic thing"" and ""autopilot"".
The court heard Pickering went on to take the clothes he had been wearing during the assault to his parents' house to be washed, before putting them back on - while his family remained unaware of Miss Dowey's death. On his way to his parents' home, CCTV images showed the defendant putting items from his pocket and from his rucksack into bins - asked what he was doing, he said they were Rich Tea biscuits and crackers which he had been ""munching on"" during the walk to Neath.
When asked why he didn't tell his parents about Miss Dowey's death, Pickering denied it was because he had not got his ""story straight"" but said: ""I didn't want them knowing about it at that point. I was planning to report it after visiting them. I just wanted to spend some time... I knew I would not be seeing them for some time.""
Describing the events leading up to Miss Dowey's death, the defendant previously told the jury on Wednesday how ""for 10 or 15 seconds"" it was his intention to kill her after she swang at Pickering with an ashtray before coming at him with a small fruit knife, reports Wales Online.
During cross-examination, the defendant told the court when he saw Miss Dowey heading for the rear utility room and toilet he thought she was going to pick up an empty bottle. He says she then picked up a small piece of wood and began swinging it at him with her left hand.
Pickering said he grabbed the empty left arm of Miss Dowey's dressing gown - which was draped over the left shoulder ""like a scarf"" - and pulled it with both hands as hard as he could. He says in the ensuring ""scuffle"" his body rotated around Miss Dowey and he ended up behind her still holding onto the free sleeve but now with his hands either side of her neck.
Asked whether he was pulling on the sleeve around Miss Dowey's neck as hard as he could, Pickering said yes, and that it was ""about 10 seconds plus"" before she went limp.
Michael Jones KC, prosecuting, said: ""So we understand this, for 10 or 15 seconds or however long it was, you intended to kill her. Is that your evidence to the jury?"", to which the defendant replied ""yes"".
In response to questions, the defendant confirmed he then pushed Miss Dowey - with both hands to her back - into the toilet room beyond the utility room. Asked whether at that point it was anger that was driving him, Pickering replied: ""I'm not sure. I don't know. I snapped.""
Prosecutor Mr Jones, opening the case, told the jury it was the prosecution's case that Pickering’s assault on his partner was a determined one, and one intended to cause really serious injury. He said Pickering caused multiple injuries and ultimately strangled his partner.
The barrister said it was not just the ferocity of the assault that indicated the defendant’s intent to kill or cause really serious harm but his behaviour afterwards. Mr Jones said: “He said absolutely nothing to summon help or inform anyone what he had done. Instead he left her body where it lay and went about his business.” The barrister said Pickering then went out and bought bleach and cat treats from a shop.
Jurors heard Miss Dowey had previously described Pickering as ""controlling"" and claimed he was emotionally abusive. Mr Jones had earlier told the jury Pickering was a user of alcohol and illicit and prescription drugs.
Giving evidence, Pickering denied disclosures made by Miss Dowey to domestic abuse workers about the defendant being ""heavy handed"" with her, and disagreed with previous disclosures where Miss Dowey described him as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character.
The case, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.
Pickering, of Beaconsfield Street, Cadoxton, Neath, denies the charge and is on trial at Swansea Crown Court. He admits an alternative count of manslaughter."
5H2CLT20Q5_P5HTMS04IGLRVWI,Rapists and burglars are let off the hook as suspects prosecuted in less than 6% of crimes,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"15:55, 25 Jan 2024Updated18:08, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/suspects-prosecuted-less-6-crimes-31966314,"Just one in 16 crimes resulted in a suspect being charged or summoned last year, damning new data shows.
Ministers have been accused of ""failing"" victims after the Home Office revealed just 5.9% of cases reported to police in England and Wales led to a prosecution. And the picture was even worse for rape cases, with just one in 40 victims seeing their alleged attacker summonsed or charged.
Figures published today revealed that 3.9% of sexual offences, including 2.4% of rapes, 4% of home burglaries, 5.3% of violent incidents and 6.3% of robberies resulted in a charge or summons. In the year to September 2.18million cases were shut without a suspect being identified.
Violence against the person - 5.3%
Sexual offences - 3.9%
Of which: Rape - 2.4%
Robbery - 6.3%
Theft offences - 4.9%
Of which: Residential burglary - 4.0%
Criminal damage and arson - 4.1%
Drug offences - 19.5%
Possession of weapons offences - 27.2%
Public order offences - 6.2%
Miscellaneous crimes against society - 9.9%
Total across all crimes - 5.9%
It has sparked calls for the Government to ""get a grip"", with new figures showing sex offences have gone up by 17% since 2020, knife crime up by 5% in a year and robberies rising by 12%.
Rachel Almeida, assistant director at charity Victim Support told The Mirror: “These figures show that the justice process is not working as well as it should. Too many victims of crime are not getting the justice they deserve and this must change.""
And she continued that police and the wider justice system must be given the resources they need to turn the figures around. Ms Almeida added: ""Without improvements, we risk victims and the public losing faith in the criminal justice process.”
Labour Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the number of cases dropped has reached record highs and added: ""Enough is enough. Britain cannot afford more of this damaging decline from the Conservatives.""
And Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservative Government has totally failed to get a handle on crime, and they have no one but themselves to blame. For years, they have taken resources out of frontline policing at the expense of our communities. It’s no surprise that more and more criminals are getting away with it as victims are left without justice. This farce needs to end.""
He accused the Tories of overseeing a decline in neighbourhood policing. On average 5,981 investigations were shut without identifying a suspect every day, analysis showed.
Charge and summons rates were higher for possession of weapons, with 27.2%, and drug offences, with 19.5%.
It comes as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed a total of 8.5million alleged crimes were reported to police in England and Wales in the year to September.
These included almost 200,000 sex offences, including nearly 68,000 rapes - up a massive 17% since 2020. There was also a 32% rise in shoplifting reports, fuelling a spike in overall theft cases overall. Robbery cases went up by 12%, the ONS data shows.
Knife crime also rose in England and Wales, with almost 50,000 cases recorded in a year. It comes as ministers face intense pressure to deal with the knife crime epidemic, which claimed 247 lives last year. Latest data shows there were 48,716 knife offences reported to 41 of the 43 police forces in the 12 months to September - up 5% compared to the previous year. These included over 22,000 assaults using knives that resulted in injury.
Chilling data also shows a rise in gun crime, with 6,233 offences recorded in the same timeframe. Overall there were 591 homicides recorded in 12 months, down from 651 the previous year.
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: “In general terms, charging decisions are for the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service). It’s not right for me to comment specifically.
""On rape cases we do know that enough has not been done and that is why we set out a very detailed Rape Action Plan which is having an impact. Of course there is much more to do and the Home Office and the Police are very committed to that work.”
A Home Office spokesman said: “Since 2010, we have more police and our communities are safer. Neighbourhood crimes including burglary, robbery and theft down 48% and violent crime down 51%. We expect police to take all crime seriously and investigate thoroughly to ensure perpetrators are charged and brought to justice, which is why we welcomed the commitment made by police in August to follow up on all reasonable lines of enquiry."""

It carries 12,500 signatures and demands a £40billion increase to match the European average. A decade-long Tory squeeze has left a backlog of 7.6 million appointments and record waits. Among those handing in the petition to Downing Street was widowed Samina Rahman and her grandsons Rayyan, Layth and Noah.
Samina's husband Iqbal, 58, had to wait an hour and 20 minutes for an ambulance when he began showing heart attack symptoms during a Christmas trip to Hereford in 2022. All ambulances were waiting at A&E wards and by the time one finally came, Iqbal had died.
Speech therapist Samina, from Birmingham, said: “It’s incredibly painful to talk about but we’re determined that people know the real-life impacts of starving our NHS of resources. I always thought that if I called an ambulance when I really needed one it would come. My trust was broken that night.”
Also handing over the petition was Mathew Hulbert, whose mum Jackie, 78, died of sepsis in hospital in Nun­eaton, Warks, after being left on her bedroom floor for 11 hours.
He said: “The NHS failed my mum when she needed it most. I will never forget the pain and indignity she endured in those 11 hours. I’m not angry at overworked NHS staff. The system has been broken by 13 years of under-investment.”
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “The Government is backing the NHS and social care with a record £14.1 billion this year and next to cut waiting lists and improve care – the biggest funding increase in history.“To increase capacity in the NHS and help patients get the care they need as quickly as possible, we also provided £800 million of additional funding this winter.”"

A nurse from Zimbabwe, she has to FaceTime her daughters back home to see them, with the calls very often ending in tears. Why? Because Yvonne is among the many immigrants propping up our health service yet denied the humanity of their children being allowed to join them.
It is yet another of the scandals in plain sight under our current administration.
It was in March 2023 that she left her girls and headed to London. Two months later, she applied to the Home Office for the children’s visas. The application was denied with the Home Office contending that the girls could live with other relatives, and that Yvonne hadn’t provided “compelling reasons” for them to join her.
Bureaucracy trumps humanity yet again.
Many critics’ first response will be to attack those affected rather than the decades-old rule that a child can only receive a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has sole responsibility.
Even though the rules allow healthcare workers to bring family members, there are still single mothers – many tempted over to work in the NHS and care sector – having their applications denied.
As has been pointed out in this column before, despite all the scaremongering, the statistics show most of the people arriving in the UK work, pay their taxes and contribute to the economy. Check the figures.
They work on the transport system and in the NHS – just as they did in the 1960s,  ’70s and ’80s.
And it is important to reintroduce that truism to the conversation because No 10 would have you believe – to use language from the late Margaret Thatcher – that we are being “swamped”. We aren’t.
Suella Braverman, Robert Jenrick, Rishi Sunak, unflushables like Nigel Farage, and even the Labour front bench have burned the phrase ‘stop the boats’ so deeply into  the media discourse that presenters inadvertently help the haters by using it routinely.
In addition, those whose lives are too busy to read the details end up conflating those in the boats with those propping up our health service who have actually made applications.
Yvonne’s youngest is four by the way. We forget that at the centre of these stories are real people. Human beings.
Like so many, she came here in search of a better life for her family. She’d been assured by her employer that it wouldn’t be a problem for her daughters to follow her over. It was. And has been ever since.
Often we hope against hope that this is not what this country has become. Sadly, it is."

He was seen in the back of a car on Thursday as it was driven down the Mall. The King has returned to the capital for the medical procedure after spending time at Sandringham in Norfolk.
His appearance follows the recent announcement that he would be seeking corrective treatment for an enlarged prostate.
A statement from Buckingham Palace last week read: ""In common with thousands of men each year, the King has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate. His Majesty’s condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure. The King's public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.""
Palace aides also confirmed that the issue with his prostate is non-cancerous. It is understood Charles was keen to share the details of his diagnosis with the public to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked, in line with public health advice.
He already appears to have increased awareness of the condition, according to data from NHS England officials. There was 16,410 registered visits to the NHS website page for prostate health last Wednesday, an average of one visit every five seconds, compared to just 1,414 hits the day before the announcement.
The King's daughter-in-law Kate, Princess of Wales is meanwhile recovering from a abdominal operation at the London Clinic, where she has remained following the procedure last week. The 42-year-old princess is expected to stay there for between 10 and 14 days in total.
Kensington Palace has not revealed further details of the princess's condition but confirmed it was non-cancerous and that she would probably not resume royal duties until after Easter. Prince William is also expected to take time away from royal duties to look after Kate and their children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, eight, and Prince Louis, five."

Chris and Brittany Tyler were at their home in Louisville, Kentucky, when they read about the newborn boy who had been surrendered under the state's Safe Infants Act. The Act provides designated safe spaces for parents to leave babies up to the age of 30 days old with no penalties.
That was two years ago, and last month, the couple adopted the baby they had read about, a boy who they called Samuel. Speaking to Good Morning America, Chris said: ""He's been part of our family from day one.""
READ MORE: Homeless man rescues puppies and leaves them at shelter with touching note
Samuel, who is almost two now, apparently loves hugs and Mickey Mouse, according to his parents. Chris explained he and his wife became foster parents almost seven years ago after they had struggled for years with infertility.
The couple already have two other adopted sons, aged five and seven. But, they said when they first read the news story about the tiny baby left at the fire station they ""prayed and hoped"" they would be asked to take in the baby.
Lieutenant Colonel Bobby Cooper, assistant chief for the Louisville Fire Department, explained firefighters at a Louisville station were in the middle of a shift change around 8am on May 12, 2022, when the doorbell rang. They opened the door to find a newborn baby tucked up in a box along with a note from his biological mother.
""The [firefighters] notified emergency transportation, EMS, to be able to transport Samuel to a local children's hospital, to get him checked out and make sure that he was healthy and that he got the proper care he needed,"" Lieutenant Colonal Cooper told Good Morning America. He added: ""Our firefighters did a tremendous job of handling it and notifying the appropriate authorities.""
Just days later, the Tylers prayers were answered when they received a call while out on a walk with their older sons asking them to foster the baby. The next day, the couple was holding Samuel in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a local hospital.
""He was in the NICU for a couple of weeks because he was ready to come home [because] he was so small,"" said Brittany. She added that Samuel weighed just three pounds when he arrived a the hospital, but that the couple were ""able to visit him in the NICU that entire time.""
When Brittany and Chris brought Samuel home on June 2, 2022, they said the tot ""fit right in"" with the family. Brittany recalled: ""The other kids absolutely loved him. We had another foster baby at the time who was only a few months older, and they became buddies right away.""
As Samuel was surrendered under the Safe Infants Act, the couple knew early on that, barring any unforeseen circumstances, Samuel would be able to be adopted, instead of being a more common, shorter-term foster placement. Now, after almost two years of making their way through the adoption process, Samuel was officially adopted by the Tylers on December 18, 2023.
In a family tradition, following the adoption ceremony the couple said they took baby Samuel to Build-A-Bear, where he made a firefighter bear. They said it's just one way that they have worked to keep Samuel's birth story at the forefront.
Since his birth, the family has visited the fire station here Samuel was left and celebrated milestones there, including his first birthday. Chris said: ""We've got a great photo of the firemen that were on duty that day holding him, and we're talking about these huge guys.. and just massive smiles. [They] know that there's a special connection between Samuel and that fire station, and with them particularly.""
And it's not just Chris and Brittany, the firefighters have also made sure Samuel has a connection to his story. They even gave his adoptive parents the note left for their son when he was surrendered, who said they are saving it to show him as he gets older.
Lieutenant Colonel Cooper said the Louisville Fire Department is ""incredibly proud"" of the role they played in Samuel's story. Adding: ""We've been lucky that his parents and his family allowed us to continue to be a part of his story, bringing him by the firehouse for his birthday and letting him know that the local fire department is a part of his life story. And we hope that they continue to do so.""
The fire chief said he hopes baby Samuel and the Tylers' story will help to raise awareness of safe haven laws, a version of which exists in all 50 states, allowing for the safe surrender of newborns in a protected environment. He said: ""It's an imperfect world, and we don't have perfect solutions for every situation, but this is another option for a mum. If a mum finds herself in a crisis situation and needs a haven for an infant, this is another resource that's available.""
The Tylers also said they hope that by sharing their story it can raise awareness for not only safe haven options but the need for fostering and adoption. Chris said as Samuel gets older, he and his wife plan to tell their son the incredible story of everyone involved in his becoming part of their family.
""We really want to let him know that somebody loved him even though they weren't going to be with him for his whole life,"" said Chris. ""That [his biological mum] loved him and wanted the best for him, and she trusted that he would go to a good place, and we're thankful to God that he came to us.""

The ITV skating show returned earlier this month with Holly Willoughby back at the helm alongside her new co-host Stephen Mulhern. It's now been announced that the third week will not feature a skate off, unlike the usual format.
Instead, a combination of the judges' score and the public vote will determine who goes home this Sunday. The lowest performing couple will leave, rather than the bottom two pairs having a skate off before a final vote by the judges.
A spokesperson told the Daily Mail : ""This weekend we don't have a skate off at the end of the show. Whoever is at the bottom after the judges' scores and viewers votes will leave the competition."" ITV confirmed to the Mirror that this is the case ahead of the upcoming third episode on Sunday.
It's not the first time that there's been no skate-off, as the combination of judges' scores and public votes determined who left the competition in the third week last year too. Typically, a skate off has been held in that week.
Last week saw former boxer Ricky Hatton and his skating partner Robin Johnstone leave the show. They had been in the skate off against comedian Lou Sanders and her partner Brendyn Hatfield, who were saved by the judges.
Ricky and Robin had originally performed a routine to Bill Conti's Gonna Fly Now in the first week. Lou and Brendyn took to the ice for their debut in the second week, with the pair having skated to Madonna 's song Hung Up.
The two couples were the lowest on the leaderboard for their respective weeks, ahead of being in the skate off together. The highest score among the debut routines came during the second week when two couples got 27.5 each.
Radio host Adele Roberts and her skating partner Mark Hanretty received that score from the judges following their routine to Grace VanderWaal's Clearly. It was matched by former ski jumper Eddie the Eagle and his partner Vicky Ogden, who performed to Bon Jovi 's Livin' on a Prayer.
Dancing on Ice continues on Sunday from 6.20pm on ITV and ITVX. You can catch up on previous episodes of the show's new series through streaming platform ITVX now.

Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers union ASLEF, said it had a “rolling mandate” from members to stage walkouts in a row over pay and working conditions that has already dragged on for 18 months. It comes ahead of strikes starting next Monday, impacting train services across England. A combination of stoppages and an overtime ban will continue until February 6. Passengers are being urged to check before they travel.
Whelan blamed the impasse on government “dogma”, claiming the Tories were preventing train companies from reaching a deal. “The employers, driven by the government, are being unrealistic,” he said.
“The fact we haven’t seen the transport minister for well over a year, and the employers since last April, shows there is no willingness from the other side to negotiate.”
The Government has introduced strike-busting “minimum service requirements” to try to tackle industrial unrest. But faced with more train strikes, not one rail company is making use of the law.
One company that said it would, LNER, subsequently backed down in the face of pressure from ASLEF.
Asked on BBC Radio 4 if the new law was unworkable, Whelan said: “We would hope so, but it doesn’t mean it has gone away.”"

Bryn Mawr College chemistry professor Michelle Francl has controversially claimed that one of the keys to a perfect cup of tea is a pinch of salt. The tip is included in Francl's book ""Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea"", which was published on Wednesday by the Royal Society of Chemistry.
The salt suggestion drew howls of outrage from tea lovers in Britain, prompting some to share the ""proper recipe"" for a brew. ""Don't even say the word 'salt' to us..."" the etiquette guide Debrett's wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
READ MORE: British tea experts hit back at wild American claims - with proper recipe
Even the US Embassy in London intervened in the brewing storm with a social media post reassuring ""the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy."" Its ironic post added: ""Let us unite in our steeped solidarity and show the world that when it comes to tea, we stand as one. The US Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way - by microwaving it.""
The embassy later clarified that its statement was ""a lighthearted play on our shared cultural connections"" rather than an official press release. But as a book, ""Steeped"" is no joke, as its publisher explained it explores the more than 100 chemical compounds found in tea and ""puts the chemistry to use with advice on how to brew a better cup"".
Francl said adding a small amount of salt - not enough to taste - makes tea seem less bitter because ""the sodium ions in salt block the bitter receptors in our mouths."" She also advocates making tea in a pre-warmed pot, agitating the bag briefly but vigorously, and serving in a short, stout mug to preserve the heat. And she says milk should be added to the cup after the tea, not before – another issue that often divides tea lovers.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
Francl has been surprised by the level of reaction to her book in Britain. ""I kind of understood that there would hopefully be a lot of interest, she said. ""I didn't know we'd wade into a diplomatic conversation with the US Embassy.""
It has made her ponder the ocean-wide coffee-tea divide that separates the us and Britain. ""I wonder if we're just a more caffeinated society - coffee is higher in caffeine,"" she said. ""Or maybe we're just trying to rebel against our parent country.""
But despite the harsh criticism, Michelle hasn't backed down on her research-based suggestion. The professor said she has always been a tea drinker, even though she hails from the Midwest, which is a ""deep coffee-drinking country,"" according to her. Her interest in the topic stemmed from her frustration with trying to find a good cup of tea in the US, outright calling the experience ""horrific.""
She cited her extensive background in chemistry as evidence her theory is credible. ""After all these years of drinking tea and researching chemistry, I learned new things about what is in my cup and how to make the very best cup of tea,"" she asserted. Brits still swatted her suggestions, personal anecdotes, scientific merits and research, essentially writing the entire idea off as a joke.
And tea experts Whittard's of Chelsea also chimed in by sharing how to properly make a British brew. The pros at Whittard's of Chelsea stated: ""While we encourage you to explore ways of enjoying your tea, no one brews quite like the British"".

Angela Pryce, Senior Tea Buyer, insisted that adding salt and said it ""shouldn't be necessary"". She revealed: ""While Tibetan butter tea has been drunk with 1/2 teaspoon salt in it for centuries, adding salt to reduce the bitterness of your regular cup shouldn't be necessary. If brewing methods are correct, then the tea will never taste bitter.""
She then added: ""It's key to always use water freshly drawn from the tap or a filter jug: the higher levels of oxygen in freshwater give your cup of tea a cleaner, brighter taste. Ensure you're brewing with water that's the correct temperature for your blend and for the correct time.""
After spending 135 years honing their technique, Whittards of Chelsea share their step-by-step below."

Consultant members of the British Medical Association voted narrowly by 51% to reject the deal of 4.95% extra for 2022/23 on top of a 6% pay rise they received in April. The extra percentage of pay offered varied from zero to nearly 13% depending on their employment grade.
The union had put further strikes on ice while members discussed the terms of the offer, raising hopes the row was close to being resolved. But today, the BMA rejected it fearing it did not form the basis of a multi-year plan to reduce a decade of real-terms cuts to their pay.
Consultants have not announced fresh strike dates due to the narrowness of the result, which will encourage the Government that a deal can be reached. But Mr Sunak had appeared confident that they would accept the deal - boasting that all other NHS staff had accepted their pay deals when discussing the ongoing strikes with junior doctors.
More than 1.3 million appointments, procedures and operations have been rescheduled due to industrial action across the NHS in England, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and physiotherapists.
It comes after consultants took part in nine days of strikes in October, before the Department of Health announced in November that the two sides “have reached an agreement to put an offer to union members following constructive negotiations”.
Dr Vishal Sharma, BMA consultants committee chair, said: “The vote has shown that consultants do not feel the current offer goes far enough to end the current dispute and offer a long-term solution to the recruitment and retention crisis for senior doctors.""
He added: “However, with the result so close, the consultants committee is giving the Government a chance to improve the offer. In the coming days we will be further engaging with consultants, and seeking talks with Government to explore whether the concerns expressed by our members during the referendum process can be addressed.”
Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: “Last week, Rishi Sunak was bragging that NHS doctors had accepted his pay offer. This vote shows he was trying to pull the wool over the public’s eyes. The NHS is in the second year of strikes. They have cost patients more than one million cancelled operations and appointments, and cost taxpayers £2 billion.
“It is long past time Rishi Sunak took personal responsibility and took charge of negotiations himself. The Prime Minister cannot continue to wash his hands of the crisis in the NHS.”
Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: “This is a very narrow outcome and health leaders will hope that it will be used as a basis for reopening negotiations with consultants to address their concerns rather than as a stepping stone to call for more damaging industrial action. Strikes have already led to over 1.3 million cancelled procedures and appointments and cost the NHS in excess of £1bn.""
Junior doctors in England are currently being balloted over further strike action."

Kenneth Smith, 58, is due to be the first-ever prisoner to be killed by nitrogen hypoxia which will see him suffocate and cause him to fall unconscious quickly and die from a lack of oxygen.
He will be strapped to a gurney and be forced to breathe nitrogen through a mask until his body is depleted of oxygen and his organs shut down. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Research has shown that when oxygen levels in the air drop to around 12.5 percent, humans can experience ""impaired respiration that may cause permanent heart damage"" along with nausea, vomiting, and ""very poor judgment and coordination.""

Smith had previously survived a botched attempt at a lethal injection execution in November 2022 where he spent hours believing he was going to die but ultimately survived.
And now human rights campaigners have criticised Alabama for using the controversial method of nitrogen hypoxia as it remains untested.
Maya Foa, a joint executive director of Reprieve, the human rights group, said that Alabama was doubling down on its untested human experimentation.
“Alabama has tortured Kenneth Smith once already, strapping him down and stabbing him with needles for more than an hour in a failed attempt to kill him. It is astonishingly reckless and cruel to try again using an untested execution method that has every chance of causing terrible suffering,” Foa said.
Foa added that Alabama's published protocol for the controversial death was ""alarmingly vague - officials evidently don’t know what they are doing and are hoping for the best. The state is treating a human being like a guinea pig in a laboratory and calling it justice.”
The United Nations has also slammed the method and expressed their ""alarm"" at the prospect of the execution. They believe there is a possibility of ""grave suffering which execution by pure nitrogen inhalation may cause"" and noted that there was no scientific evidence to prove otherwise.
Smith's own lawyers have claimed the state is looking to make him the ""test subject"" for a new execution method.
The inmate expressed his fears in writing, saying: ""I am worried that we have told Alabama that these risks could happen - will happen - just like we warned them last year. And they will do nothing to prevent these dangers from happening.""
Smith's spiritual advisor, Reverend Jeff Hood, expressed his worries about Smith's potential suffering and resistance to the execution. He stated: ""This is not going to be a peaceful experiment."" Adding: ""I think it's important for people to realise, when you strap someone down like that, you can't expect someone who's choking to death - suffocating to death - to not resist.""
At present, Alabama is just one of three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that authorises the use of nitrogen gas in executions.
The state will fit a 'NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator', a type of mask usually used by industrial workers, over Smith's face during the execution. After this, a warden will read out the death warrant and ask Smith for any final words before triggering the ""nitrogen hypoxia system"" from another room.
According to Alabama's guidelines for execution by nitrogen hypoxia: ""After the nitrogen gas is introduced, it will be administered for (1) fifteen minutes or (2) five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer."" However, parts of the protocol for this new execution method have been redacted from public view."

The Money Saving Expert (MSE) website founder shared the warning on the recent episode of the Martin Lewis Money Show this week. He told viewers that unmarried parents whose partner had died could claim backdated payments of Bereaved Parent's Payment or Widowed Parent’s Allowance after a rule change last year. These are benefits aimed at providing financial support to parents who have lost a partner and have children together.
However, he warned that people don't have long left to claim as the ""rock hard deadline"" is in two weeks' time on February 8 2024.
Previously the benefits were only available to bereaved parents who were married or in a civil partnership, however, in February 2023 it was changed and is now available to cohabiting parents with dependent children. The DWP then opened a 12 month window for cohabitating parents to backdate their claims - potentially as far back as 2001.
Martin Lewis told viewers that parents can claim backdated support worth up to £40,000, he said: ""If you are unmarried and have children and your partner died since 2001, you can possibly claim up to £40,000 of backdated bereavement support, but that is a rock hard deadline on February 8.
""Watch back our show on December 5, 2023, and there’s free information available online. Spread the word to anyone you think fits the bill. It is so important, it’s huge money, it’s life-changing, and once we get to the eighth of February it’s closed for so many people.""
The MSE newsletter was posted later this week and explained how you can claim the backdated payments. It also linked to the Bereavement support payments MSE page which shared the stories from people who had successfully claimed.
Admin assistant Joanne from Bradford successfully claimed £22,000 earlier this year. She told the MSE team: ""I was going through my emails and almost deleted the MSE weekly email when I spotted the reader success about bereavement support. I clicked on the link and followed the guidance in the story to make a claim.
""I was told I was eligible but I was totally shocked when £22,000 dropped into my bank account. I had to ring the Department for Work and Pensions to make sure it was correct and not a mistake.""
Another success story came from Janice who emailed the MSE team to thank Martin for bringing the change of law to her attention, she said: ""My partner died suddenly in December 2016 and because we weren’t married I received nothing despite the fact we had a 12-year-old son. Following you highlighting the change in law, I submitted a claim and have recently received a payment of over £30k! Many Thanks!""
The amount you may be able to claim from the DWP is dependent on when your partner died. If your partner died on or after April 6, 2017, then you might be able to claim Bereavement Support Payment and if they died before this date, you may be entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance - you have to be under state pension age to apply.
The Bereavement Support Payment is worth £2,500, plus £100 a month for 18 months for those eligible. If you get Child Benefit or you were pregnant, you receive higher rates. This includes a first payment of £3,500, plus £350 a month for 18 months - this means you could receive up to £9,800 in support.
Widowed Parent’s Allowance is based on how much your partner paid in National Insurance contributions. The maximum is £139.10 a week and you might be entitled to claim this until you either stop being entitled to child benefit or reach state pension age. The MSE website says this means you could be eligible to tens of thousands of pounds depending on how old your child was when the partner died.
Bereavement Support Payment claims can be made online, over the phone or through a paper application form. Widowed Parent’s Allowance claims are only processed by paper forms and these can be downloaded from the GOV.UK website or requested through the Bereavement Service helpline on 0800 151 2012.
The DWP says people can make a claim after the February deadline however those who do will not receive as much money."

Spoilers have revealed that Angelica King could be leaving the Dales as she is set for a court hearing next week after confessing to driving the car that killed Heath Hope. Elsewhere, Cain Dingle is set to leave wife Moira shocked next week as his secret is exposed after a scary hospital dash.
Also in the village, Chas Dingle shares her heartbreaking cancer news with her stunned family before she decides to leave the village. Here's the biggest moments ahead on Emmerdale next week...
Emmerdale is set for dramatic scenes next week as the village could be saying goodbye to one character after court news.
Only recently, the ITV soap was full of heartbreak on New Year's Day as teenager Heath died after joyriding in a car with his twin sister Cathy and Angelica King. The teenagers had been desperate to go to a New Year's Eve party out of the village but couldn't get a lift and their dad Bob Hope refused to pay for a taxi. The trio were left bored at the B&B's party so decided to take matters into their own hands, stealing Wendy's car to joyride to the party.
Since the crash, both Cathy and Angelica have claimed the other person was driving with the village left torn over who to believe, especially Bob who has been refusing to see Cathy in order to protect her from himself. On Thursday, it was the day of Heath’s funeral, and a guilty Angelica decided to tell the truth.
Angelica confessed to her gobsmacked mother, Nicola King, that she was the one driving the car when Heath died as she worried about being sent to prison. On Friday night, it aired the aftermath as Nicola struggled with the bombshell and upon telling husband Jimmy King, he stormed out the house unable to cope.
In scenes this week, despite being urged to lie from Jimmy, Angelica runs over to the B&B where she publicly confesses to a shell-shocked Liam, Brenda, Cathy and April. Later, at the police station, she is arrested for causing death by dangerous driving. In upcoming scenes next week, Nicola is gloomy as she returns from resigning her post at the council.
Meanwhile, Jimmy and Nicola are both apprehensive as they tell Angelica there is a date for her hearing, leaving the family worried. Later, lawyer Ethan Anderson delivers Nicola the bad news that Angelica will likely face a custodial sentence. Yet there's more drama ahead as Bob is left shaking with anger when Jimmy admits he was the one who told Angelica to lie.
The next day, the King family prepare for Angelica's hearing and protective mother Nicola urges Jimmy not to tell Angelica about her potential custodial sentence. However, Jimmy is unsure if it’s the best strategy for their little girl and is later left shocked when a distressed Nicola desperately seeks a way out of Angelica's situation by lying by saying Angelica should claim ""not guilty"".
After an argument breaks out, the worried parents agree that they can help their daughter without making her lie. Later, Nicola and Jimmy head off with Angelica, where they spot Brenda and Bob, who are delighted the charges against Cathy have now been dropped. What's next for Angelica and is this an exit for the young character?
Emmerdale's Cain Dingle is set to leave wife Moira shocked next week as his secret is exposed after a scary hospital dash.
In upcoming scenes this week, Cain is set to fight it out with his nephew, Aaron Dingle, after the latter's car stealing antics go too far. Aaron is set to sell fellow family member Samson one of his stolen motors and Cain realises that Aaron is playing games so sells the car on.
Aaron continues to push Cain's buttons and before long he steals Cain's personal car, and the family fear Cain's reaction. Things go from bad to worse when a police officer spots Aaron's lack of licence plates and he's taken in for questioning about the spate of recent car thefts with the situation looking damning.
Later, with Aaron throwing further disrespect in Cain's direction, the uncle and nephew soon have a brutal fight in the garage, where Cain pins Aaron down, unsure whether to finish it. In spoilers next week, it is revealed that Cain is in hospital and wife Moira is relieved when he awakes.
The doctor finishes examining Cain and gives him advice to stay in bed but Cain decides to leave. Later, Dr Liam Cavanagh is shocked to hear Cain has discharged himself. As the family rally behind Cain, an isolated Aaron ponders his next move, realising he is a Dingle outsider.
The next day, Moira frets as Cain takes more painkillers. Later, Cain returns and Moira is shocked when he finally opens up to her and reveals what has been troubling him.
Emmerdale fans will be left in tears next week when Chas Dingle shares her heartbreaking cancer news with her stunned family.
This week, Chas is set to be diagnosed with triple negative cancer a year on from losing her mother to terminal breast cancer. Chas receives a call confirming her hospital appointment after finding a lump in her breast in a previous episode.
Next week, doctor Liam Cavanagh and Chas talk about her prognosis, where Liam is concerned about her keeping it a secret and he attempts to tell her that telling family is the best option. Later at the pub, in true soap style, as the family argue, Chas explains what is going on and everybody reels from Chas' news. The shocked yet supportive family gather around Chas except for her son Aaron Dingle, who cruelly keeps his distance and then walks away from his heartbroken mum.
Chas is left further heartbroken to realise Aaron intends to leave the village while Mackenzie rushes after him, determined to make him see sense. Mackenzie tries to get through to Aaron, who is irritated when Mackenzie continues to offer his support and follows him. Aaron insists he doesn’t want to talk - but can Mackenzie get him to change his tune?
Meanwhile, Chas and ex-husband Paddy decide on how best to let Eve know of her diagnosis and soon sit Eve down to gently explain the cancer. The next day, siblings Cain and Chas, who is frightened but grateful to have found the cancer early, get together and poignantly reflect on their lives.
After the chat, Paddy is disappointed when Chas says she wants to take Eve on holiday without him. Later in the week, the family gather on the street to see Chas off for her holiday and Chas is shocked when Mandy hands her a wad of cash from Paddy.
Emmerdale is working with the charity Breast Cancer Now who are helping the production for this long running storyline. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK with one woman diagnosed every ten minutes.
Emmerdale airs weeknights at 7:30pm on ITV1 and ITVX, with an hour-long episode on Thursdays. Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads."
62FQ9MUDOT_6B0P1USA49S32HX,Fraudsters could use these tricks to turn your big 2024 holiday into a nightmare,Beci Wood,"19:43, 23 Jan 2024Updated21:02, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/fraudsters-could-use-tricks-turn-31950553,"The weather outside may be chilly but it’s a busy time of year for holiday bookings, as people start putting their travel plans for the year ahead into action.
With cost-of-living concerns still squeezing household budgets, cheap deals might seem ­particularly tempting. But fraud experts are warning that some “special offers” may turn your holiday dream into a nightmare.
Chris Ainsley, head of fraud risk management at Santander, says: “Many people are already daydreaming about their next holiday, but unfortunately, fraudsters are ready to pounce. As you plan your trips for 2024, stay safe by always booking directly with an airline, hotel or through a well-known agent, and check whether they are a member of ABTA (a trade association for UK travel agents, tour operators and the wider travel industry). And don’t reply to unsolicited emails, texts or cold calls about ­holidays either.”
Holidaymakers should also read the small print for ATOL protection before they book their next trip abroad. People can check the ATOL website before booking and use its checker tool to see if their holiday provider holds an ATOL licence.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority runs the ATOL financial protection scheme. Recent research from the scheme suggests that one in 12 (8%) of people would research and book their next big holiday on the same day. But beware of making hasty ­bookings without doing some proper digging first. Holiday fraudsters will use fake online adverts that may look very similar to the real thing. And don’t be dazzled by images of luxurious rooms and stunning views, all intended to lure people into handing over their cash.
Chris also warns that fraudsters will use genuine images of locations stolen from legitimate websites to trick people, so make sure you know who you are dealing with. You could try doing an image search online to see if the pictures have actually been taken from elsewhere.
Also, check the website address and make sure it has not been altered by slight changes to the domain name. Criminals may clone websites to imitate trusted companies, so that it appears you are dealing with someone legitimate.
Fraudsters may ask people to pay by bank transfer, too. Those making payments may never receive a confirmation. Or, they may receive what appears to be a booking confirmation and only find out at the airport or hotel that they have been scammed. Chris adds: “Remember that using a credit or debit card when booking gives you extra protection if things do go wrong.”
Under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, people can raise a claim against their bank or lender for a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of goods or services. People who have used a debit or credit card to pay could also try raising a charge-back claim, which allows people to dispute transactions and claw back payments. Banks and lenders can provide you with more information on this.
Keep any documents or receipts from your holiday booking handy. Also keep an eye out for any “hidden” charges that could ramp up the overall cost of your trip, such as charges for amending the booking or for extra baggage. Travel insurance is also vital if the holiday doesn’t quite go to plan. Make sure you shop around for a travel ­insurance policy that will fit your needs.
Lucie Hart, policy adviser at the ­Association of British Insurers says: “Travel insurance should be an essential part of planning your holiday, not least to cover you against the potential ­jaw-droppingly expensive cost of needing any emergency medical treatment while you are abroad. You should always make sure that you buy the right policy for your needs, which may not be the cheapest one. For example, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, then you may need to arrange cover with a specialist travel insurer.”"
63M1YA4I8T_D8Z5YSGL871PTTZ,UK's 'worst' broadband providers exposed - is your supplier bottom of the list?,Dave SnellingTechnology Editor,"11:33, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/uks-worst-broadband-providers-exposed-31964565,"The latest broadband stats from Ofcom are out which reveal who is performing well and which firms could do with improving. These figures are released a various points throughout the year and it seems some providers are doing far better than others.
So who is the top dog and who needs to up their game?
Coming bottom of the pile for broadband moans is Virgin Media with the popular provider scoring 32 complaints per 100,000 - that's considerably worse than any other supplier.
""Virgin Media was the most complained about broadband, landline and pay-TV provider, seeing significant rises across all these areas from the previous quarter,"" Ofcom explained.
""Customers’ complaints were mainly driven by how their complaints were being handled.""
Next up it's NOW Broadband with 18 complaints (per 100,00) and TalkTalk with 15 complaints (per 100,000).
If you want the broadband provider with the least issues then it seems Sky is a good option with the popular supplier scoring just 5 complaints (per 100,000), this is followed by EE and then BT who both scored below the average.
Along with broadband, Ofcom has also rated firms for their pay-TV offerings and once again its Virgin Media falling behind the pack.
The company scored 20 complaints (per 100,000) which is way higher than TalkTalk's one complaint (per 100,000). Sky came second for telly with two complaints (per 100,000).
Sky also performed well when it comes to landline and mobile complaints coming top in both categories.
""Sky again generated the fewest complaints per 100,000 subscribers in both broadband and landline,"" Ofcom confirmed.
Overall it's been a great few months for providers with customer moans growing across the industry.
""In the quarter from July to September 2023 (Q3 2023), complaints to Ofcom rose slightly from the previous quarter (Q2 2023: April to June 2023),"" Ofcom confirmed.
""Complaints about landline, fixed broadband and pay-TV all rose from the previous quarter while mobile pay-monthly remained at similar levels.""
Speaking about the stats a Virgin Media O2 spokesperson said: “Our number one priority is to provide an excellent service to our customers, and we accept that the rise in complaints in the third quarter falls far short of our expectations.
“As Ofcom acknowledges, the rise is largely due to its investigation announcement in July which subsequently generated a higher number of complaints than would ordinarily be expected. However, it should be noted that overall complaints about Virgin Media and O2 products still represent a very small proportion of our customer base.
“As well as engaging fully with Ofcom’s ongoing investigation, we are investing in every area of our business to give our customers the best possible experience, with a real focus on resolving any issues at the first time of getting in touch and making it easier for them to get support when they need it.”"
67ZVUY6TFT_RT6NMC6D57Q7A5Z,Sheep-shearing sex predator sent back to the UK from Falkland isles as cops put on alert,Graeme MurrayNews Reporter,"09:34, 22 Jan 2024Updated10:42, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sheep-shearing-sex-predator-sent-31935544,"A sheep-shearing sex predator has been sent back to UK from the Falkland Islands as cops are put on alert.
Roland Wedgwood-Orekoya was given a prison sentence in the South Atlantic for attacking a teenager who he lured home. But he has now landed in Britain with any warning and been described as a 'danger to women'. The high-risk sex offender was sent back from Falkland Islands to British streets.
The Daily Record Police reports police chiefs went to court in Glasgow to ensure he signs the sex offender register. Wedgwood-Orekoya, also known as Seyi, has travelled the world working on farms and has strong connections to Aberdeenshire. But in 2021 he arrived on the Falklands, taking jobs as a shearer and also working in the fishing industry. In April 2022 he struck up a conversation with his victim as they queued at a late-night burger van in capital Port Stanley.
The girl was drunk but made clear she wasn’t interested in him. But, according to the court, Wedgwood-Orekoya “clearly intended luring her back to [his] accommodation in order to have sex with her”. He offered to share his stash of cannabis if she went to his digs. When they arrived, though, he stripped naked and tried to force himself on her, tearing off some of her clothes and leaving her bruised in the “sustained assault”. She escaped after punching the predator. Wedgwood-Orekoya denied sexual assault but was found guilty.
A probation report said his “transient lifestyle”, flitting between countries to shear sheep, added to the danger he poses. Sentencing him to 18 months’ jail, judge Malcolm Simmons told Wedgwood-Orekoya: “You have been assessed as being a high risk of harm to the public, namely females, especially those to whom you are sexually attracted. There was clearly a level of violence in the way you manhandled your victim.
“This was clearly a frightening event for her. What occurred was not a momentary touching but a sustained assault. She was living at home with her parents, having recently left school. You are a man in your thirties. You specifically targeted a particularly vulnerable victim, a young girl who you knew had been drinking. You continue to deny the offence. You have shown no remorse.”
Last week, Police Scotland took legal proceedings at Glasgow Sheriff Court to reduce the risk Wedgwood-Orekoya poses to women. The force secured an order to ensure Wedgwood-Orekoya signs the sex offenders register till 2032. It means he will have to notify the police of any change of address or name. He will also be subject to frequent monitoring."
68BI2W652M_LEUQEGL9EMJL2KO,Norwich deaths timeline: Everything we know after four found dead inside Norfolk home,Kieren WilliamsNews Reporter,"14:43, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/norwich-deaths-timeline-everything-know-31957228,"Four people - a dad, his two young girls and their aunt - were tragically found dead in a house in Norwich.
Police had to force their way into a home in Costessey, Norfolk, after receiving a call from a member of the public shortly before 7am on Friday January 19.
There had been a previous 999 call from the same house which officers hadn’t attended, but when they eventually got into the home they found the bodies of Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36, Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, and Natasha Kuczynska, nine.
Bartlomiej was the dad of Jasmin and Natasha, and Kanticha was his sister-in-law who had been visiting over from Thailand. A Home Office post-mortem examination found that Kanticha died of multiple stab wounds to the neck, whilst Bartlomiej died of a single stab wound to the neck.
A post-mortem on the two young girls is being carried out today and detectives confirmed that they were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. The local community was left reeling by the deaths, as was one of Kanticha’s friends who spoke to the Mirror following her death, and there remains a number of unanswered question over the tragedy.
December 14 - In the days before Christmas, a missing person enquiry was made from the address in Costessey about Bartlomiej. Police had contact with the family and this is one of the two incidents it referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. It is believed that drones were deployed in the search and the dad was found.
December - Sometime over December it is believed, Bartlomiej missed a mental health assessment. The exact date is unclear but the dad missed the emergency mental health assessment just weeks before he was found dead.
The father of two was taken to hospital for an emergency mental health assessment but was able to leave the site in Colney, Norfolk, unescorted before it was carried out. Neighbours also said Mr Kuczynski had mental health problems for months and had asked for help, although they didn’t know if he had engaged with mental health services.
December 27 - Kanticha arrived in the UK, to stay with her sister’s family. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, one of her best pals Naty Wathanakul revealed she had been due to fly home at some point next month.
She described her shock and said: ""She was very nice and caring to all friends of her, a really big supportive person, she helped everyone. We have been shocked and depressed since we knew about her death. I wasn't expecting that my friend wouldn't be able to come back alive. She was just a petite woman, I can't believe this happened to her. It was too cruel to handle, I was crying.""
Naty said Kanticha had visited the UK last June and had originally been hesitant about coming over this month for ""no reason"". She said: ""She didn't want to go to the UK this time for no reason because she went there once or twice a year normally.""
January 19, just before 6am - The first 999 call was made from the house in Costessey, but no officers responded. The call was thought to have been made by Bartlomiej and the force subsequently referred itself to the IOPC.
During the call, it is believed that a man “expressed concerns for his own mental state”. Charmaine Arbouin, IOPC regional director, said: ""Norfolk Constabulary established that the man had made a 999 call to the force shortly before 6am on January 19. During that call the man expressed concerns for his own mental state saying he was confused.
""He was advised to seek medical advice and police did not attend.""
January 19 - Around an hour later, a second 999 call was made by a dog walker expressing concern for the occupants of the house. Police attended this and had to force their way into the house. Once inside, they found the body of the four people, and investigations began.
Ms Arbouin added: ""At around 7am the force received a call from a dog walker concerned for the welfare of those within the home. Officers attended shortly after and, tragically, found the man, a woman, and two children dead.""
January 20 - The next day, Norfolk Police referred itself to the IOPC over the missing persons enquiry and first 999 call - that went unresponded to.
In the update police issued that day, it also confirmed that it wasn't looking for anyone else as a part of the investigation and had additional patrols in the area.
January 21 - The next update came after the Home Office post-mortems for Bartlomiej and Kanticha. It was confirmed that the sister-in-law had died of multiple stab wounds and Bartlomiej of a single stab wound - both to the neck.
January 22 - Norfolk Police chief constable Paul Sanford issued a statement saying the force would be “open and transparent” with the IOPC investigation.
Mr Sanford said: “This is a tragic and horrific incident and my thoughts, and that of the entire constabulary, remain with the family of those involved. I’m aware this incident has also caused great upset and shock in Costessey, the wider community and beyond.
“Following the identification of the earlier 999 call, the constabulary referred itself to the IOPC who will now investigate. It is because of this process that I choose my words carefully; not because I don’t want to be open and honest, but because I have a duty to protect the integrity of any investigation that needs to follow.
“It will be for this investigation to identify and consider the circumstances and to consider if there were any issues with the response. I know the family and the public will rightly want to know whether there was an ability to prevent this tragedy, and this is a question that must be answered.
“However, at this stage, I cannot answer that question. What I can say is that we will be open and honest in the days, weeks, and months ahead, to get the answers to this question. There will, of course, also be an inquest that will review the wider circumstances surrounding the deaths and the involvement of the police and other agencies.
""We have thousands of interactions with the public every single day, on the phone and in person. It’s only right that when there are questions about our response, they are properly investigated, and I fully support and welcome this scrutiny.
“I will not wait for the outcome of this investigation to review our working practices and that process has started. Furthermore, the constabulary is currently undergoing a routine inspection by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. That inspection includes an assessment of our response to 999 calls.
“Today, I have asked the Inspectorate to consider undertaking a deeper review than the robust inspection already planned, to provide the reassurance that the public and I need in our response to emergency calls.”
January 23 - Yesterday police confirmed the names of the four family members in the home, aligning with previous reports including from the Mirror."
6EWXU6ZN02_0AKAM56JWMIRXQ3,Will Rishi Sunak be replaced as Tory leader before the next election? Vote in our poll,Freya HodgsonOnline Reporter,"11:45, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-replaced-tory-leader-31954843,"Rishi Sunak is facing an attack on his leadership by Sir Simon Clarke, who is calling for the PM to be replaced to give the Tories a ""fighting chance"" at the ballot box - and we want to know what YOU think.
The former cabinet minister has urged MPs to oust Sunak over fears the party will face an ""annihilation"" at the next election, which will take place during the second half of 2024. In a Daily Telegraph article on Tuesday, Sir Simon launched scathing criticism of Sunak, describing his rule as ""uninspiring"" and adding: ""The unvarnished truth is that Rishi Sunak is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred"".
He confessed that some MPs would be ""afraid"" of electing a fourth leader in two years, but said: ""What could be more ridiculous than meekly sleepwalking towards an avoidable annihilation because we were not willing to listen to what the public are telling us so clearly?""
In response to the blistering article, former Tory minister and peer Lord Zac Goldsmith said: ""He's obviously right"". This comes amid growing rightwing pressure on the PM over his flagship Rwanda Bill, which aims to deter small boats from crossing the Channel.
Last week, 61 Tory MPs voted to change the bill as it went through Parliament, marking the biggest rebellion of Mr Sunak’s premiership. Sir Simon was among those who voted against the Bill, claiming that the Government's plan will fail.
He said the Tories ""face an utter disaster when it becomes clear over the months ahead that it does not deliver. Many of us will not stand idly by and let that happen"".
The MP for Middlesbrough South is the second former minister publicly calling for Sunak to step down, after Dame Andrea Jenkyns submitted a letter of no confidence in the PM in November. At least 15 percent of the parliamentary party - equivalent to 53 Tory MPs - must submit a letter of no confidence to trigger a possible leadership challenge.
Former Tory Cabinet Minister Sir David Davis denounced the article, saying: ""This is getting silly. The Party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests."" While former home secretary Dame Priti Patel accused Sir Simon of ""engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence"".
The brutal assault comes after a YouGov poll of 14,000 people projected Labour was on course for a 120-seat majority at the general election, while the Tories could face a 1997-style wipeout. With the next election expected during the second half of this year, we want to know if you think Rishi will be replaced? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.

The star only recently left prison and has been fined. He was ordered to pay over £5,000 - a £500 fine and £4,707.05 in costs for the fence around his house that was built without planning permission. A complaint was initially made about the fence in late 2020, Chelmsford Crown Court heard but Bear ignored warnings from Epping Forest District Council.
The fence was still up in March 2021. It resulted in an enforcement action but when authorities returned in January 2022, the fence was still up around his house. Bear appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court on January 26 for sentence and for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing about his conviction for sharing a sex tape with ex-girlfriend Georgia Harrison without her permission. Ms Harrison bravely waived her right to anonymity.
Bear initially claimed he ""didn't know"" about the enforcement action but changed his plea in November last year. Judge Morgan told the disgraced TV personality: ""You are entitled to take measures to protect your house, but that must be done lawfully.
""I have little doubt that if you were not pressed by your circumstances at the time, you would have sought advice and not placed yourself in that situation.""
The reality star, 33, was released early from prison after serving half of his sentence. The Ex on the Beach star was handed a 21-month sentence in March after being found guilty of sharing a  sex tape with ex-girlfriend  Georgia Harrison without her permission. On January 17, he walked free after serving 11 months.
During his sentencing, Bear was also slapped with a restraining order and told not to contact Harrison for five years. Bear must also keep police informed of his whereabouts for an entire decade. Bear was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and also to pay Georgia the sum of £207,000 – the highest sum awarded in an image abuse case.
On Friday, Bear appeared in court over the order to pay the £207,000 sum. He was seen at the court alongside his dad and wore a black suit paired with flashy £800 trainers and £243 sunglasses. His hair has gone back to his signature cut and his long prison beard has gone. The Ex on the Beach star was ordered to pay Georgia the damages in July and he was also slapped with an injunction preventing him from using the footage again.

Viewers watching the latest episode of the long-running BBC show were watching through their fingers as they cringed over the true story of a vase that the owner believed was over 100 years old. The show's latest episode was filmed in Derry in Northern Ireland and hosted by Fiona Bruce, who was joined by a string of antiques experts who were on hand to tell guests how much their belongings were worth.
But disaster and embarrassment befell one attendee as he discovered a ceramic vase was fake. During the episode, expert John Sandon was asked to cast his eye over an item and to give an approximation of its value.
The guest appeared on the show saying he was a collector of ceramics and he had brought what he believed to be rare Irish ceramics. Presenting two lilac vases on the show, the guest explained how he came by them.
He said: ""When I saw the name William Moorcroft, I thought 'Yeah, I'd like to get something that was quite old of his. I have a couple of new pieces which kind of 2004, whereas these, I thought were kind of around 1900, 1905.""
John cast his eye over the items and was initially surprised by them and the guest’s tale. He warned, however, that it would be rare to find a matching pair of William Moorcroft cases in such good condition. The guest went on to explain he had bought the items from someone who was selling the belongings of a dead relative.
He explained: “I drove down to Cork to meet him. But I ended up meeting in a car park, which I thought was a bit strange."" He went on to state he bought the vases for £550.
John then explained: ""What worries me when you see them here is, are they too good to be true? Because they would be 1905, so 110 or 120 years old. You're going to expect to see defects here and there, a bit of signs of crazing. Underneath there, smears of old, has that just been dipped in tea?""
Turning the vases upside down, John went on to point out that the signatures underneath were photographic copies. He said: ""They're modern fakes, and therefore they're just pretty"".
Viewers watching from home were left feeling embarrassed on behalf of the guest. One wrote on X: ""Difficult to have much sympathy for that bloke who bought the vases from the back of a car #antiquesroadshow.""
Another questioned: ""Didn’t that guy say he was a ceramics maker? Was there really a guy in a car park, or were you just trying to see how well your ceramic making is?"" Another lamented the meeting, writing: “What a waste of time!”
While a further viewer wrote: ""#antiquesroadshow has turned into the car boot sale show."" With a further fan writing: ""Never seen so much tat in the show … all junk #AntiquesRoadshow.""

Kimberlie Donoghue, who was in her 30s, has been hailed as the ""most caring girl"" in tributes from her loved ones after police said an investigation into her death - treated as unexplained - is ongoing. A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to a police station for questioning.
The death of Kimberlie, from Kirkby, Merseyside, has devastated the community, including the woman's friends who paid tribute to her today. One friend posted on Facebook: ""I can't believe what has happened in the last 24 hours it's absolutely heartbreaking. We had some great times growing up. Absolutely awful. Kimberlie Donoghue thinking of all the family x.""
Another wrote: ""Can’t believe what’s happened! You were the purest, most caring girl I’ve ever known. You were always there for others before yourself and as a mum you were one of a kind. Rest in peace angel and you will never leave anyone’s mind who had the pleasure of knowing you as a person.""
A third wrote: ""How can this world be so cruel? You were one of a kind Kimberlie Donoghue. The one who got me up when I was down, the one to make any silent room loud. You were an amazing friend to everyone and I’ll never forget you. I love you so much.""
A fourth said: ""Rest in paradise Kimberlie Donoghue. Such a beautiful lady inside and out. Sending all my love to your family and your four babies. Life really is so unfair, feeling all kinds of emotions this morning. Fly High Gorgeous.""
Liverpool Echo yesterday reported how police and forensics swarmed the residential road. Pictures of the scene showed a row of houses cordoned off from the pavement, with police attention focusing on one house in particular.
Chief Inspector Colin Dyer, of Merseyside Constabulary, said: ""We are carrying out a number of lines of enquiry as we seek to establish what has taken place. Witness enquiries are being carried out in the local area and we are examining local CCTV and Ring doorbell footage to build a picture of what has happened.
""We would ask anyone who was in the area of Roughwood Drive this afternoon who saw or heard anything to contact us as a matter of urgency. Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC or call 101 quoting log 620 of 21st January."""
6R389UT2CV_OVA9LZUBB57F8IW,Man praised for 'glorious' revenge on coworker who kept stealing his lunch,Emma Rowbottom,"13:35, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/man-praised-glorious-revenge-coworker-31938804,"They say revenge is a dish best-served cold, which was certainly the case for one hapless work thief who lived to regret continually stealing a colleague's lunch. The man recounted how years ago he had been the victim of numerous stolen lunches at work, and after complaining to HR every third or fourth time, he was left fuming that nothing was being done.
However, a yearly check-up at his doctor led to a prescriptive revenge tactic that left the thief unable to eat for some time afterward. He said: “I was b****ing to my doctor and he smiled saying: ‘You’re constipated then?’ I was dumb and said: ‘No why’, and he wrote me a prescription for some laxatives with instructions to ‘mix it in with your meal for maximum effect’ at which point I knew the plan.”
The man then shared how on the day he put the laxatives in his lunch - and waited patiently for the thief to steal his sandwich yet again, heading straight to HR to report two things when he did: “One my lunch was stolen again, and wto my medication was stolen.”

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
After telling HR that he had some digestive problems and his doctor had prescribed a ‘powerful laxative to mix in with his mid-day meal’, HR was duty-bound to call the police, as stealing prescribed medication was a criminal offense.
After the police caught the culprit, from a different department and clearly feeling worse for wear, he even tried to accuse the man of poisoning his food: “I asked him: “At which point did you get the idea that food was for you? Now I no longer have my medication I was prescribed for my condition.”
After admitting that this comment led to the man to: “Shut his mouth until he got a lawyer,” he told how his friend from high school came in to take on his position at the company after he was sacked for the offence. “I have no clue where lunch thief went after his fines and community service,” he confirmed.
With his revelation on Reddit sending readers wild, one said: “Can I have the number of that doctor? Been looking for one just like him.” Another commented: “This is beautiful – keeping the medication in the bag is a neat trick.”
One told how most good HR departments have policies that mean lunch theft equals instant termination, with another saying: “This is why employers shouldn't disregard lunch thieves. It's only a matter of time until they turn their thieving hands on the employers' things, or somehow cause damages to their employer.” One reader said: “Glorious, love that both the thief and boss got their just desserts. It's no different than stealing money from someone's wallet.”"

The Islanders had returned to the South African villa for a second chance at love, however their time was brutally cut short on Monday night. Demi and Luis were booted off the show after the recent arrivals of Arabella Chi and Tyler Cruickshank. Arabella was asked to choose who she wanted to couple up with and she picked Chris Taylor, whilst newbie Tyler chose to recouple up with his ex-girlfriend Kaz Kamwi.
On TikTok live with former stars Francesca Allen and Elma Pazar, Demi told them Luis in fact had been honest about his issues with his two ex girlfriends Cally Jane Beech and Chloe Elizabeth, who are the mothers of his children. She says they are still connecting and opened up after he hit the headlines.
""I'm not one to judge, he did sit down and he did tell me in the villa, his situation,"" she said. ""It wasn't a shock when it came out."" I've met Cally before, I sort of knew the situation but I didn't know all the ins and outs of the other stuff and also I'm not one to pry. He's got a lot on his plate.""
She went on to say: ""I'm happy, we'll see where it goes, we'll see what happens."" In her exit interview, Demi revealed: ""Although it’s extremely early days, Luis and I get on so well. We are not putting any pressure on anything but we have already arranged our first date; we’re going to go out for dinner in London, go out for drinks and go out clubbing with our friends after.""
Luis added: ""I want to take her out this weekend. We've spoken about going to a restaurant in London and then meeting up with our mates for a night out."" He has already gushed over Demi, as he admitted he is ""so happy"" to be leaving with her. Luis said: ""Even though we weren’t coupled up, I wish we could’ve stayed longer as I thought we were a solid couple. I loved the time we shared together and overall I’ve had the best experience, it was even better than my time on series 1.""
As he headed into the villa for a second time, Luis was convinced he would find love. He said: ""I’m a lot older and wiser, so I know what I am getting myself into. I don’t have a game plan at all - I am an open book so I will go with the flow and see what happens. I feel like the Love Island Villa is the place best place to find different connections. I am confident I will find a connection again.""
Demi was also hopeful of finding the one, as she added: ""I am returning to the Love Island Villa because I am ready again to find love. I lost a lot of confidence with my health issues over the last couple of years but I’ve been smashing the gym this year, finding my confidence again and I’ve got it back. So, let’s find a man! It’s hard to find someone genuine or someone in the same industry as you who understands everything, it’s hard. I’m hoping to find someone in the same shoes as me and we can vibe.""

The couple - who first met on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing - have reportedly been surrounded by ""tension"" while Gorka has been working in Spain on the Spanish version of Strictly. Sources claimed Gemma was left frustrated as Gorka was unable to get home during the final six weeks of the last series, despite being voted out in week three.
But the former Hollyoaks star appears to have slammed any speculation about her engagement and insisted that she and Gorka, who she shares two children with, are more than happy. The star told her Instagram followers that she was making the most of the ""peace"" while Gorka was away from home.
Addressing the speculation, she said: ""Yes we did see them stories. There was a few floating around weren't there which is news to us. It is what it is, isn't it. Happens all the time dunnit. It's not true."" Gemma, 39, went on to say: ""I think it's because it was made out he's working away a lot. He goes away Friday afternoon and comes back Sunday mornings.
""He's hardly bloomin' overseas is he. Crikey it's less than 48 hours if anything it gives me a bit of peace at weekends. No offence Gorks. Well, he is overseas but you know what I mean."" Gorka is currently sitting as a judge on Bailando con las Estrellas, the Spanish version of Strictly and is spending a lot of time in the capital, Madrid, for filming.
Sources claimed that Gemma was ""effectively raising two kids by herself"". Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, they said: ""Gemma knows how important Gorka's work is to him and goes above and beyond to be supportive. But she found it challenging when he wasn't able to travel back to Man­­chester to spend time with her and the kids, even when he'd been voted off last year's series. She'd been hoping they would have more time after the show finished, as he usually opts out of the tour to focus on family.
""But then he signed up to Bailando con las Estrellas, and the plan changed. Gemma knows he's just wanting to support his family, but it's ­disappointing for her. It's a really rough patch for them. Gorka has also been frustrated because they haven't had time to travel to Bilbao for Thiago to meet his elderly parents."" Gorka and his professional partner Nikita Kanada were voted out of Strictly in week three but he remained in the competition and took part in group dances.

27-year-old Liren Chen, who works for Google, was arrested on January 16 at a home in Santa Clara, California for the murder of his Google Engineer wife. Chen was charged with murder and faces prison time if convicted, however, his arraignment was postponed after he was hospitalised.
Santa Clara officers arrived at the $2 million (£1.574M) home at around 11am on January 16 after being called to perform a welfare check on Valley Way. When officers arrived at the scene, an acquaintance of Chen ""expressed concern about Chen and his wife"", according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney, who added: ""Chen was refusing to answer his phone or his door.""

It's said the friend could see Chen inside the home ""motionless on his knees"" with ""his hands in the air"" and ""staring blankly"". Officers found Chen with an ""extremely swollen and purple"" right hand, and ""blood on his clothing, legs, arms, and hands and scratches on his arm.""
They found his wife ""deceased on the floor"" in the bedroom behind where Chen had been, she ""had severe blunt force injuries to her head"". His wife is believed to be Xuanyi Yu, a Google Engineer, though she has not formally been identified by authorities at this time.
Property records show Chen and Ms Yu had bought the Valley Way home in April last year for $2.05M (£1.6M). According to Ms Yu's LinkedIn profile, she worked as a Software Engineer at Google, a job which she started in June 2021. Prior to this she worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon full time after completing a three-month internship with the company in 2019.

77P2URDMF1_00B5QWB1HS4BL34,'Eunuch maker' fanatics admit to lucrative procedures like penis cutting and castration,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"13:45, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/eunuch-maker-fanatics-admit-lucrative-31964564,"Two men have admitted being part of an extreme body modifications plot involving videos posted on a lucrative “eunuch maker” website.
David Carruthers, 61, and Janus Atkin, 37, from Newport in Gwent, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm between 2016 and 2022.
The charge against them alleged the conspiracy involved the removal and cutting of penises, testicles, castration by clamping, and the insertion of needles into genitals. Judge Mark Lucraft KC adjourned sentencing to March 4 and 5 alongside other co-conspirators.
A third man, Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was not asked to enter a plea to the same charge and his case was adjourned for a week. Previously, the ringleader, Marius Gustavson, 46, of Haringey, north London, had admitted a string of charges at the Old Bailey.
Gustavson, known as the 'Eunuch Maker', led the wide-ranging body modifications plot and allegedly made up to £200,000 by posting videos of castrations and other procedures online.
Ten men were arrested after police raids in London, Scotland and South Wales. They have been charged as part of the conspiracy which is said to have involved up to 29 extreme body modifications, the removal of body parts and the trade in body parts with eight other men.
It is believed to have been a society in which people willingly undergo extreme body modification. The practice is linked to a subculture where men become “nullos” – short for genital nullification – by having their penis and testicles removed. Carruthers, Atkin and Scharf had appeared at the Old Bailey by video for the short hearing before Judge Lucraft.
Carruthers' partner Ashley Williams, 31, previously admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Atkin on November 7 2017. Carruthers and Williams together removed one of Atkin's testicles. Scharf is accused of taking part in a single procedure by removing a testicle in an apartment in Camden in July 2019.
Damien Brynes, 36, who removed Gustavson's penis with a vegetable knife has already been jailed for five years and male prostitute Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, was jailed for three years and eight months for freezing his leg, causing it to require amputation.
Former nurse Nathaniel Arnold, 46, was given a two-year suspended sentence for partially moving Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel. Gustavson, now wheelchair bound, admits conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one count of possessing criminal property, namely money.
He also admits making and distributing two indecent videos of a child between January 2017 and January 2020. Crimi-Appleby, of Epsom, Surrey, Arnold, of South Kensington, and Byrnes, of Tottenham, admitted causing GBH with intent.
Romanian Ion Ciucur, 28, who works in a hotel in Gretna Green, Scotland, has admitted conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm by taking part in a castration by clamping and one other modification. He is said to be 'part of Gustavson's inner circle'.
Arnold also admitted stealing Lidocaine while working as nurse at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital between January 2016 and January 2022, and possession of extreme pornographic images. Gustavson's alleged 'righthand man' surgeon Peter Wates, 66, has admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.
He was said to have a major role as surgeon in a large number of procedures. Gustavson, Atkin, Carrthuers, Ciucur and Wates will be sentenced on March 4 and 5. Gustavson, Scharf and Ciucur are remanded in custody while the others are on conditional bail, including curfew and residence. Scharf will next appear for a hearing on February 1."
7AL5IF99H4_3E1NT9IPHH0ZSCH,Nottingham killer Valdo Calocane's sentence 'too lenient' as review sent to Attorney General,Antony Clements-ThrowerNews Reporter,"09:31, 26 Jan 2024Updated09:34, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nottingham-killer-valdo-calocanes-sentence-31972079,"The furious families of victims killed by Nottingham knifeman Valdo Calocane have slammed his sentence as “too lenient” to the Attorney General.
Prosecutors of the Valdo Calocane case accepted a manslaughter charge rather than pursuing a murder verdict after the violent deaths of 19-year-old students Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates, 61. Calocane was yesterday sentenced to detention in a high-security hospital.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) defended its actions but the families have approached Attorney General Victoria Prentis as they argue the sentence was too lenient, a spokesman confirmed to the Mirror. The Cabinet minister now has 28 days from sentencing to review the request and decide whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal to decide whether the sentence was appropriate.
Emma Webber, mother of student Barnaby, said on the steps outside Nottingham Crown Court yesterday: “We as a devastated family have been let down by multiple agency failings and ineffectiveness. The CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) did not consult us as has been reported - instead we have been rushed, hastened and railroaded.
""We were presented with a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges. At no point during the previous five-and-a-half-months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder. We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out. We do not dispute the murderer is mentally unwell and has been for a number of years.
""However the pre-mediated planning, the collection of lethal weapons, hiding in the shadows and brutality of the attacks are that of an individual who knew exactly what he was doing. He knew entirely it was wrong but he did it anyway."" During sentencing, Judge Mr Justice Turner said Calocane would ""very probably"" be detained in a high-security hospital for the rest of his life as he sentenced him for the ""atrocious"" killings, as well as the attempted murder of three others.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declined to back calls for a public inquiry into the circumstances leading to the Nottingham attacks, but has promised to learn ""any lessons"" required from the case. Mr Sunak told broadcasters during a visit to Scarborough in north Yorkshire on Thursday it was ""right"" Calocane would ""spend very probably the rest of his life"" in a high-security hospital. Asked whether he would order a public inquiry into any failings by the police, health authorities and the CPS, he said: ""I think it is important all the relevant agencies look back to ensure all reasonable steps that could have been taken were taken and if there are any lessons to be learned that we do so.""
Treasury minister Gareth Davies declined to comment further after it emerged the Attorney General is considering whether judges should review the Calocane's sentence. The minister told Sky News: ""I'm pleased a sentence has been handed down which ensures that this perpetrator will be locked up for the rest of his life.
""There is a process in place to ensure that a referral can be made to the Attorney General and it's important that agencies conduct a thorough review of themselves and to assess what could have been done differently if that's the case. In any case, the Attorney General can review the outcome and the sentence. It is open to anybody to do that."""
7CNWUJZH7L_R37M5K8NTYNCL3Q,Exact moment Charles found out his mum the Queen was dead and he had become King,Ryan FaheyNews Reporter,"13:14, 23 Jan 2024Updated13:28, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/king-charles-queen-elizabeth-death-31944946,"King Charles discovered he had become the new British monarch while at the wheel of his car just hours after he'd visited his dying mother, a new biography has claimed.
Royal commentator Robert Hardman recently released his new book, The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy, which details the 75-year-old's ascension to the throne and the immediate aftermath of the death of his beloved mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.
In Chapter Three, London Bridge, Mr Hardman reveals never-before-heard details about when King Charles discovered that he had risen to the throne. He had earlier visited the Queen at Balmoral Castle, but was snaking along an unmarked Scottish country road when his title suddenly changed.
Mr Hardman writes: ""King Charles III succeeded to the throne at the wheel. To be more precise, he had just turned off the B976 onto the back drive of the Balmoral estate and was driving through a part of the world as dear and familiar to him as any, when he learned that he was now sovereign of the United Kingdom and fourteen other realms, covering a large part of the Earth's surface.
""Schoolchildren are taught that the longest reign in British history began at a Kenyan watering hole; that Princess Elizabeth was watching wildlife from the branches of a giant fig tree when King George VI died in his sleep on 6 February 1952; that his dutiful daughter, having climbed up as a Princess, climbed down as Queen.
""History will also record that, seven decades later, on the afternoon of 8 September 2022, her son and heir was on an unmarked Scottish country road, at the wheel of his car, when he was first addressed as ""Your Majesty"". He had been to visit the Queen at Balmoral Castle earlier in the day and had then spent a few hours at his nearby home, Birkhall, before returning to the castle.
""In the manner of his late mother, he had climbed into the car as both Prince of Wales and Duke of Rothesay (his title when in Scotland). Twenty minutes later, he would climb out of it as King Charles III - with the new Queen at his side.""
The book also goes on to provide information about the rift between King Charles and his son Prince Harry. The King would love to have his youngest son back in the fold and wants to patch up their fractured relationship, Mr Hardman claims.
While the book details the fall-out between Charles and his youngest son, Robert firmly believes the new King will reunite with Harry at some point in the future.
Mr Hardman claimed that Harry may not want to “reengage with his family”, after the father-of-two made a series of allegations against his close relatives, including details of a physical altercation between him and big brother Prince William over Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle. “Charles would love to have him back in the fold, not being royal again - I think that ship has sailed, and I'm sure Harry would not want to do that,” he explained."

Prosecutors in New Mexico first kicked off the new proceedings for the same shooting on the Rust set when they filed paperwork on Dec. 31. By Jan. 19, the actor was indicted before a grand jury as prosecutors came in with new evidence and experts to weigh in on the previously dropped case.
According to documents obtained by The Mirror, the next order of business is Alec's arraignment hearing. It's scheduled for Feb. 1 at 11:00 AM. Following this Friday's revelations, his attorneys Lukas Nikas and Alex Spiro told The Mirror US: ""We look forward to our day in court.""

As previously reported, the case was dropped when debates surrounding the alleged murder weapon spiraled. Alec claimed to never have pulled the trigger, raising concerns that the .45 Colt may have been defective, modified, or otherwise malfunctioned. The initial FBI investigation left the gun broken, leading to a halt in the investigation.
Now, the prosecutors worked with new experts to reconstruct the gun and the results from Lucien and Michael Haag claim that the trigger would need to be pulled for the gun to fire. Their report explained: ""Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver.""
Additional documents obtained by TMZ show that Alec's attorneys responded quickly and stressed Alec's constitutional right to a speedy trial. The response showed that Alec would like to settle this issue quickly as it's been dragging on for years now. The documents express a desire to ""avoid the hazards of proving his innocence that often arise after a lengthy delay in prosecution.""
Alec's team also stated some concern about the optics of the situation. As the proceedings drone on, fans continue to speculate and debate Alec's innocence amongst themselves. So, his legal team believes that the faster they can finish this the more then can ""minimize public vilification and suspicion."""
7F816M4EC8_E0J2082ZLP8UV0B,Alabama death row killer Kenneth Smith executed by nitrogen gas after surviving injection,Liam BucklerUS News Reporter,"02:34, 26 Jan 2024Updated09:44, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-alabama-death-row-killer-31956772,"Death row killer Kenneth Smith has been executed using a controversial nitrogen gas method after surviving his first lethal injection attempt.
The 58-year-old became the first-ever inmate in the USA to be put to death by toxic gas following an execution at Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility. His official time of death was recorded at 20:25 on Thursday, 25, January. Speaking ahead of his death, Smith said: ""I am not ready for that. Not in no kind of way. I'm just not ready, brother.""
The state of Alabama had predicted in federal court filings that the nitrogen gas would ""cause unconsciousness within seconds and cause death within minutes"" as the body is starved of oxygen.
As Smith was strapped to a bed, executioners placed a medical face mask over his head - with instructions allowing nitrogen to be administered for up to 15 minutes until the heart monitor flat-lined.

Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, said his last meal consisted of a Waffle House order: T-bone steak, hash browns, and scrambled eggs in A.1. sauce and toast. Procedure around the method of execution reports meant Smith was denied food for eight hours before his death.
He was said to have consumed his final meal at 10am on Thursday morning, before being denied any further solid food before his death and only clear liquids. According to a court document, the decision to ban all solid foods in the eight hours before his death was to reduce the likelihood of him vomiting during the execution and limit any ""substantial risk of harm"".
On Wednesday, one day before his scheduled death, Smith reportedly declined to eat breakfast and lunch and only consumed a coffee, a Mountain Dew, and a Pepsi, however did eat part of his evening meal. Yesterday he was also reportedly visited by a friend, his brother, two nieces, his son, grandson, wife, lawyer, and spiritual leader.

Smith was sentenced to death in 1989 for acting as a hitman to murder a preacher's wife. He survived an execution attempt in 2022 because medics could not find the veins to deliver the lethal injection. Smith later described the experience as ""like being up under a sewing machine.""
His nitrogen execution came after a last-ditch appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the killing, but judges ruled it could go ahead and refused to grant a stay of execution. But not all the judges were in agreement.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the method as ""untested"" and said Smith faced choking to death on his own vomit while wearing the face mask. And Justice Elena Kagan said nitrogen execution was ""entirely novel"".
Reverend Dr Jeff Hood, Smith's spiritual advisor who accompanied him to his deathbed, feared he too could die if nitrogen leaked into the surrounding room. Rev Hood said: ""I did hug my kids extra hard and tell them I love them multiple times before I left the house.""

In the hours ahead of the scheduled execution, Smith met with family members and Rev Hood, according to a prison spokesperson. He ate a final meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast, and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Hood said by telephone.
Critics of the controversial death penalty method said it was unclear what Smith would feel after the warden switched on the gas, according to medics.
""What effect the condemned person will feel from the nitrogen gas itself, no one knows,"" Dr Jeffrey Keller, president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, wrote in an email. ""This has never been done before. It is an experimental procedure.""
Keller, who was not involved in developing the Alabama protocol, said the plan was to ""eliminate all of the oxygen from the air"" that Smith is breathing by replacing it with nitrogen.
""Since the condemned person will not be breathing any oxygen, he will die,"" Keller said. ""It is little different than putting a plastic bag over one's head.""
The execution is the first attempt to use a new method since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. Three states - Alabama, Mississippi, and Oklahoma - have authorised nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. Some states are exploring new methods as lethal injection drugs have become more difficult to find.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable euthanasia method for most mammals because the anoxic environment ""is distressing."" Experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife. Prosecutors said the men were paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett, 45, on behalf of her husband, who wanted to collect on insurance. The coroner testified Sennett was stabbed repeatedly. Her husband killed himself when he became a suspect. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted, was executed in 2010.
The family of Alabama prisoner Kenneth Smith read a statement following the execution of killer Kenneth Smith, saying it marked a ""bitter sweet day"".
Following Thursday's execution, Elizabeth's son Mike Sennett, joined by his brother Chuck, issued a statement, saying it was a ""bittersweet day"". He said: ""Nothing happened here today that’s going to bring Mom back. It's kind of a bittersweet day. We're not going to be jumping around, around, hooting and hollering ""hooray"" and all that. That's not us. But we're glad this day is over.
""All three of the people involved in this case years ago, we have forgiven. Not today but we have in the past. Some people may not believe that, you know, how do you forgive somebody. Well, in an effort to be more Christ-like, try to live his teachings and stuff, it is my duty and it is a weight off my shoulders.
""I forgive him, I forgive him what he done, I don't like what he done but they are forgiven from us. The Bible says evil deeds have consequences — and Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions 35 years ago — and his debt was paid tonight.
""Some of you may have heard us talk about over and over about 35 years, 35 years. 35 years - Kenneth Smith, Parker, Williams - Williams not so much because he died in the system, but Parker and Smith have been incarcerated almost twice as long as I knew my mom. Elizabeth Dorlene Thorne Sennett got her justice tonight.""
Smith's initial conviction was overturned. He was convicted again following a re-trial in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge sentenced Smith to death. Following a rule change, Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury's sentencing decision in death penalty cases.
Smith is one of few people to survive a prior execution attempt. The state attempted a lethal injection on him in 2022, but the prison system called it off before the drugs were administered because the staff had difficulty connecting the two required intravenous lines.
Rev Hood said before tonight's gas execution: ""Kenny describes the initial botched execution like being up under a sewing machine — just consistently being poked over and over and over again. It’s horrific to think about."" He added: ""This is a group of people that just simply could not kill Kenny, who just bungled the whole thing, and he’s supposed to trust them to get it right this next time. That’s absurd, absolutely absurd."""

The 22 Kids and Counting star was seen arguing with boyfriend Jake in an upcoming episode of the hit Channel 5 series. She becomes frustrated that he wasn't pulling his weight as a dad to their one-year-old daughter Mila. The couple also appear to be struggling living at Jake's parents' home rather than having their own space.
Noel and Sue Radford are forced to step in when Chloe arrives following the heated clash. Chloe said: ""Whilst living with your parents you've not really got any real responsibilities, have you, because you're still kind of being looked after."" Things escalated between the couple as they planned Mila's first birthday party.
Jake argued he hadn't been asked to help organise anything. Chloe explained in the programme: ""It's more of a case of I ask if he would like to do something rather than him just doing it. See I don't know how much to say without it causing arguments. Things need to change.""
While Jake added: ""Well she says she wants help but at the same time she wants it done her way. She's hard to live with... she stresses out quite a bit."" Chloe was seen arriving to her parents house with Mila after the fight as she asks them for help. Sue said: ""We didn't really know that Chloe and Jake were unhappy. I guess you don't really ever know what's going on behind closed doors, do you?""
Chloe revealed her frustrations to her dad as she said: ""He does like go out with his friends and to the gym. I'm just like, well we're here all day, we're never seeing you, you've not got much time for Mila... You're really not really giving us any of your time. I'm just doing everything for Mila - cooking, cleaning, the washing. It should be that we are fifty-fifty on household responsibilities and with Mila. To me, that seems fair.""
Chloe ended up living with her famous parents for a month and eventually moved to a flat with Mila. She said: ""I've got to take control of mine and Mila's future now... At the same time, I am sad I could be facing life as a single mum."" Thankfully for the couple they managed to turn things around and got back together during the show.
Last year Chloe, Jake and Mila headed on one of the Radford's lavish holidays to Disney. However Chloe's sister Millie appeared upset at the holiday and accused her parents of leaving out her own children. Sue and Noel filmed themselves telling grandchildren Daisy, Ayprill and Leo that they were taking them on holiday. Millie is mum to Ophelia and Chester, who weren't involved.
Millie, 22, reposted the video on her Instagram, and wrote: ""Cute? But you've made money from all your grandchildren but choose your favourites...Said my piece, I recall my kids being in the whole 22 Kids and counting - not a single sight viewing of the rest in there.. bare 1 ep.""

7ILXJ8DXO8_S2IJDHXAZC6EHZP,BBC The Traitor's Mollie's love life and brave fight to live with terrifying diagnosis,Julia BanimAudience Writer,"19:00, 26 Jan 2024Updated10:26, 27 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bbc-traitors-mollies-love-life-31950463,"As the youngest member of The Traitors season two, it would be easy for some to underestimate Mollie Pearce - but the 21-year-old is far tougher than her young years might suggest.
A disability model with a passion for inclusive representation and body positivity, Bristol-based Mollie hopes to use her platform to raise awareness of living with a stoma bag, which she says helped give her her 'life back'.
As the beloved murder mystery reality show reaches its finale, we take a look at Mollie's life away from the castle, including her stylish modelling shoots, health struggles, and loving relationship with a very supportive boyfriend.
At the age of 11, Mollie was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, a chronic condition defined by inflammation of the lower end of a person's digestive system, including the large bowel and rectum. Later on, she underwent an ileostomy procedure to have her colon removed, and had to get used to a stoma bag removing her waste instead.
This was by no means an easy journey, and Mollie has previously revealed that she struggled to walk upstairs in her own home due to the pain of her condition. She's now expressed grattitude for the new lease of life her stoma bag has brought her, despite her initial fears over the procedure.
In one candid post shared via Instagram, Mollie wrote: ""This is a post I hoped I would never have to write. On the 30th of September, I went to the hospital for a checkup and ended up being admitted due to the severity of my symptoms. I didn’t think in a million years my biggest fear was about to come true. I have been fighting ulcerative colitis for 8 years and last week it finally won when I had to say goodbye to my colon forever. It is a major 7-hour operation which has scared me since being diagnosed.”
She continued: “It’s been the hardest week of my life but the love I have felt from my friends and family is something I will never forget. All I ask is that if you have any time please educate yourself on Crohn’s and colitis. It affects a huge amount of people and can be very hard to explain and understand. It’s going to take a lot of time and strength to adjust to my new life with a stoma bag. It’s important to remember beauty isn’t external and it’s about who you are and how you view things you. All our bodies are beautiful! Please share this and anything you know about IBD to spread as much awareness as possible about this vicious illness. Let’s get you educated! Thank you to everyone for all the love and support. Scars make us strong.”
Mollie was also born with a limb difference on her right hand, with several fingers missing. In one recent episode, Mollie opened up to the rest of the group about the importance of such differences being represented. She explained: ""So, when I was younger I walked into a shop and saw a model who had one arm and from that moment I just remember saying to my mum that the way she made me feel, I was like, 'I want that to be me for other people'.""
A health care assistant by day, kind-hearted Mollie has also built up an impressive second career as a model, and is currently signed with Zebedee, a talent agency which represents 'disabled, visibly different, non-binary, and trans UK models'. According to her online bio, Mollie has previously modelled for a number of high profile brands, including the likes of Tommy Hilfiger, Vogue, Kurt Geiger, and Adidas.
Mollie will also use her social media platform to showcase disability-friendly trends, including swimsuits and loungwear sets suitable for those with stoma bags.
Opening up to her fellow contestants during one episode, Mollie confessed that she had harboured doubts about ever having a relationship after getting her stoma bag, but has since found strength in her differences. Mollie shared: ""Obviously as an 18-year-old, getting told that you have to have a bag stuck to you for the rest of your life, you're thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm never going to be able to wear anything again, never going to be able to go swimming again, never get a boyfriend again.""
It would appear however that Mollie is happily loved-up with boyfriend Max, who she described as her 'bestest friend' in one touching Instagram post. The adoring couple have been together since at least July 2021, and appear to have a shared love of travel, often sharing holiday snaps from sunkissed destinations such as Greece, Lanzarote and Italy.
Showing encouragement for Mollie ahead of the first episode of Traitors season two, proud Max took to Instagram, writing: ""Super proud of everything you have achieved but I think this one tops it cannot wait for tonight.""

7R1AQMA2YR_Q4IMXDHTFL91HAH,"BBC The Traitors series 1 finalists lives now - podcast host, yacht boy and influencer",Julia BanimAudience Writer,"18:00, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-traitors-series-1-finalists-31976131,"It's fair to say The Traitors season two has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, but it all began of course with the show's iconic first season, which aired back in December 2022.
Season one culminated in a tense, and rather controversial twist, after Kieran stabbed fellow traitor Wilf in the back in the final hour, writing his name down as a 'parting gift' for faithfuls Meryl, Hannah, and Aaron. Up until this startling gear change, many had expected that Wilf - the Harry of his day - would bag the lot. Instead, the faithful trio ended up splitting the £101,050, having outfoxed the devious traitors with just a little bit of help.
As viewers eagerly await the conclusion of this year's undoubtedly tense finale, we take a look at the original fianlists are up to nowadays.
In an interview with Metro shortly after leaving the show, Kieran Tompsett, whose decision to out Wilf as a traitor divided the nation, spoke of his ambitions of entering the wold of acting, issuing a plea to EastEnders. Kieran said: ""A lot of people have said I give off EastEnders villain vibes, which I would love."" He added: ""I could see myself playing a baddie. I think it's down to my array of coats – I love them – and especially my trench in the finale. It wasn't intentional, it's just my favourite jacket, but now I realise I was channelling Columbo.""
During a recent appearance on Lorraine, ahead of the new season, Kieran reflected on the incredible year he's enjoyed since his iconic exit, sharing: ""I've had the best year ever. Even sitting here with you today is like a dream come true, so I'm extremely happy.""
Since the finale, Wilfred 'Wilf' Webster left his career in the charity sector after struggling to balance media requests with his day job. He has however opened up candidly about the difficulties of life of influencer, telling Vice: ""The thing with social media is it's always fluctuating. So it's never guaranteed income all the time. That's hard, especially with a family.""
Expressing his hopes for the future, Wilf, who also hosts a podcast with former cast mates Ivan and Ryan, added: ""I want to be a presenter eventually, like present a gameshow or something like that. I don't want to be Wilf from The Traitors, I want eventually for people to not remember where I came from.""
In a recent interview with Mirror video journalist Sam Teesdale, Wilf revealed that one person from season one had blocked him on social media after the show, and that they weren't on speaking terms. He shared: ""I've been saying all year, 'We're all best friends!'. It's not true. Some of us are really close. [...] There's only one person I don't speak to. I haven't spoken to them since we left the show because they blocked me on Instagram for some weird reason. ""But everyone else I speak to a lot. So Ivan and Ryan, Thomas, Tom a lot, Hannah, Meryl. There's quite a few of us who speak quite a bit, or, if we don't speak, when we do speak, we speak for hours because we're catching up. I'm really close with Faye. But yeah, there's, I just got sick. I said to my agent,' I'm sick of saying I get on with everyone. There's one person I don't get on with.""
Meryl Williams has had a busy year since season one wrapped up, and was even nominated for a BAFTA Scotland Audience Award in October. Sharing her delight at the nomination via Instagram, Meryl, 27, described it as a 'pinch me moment', and stated that she was 'forever grateful' for her time on The Traitors. She wrote: ""Never in a million years would I expect to be nominated for a [BAFTA Scotland] Audience Award. I am so beyond grateful for all the opportunities I have received. It is amazing how one year can completely change your life. Thank you for being on this journey with me & a special thanks to The Traitors for gifting me with these opportunities.""
Speaking with OK! magazine last year, Meryl revealed that she'd quit her job at H&M customer service after her Traitors victory to pursue a career in social media. Opening up about how she spent her winnings, Meryl continued: ""A lot of people were likem 'Are you gonna buy a handbag?' I was like, 'No.' because I think money is freedom at the end of the day. I never wanted to get anything designer - I'd rather just have the freedom to not have to go back to my normal day job.""
Victorious faithful Hannah Byczkowski has been busily sharing her thoughts on the second season in her Radio Times column, Hannah's Traitors Diary, pulling from her own lived experience, and signature wit. In a recent interview with the Mirror, the former social care worker opened up about how her £33,000 winnings changed her life and allowed her to pursue her passions.
Hannah, now 33, revealed: ""It has changed my life more than I think 30 grand could for a lot of other people. I had to quit my job before I went into the show, because they wouldn't let me go and film, so I had to start doing full-time comedy.""
Sharing how she'd spent the cash, Hannah added: ""I basically used it to finish off my house contract in London, get a car, pay bills for a few months and then when I moved back to Stoke, and then I'm back and forth from Stoke to London now. But yeah I basically used it to change my career.""
As well as comedy, Hannah has also explored her interest in the supernatural, and is the host of chart-topping podcast Ghost Huns, alongside fellow comedian Suzie Preece.
Popular contestant Aaron Evans dreamt of buying his mum a house when he bagged his share of the prize, as well as putting a bit away for travelling. The former estate agent has also now made an interesting career move, and now works on yachts.
Aaron, who is now 25, also recently shocked fans after making an appearance in a preview of the new series of Channel 4 dating show First Dates. In a recent video shared to his YouTube channel, Aaron revealed: ""I've gone on First Dates and I've also gone on Mastermind. However, I do not know when they're going to be posted. I believe that First Dates will be out soon, but I've not been told an exact date yet. So I'll keep you guys updated as of when.""

7R2WMRB3DH_A5GHJOTJ991JDQ5,EasyJet loses £40m due to Israel-Hamas conflict but says summer bookings are strong,Lawrence Matheson,"08:38, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/easyjet-loses-40m-due-israel-31953009,"EasyJet has managed to reduce its end of year losses, even though it took a £40m hit from the conflict between Hamas and Israel.
The airline reported a pre-tax loss of £126m for the last three months of 2023, which is less than the £133m loss it had during the same period in 2022. The number of passengers flying with EasyJet increased by 14% compared to the previous year.
However, the company expects a ""direct impact of £40 million"" in the six months leading up to March's end due to the war between Israel and Hamas. This is because flights to Israel and Jordan were paused, and there was less demand for trips to Egypt.
EasyJet's boss, Johan Lundgren, said: ""We delivered an improved performance in the quarter which is testament to the strength of demand for our brand and network.""
He also said that easyJet holidays are becoming more popular, with 48% more customers during this period. He added: ""We see positive booking momentum for summer 2024 with travel remaining a priority for consumers.""
He explained flight and holiday bookings have started strongly during the traditional busy turn of year sales period. Customers are securing their summer holidays to favourite destinations like Spain and Portugal, as well as further afield places like Greece and Turkey.
Lundgren concluded by saying: ""EasyJet remains focused on delivering for our customers in the coming months, while also expecting to deliver continuing performance gains."" The airline is super happy about how many tickets they sold since December 21. They've been selling tickets so fast, it's like filling two planes every minute!
People are loving flights to places like Amsterdam and Paris, but also to sunny spots like Alicante and Malaga. Some new hot destinations are getting popular too, like Skiathos in Greece, Calabria in Italy, and even Rovaniemi in Lapland. May is turning out to be a top month for flying because families are planning their trips for the school half-term break.
The airline has also made a big deal with CFM for engines to power lots of new planes they're getting. This means they can fly more people around and do it in a way that's better for the planet.
Mr Lundgren said: ""We are very pleased to have signed a deal with CFM, following a competitive selection process."" He also mentioned that this deal will help the environment and let easyJet keep being one of the best airlines at Europe's busiest airports. He added, ""EasyJet has a long history working with CFM and look forward to continuing to work in partnership in the years to come.""

7T7M6OHLZ6_S11S15IQK980YT0,BBC The Traitors faked scenes from 'nighttime murder hour' to secret first breakfast,Nia DaltonSpecialist Writer,"19:15, 26 Jan 2024Updated20:23, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-traitors-faked-scenes-nighttime-31977779,"The Traitors is the ultimate reality game of treachery - so it's no surprise there are some deceptive scenes in the hit BBC series.
The award-winning show comes to a dramatic close this evening as Traitors Harry Clark and Andrew Jenkins battle against the Faithfuls to take home the whopping prize pot. But as they are forced to lie to their fellow players in a bid to get their hands on the winnings, the bosses behind the show have also been tricking viewers sitting at home.
There is a lot of mystery surrounding the show's set-up - from where the cast sleeps at night to how many drinks they're allocated after the exhausting Round Table. Here, we take a look at some parts of the show where not all is as it seems on-screen...
The reality TV series - which is based on the Netherlands' De Verraders - is located at a castle in Scotland, with the contestants taking part in challenges on the estate too. The show is filmed at Ardross Castle, located just north of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. The 19th-century castle is set within more than 100 acres of parkland.
While nearly all of the filming takes place in and around the beautiful castle grounds, where the players sleep is far less glamorous. In the series, we see black Land Rovers pull up outside the castle at nighttime to escort them to their sleeping quarters, where they await their fate.
However it is never shown where they actually go. It turns out that contestants stay overnight in a hotel right next to the runway at Inverness Airport. Alan, who hosts the US version that is filmed in the same Scottish Highlands, revealed to the Daily Beast that players do not get to rest their heads within the walls of the castle.
""Spoiler alert: None of us stayed in the castle,"" he said. Alan continued: ""None of us. [The contestants] all stayed in the airport hotel in the Inverness Airport. How glamorous - you come to Scotland, and you stay in the Inverness airport hotel.""
Fans of the show were gobsmacked by the revelation and took to site X (formerly Twitter) to share their reactions. ""Omg, I always imagined they all stayed in individual little cottages on the castle estate somewhere - this is way less romantic than I thought,"" one person said.
Last year's contestant Maddy Smedley also revealed the contestants don't live in the castle, but travel around 30 minutes to their hotel accommodation. She said they are given ""a different driver each night"" to drive them there and back.
The buffet breakfast is a pivotal moment for every episode, with players nervously walking into the room to see who has survived the night. While some players tuck into the buffet, others seem too nervous to eat - or maybe they're just not hungry because they actually ate earlier.
Last year's star John McManus told The Sun they ""get breakfast served in our rooms in the hotel, before the on-screen breakfast!"" So, it's all part of the show.
John also lifted the lid on the way filming and eating works in the evening. While it might seem that the players get to relax the evening away, there is a strict rule when it comes to how much alcohol they can drink.
The Scottish spa therapist shared: ""When we come from the Round Table, we go into the bar and have a drink - we're allowed a maximum of two - and all that's real. There's security, your food's brought to your room, and the welfare team are brilliant, knocking on your door regularly to check you're okay, but there's none of this mixing or hanging about.""
We've seen Charlotte and Andrew take relaxing bubble baths, whilst Diane treated us to her regime of lunges - these are the peculiar filler scenes that are shown as the Traitors discuss who to kill off next. However it isn't of course live footage of the players awaiting their fate in their rooms.
They're filmed separately and are used to give viewers something interesting to consider as the Traitors plot their next moves from the castle turret. Season one finalist Wilf Webster was never asked to do one, indicating that only those who leave the show earlier on get the chance to have some shots made.
When asked by Mirror video journalist Sam Teesdale about whether he had the choice on what to do for the scenes, he said: ""I didn't do one. I don't know when they do them, maybe when they've been murdered or banished? I don't know.
""But I didn't actually film a cut-shot. I don't remember being asked to or being pulled out to do it."" Laughing, Wilf added: ""They did definitely have them in season one, they had Amos in the shower."" He then speculated: ""I'm not sure if when you get banished, they ask you to do a video for whatever. But I don't actually remember filming one.""
Last series' contestant John also revealed how the Faithfuls are not actually 'killed off' during the middle of the night, as the show makes out in it's 'murdering hour' when it's dark outside. Instead, it's the following morning. He said: ""Everybody goes to the castle at the same time in different jeeps and then you're all put into separate holding rooms. It's like a Big Brother diary room with the letter sat on the chair in front of you, and it just says, 'The Traitors have murdered you'.""
So this scene actually takes place just before the buffet breakfast, according to the player. The Traitors looks like a pretty intense, back-to-back filming schedule, but contestants do get some downtime in between the madness.
Last year's winner Meryl Williams told the Metro cameras are recording all day from Monday to Saturday but Sundays are filming-free. ""So when it came to Sunday, you literally slept the whole day,"" she said. ""Like I literally woke up at 12pm. I'd chill for a little bit and watch movies and stuff in the room. And then I literally went back to sleep at like 3pm and then I woke up again for dinner and then I went back to sleep."""
7UH8O6DV2E_RJNNAXBQG7MWIWK,All the secret signs Bobby Brazier and Ellie Leach have been dating that you might have missed,Daniel BirdAssistant Showbiz Editor,"11:49, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/secret-signs-bobby-brazier-ellie-31964204,"Strictly Come Dancing's Bobby Brazier and Ellie Leach's romance hasn't gone unnoticed.
Reports emerged claiming that the pair who met on the 2023 series of the BBC dancing competition had secretly been dating and have set tongues wagging on the tour bus. But there had been a series of clues that their relationship was more than just platonic before they hit the road.
Ellie, 22, and Bobby, 20, are said to be prepared to go public with their romance in the coming weeks but they have previously hinted they were in a relationship with a slew of snaps together.
Earlier this week, professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin took to Instagram to share a snap of his partner, Layton Williams, who was seen eating dinner with both Ellie and Bobby. In the post, EastEnders star Bobby can be seen wrapping his arm around the back of Ellie's chair as the trio smiled for the photograph.
Another snap which appears to have been taken on their tour bus saw the pair getting quite cosy with one another. In the picture, Ellie can be seen embracing the actor with her arm around his neck and resting on his chest. Bobby flashed a huge grin for the camera as he closed his eyes.
Ellie and Bobby allegedly first noticed a romantic spark after a performance in Birmingham, before they spent the night partying together. It was claimed that the pair had also enjoyed a secret trip to Nando's during a break on the Strictly tour in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. A source told The Sun: ""Their friendship has grown and grown, and they've been spending nearly all their free time together before and after performances. They've been having their meals together, and flirting increasingly openly.
""The chat on tour is they may have enjoyed a cheeky snog, and will go public with their romance any week now. They're both hugely popular characters and make a really cute couple. There are also endless commercial opportunities for them as a pair because they are both hugely in demand, with the world at their young feet. Everyone is very excited about this hot new pairing.""
The revelation comes just days after Ellie and her dancing partner Vito Coppola silenced speculation that they were romantically involved with one another after months of whispers. ""We have a great relationship and honestly when you just find people, not just me and Ellie but their family which I love,"" Vito told The Mirror. When asked for clarification, the duo confirmed they were just friends.

Buckingham Palace earlier announced that he would head to the hospital for a “corrective procedure” to treat the benign condition. Images released online shows the King being driven in London after he travelled from his royal residence in Sandringham on Thursday.
The Palace has since confirmed that he was admitted to a London hospital for treatment this morning. The statement read: ""The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment. His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.""
The King is said to be looking forward to getting back to work after he was forced to cancel several engagements as he prepares for the procedure this week.
In an earlier statement, the Palace said: ""In common with thousands of men each year, The King has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate. His Majesty's condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure. The King’s public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.”
Camilla briefly touched on her husband's health whilst she was out in Aberdeen, Scotland. Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeen Dr. David Cameron asked her: “How is His Majesty?"" She replied, ""he's fine, thank you very much. Looking forward to getting back to work.""
Should Prince Harry fly back to support the King after his surgery? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
Charles was diagnosed with the benign condition on January 17 while staying at Birkhall in Scotland, after going for a check-up because he was experiencing symptoms. He is understood to have wanted to share the news to encourage other men to get themselves checked. The King, who only acceded to the throne 16 months ago, was urged to rest by his doctors ahead of the corrective procedure.
The announcement of his surgery was released just after it was revealed that Kate Middleton was taken to hospital last week. The princess was admitted to the London Clinic on Tuesday ahead of her successful abdominal surgery.
The London Clinic was chosen to care for Kate this time, rather than King Edward VII’s Hospital, which is usually the go-to establishment for royal medical matters and where she was admitted in 2012.
A statement from the Palace read: “The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private.
""The Princess of Wales wishes to apologise to all those concerned for the fact that she has to postpone her upcoming engagements. She looks forward to reinstating as many as possible, as soon as possible.”"

The MoneySavingExpert.com founder shared the advice on pensions during a live caller phone-in on ITV This Morning earlier this week. One caller, introduced by presenters Sian Welby and co-host Dermot O'Leary, asked Martin how much money she should be paying into her pension.
Martin told the caller that the sooner they start paying money into their pension pots, the better. He then urged Brits to ""put a bit more"" money into their pensions when and where they can throughout their lives. He explained: ""What I will say is you need to put in 18.5% of your earnings, that's what your company puts in and what you put in.
""Now, nobody does that. So anybody listening, don't worry, it's fine, but the earlier you start, the better. Whenever you get a pay rise, let's say you got a pay rise, put a quarter of it into a pension before you get used to it. Try and push up your contributions where you can.""
Martin has shared this advice before and goes into further detail on his MSE website. On the website, the MSE team explain how you can work out what percentage of your salary you should be putting aside in your pension - with the ""basic"" advice being ""put in as much as possible, as early as possible"". However, the ""rule of thumb"" with pension contributions is to: Take your age when you started saving in a pension - and halve it.
The MSE team wrote: “There's a rule of thumb for what to contribute for a comfortable retirement. Take the age you start a pension and halve it. Then aim to put this % of your pre-tax salary into your pension each year until you retire.
""So someone starting aged 32 should contribute 16% of their salary for the rest of their working life. Don't worry, almost nobody reaches this amount, but the real takeaway is to start as early as possible with whatever you can, as you've longer for the gains to compound."""

Helene Sula, 37, had always wanted to live in the UK ever since she visited as a child and moved to Oxford in October 2023 with her husband, Michael, 36.
She was shocked at some of the cultural differences since moving here - such as slang words like ""cheers"" and ""cycle"". Helene says British people are ""genuine"" compared to Southern Americans, who she claims are ""a little bit fake"".
Helene, who is originally from Dallas, Texas, US, also finds our hard beds and ""lumpy pillows"" weird. Helene, a content creator and travel blogger, said: ""I had never heard of the word cheers before, now I say it every day. Culturally British people are some of my favourite people.
“The word I would use to describe them is joyful. There is genuine kindness here. Southerners are a little bit fake. The houses are so different to me. They are so different from the US, they are much smaller.
""The architecture can be frustrating here, just in the sense that it is older."" Helene moved to Germany in 2016 and has been travelling for the last five years before deciding to settle in Oxford late last year. Helene said: ""I wanted to live here and I knew it had its challenges.

""Europeans like to go to the US and Americans like to come to the UK. It feels like the grass is always greener, you want to see what you don't have."" Helene used to spend her summers in the UK as a child as her parents taught a study abroad programme.
But since settling in Oxford she has noticed vast cultural differences. Helene says loves the ""hearty"" food it very different from what is offered in the US. She is also astonished by the amount of different flavoured crisps and meal deals available in our supermarket - which don't exist in the US.
She said: ""The pies are my favourite dishes. The savoury pies, the steak and the kidney and leek. The number of different flavours of crisps is so fascinating - I had never heard of roast chicken flavoured crisps before or champagne and vinegar.""
Helene has also been baffled by condensation and had to buy a humidifier- something she never had to deal with in Texas. She said: ""The windows are so beautiful but we get condensation."" Helene was also shocked when hearing new words and phrases.
She said: ""We say 'bike' or 'I am going to go biking' and you all say 'cycle'. I never used to say the word cheers before, now I say it every day. ""You say candyfloss, we say cotton candy. We never say rubbish, we say garbage.""

Helene has also had to get used to the ""small"" houses and arrangement of the properties. She said: ""Old houses can come with their quirks. When you open the windows you have to open it in a certain way. You have to flush the toilet really fast, if you don't give it a bit of extra flare it won't flush properly.
""Most of the washing machines are in the kitchen, it is very different. If you want to wash your clothes, you won't necessarily host a dinner party. Our heater makes a noise, it is like a basilisk in the walls. The beds are as hard as rocks this is maybe something Fred Flintstone would prefer.""
Helene has also had to get used to smaller roads and the amount of people around. She said: ""In Oxford it feels so dense, yet there are still people everywhere. If you drive outside an hour in Dallas, you will see no one for miles.""
Helene loves the castles and architecture in the UK - and was a big reason she wanted to move. Helene has a blog and she has written a book called 'Two O'clock on a Tuesday At Trevi Fountain' about her experiences of moving abroad. Helene said: ""There is so much natural beauty. The castles, the history and the beautiful architecture, England really embodies it."""
7YDOYEIYMF_AVYEXDDKGVTQ22O,BBC The Traitors' Diane reveals 'intense' round table 'drama' viewers never see,Charlotte TuttonSenior TV Reporter,"14:34, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-traitors-diane-reveals-intense-31975369,"The Traitors' Diane revealed all on the ""intense"" build-up to the dramatic round tables.
The series icon joined her son and co-star Ross on Loose Women on Friday to discuss the series ahead of the finale on Friday night. Diane revealed secrets from filming, including what happens before the banishments and why they are so dramatic.
After co-star Charlotte told This Morning that the round tables actually last for hours and not the 10 or so minutes we see on screen, Diane also revealed what happens prior to the accusations at the table. It sounds pretty tense too, as Diane told the Loose Women panel how The Hunger Games music is played and the players are not allowed to talk for 10 minutes, before host Claudia Winkleman allows the round table to begin.
Diane revealed she was left shaking during one moment, as the nerves got too much. She explained: ""You look at the round table and you think, I can do that. Oh my God. They play the music from The Hunger Games which is The Hanging Tree, if you've ever heard that.
""Wow. You have 10 minutes of this, you're not allowed to talk. The cameras are just going up and down, ad you're getting ready to accuse somebody. We've got these big wine glasses in front of you, I couldn't even hold mine with one hand.
""It's really clever. We know this is drama, we know this is just fun and we loved it by the way, but that was intense, honestly."" It comes as their co-star Zack told This Morning he was ""used and discarded"" by the Traitors.
Zack was the last player of the series to be murdered on Thursday night ahead of Friday's finale. One more player, Jasmine, was eliminated in the round table after this, leaving three Faithfuls and two Traitors to battle it out in the final.
Speaking on This Morning on Friday, Zack addressed his exit at the hands of Traitors Harry and Andrew, with him asked about being so vocal on the show. Zack addressed the fact his outspoken nature and him sharing so many theories probably allowed him to remain on the show for so long, before brutally being dumped at the end.
Of this, Zack said he was ""used and discarded"" by Harry, as he shared his hopes for the Faithfuls to be victorious and win the prize money. Speaking to hosts Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond, he said: ""It was a little bit gutting but I underestimated Harry a little bit. He had me wrapped around his finger, he used me and then discarded me like a rag.""
On who he wants to win the series, he added: ""I'm out here praying for a Faithful win. I'd love to see Evie win, but I think Harry's got it in the bag. He’s so good at it isn’t he it hurts."" It comes as Jasmine told Lorraine host Christine Lampard how she too hoped for a Faithful win.
The Traitors series 2 concludes Friday at 9pm on BBC1 and BBC iPlayer. * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."

James ‘Jimmy’ Johnstone, 84, died when the Hyundai he was a passenger in collided with a tree on the A905 in Grangemouth, Fife, in Scotland. The accident happened at around 11.45pm on Sunday. Mr Johnstone was sat in the front seat and, despite the best efforts of paramedics, was pronounced dead at the scene. The other people in the car were not injured in the accident.
The road was closed while investigations were carried out and reopened around 6am on Monday, 22 January. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward as investigations into the tragedy continue. The crash came during Storm Isha's huge winds, which felled trees across the country over the last few days.

In a statement issued through Police Scotland, his family said: ""A much loved and well respected family man who left a lasting impression on all who had the privilege to have met him. Our hearts are broken as a family however take great comfort in knowing he has been reunited with his beloved wife Anne.”
Road Policing Inspector Andrew Thomson said: “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr Johnstone, and all those involved in the collision. We continue to offer them support as our enquiries progress.
“I’d be keen to speak to anyone who saw what happened or was on the A905 around 11.45pm on Sunday. I’d also request anyone with dashcam footage of Beancross Road around that time, please review your footage and bring anything of significance to our attention.” Anyone with information is asked to call 101, and quote reference 4198 of 21 January.
After the tragedy, a man from Grangemouth said of the tragedy: ""It is really sad, Grangemouth is a really small community, everyone knows everyone. When it happens so close to home it does have an impact on the community, people are gutted.""
It has been reported at least four other people were killed in the UK and Ireland during Storm Isha. A man, who is yet to be named, died after falling down a manhole in Bradford when safety barriers were destroyed by 80mph winds. The victim is believed to have suffered a fatal head injury after plunging into the exposed hole.
Elsewhere, a man in his 60s was killed when the car he was travelling in collided with a fallen tree in Limavady, Co Londonderry, on Sunday night. In Ireland, much loved father Jimmy Rowe was killed in Claremorris, County Mayo, and a woman in her 20s also perished in a separate road accident."

Kirsty Findlay, 40, and her husband Mark, 42, were on their way home from a trip to Amsterdam when their plane was battered by high winds. Images shared by the mum-of-one showed the plane shaking and rocking as it attempted to reach the runway at Glasgow airport at around 7pm on Sunday.
Kirsty, from Irvine, said the experience was so petrifying that Mark sat praying in his seat as passengers around them threw up in sick bags. “It felt like the wind was in control of the plane. We felt helpless. It was really frightening. There were people around screaming, crying and being sick. My husband was actually praying out loud,” she said.
Kirsty claimed the flight’s pilot said the storm’s conditions were the worst conditions he had ever experienced in all his years of flying and the landing was aborted before the plane was diverted to Manchester. ""We didn’t actually realise how many times the flight had circled around Glasgow in the air until we later saw it on the Flightradar app. It was crazy,"" she continued.
Kirsty and Mark had enjoyed a three day break in Amsterdam before their holiday ended in a nightmare. “We didn’t even expect our return flight to take off on Sunday because we were aware of the weather situation back home,"" she told the Daily Record. “Our nerves were shattered by the end of it all.”
The couple’s horror journey took place as multiple flights across Scotland struggled to land at their destinations due to high winds on Sunday night. Several routes had to be diverted or cancelled, causing significant disruption to passengers.
A Jet2 passenger also shared the nail-biting moment their flight from Alicante landed in Edinburgh during the storm. Images showed one of the plane’s wings shaking as the aircraft descended before eventually landing on the runway and coming to a halt.
The passenger wrote on TikTok: “Well done to captain David Livingston and crew on the Jet2 LS776 ALI-EDI getting us all home safely through Storm Isha. Landing in 110mph winds was not a good experience but we were clearly in safe hands. Get your hat out for a whip round.”
An easyJet flight from Edinburgh to Bristol was also diverted to Paris as several passengers were forced to sleep on the floor. It’s understood the flight circled Bristol for some time before the pilot was forced to abort.
Passenger Tom Shepard told how they landed in the French capital and had to wait on the tarmac for around three hours while staff debated whether it was worth returning to their original destination. The decision was then made to remain in Paris and dozens of people were reportedly forced to stay in the airport.
They were offered water and food but some, including elderly passengers, had to sleep on the floor. Tom, 39, said: “We thought the flight was going to be cancelled because flights to Cardiff and Southampton had been and they are pretty close to Bristol.
“We were circling Bristol Airport for some time and then the pilot said we were being diverted to Paris. We thought he was joking at first. We couldn’t believe there was no other airport in the UK that we could land at.”
An EasyJet spokesperson said: ""Storm Isha impacted all airlines' operations on Sunday 21 January unfortunately causing some diversions including flight EZY3174 from Amsterdam to Glasgow which diverted to Manchester and landed normally in line with procedures. As the weather was not set to improve, the flight was delayed overnight.
""We did all possible to minimise the impact of the disruption, providing hotel accommodation and meals for those who required them. The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority and while this was outside of our control, we would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused as a result of the weather."""

The couple met on day seven of season nine (2023) of the UK dating show when Jessie entered as a bombshell, having previously made the final of Australian Love Island in 2019. Jessie, 27, instantly hit it off with Will and they coupled up on day eight and became inseparable.
While friendships were made inside the villa, it's since become clear that people have gone their separate ways but Jessie says she will always say hello to her former co-stars and ""everything is good"".
Speaking exclusively to the Mirror from her home in Australia, the personal trainer said: ""We don't actually bump into many Islanders from our season, we bump into Islanders from other seasons. It's not very common we see Islanders from our season. Whenever I've seen them, everything is all good, I always stop to say hello to people.
""I do think perhaps that they are more in a friendship group, there's a few groups from my season, it's a bit divided. I've not taken sides, ever, I always say hello to everyone. I don't think Will and I are really included in the groups. But we're really happy with each other."" Although Jessie and Will hit the jackpot, Jessie admits she had no idea she would fall for somebody as hard as she did while in the villa.
""I really wanted it but I didn't think it would happen,"" she explained before adding: ""I don't believe that we're here where we are now, he's literally here in Australia with me!"" But Jessie says she was ""too young"" when she first appeared on Love Island Australia and she wasn't ""emotionally invested"" in who she left the competition with (Todd).
She said: ""I knew that if you found the right person in there, it's the perfect place to build a relationship because you're trapped with them for 24 hours a day. What better way there's no distractions, you can't go to work. You can't even go to the gym without each other.
""When I did go into Love Island for the second time, I did say 'I'm going to be really open' because if people go in with the right mind frame, you can feel it. I feel like the producers in ours were getting people who don't quite want the longevity of the relationship – it's not everyone that goes in for true love."" But Jessie says she understands people who choose to go on the show for the platform and not for love.
""It would be nice to see a few more Love Island couples!"" she said. Although some have been sceptical about Love Island: All Stars, Jessie says: ""I do think there's a lot of history between a lot of Islanders, crossing over at parties and then dating history, even like a friend of a friend.
""It's really interesting to see that put all into one place. It's going to be completely different."" She added: ""The Islanders are going to be a lot more stern and I think they're probably going to get a little more fed up with the environment, they've done it once in their life and it's intense.""
Although Jessie and Will are currently spending time in Australia with her family, she teased that the couple have exciting plans ahead of their return to the UK. ""We do really want to look to kind of invest in our YouTube channel and kind of level up, we're 50/50 between elevating our YouTube channel or having a podcast style, or into actually going down the avenue of a podcast.""

Haleon says that the sale to US firm, Suave Brands Company, will see them receive about £338 million and a small stake in Suave valued at round about £63 million. This money is set to be used to pay off debt, Haleon said. They explained this deal was a part of their ongoing plan to make their business operations simpler.
The company, separated from medical giant GSK in 2022, also has famous household brands like Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol for pain relief, and Centrum vitamins.
Brian McNamara, the CEO of Haleon, described the sale of ChapStick as a chance for Haleon to proactively manage its portfolio. He stated: ""While ChapStick is a great brand, much loved by consumers around the world, it is not a core focus for Haleon.""
He continued: ""Selling the brand allows us to simplify our business and pay down debt more quickly."" The ChapStick sale is expected to be completed later this year. ChapStick, first made in the US in the 1880s, had global sales of roughly £112 million in 2023.

8ELYCJ6KG6_FBKXCH8TSLCHB1L,'Monster' music teacher who urinated in boy's mouth can tutor under-16s when released,Kelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter,"11:48, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/monster-music-teacher-who-urinated-31964202,"A paedophile music tutor who sexually abused two young boys and even urinated in one of their mouths has been jailed after his victims waited 25 years for justice.
As Thomas Rodgers, who was 17 to 18 at the time of the attacks, was jailed for four years it came to light he would be allowed to continue teaching youngsters once he was released. Now 44, he appeared for sentencing at Snaresbrook Crown Court in a black suit, unbuttoned yellow shirt, and piano-themed scarf.
The musician, of Balmoral Close, Billericay, was convicted by unanimous verdict for one count of indecent assault on a male, and two counts of indecency with a child after a trial in December last year. The choirmaster, pianist, and flautist, who became a 'widely respected' community member in Essex since the offences, enjoyed support from a packed public gallery.
The court heard how, on at least four occasions, Rogers encouraged the youngest victim to touch his own genitals and urinated into the victim's mouth. Rogers abused the second victim by performing oral sex on the victim 'to show him what he wanted', then forced his penis into the boy's mouth and choked him, the court heard.
The 'severe' psychological impact of Rodgers' sickening offending was laid bare by moving statements from his victims, both originally from East London. One addressed Rogers in the dock, and said: ""I hope you are happy and proud of what a monster you are... I'm happy I'm a survivor, and I'm proud and hopeful no-one will have to go through what I have gone through with you again.""
They described decades of social anxiety, the pressure it put on their marriage, and the feeling they could not protect their own child. ""You robbed me of the innocence and joy of my youth and adulthood,"" they added. Another victim, who was between five and eight at the time, said they had tried to 'downplay' the abuse to themselves, and turned to drugs to soothe the 'shame and embarrassment' which left them questioning their own sexuality and how to interact with children.
""My earliest childhood memory is seared into my mind, being locked in a bathroom with Thomas Rodgers and being forced to perform unspeakable acts,"" the victim said. ""I recognise that justice is a positive step, but it's crucial to recognise the pain inflicted can never be undone.""
The eldest victim, who was between eight and 11 when he was abused, first made contact with Rogers in 2009 to ask him to hand himself in, at a time when Rogers was undergoing checks to work with children. Instead of admitting the abuse, Rogers met up with the victim in the hope he would stop contacting him, the court heard.
The victim made a statement about the abuse to police in 2011, but Judge Louise Kamill said, 'for some unfathomable reason it was not followed up'. Only after seeing a therapist did the victim then step forward again to report the abuse in 2019, leading to Rogers' arrest and eventual prosecution.
Had the offences been committed now, Rogers would have been convicted of rape of a child under 13, which carries a maximum sentence of life with a minimum of six years in prison. Instead, Judge Kamill was limited to the much lower maximums, in place in the 1990s, of two years for indecency with a child and four years for indecent assault.
After the offences, Rodgers studied music at Kingston University, then went on to teach in schools before becoming a private music tutor and musical director of the Hornchurch Can't Sing choir. Ahead of his sentence, a joint investigation by MyLondon and Romford Recorder revealed Rodgers continued to teach young children at his home while on bail.
Rodgers’ victims said the legal loophole, which means private tutors are not required by law to provide a DBS check or declare their convictions to parents, was 'disgusting' and it was 'traumatising' to know he still had access to children. In response, prosecutor Babatunde Alabi called for a sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) to force Rodgers to declare his offences.
""The reason the Crown is seeking one is because the defendant still has unfettered access to young children... He does not need to be DBS checked because, I understand, he is not a teacher, he is in the private profession... There's no complete ban on having communication with children, provided the parent or guardian of that child are aware of his conviction,"" Mr Alabi explained.
But defence counsel Claire Cooper claimed her client had already told parents about the offences and sentence date, after it was suggested by police officers a few days after his conviction. The police then followed up by emailing parents directly, causing some to withdraw their children, though, not all.
Ms Cooper described Rodgers as a 'widely respected' and 'upstanding' member of the community, who had been subject to cold calls and 'endless' press articles, as she urged Judge Kamill not to impose the terms of the SHPO. “All I ask on behalf of Mr Rodgers is that the court takes into account that these offences were from a quarter of a lifetime ago when he was a youth himself,"" she added.
Judge Kamill did not impose the SHPO, which means Rodgers can return to private tutoring when he is released. “Clearly it is desirable that anybody you teach in the future is over 16, or the parent or guardian is aware of your past,"" she said. “[The SHPO] is not, in my opinion, necessary, although I strongly advise that should you continue to teach, you should contact the parent of any child and make them aware.”
Jailing Rodgers for four years, she added: “In my view, the real punishment on you is the effect on your reputation and your personal and professional life.”"

Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces - each of the 12 zodiac signs' forecasts should hold something that speaks to you and resonates with a deeper, inner truth.
Today's daily horoscopes for each star sign can be found below. These daily forecasts have been compiled by astrologer Russell Grant, who has been reading star signs for more than 50 years.
From Aries through to Pisces, here's what today could bring for your horoscope - and what you can do to be prepared.
You’re almost at the point of giving up on a relationship when a friend or partner is unpredictable and difficult to understand. You’re tired of the way they keep changing their mind about joint plans. If they once again pull out of arrangements already made, turn around and walk away.
A youngster in the family needs to be reassured that failing a test or examination is not the end of the world. Encourage them to try again and to keep on trying until they get it right. There’s a lot you have to talk about during a business meeting when for various reasons, previous ones were postponed.
Whenever you come up with ideas that excite you a friend or workmate will try to burst your bubble. Receiving just a little support and encouragement from others would go a long way. It’s hard to feel confident about experimenting with something new when people seem to expect you to fail before you have even started.
Progress made within a highly skilled team will have positive long-term implications. Group activities will be rewarding but some people are relying on you too much when there are no other volunteers. They cannot complain when you decide to cut down on community and volunteer projects.
Stop underplaying your abilities and more progress will be made. Promote your past achievements when interviewing for a job or auditioning for a special role. You look good and sound good which makes this a great time for attending meetings. Wear something smart and sophisticated.
A partner’s success and happiness will rub off on you. They have something to celebrate and you will want to share this news with your family. Are you single and looking for love? Don’t give up on a possible new relationship because they aren’t your usual type. Give a potential admirer a chance to work their magic on you.
You don’t agree with a friend or workmate’s way of thinking. Even if you got on well in the past you are finding little to agree about now. Someone will try to persuade you out of following your instincts. Stand your ground and insist on continuing with your own plans even if it means going your own way.
Consider the cost and other implications before starting on a home improvement project. Once begun, this cannot be put back to the way it was. Will it be worth the time, expense and effort? Talk things through within the family before agreeing to these new suggestions.
Problems will be resolved very easily. Solutions will be found by letting your mind and imagination wander. A new friend or romantic partner is showing a possessive side to their nature. People who act as if they own you will soon discover you aren’t easily manipulated.
Someone you have been helping out, out of the kindness of your heart, is growing more demanding. You’re starting to get anxious about this commitment. A frank discussion followed by a brisk walk will help release your tension. There’s a lot of literature to read before making a business decision.
Increasing tension in the workplace makes you prefer to work at home. You wish there was more honesty in communications when some people say one thing to one person and something completely different to another. You’re growing bored with witnessing such insincerity.
Providing you both agree to work at it, a close relationship can be improved. You and a partner have been growing apart due to work and other outside responsibilities. If you are struggling to get some time to yourselves, the pair of you should sneak off somewhere quiet and private."
8HNROMUQQM_CQRCIY6HANQZQ2H,Woman began 'talking gibberish' and died after being prescribed toxic mix of medication,Imogen Clyde-Smith,"15:09, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-began-talking-gibberish-died-31976135,"A “kind” woman on a range of pills for mental and physical health problems died having taken a toxic mix of prescribed medication, an inquest heard.
Proceedings were told Kirsty Doyle, 46, was in a crash in 2001, which left her with mobility issues and chronic pain. She was prescribed strong painkillers and received her prescription on a weekly basis in organised pill trays. The inquest heard how her mental health was 'up and down' following the crash and deteriorated drastically until her death at home in October 2022.
South Manchester Coroners' Court heard she died from combined drug toxicity, relating to the medications she had been prescribed, against a 'background of fatty liver', the Manchester Evening News reported.
Her niece Leanne said: ""Kirsty was the most kind, caring, and lovable human being that would do anything for anyone. She's left the hugest hole in many people’s hearts and we miss her dearly."" During proceedings Leanne explained how her aunt “sometimes felt like a burden” because of the amount of support she needed, but said she needed help with her medication as she often forgot whether she'd taken it. She added that in the summer of 2022, her aunt began seeing and hearing things and was sectioned in July.
Psychiatric doctor Brian Sweeney told the inquest how while on the mental health ward, Ms Doyle denied she had plans to end her own life. She was discharged the following month, having been prescribed an antidepressant and antipsychotic. Dr Sweeney said Ms Doyle had a follow-up medication review, where no concerns were raised.
Ms Doyle's GP Dr Kate Jenkins said she had a review of the pregabalin medication she was taking when she was discharged from hospital in August 2022, but that she had not had a holistic review of her medication since that February. Dr Jenkins confirmed she was aware of all the medications Ms Doyle was taking when she was discharged from hospital.
She had been due to have a review of the care she was receiving the day she died. The night before her death, Leanne called her aunt but said she sounded “erratic, panicky and out of breath"". It was the last time they spoke. Leanne called the Trafford home based treatment team - which offers a 24-hour service - and told them she was concerned. She said she was told Ms Doyle had been assessed in the morning and was deemed to be okay. She insisted she was not told to take her auntie to A&E.
David Irwin, a mental health practitioner at the Trafford team, told the inquest the plan was to speak to Ms Doyle directly and make an assessment. The night team called her three times that evening, but the phone went to voicemail each time. Celeste Corrigan, the practitioner on duty that night, said that when she arrived for her shift, she was told Ms Doyle's niece had called earlier with concerns for her auntie's 'safety and welfare'. She said Leanne's concerns had been 'reduced to a phone call' to Ms Doyle, saying she was told she would not benefit from a hospital admission and that a phone call was the best way to manage her.
Ms Corrigan said she was told to call Ms Doyle if she did not ring back by the end of her shift. She said she called Ms Doyle at around 7.30am on the morning of October 14, but there was no answer, so she left a message. Later that morning, care worker Chris Shaw went to visit Ms Doyle and found her sitting on the end of her bed. He told the inquest Ms Doyle began 'talking gibberish' and he thought she was having a psychotic episode. He called an ambulance and began performing CPR, before paramedics arrived and took over. She died a short time later.
Pathologist Dr Joseph said Ms Doyle died of drug toxicity and that her death was contributed to by fatty liver. Coroner Christopher Morris concluded there was no evidence Ms Doyle intentionally took an overdose of prescribed medication with a view to ending her life or harming herself.
He said the evidence didn't confirm whether Ms Doyle inadvertently took an overdose, or whether she had taken her medication as directed and died as a consequence of 'complications arising from polypharmacy in the context of previously unidentified liver disease'. Mr Morris concluded Ms Doyle's death was an accident.
Following the inquest, Dr Arasu Kuppuswamy, chief medical director at the Greater Manchester Mental Health  NHS  Foundation Trust, which runs the Trafford Home Based Treatment Team, said: ""We express our sincere condolences to Kirsty's family and all who loved her at this sad time. We are very sorry for the shortcomings in the care and treatment we provided to Kirsty, identified in our internal review and at the coroner's inquest.
""Since the tragic incident, we have reviewed and improved our medicine management procedures, to ensure we are working with all our prescribing partners to safely manage the medications that are prescribed to our patients, including prescriptions for both mental and physical health and how these may interact. This has been underpinned by a series of staff training events.
""We have also improved the way in which we communicate with other health and social partners to provide a more joined-up support offer to our patients and have delivered a package of awareness training to our staff for providing best practice care for patients with a learning disability or autism."""

Rishi Sunak ruled out conscription after the head of the Army warned ordinary Brits may have to be called up because the regular armed forces aren't big enough. The Prime Minister's spokesman insisted that military service would remain voluntary.
Asked if Mr Sunak could rule out conscription, his spokesman said: ""There is no suggestion of that. The Government has no intention to follow through with that. The British military has a proud tradition of being a voluntary force. There are no plans to change that.""
The comments came after the head of the Army said Britain should ""train and equip"" a ""citizen army"" to ready the country for a potential land war. General Sir Patrick Sanders, the outgoing Chief of the General Staff (CGS), said even that would be ""not enough"" as he pointed to allies in eastern and northern Europe ""laying the foundations for national mobilisation"".
The military top brass suggested increasing Army numbers in preparation for a potential conflict would need to be a ""whole-of-nation undertaking"". He said: ""Within the next three years, it must be credible to talk of a British Army of 120,000, folding in our reserve and strategic reserve. But this is not enough. Our friends in eastern and northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilisation.
""As the chairman of the Nato military committee warned just last week, and as the Swedish government has done, preparing Sweden for entry to Nato, taking preparatory steps to enable placing our societies on a war footing when needed are now not merely desirable but essential.
""We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare - and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking. Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.""
It comes just days after a top NATO chief said civilians must be ready for an all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years. Admiral Rob Bauer said last week : ""It is the whole of society that will get involved whether we like it or not. That realisation, we didn't talk about that a year ago.""
The Dutch military chief said nations will need to mobilise civilians in case a global war breaks out - saying governments need to be ""war ready"". He went on: ""I'm not saying it is going wrong tomorrow. But we have to realise it's not a given that we are in peace. And that's why we have the plans.""
Gen Sir Patrick has previously voiced his concern about Russia, saying in 2022 that the UK is facing its ""1937 moment"". He said back then that the nation needs to be ready to ""fight and win"", stating: “This is our 1937 moment. We are not at war, but must act rapidly so that we aren’t drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion.”.
At the weekend, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps refused to say when a Tory pledge to raise defence spending will be met - despite saying the risk of war has increased. The Defence Secretary was challenged over whether the UK is ready for war, with defence spending below its target of 2.5% of GDP. Asked when the UK will meet the target, he told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: ""There is a trajectory upwards. I can't give you the exact date because we've always said it's as the economic conditions allow. But the point is we're working to a plan.""

A former chief of the general staff of the British Army warned this week the UK risks a repeat of the 1930s unless more is invested in its armed forces. General Lord Dannatt hit out at the shrinking size of the army, which he said has fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today ""and falling fast""
Writing in The Times, he drew parallels with the 1930s when the ""woeful"" state of the UK's armed forces failed to deter Hitler. ""There is a serious danger of history repeating itself,"" he said. Pointing to rising geopolitical uncertainty, he said: ""If our armed forces are not strong enough to deter future aggression from Moscow or Beijing it will not be a small war to contend with but a major one.""
Lord Dannatt said pay and conditions should be ""urgently reviewed"" and ""a pay rise to attract recruits and to retain current trained personnel should be a priority, as should addressing the appalling quality of some armed forces accommodation"".
Under Government proposals, the size of the regular army will be cut from a commitment of 82,000 troops to 73,000 by 2025. Mr Shapps  has said the size of the British Army will not dip below 73,000 under the Conservatives, disputing projections that it could eventually sink to 50,000."

While looking at Tarot cards for the year ahead, Inbaal Honigman has claimed that some negotiations ""don't go to plan"" as the Duchess of Sussex faces an ""obvious struggle"" this year. The astrologist said Meghan ""doesn't want to start an argument"" or be seen as ""hard work"". However, she might decide to stop collaborating with a certain brand after facing some problems.
Ms Honigman also said 2024 will not be ""an easy year"" emotionally for Meghan. This may mean that she will ""change her circle of friends"" to ensure she has ""more support"", the astrologer added.

Speaking on behalf of Slingo, Ms Honigman said: ""Some negotiations don't go to plan for Meghan this month, and she feels disappointed with being short-changed on a deal. She doesn't want to start an argument or be seen as hard work, but she won't be collaborating with that brand again.
""There's an obvious struggle for Meghan this year, as she tries to identify who she is. She isn't a working royal, not a current actor, at home in the UK or at home in the US – it's not an easy year emotionally and she'll therefore change her circle of friends so that she's surrounded with more support.""
The celebrity astrologer also claimed that Prince Harry is ""experiencing worry for the wellbeing of those around him"". She added that the Duke of Sussex's desire is to be financially independent and successful, adding: ""He spends 2024 coming up with directions and contacts which can get him there – and it all comes together beautifully before the end of the year.""
According to Ms Honigman, Prince William will spend this month tidying up the house and closets, and donating a lot of charity. She added that during the year, the Prince of Wales will ensure he is ""balancing his personal life and many commitments, ensuring that he doesn't suffer from burnout.""
The astrologer went on to say that the Princess of Wales will consider cutting some ties while ""stepping away from some organisations that she works with, which no longer feel aligned with her goals."" Ms Honigman said: ""Kate's nature means that she's busy even when she’s not busy, so this year she will find that spending time with friends or popping out to the shops whenever possible will provide a fun break from thinking too much.""
About the King, the astrologer believes Charles will go on a trip to support a charity that will ""require his presence in person"". Ms Honigman also said that Queen Camilla's February will be ""happy and fulfilled"", adding that she will ""spend the month receiving praise for her contributions to the wider society around her as she tries to channel her busy schedule and public lifestyle into a positive direction in 2024.""
This month, the Royal Family has been rocked by a series of health issues including Catherine's surgery last week, the King's enlarged prostate diagnosis as well as Sarah Ferguson's skin cancer diagnosis. Kensington Palace announced news of the princess’s surgery last Wednesday, with Buckingham Palace sparking a double royal health scare just 90 minutes later by revealing the King was preparing for treatment for an enlarged prostate. The King has also cancelled engagements ahead of his corrective procedure in hospital this week.
Meanwhile, Catherine was said to be ""doing well"" following her surgery last week, with William spending time at her bedside. She is not expected to return to official duties until after Easter. A royal source told The Sunday Times the Waleses have switched to ""100% family first, day job second"". Aides insist the princess will be out of sight over the next few months but is likely to be working behind the scenes.
""Her passion for the early years is clear – there will be a huge continuation of that campaign and she will be keen to be out continuing that conversation with the nation as soon as possible,"" the source told the newspaper. Kensington Palace has not revealed further details of the princess's condition but confirmed it was non-cancerous."

The 37-year-old TV and radio star delighted fans with her fresh take, 'bringing fun' to the ITV daytime programme. As the show's showbiz reporter, Sian has stepped in this week alongside Dermot O'Leary as the broadcaster continues to search for a replacement for Holly Willoughby.
She has been dubbed a 'rising star' at the network, sources say, with bosses wanting to give her a chance to see if she can step up. A source told MailOnline: ""Sian has many years of presenting experience under her belt, she is very much ear marked as being a star of the future.
""She has done really well already on This Morning so the bosses thought it was time to give her the reins to the whole show rather than just segments."" But what do we know about Sian's life away from the cameras?
Sian, from Nottingham, started presenting at 19. She starred in an advert for New! magazine and was spotted by Channel 5 boss Richard Desmond. Whilst working part-time as a shop assistant at New Look, Sian became the face of Channel 5 News.
She had been working in the store by day, and recorded videos in the fitting room after the shop closed. She went on to become the lead weather presenter and turned her hand to radio, where she has presented for Heart and Capital.
When it comes to her personal life, the presenter is loved-up with her radio producer fiancé Jake Beckett. The couple got engaged last summer, with her revealing the happy news to her Instagram followers.
Alongside a smiley photo of the two, with Sian showing off her diamond ring, she wrote: ""I thought we were just going on a boat trip!!. Genuinely didn't see this coming. For once I am totally speechless. I didn't think it mattered until he asked me, and then suddenly it meant everything. Love you Jakey x 15.8.23.""
The pair met at work as Jake works for Heart Breakfast as a creative producer, alongside celebrity hosts including Kelly Brook, Rochelle Humes, Vogue Williams and Emma Bunton. Both Sian and Jake have a close circle of celeb pals, and it was in fact Spice Girls' Emma and fellow presenter Amanda Holden who helped Sian's elderly dad 'cheat death'.
In May 2022, her father caught coronavirus while suffering from cancer, with him left fighting for his life. He took a downward spiral after suffering from sepsis and pneumonia in both lungs.
There was a chance he'd never come home, and lost more than six stone as he battled for his life across a seven-week stint in hospital. But Sian became a firm believer in positive thinking, and says her celebrity pals helped ""bring him back to life"".
Talking about sharing updates online, Sian said: ""A week after that post of me hugging him, and after 37,000 people liking and commenting on my story, I really believe in the power of positivity. He couldn't believe Emma Bunton and Amanda Holden sent him a message to get well soon!
""He asked me to print all the DMs out so he can look at them when I’m not there! It was honestly a miracle."" Sadly Sian knows all too well what it is like to have lost an immediate family member, having never been able to meet her sister.
Before Sian was born, her older sister tragically died of meningitis - inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. As a result, the presenter is an active supporter of several charities including Sick Children's Trust. Speaking to the Express, Sian explained: ""The Sick Children’s Trust is a wonderful charity. My older sister sadly died from meningitis before I was born, so it's a cause that’s close to my heart""."
8P5J8JJC68_12AQGVEDO4XK9QW,Simon Cowell ups his security as he leaves ITV Britain's Got Talent auditions after police scare,Zoe DelaneyAssistant Showbiz Editor,"15:18, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/simon-cowell-ups-security-leaves-31966431,"Filming for the new series of Britain's Got Talent took an unexpected turn on Wednesday, as someone sadly experiencing a mental health crisis outside the venue auditions were taking place.
Metropolitan Police confirmed that a woman had been distressed nearby The London Palladium, with a Britain's Got Talent insider telling the Mirror that ITV security assisted the force and helped ensure the woman was safe until a family member arrived.
Despite police stating no offences were committed - and a Britain's Got Talent source revealing no-one entered the Palladium or threatened the judges - it seems head judge Simon Cowell is living by the motto ""better safe than sorry"", with the music mogul upping his security on Thursday.
The X Factor creator, 64, has good reason to be cautious when it comes to his security, following a plot to rob the dad-of-one's London home being foiled last year - leaving Simon in ""total shock"" and ""disgusted"" after discovering someone had developed software in a bid to steal from the homes of the rich and famous.
""The fact that it is possible for a person to obtain the software code to sell to someone so they could rob the house my family lives in is disgusting,"" Simon told The Sun in July, as it was reported that he's spent more than £500,000 on securing his home following the scare. He went on to add: ""To even consider doing this is dangerous and reckless. People who attempt to enter other people’s homes couldn’t care less of the consequences and how people living in these houses could have been affected.""
Leaving The London Palladium with his fiancée Lauren Silverman on Thursday afternoon, Simon was joined by a bulky security guard as filming concluding for the second day of 2024 Britain's Got Talent auditions - just hours on from Wednesday's security scare.
Simon was among the first to arrive at The London Palladium for auditions on Wednesday, ahead of fellow judges Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, Bruno Tonioli and hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. However, as hopefuls tried to impress the judges, police were called to help a distressed woman outside the venue.
A Britain's Got Talent insider told the Mirror on Wednesday: ""Police were dealing with an individual outside of the Palladium who was causing a bit of a stir, and the BGT team helped out. But BGT didn't call the police and there was no threat to the judges as they didn't get inside the Palladium.""
The Metropolitan Police also confirmed the incident, with a spokesperson issuing a statement which read: ""Police were called at 13:23hrs on Wednesday, 24 January, to reports of a woman suffering a mental health crisis at Argyll Street, W1. Officers and London Ambulance Service attended. The woman was assisted by officers who made arrangements for her to be met by a family member. There were no offences.""

Avoiding a vote in Parliament and not even notifying Opposition leader Keir Starmer shows how gung-ho Rishi Sunak is becoming. This Red Sea conflict he seems to be getting us sucked into could turn out to be as unpredictable as previous wars in the region. Nobody should pretend there’s an easy way to stop the Iran-backed Houthis launching missiles and drones at shipping. But those advocating military action need to put forward a clear strategy for how this confrontation can be brought to an end. The Middle East requires ceasefires and peace deals – not more wars.
Keir Starmer’s accusation that the Conservative Government failed a generation by leaving knives on Britain’s streets is a charge with the ring of truth to it. The terrible toll of people killed by blades – last year a heartbreaking 247 – is more than a shocking statistic. Each one of that total is a lost life and a grieving family. The number has quadrupled since the Tories came to power in 2010, a chilling and dismal record. Five Tory Home Secretaries in eight years promising but failing to deliver a ban on zombie knives and machetes proves that spin was always more important than action. We welcome Starmer’s vow that Labour would consider outlawing a wider range of weapons, possibly including swords.
At least snubbed director Greta Gerwig and the film’s lead Margot Robbie can console themselves with the fact that if there was an Oscar for the most fun film of the year, Barbie would sweep the board."

Sofia is best known for her role as Gloria on Modern Family, which aired for 11 season starting in 2009. Now, fans will be seeing her in a much more serious role on Netflix's new series, Griselda, premiering on Thursday, January 25. Griselda is based on a true story of a single mother of four, who was a cartel leader in Colombia. The show includes stars like Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez, Karol G, Vanessa Ferlito and Carolina Giraldo Navarro.
Griselda's son, Michael Corleone Blanco, 45, expressed his anger and disappointment to the Daily Mail about the way Sofia portrayed his mother. He did not like like the way Sofia transformed into Griselda, as she used facial prosthetics to look like her. In an interview on Good Morning America, Sofia revealed spending three hours in the makeup chair just for the prosthetics, which included a wig, teeth, things to cover her eyebrows and more.

He did not like like the way Sofia transformed into Griselda, as she used facial prosthetics to look like her. In an interview on Good Morning America, Sofia revealed spending three hours in the makeup chair just for the prosthetics, which included a wig, teeth, things to cover her eyebrows and more.
He told the Daily Mail: ""My mother was a beautiful woman and it's crazy that a lot of people say 'No, you've got to look more like a drug addict' The fact that they call her 'ugly' that really offends me.""
He also said that he did not like the fact that the team refused his offer to consult on the project. He shared his frustration on people basing who Griselda was due to her mugshots and pictures that were taken after spending time in prison. He said: ""People see the mug shots and just go from that,' he continued. 'But when you read my book, you'll see that my mother was called the porcelain doll in her youth.""

He continued: ""Mayors, governors and politicians in different countries would try to court my mother...even here in the United States. She was the crème de la crème."" Michael also said his mother was a ""celebrity"" during her time in the Medellín Cartel.
Griselda is produced by Eric Newman and Andrés Baiz, the creators of the popular crime series Narcos and Narcos: Mexico. Sofia is also executive producer of the show. Michael opening up about his thoughts on the shows comes a week after it was claimed that Sofia was being taken to court by the family of Griselda Blanco over the show. The show, set in the 70s and 80s, has reportedly caused a lot of controversy with real-life Griselda's family."
8TCIALKHVS_OWZ0DX841GKW68B,Moment Russian plane with 63 onboard explodes into massive fireball on border of Ukraine,Will StewartRussia Correspondent,"09:55, 24 Jan 2024Updated11:26, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-moment-russian-plane-63-31953907,"This is the moment a Russian military Il-76 aircraft crashed in a ball of fire in Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine, today.
The cause of the crash and explosion is so far unconfirmed. The Russian Defense Ministry has now confirmed that it was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six crew, and three escorts on board Il-76 military aircraft that crashed in Korochansky district, Belgorod Oblast.
‌A video shows the plane out of control and lurching towards the ground, then a huge fireball as it crashed. Some reports suggested it was on fire as it came down, but the cause remains unclear.
Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov confirmed an incident without giving full details. “Currently, an investigation team and employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are working on the spot,” he said. “I have changed my work schedule and gone to the area. All details later.”
Starsche Eddypro-war Telegram channel said: “Judging by the video, the Il-76 military transport aircraft was on fire before the fall. Fire is visible in the area of the left engine.”
There were preliminary 63 people on board the crashed Il-76 near Belgorod. Their fate is being determined.. Earlier there had been a missile threat in Belgorod region and claims Russian air defences shot down an aircraft-style drone flown from Ukraine.
Russian media outlets cited the Russian Defence Ministry claiming there were 65 captured Ukrainian prisoners of war on the stricken Il-76 military transport aircraft. They were due to be exchanged.
A statement said: “The Il-76 crashed at about 11.00 [local time] in the Belgorod region. On board the fallen Il-76 there were 65 captured military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces transported to the Belgorod region for exchange, six aircraft crew members and three accompanying persons.
The statement - which was run by the Ministry’s own channel Zvezda - means it is a monumental tragedy for Ukraine.
A Russian Telegram channel alleged the Il-76 was shot down, implying it was by the Ukrainians. “The crew [of the plane flying next to the fallen Il-76] reports a missile hitting the [Il-76].”
An audio recording purportedly suggested the plane was hit by a missile. The same channel said: “Ukrainian sources celebrate the crash and say it was their missile that hit it.”
Rybar pro-war channel said: “So far, there are two versions of the downing of the IL-76 near Belgorod - either a shooting down or a technical malfunction. Given the fact that yesterday two IRIS-T SAMs, which Ukrainian formations had dragged to the border near Suzha, were shot down, technical malfunction is hardly believable. The AFU [Ukrainian army] began saturating the border region with surface-to-air missile systems from the beginning of the year. There were 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board, who were being prepared to be exchanged today as part of the planned exchange with the Ukrainian side. The exchange was delayed and sabotaged by the Ukrainian side for quite a long time. A total of 192 people were to be exchanged.

BBC Lancashire host Graham Liver, 47, cheekily called one of his listeners 'a b*tch' on Tuesday morning, thanks to the miffed complainer feeling the need to contact the studio to request Graham stops being ""so camp"". Graham, who tied the knot with his partner David in 2022, handled the criticism in style live on air - sharing the disgruntled message with his listeners and delivering his now iconic reply.
""You're getting boring, your producer can't think of anything fresh,""' Graham started, quoting the message. ""Also, the guy from Chorley isn't the first person from Lancashire to go on The Apprentice, a guy called Adam went on it in the late 90s,"" he continued.
""You need to do more research rather than talking about what you've been up to at the weekend, or what you're doing in the next few days. Rant over. Thanks. Stop being so camp,"" the message finished, with Graham pausing before giving his reaction. ""Ooo. You bitch,"" Graham retorted, causing laughter to break out in the background. Trying to carry on, he said: ""I don't know what you mean... What a, what a..."" but couldn't finish due to laughing at the absurdity of the situation.
A clip of Graham's retort quickly found its way onto social media - where Twitter (X) users were quick to point out that The Apprentice actually started in 2005, much later than the critical listener suggested. Adam Corbally - The Apprentice contestant from the fuming listener’s imagined series of the 1990s - even joined in and commented on the clip.
""Love this although I was on in 2012! And I’m from Derbyshire not Lancashire!"" Adam declared, completely shutting down the caller's claims. Host Graham even posted a clip to his own Twitter page, captioning it: ""Good morning [manicure emoji and love heart emojis].""
""Legend to be honest I’ve always found you quite Butch xxx,"" one of Graham's followers told the radio star in reply, with another adding: ""Good grief!! Why on earth do they bother to listen then? If they don't want authentic humour mixed with current local and national news then they need to turn that dial. I, for one, am looking forward to you waking me up tomorrow at 6am with THE best breakfast show around.""
""As a fellow radio presenter, is it now fair game to say the B word now it's been said on the BBC? This made my morning! Haha,"" another asked Graham. According to BBC rules, bad language is only allowed on air if it's ""editorially justified"".
Returning to Twitter on Thursday morning, Graham poked fun at the situation once again as he shared a snap of himself in the BBC studios ready to host his breakfast show. ""[Trumpet emoji] Good morning Campers, @BBCLancashire breakfast on now"" Graham told his followers, a nod to Wednesday's angry caller's request for him to stop being ""so camp"".

915ZNQ6EOG_2A2DV5WKQ3V02E2,Why did David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst 'fall out'? Only Fools and Horses 'row' to current status,Saffron OtterAssistant Features Editor,"12:20, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/david-jason-nicholas-lyndhurst-fall-31954174,"Sir David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst became household names thanks to their characters in the classic British sitcom Only Fools And Horses, but rumours of infighting often flew.
Ever since the hit BBC show launched in 1981, the pair became synonymous - with David starring as the iconic Derek Edward Trotter, better known as Del Boy, while Nicholas portrayed his ill-fated younger brother Rodney. When it sadly came to a close in 2003, fans eagerly awaited a reunion.
The Trotter family finally came together again for a one-off charity special in 2014 but ever since, things have gone quiet, with the pair of actors losing touch. Rumours swirled that relationships off-camera weren't as they seemed, with a reported feud between 83-year-old Sir David, who was knighted in 2005 for his services to acting, and 62-year-old Nicholas.
Sir David, who went on to star in leading roles such as Detective Jack Frost in A Touch Of Frost, revealed the two had a spat in the early days - but it was all for show. Speaking in 1989, David recalled: ""One day, Nick and I were in our very small caravan on location. We were all fed up because nothing was happening so [we] said 'why don't we stage a huge row and you can storm out and say you're leaving and I can shout at you saying don't you ever come back again'.""
He continued: ""I never want to work with you'. The whole crew went stiff. Five minutes went by and the producer and director came to see me and they were quaking in their boots. They asked what's going on and I told them to go see Nick. When they got to him, I couldn't contain myself any longer and roared with laughter. They went from white to purple in their faces. I don't think the producer was much impressed.""
During a documentary about the making of the show, David revealed his true thoughts about his co-star, expressing: ""You couldn't have had a better co-partner than Nic. We liked and respected each other so much, we were genuinely good friends.""
However, more recently, the Del Boy star admitted to a relationship breakdown, with them no longer seeing each other much. Understandably, Nicholas has been largely out of the spotlight since his 20-year-old son suddenly died in 2020. Archie tragically suffered a brain haemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
Speaking about their friendship, in 2022 David said: ""He's much more, how can I say, self-contained, perhaps, than he used to be.
""So, unfortunately, we don't see each other as much as I would like to. But that's how things work out sometimes.""
Touching on their heyday, Sir David reflected: ""I miss it terribly. It wasn't like going to work. It was going to have some fun with your mates. We loved each other.""
He has said that during their very first read-through, the cast knew immediately ""there was magic in the room"". The show went on to win six BAFTAs, with two going to Sir David for his portrayal of Del Boy, and 18.8 million viewers tuned in to one episode in 1986. That year, the cast appeared at the Royal Variety Performance, in front of the Queen Mother."

The body of Kanticha Noon, 36, was discovered at a property, along with that of her sister's husband, Bartlomiej Kuczynski, and his two daughters, seven-year-old Downreuang and Jasmin, 12. Police admitted ignoring a 999 call in connection with the deaths and now Norfolk Constabulary has referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC). It's also looking at previous contact at the address in Costessey, Norfolk, on 14 December which was in relation to a missing person enquiry.
The force's Chief Constable Paul Sanford said: ""Following the identification of the earlier 999 call, the constabulary referred itself to the IOPC who will now investigate. It is because of this process that I choose my words carefully; not because I don’t want to be open and honest, but because I have a duty to protect the integrity of any investigation that needs to follow. It will be for this investigation to identify and consider the circumstances and to consider if there were any issues with the response.""
Kanticha, the Mirror told, was on a trip from Thailand to visit her sister's family, and there were ""no warning signs"" beforehand. Her best friend Naty Wathanakul said: ""I wasn't expecting that my friend wouldn't be able to come back alive. She was just a petite woman, i cant believe this happened to her. It was too cruel to handle, I was crying.""
But now questions are being levelled at police after it confirmed a 999 call was made to the force from the man inside the address just before 6am on Friday and officers were not deployed.
Mr Sanford said: ""This is a tragic and horrific incident and my thoughts, and that of the entire constabulary, remain with the family of those involved. I’m aware this incident has also caused great upset and shock in Costessey, the wider community and beyond.
“I know the family and the public will rightly want to know whether there was an ability to prevent this tragedy, and this is a question that must be answered. However, at this stage, I cannot answer that question. What I can say is that we will be open and honest in the days, weeks, and months ahead, to get the answers to this question.
“There will, of course, also be an inquest that will review the wider circumstances a surrounding the death and the involvement of the police and other agencies. We have thousands of interactions with the public every single day, on the phone and in person. It’s only right that when there are questions about our response, they are properly investigated, and I fully support and welcome this scrutiny.
“I will not wait for the outcome of this investigation to review our working practices and that process has started. Furthermore, the constabulary is currently undergoing a routine inspection by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. That inspection includes an assessment of our response to 999 calls.
""Today, I have asked the Inspectorate to consider undertaking a deeper review than the robust inspection already planned, to provide the reassurance that the public and I need in our response to emergency calls."""

Industry regulator Ofcom will also be told to produce an annual report looking at the impact the Corporation is having. The instructions are contained in the Government’s mid-term review of the BBC ’s Charter - its contract with Government which is underpinned by the licence fee, paid by every household in the UK. The mid-term review also gives media regulator Ofcom greater powers to scrutinise the BBC’s online services.
They have attracted strong criticism from publishers after the BBC began dismantling its local radio services so it could boost its local news online, directly competing with existing local news websites.
Across the UK, the BBC has scrapped dedicated local programming on local radio stations after 2pm on weekdays and throughout most of the weekend, instead hiring more local journalists to write stories for the BBC News website, often writing articles already being produced by existing local publishers. Publishers say the BBC’s licence fee model, which enables it to publish stories without adverts gives it an unfair advantage which could drive historic local titles out of business.
Owen Meredith, News Media Association chief executive, said: “The government’s recommendation that the BBC strengthen its transparency and engagement with commercial media providers is welcome and makes clear the BBC needs to change its current approach, particularly in the local news marketplace, to support rather than compete with commercial providers.”
The BBC dismissed the concerns in a statement on its website, pointing to its funding of 165 Local Democracy Reporters through the Local News Partnership with publishers."

Here's how to watch series starring Sofia Vergara,Chiara FiorilloNews Reporter,"00:09, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/griselda-premiere-netflix-heres-how-31961044,"""La Jefa has arrived."" This is how Netflix is introducing its brand new series starring Sofia Vergara as Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco.
The series, called Griselda, follows the exploits of the ambitious woman who created one of the most profitable cartels in history. Stars include Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez, Vanessa Ferlito and Carolina Giraldo Navarro.
Griselda is produced by Eric Newman and Andrés Baiz, the creators of the popular crime series Narcos and Narcos: Mexico. Vergara, who is renowned for her roles in Modern Family and America's Got Talent, is also executive producer of the show.

With six hour-long episodes, the series premieres on Netflix tomorrow, January 25. Newman told Tudum: ""From the earliest days of my research for what became Narcos, [Griselda] leapt out at me as a fascinating character. I have always endeavoured to humanise complicated people, many of whom have been considered evil, and Griselda offered both the greatest challenge and opportunity.""
He added: ""There has never been a woman who came close to achieving the power, wealth, and respect that Griselda did. And no trafficker, woman or man, ever elicited the same level of fear. Griselda is a rise-and-fall story like none we have ever seen before. It’s thrilling, emotional, funny, scary, and tragic. Griselda is an antihero of the highest order and a series of contradictions at odds with herself.""
Explaining why Sofia was chosen for the role, which is different from any other she has played before, Newman said the actress is ""a force of nature"". Also, like Griselda, she is ""a single mother who came to America from Colombia with nothing and built an empire."" The trailer and publicity images for the series show Sofia looking practically unrecognisable thanks to the wigs and make-up she wore during filming.
Last week, it was claimed that Vergara is being taken to court by the family of Griselda Blanco over her new upcoming series on Netflix. The show, set in the 70s and 80s, has reportedly caused uproar with real-life Griselda's family.
According to TMZ, she was assassinated in 2012 and now her children, acting as representatives of her estate, claim Sofia's portrayal of their mother is ""unauthorised"". The family is suing the actress and Netflix for the use of Griselda's image and likeness in the series.
According to court documents seen by the outlet, real-life Griselda's kids were trying to ""prevent the release"" of the show. Griselda's son, Michael, says he has been doing interviews for years about a possible show about his mother, reported TMZ. Michael claims he has been doing interviews since 2009, with the possibility of the story also becoming a book.
TMZ says Michael's story was set to be ""shopped around Hollywood"" in 2016, but went nowhere. He alleges his interviews were pitched to Netflix, but after they showed interest, they reportedly did not want to use any of his details. TMZ states that Michael ""claims he's learned this new 'Griselda' show does, in fact, lean on a lot of his anecdotes and material ... but he says he never saw a dime"", resulting in a lawsuit by him and his siblings, alleging Netflix ""ripped off their family story""."

Buckingham Palace announced that last week Kate had successful abdominal surgery, and is expected to stay in the London Clinic for up to two weeks while she recovers.
Giving a glowing review of his time there, Asad Ashraf, a former patient at the hospital in Marylebone, said: ""I stayed in the hospital where Kate is being treated - it's five-star luxury like the Ritz"" He compared his stay to that of a luxurious hotel, with plush bedding, gourmet food and silver service.
He was even smoked salmon sandwiches whilst a patient at the clinic. Asad, who is retired, described his experience as ""luxurious"" and fit for royalty. ""My stay was incredible,"" he said. ""Even if you're only there for a day, they really treat you fantastically. I had no complaints at all and I shouldn't imagine Kate would either - but then, she's probably used to staying in places like that!""
He chose the hospital for a planned abdominal procedure because he wanted treatment from a specific specialist working there. Asad was discharged the next day and described his treatment as ""an overall smooth experience"". While he was there, he saw people cater to his every need. ""The room was well-kitted and air-conditioned with an extra fan. It had a big TV with all Sky channels,"" he said. ""The furniture was posh, made from real birch, and mahogany, and it had leather chairs.""
""The bathroom had high-quality toiletries and Egyptian cotton towels. The ceiling even had stars on like the night sky. I drank a pot of tea from a China cup and saucer with posh biscuits too.""
Asad recalled being offered fancy dishes like salt and pepper squid, steamed ginger sea bass, wild mushroom risotto and truffle fries. He said: ""There was a concierge and food was available round the clock at a price for guests. I didn't want much food after my surgery, but if you're there for a long period of time like Kate, it would be very nice.""

The mum, identified as 39-year-old Alexandra, left her son behind from 2020 to 2022 while she moved in with her partner who lived about five kilometers away—reports say she would visit on occasion. The boy was forced to live alone with no heat or electricity, surviving off cake, canned goods and some stolen tomatoes.
The horrid living conditions did little to impede his academics as the boy still attended school and earned good grades. Mayor of Nersac Barbara Couturier sounded the alarm to authorities once she discovered the boy was living alone. Barbara grew suspicious when Alexandra asked social services to help her buy food.
READ MORE: 'Our missing son returned home after three years - but it was actually a French conman'
However, it was the specific kind of food the mom selected that prompted the Mayor to step in. She chose canned good over food vouchers, which was very strange to Barbara.
“I met his mom in May 2022,” Mayor Barbara Couturier said. “She came to tell us that she had financial problems, and we gave her four vouchers for food, but she took some processed food products instead so that got me suspicious. Some residents told me that there was a child living alone, so I connected the two things and I called the local police and the national police.”
Local media outlets said 12 months of Alexandra's sentence was suspended and she will spend the last six months under house arrest. Meanwhile, her son has been taken into the custody of social services. The younger's impressive ability to care for himself at nine years old greatly helped with keeping authorities in the dark.
According to a classmate, the boy told his friends that he dined alone and rode the bus alone, adding that he didn't go out at all and preferred staying home. At trial, the presiding judge scoffed at Alexandria's defence, which claimed the mother did in fact live in the flat with her son.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
The assertion was quashed by neighbour accounts and mobile data obtained by local police, proving the opposite of Alexandria's words. Her neighbours admitted the guilt they felt at not acting sooner to stop the neglect. They told local media the privacy of modern-day life helped keep the mother's actions in the dark for so long.
""When there was a family and a village around the family, if the mother neglected the child, it didn't matter too much, because the rest of the family and the whole village took care of the child. It's not like that any more,"" a local resident said."

The former US president was seen raising his fist and greeting people who gathered on Fifth Avenue in New York City this morning. He could testify in court as soon as today in the defamation trial over his 2019 comments branding Carroll a liar who faked a sexual attack to sell a memoir. Because a different jury found last year that Trump sexually abused Carroll, US District Judge Judge Lewis A. Kaplan has ruled that if the former president takes the stand now, he will not be allowed to say she concocted her allegation or that she was motivated by financial or political considerations.
While Carroll testified last week, he complained to his lawyers about a “witch hunt” and a “con job” loudly enough so that the judge threatened to throw Trump out of the courtroom if he kept it up. Trump piped down and stayed in court, then held a news conference where he deplored the “nasty judge.”

“It’s a disgrace, frankly, what’s happening,” Trump told reporters, repeating his claim that Carroll's allegation was “a made-up, fabricated story."" In Carroll's case, her lawyers have implored the judge to make Trump swear, before any testimony, that he understands and accepts the court’s restrictions on what he can say.
“There are any number of reasons why Mr. Trump might perceive a personal or political benefit from intentionally turning this trial into a circus,” attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote in a letter to the judge, who is no relation. Trump is contending with four criminal cases as well as the civil fraud case and Carroll's lawsuit as the presidential primary season gets into gear.

“I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied, and he shattered my reputation,” Carroll, a former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist, told jurors and Trump while he was still in court. Trump doesn’t have to attend or give testimony in the civil case.
He stayed away last year from the prior trial, where a different jury awarded Carroll $5million (£3.9million) after deciding that Trump sexually abused her in 1996 and made defamatory comments about her in 2022. Trump is appealing that verdict.
Trump lawyer Alina Habba told the court in a letter that he might take the stand because, even with the judge's restrictions, “he can still offer considerable testimony in his defence”. Among other things, he can testify about his state of mind when he made the statements that got him sued and about how his comments came as Carroll was doing media interviews and journalists were asking him about her, Habba wrote.
She also suggested he could “show his lack of ill will or spite” by talking about how he “corrected” his initial denial of having ever met Carroll. The revision happened after a reporter called Trump's attention to a 1987 photo of him, Carroll and their then-spouses at a charity event. Trump responded that he was “standing with my coat on in a line - give me a break.”"
9J38EG72PO_LEQH2RULKLM9Z2G,Two top UK hospitals downgraded after damning report finds 'bullying and intimidation',Daniel Holland,"15:10, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/two-top-uk-hospitals-downgraded-31957636,"Concerns for patient safety and evidence of bullying were found by inspectors visiting two major UK hospitals, according to a new report.
A healthcare watchdog has demanded changes at the Royal Victoria Infirmary and Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, both of which have previously been named among the best in the world. The Care Quality Commission dropped its rating of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust from 'outstanding' to 'requires improvement', following inspections carried out between June and September last year.
Their latest report highlights specific concerns about harassment and abuse at the Freeman's cardiothoracic department, where staff allege there has been a history of ""bullying, intimidating and punishing staff who speak up over patient safety concerns"" and of serious incidents being ""deliberately covered up"".
Concerns were also highlighted about ""significant shortfalls"" in the numbers of doctors and midwives at the RVI's maternity unit that have left them unable to provide ""basic fundamental standards of care"". The CQC rated the leadership of the internationally-renowned NHS trust as 'inadequate', with reports that senior managers were not visible and staff complaining of a culture of favouritism and nepotism.
Sir James Mackey, who recently took over as the hospitals' new chief executive, said the CQC's findings were fully accepted and that improvements would be made ""as a matter of urgency"", reported ChronicleLive. Ann Ford, the CQC's director of operations in the North, said: ""When we visited the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, we found a significant deterioration in how well the trust was being led. Our experience tells us that when a trust isn't well-led, this has a knock-on effect on the standard of services being provided to people.
""We found leaders had the skills and abilities to run the trust but they weren't using them to always manage the priorities and issues they faced in a timely way. Also, the board had a lack of oversight at all levels to effectively manage and reduce risks to people. We were also concerned to hear the trust didn't have an open culture where staff could raise concerns without fear of blame or punishment. Some staff told us that bullying was a normal occurrence, and they were encouraged to 'turn a blind eye' and not report this behaviour. This is completely unacceptable and must be addressed by the leadership team as a priority to enable staff to provide the best possible experience to people.""
In their findings, inspectors detail how the hospitals' standards had deteriorated over recent years. They said that the CQC received 69 whistleblowing concerns before and during their inspection, mostly in relation to bullying and a fear of reprisals, compared to just one in 2019.
The report adds that the worries about the culture at the trust, which is one of the largest teaching trusts in the UK and employs nearly 15,000 people, were ""significantly different from our previous inspection in 2019"". There have already been big changes at the top of the NHS organisation recently, with previous chief executive Dame Jackie Daniel stepping down and its medical director and chief nurse also both set to leave soon.
'Every shift is an accident waiting to happen'Five trainee surgeons were moved away from the Freeman's cardiac unit in 2021 after raising concerns, following a review from the Royal College of Surgeons into the service's working environment. Having carried out a targeted inspection of the department last September because of ""concerns about the management of patients due to the behaviours of some staff"", the CQC said that staff felt bullying had become the norm and that inspectors were given specific examples of female employees being subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour.
The report concluded: ""The service did not always manage patient safety incidents well. Staff recognised but did not always report incidents and near misses for fear of retribution. Managers investigated incidents but this was not always timely, and lessons learned were not shared with the whole team and the wider service. When things went wrong, there were delays in staff apologising and giving patients honest information and suitable support.""
In 2023, the Newcastle Hospitals Trust was issued with a warning notice ordering it to make significant and immediate improvements in the quality and safety of care provided to patients with a mental health need, a learning disability, or autism. The CQC also said that maternity services at the RVI required improvement after an unannounced inspection in January last year.
In its latest report, published on Wednesday, the watchdog says that staff in the maternity ward commented that ""every shift is an accident waiting to happen"" due to workforce shortages and that they felt ""burnt out"" and exhausted"". It adds: ""Staff reported there were significant shortfalls in staffing across the maternity service and at times it felt 'unsafe'. They struggled to look after high numbers of woman and babies and told us they did not have the time to provide basic fundamental standards of care.""
The trust's patient transport service, NECTAR, was also deemed inadequate - with concerns about infection prevention measures and problems with equipment meaning that it would not always be possible to perform CPR in a vehicle when required. Other issues raised by the inspectors include medicines not being stored safely, care not always being ""delivered in accordance with national guidance or evidence-based practice"", and equality and diversity not being promoted.
Hospital staff still 'proud' of workHowever, there was praise for the way staff treated patients with ""compassion and kindness"" and examples of innovation and research. Ms Ford added: ""Although we found a number of concerns across the trust, we also found staff were proud to work for the organisation and were providing good care. Inspectors also found some outstanding practice.
""For example, in children and young people's services at both hospitals, staff were exceptional in supporting families and loved ones to understand a child's condition and they knew when to escalate concerns, so the child received appropriate care as soon as possible. Since these inspections, a new chief executive and other senior leaders have joined the trust and know where improvements need to be made. We will continue to monitor the trust and will return to carry out another inspection, to ensure the necessary improvements have been made and embedded so people receive the safe care they deserve.""
The CQC has used its enforcement powers and placed conditions on the trust's registration requiring it to make specific improvements within a specified timescale and to submit monthly progress reports. Actions that health bosses must take include demonstrating that staff are able to report safety concerns without fear, that all premises and equipment are clean and secure, and that minimum staffing levels are met. The trust has promised to introduce an ""open and honest incident reporting system"" and to create the ""best possible environment for staff and patients""."

Bruce's fun-loving personality was also evident in the clips, as he could be seen tapping his feet as he played the harmonica outside the home the couple share, while another snapshot saw him joyfully skipping holding the hand of one of his young daughters.
Captioning the footage, Emma penned: ""When I was a little girl all I ever dreamed of was to fall in love with the man of my dreams, the white picket fence, having a family and to know what unconditional love feels like.
""The moral is, be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it."" Emma's followers flooded the comments section with a number of sweet comments.

After dating for two years, the pair tied the knot in Turks and Caicos, before marrying in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills six days later. In 2012, they welcomed daughter Mabel, before bringing daughter Evelyn into the world two years later.
Bruce, also has three daughters from his first marriage to Ghost actress Demi Moore, 61, Rumer, 35, Scott LaRue, 32, and 29-year-old Tallulah. Bruce and Demi are also grandparents after Rumer and boyfriend Derek Richard Thomas welcomed a baby girl called Louetta Isley last year.
All of the family, including Bruce's current wife Emma and his ex-wife Demi are often seen hanging out together at family celebrations, with the Willis clan all banding together in light of Bruce's dementia diagnosis.
Bruce has been battling a number of health struggles since 2022 after being diagnosed with aphasia and then frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 2023. His family shared that he would be retiring from acting amid his health battles. His daughter Tallulah recently shared that they are committed to raising awareness about FTD ""because there's not enough information out there""."

Valdo Calocane “hid in the shadows” waiting for Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19. The university students had been on their way home, after an end-of-term night out, at 4am on June 13 when Calocane attacked them. Brave Grace tried to fight Calocane off, pushing him into the road as he attacked Barnaby, but both tragically died. Calocane was today (Thursday) sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at a high security hospital, subject to special restrictions, after pleading guilty to manslaughter by way of diminished responsibility.
Prosecutor Karim Khalil said: “He hid, as we know, in the shadows. What he did was wait in the shadows until the two students walked past, and he followed them from behind. He plainly knew what he was about to do.”
Following this, he approached school caretaker Ian Coates and caused the 65-year-old to leave his van, so Calocane could attack him. “It is plain he conducted himself in a purposeful way,” the Crown’s barrister added. “It is clear that his dangerousness is heightened by virtue of his ability to diminish or conceal that which he is actually doing.”
During the first attack, one witness called 999 to report the initial double-killing to warn them of the ""awful"" events taking place. The member of the public said: “There’s been a stabbing on Ilkeston Road, somebody’s lying in the street I think they’re dead. Oh – that was awful.”
Shocking CCTV captured the pair walking home happily chatting to one another as they did. Afterwards, Calocane calmly walked through the Radford area of the city, appearing in no hurry. He failed to get into a youth hostel, where an unknown hero pushed him from the wind, then proceeded to attack and kill Mr Coates.
In court yesterday, the final victim impact statement was delivered by Barnaby’s brother, Charlie. Speaking via a pre-recorded video, he said: ""When I first learned about what happened I wanted to set the world on fire. I was angry with everyone, angry with Barney, but I now realise my anger was really pride.
""He stood his ground and died being the person who he was, a hero. My hero. He was the best thing that ever happened in my life and when he died it not only took him but it also took a large part of myself.""
On Tuesday, Barnaby’s dad told the court how his son had been planning for a future beyond university. David Webber bravely read his own statement in court. He said his son had wanted to serve in the armed services after he finished his studies.
Mr Webber said: ""Barney was a vibrant loving boy growing into a man. He loved coming to Nottingham University and I loved coming here to see him. Due to your unbelievably savage actions I will never see him again and I will fight to my last breath to get justice for him.""
Barnaby’s mum, Emma, also spoke in court, in her victim impact statement she told how all she has left of her son is a lock of his hair she carries around her neck every day. She said: ""Barney did not lose his life in June 13, it was taken from him. Stolen in the most vicious, unprovoked, senseless and evil way imaginable, murdered by a monster who sits in this court today."""

The German-born musician and producer, known for songs such as Daddy Cool died in his apartment in Miami, Florida. His tragic death comes after his health declined in recent years with him also undergoing surgery on his heart. The late star previously had surgery on his heart to insert a pig valve in 2022.
Over the course of his career, Farian was responsible for some of the biggest names in music. He also discovered the boyband Milli Vanille – who were later discovered to have lip-synched during their Grammy award-winning run.
Paying tribute, Liz Mitchell of Boney M who sand lead vocals on Frank's hits told the Mirror from her home in Oxfordshire: ""Our work was truly blessed and so enjoyed by people around the world who had the privilege to hear it down the years. The testimonies come from the hearts of those who heard it and I am so grateful to the God of music that allowed our coming together, to create and present to the world the music of Boney M.
""We shared and united under a star which rose above and beyond what we ever dared to expect. I say well done to the work that we did. Rest in peace, Frank."" Speaking in November last year, he said: ""My heart valve works wonderfully. Mick Jagger also received exactly the same heart valve. I have a good pig in me! And I'm very grateful for that,"" he told Bild.
The same outlet claimed that following his procedure, his health continued to decline and he lost a considerable amount of weight. He was subsequently prescribed a similar drug to Viagra by medical staff. He said: ""This is a similar active ingredient to Viagra and has a nice side effect. But to be honest, I'm not thinking about sex at all at the moment. Today I enjoy a good meal and am just happy that I'm still alive.""
It's claimed that Farian was forced to use a wheelchair and also had breathing equipment due to ongoing issues with his lungs. A friend of Frank's, his ex-partner, Ingrid ""Milli"" Segith, is said to have visited him at his home in Miami over the New Year. ""Frank was physically very weak, but was still full of energy,"" she said, adding that he was ""still sitting in the recording studio all day working on new music"".
Frank's career started in the 1970s. He founded the band Boney M and went on to catapult them to stardom with songs including Rivers of Babylon, Rasputin, Mary's Boy Child and Daddy Cool. He also worked alongside the likes of No Mercy, Meat Loaf and Stevie Wonder throughout his impressive tenure in the music industry.
Despite his success, Frank remained optimistic and once likened himself to a chef after mixing a song together. He said: ""It's always about the ingredients. You can say you become a musician, but a lot of it is luck. Success cannot be planned.""
Since the news of his passing broke, fans have taken to social media to pay tribute. One penned: ""It's impossible not to like Boney M. RIP Frank Farian. Pop music maestro."" A second added: ""Oh blimey. Frank Farian has died. The man who masterminded Boney M (and was the male voice on all their hits), who also discovered the excellent Eruption, put together The Far Corporation and rounded off the 80s with the notorious Milli Vanilli. That's quite the career.""

9Z3V9KK3LC_4JFSWJ1B2E06B8I,UK walks out of post-Brexit trade talks with Canada for the most British reason,Lizzy BuchanDeputy Political Editor,"09:17, 26 Jan 2024Updated11:43, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-walks-out-post-brexit-31971455,"Trade talks with Canada have collapsed in a ferocious row over cheese and beef.
The UK halted long-running discussions with Ottawa on a post-Brexit pact in a fury over tariffs on British stilton, cheddar and other cheese imports which came in earlier this month. The other key sticking point is Canada's demand for the UK to ditch its ban on hormone-treated beef. It is the first time the UK Government has pulled out of talks since the UK formally left the EU.
Both countries have been trading for two years under terms agreed before the UK left the EU, which allows the UK to sell cars and cheese to Canada without import taxes. But the Canadian government has been under pressure from domestic beef and cheese producers to set tougher terms.
Trade between Canada and the UK was worth £19.2 billion in 2020, according to the UK Government. Imports from Canada are worth £7.3 billion and UK exports to Canada worth £11.8 billion.
A UK Government source said Canada appeared to have ""lost sight of the bigger picture - the British and Canadian businesses who do £26 billion worth of trade a year and the people they employ"". The source added: ""If Canada come back to table with a serious offer and desire to make progress we're all ears, but in the meantime we're going to focus on other trade deals that deliver for UK businesses.""
A spokeswoman for Canada's trade minister, Mary Ng, told the BBC she was ""disappointed"" that talks have collapsed and had made this clear to her UK counterpart, Kemi Badenoch. The spokeswoman added: ""Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.""
Ms Ng tweeted that the Canadian ""government will never agree to a deal that isn't good for our workers, farmers and businesses"".
Minette Batters, president of the Nation Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said it was essential that hormone-treated beef was not allowed into the UK. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is a relief for farmers... Trade on agricultural products is always the first thing to be discussed and the last thing to be agreed. I am pleased the Government has stuck to its line and not given way.""
She added: ""Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.""
Shadow Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises. Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector.
“This is another blow to the British economy because of Conservative incompetence. It is clear that they are unable to deliver what we need to get our economy growing.”
A UK Government spokesperson said: ""We have always said we will only negotiate trade deals that deliver for the British people. And we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made. We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic."""
9Z4ZX42FK5_V97692WUTM77SIB,Headteacher humiliated by boss in front of Ofsted inspector sues after being forced out,Emma Gill,"18:09, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/headteacher-humiliated-boss-front-ofsted-31949960,"A headteacher has successfully sued her former employer after claiming her boss dressed her down during an Ofsted inspection over a marking error.
Deborah Lingard was left ""humiliated"" after executive headteacher Yvonne Brown brought out an exercise book belonging to her son - who was in Ms Lingard's class - pointing out the error and threatening to move him to a private school, a tribunal found. The ""talented"" Year 5 teacher had been head at Tyldesley Primary School in Wigan, Greater Manchester, at the time, but had had a ""considerable dispute"" with executive head Ms Brown.
A report from Manchester Employment Tribunal said Ms Lingard claimed the ""majority"" of her decisions had to be rubber-stamped by Ms Brown, who was known to ""control many aspects"" and, according to another employee, would even call on the home phone about work matters. One incident during a November 2016 inspection saw Ms Brown leave Ms Lingard ""humiliated"" after threatening to pull her own son out of the school and send him to another, the tribunal heard.
It came during a discussion about high achievers at the school and Mrs Brown had noticed a marking error in her son's book. The tribunal report said ""The challenging high achievers issue was discussed in this meeting and Yvonne Brown went to get some books from the nearest classroom to assist the discussion.
""This included her son’s books as he was a high achiever and Yvonne Brown noticed a marking error by the Year 5 teacher and began to criticise the teacher. YB said she had never referred to her son’s books specifically it was about high achievers in general as this was one of the issues.
""The claimant said that YB went on to say that unless matters improved she would be taking her son out of the school. YB denied she said this on this occasion but that she had said that on a separate occasion in July 2016 in parents evening when she was attending as a parent, not at the meeting with Mr Iwaskow [the Ofsted inspector].""
Employment Judge Pauline Feeney ruled the 'humiliating' incident amounted to a breach of employment law, saying the exercise book incident clearly ""seriously undermined and humiliated Mrs Lingard in front of a stranger"", particularly one who was ""going to play an important role in improving the school.""
""There was no reasonable and proper cause for saying this in front of a third party,"" the judge said. Mrs Lingard, who has hypertension, claimed her treatment at school led her to being off work sick and she resigned in March 2017.
As well as the 'undermining incident', the tribunal ruled she was constructively dismissed on other grounds. Her claims of disability discrimination failed. The tribunal heard of other disputes Ms Lingard had had with Ms Brown while at the school, including how, in one meeting, Mrs Brown was ""aggressive and hostile"" telling her she was not up to the job.
Judge Feeney added: ""We consider these individually and collectively to be fundamental breaches, in that there was no attempt to support Mrs Lingard in her illness, but rather to put unreasonable pressure on her.""
The tribunal award equates to more than £190k, but with salary capping and other factors taken into account, the Manchester Evening News reports she will receive less than half of that amount.
The school's trust, Leading Learners MAT, previously came under fire in 2019 for its finances over bosses spending more than £1,880 on bar bills and £270-a-night hotel rooms. It also made headlines in 2017 after it transpired £4,000 of taxpayers’ cash was squandered on scrapped plans to turn a double decker bus into a library.
A spokesperson for Leading Learners MAT said in response to the ruling that ""while we do not agree with the final outcome, we have to respect the decision that has been made"", adding that the tribunal also sided with the trust on a number of points.
""As a Trust we always strive to ensure that every child and colleague can flourish by being part of our community. We are sorry if anyone feels that we have not acted with the best of intentions to get the right outcome for all of our brilliant children."""

Since January 16, the Princess of Wales has been an in-patient at the London Clinic, where she is recovering from what Kensington Palace has called ""planned abdominal surgery"". Kate is expected to remain in the private hospital for a few more days, before then spending the rest of her recovery at home - where she will be off-duty until around Easter ""based on the current medical advice"".
A royal expert has claimed that despite being separated from her three children - Prince George aged 10, eight-year-old Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, five - the Princess is likely finding ways to ensure she regularly checks in with them and makes sure that they are doing okay during her hospital stay.
The expert - Jennie Bond - explained to OK! Magazine that both William and Kate prioritise their family life and their children's upbringing over their royal duties, so they are likely to be making sure that their kids are in touch with their mother while she recovers in the hospital. Bond expects that before long they will make a trip to visit her in person, something that William has already done on his own.
""I'm sure that as soon as it is appropriate, William will take them to see her in the hospital, because children need that kind of face-to-face reassurance,"" she claimed, adding that in the meantime she believes that Kate will still be checking in with her kids via video calls: ""They'll be FaceTiming a lot, I'm sure, and showing them that mum's alright.""
Bond added that apart from staying in touch with their mum, William will be endeavouring to keep things as normal as possible for his three children, and sticking closely to their usual routine to help keep any feelings of upset and confusion at bay.
When the Palace announced that Kate had been admitted to the hospital for a planned surgery, they declined to provide details on what the surgery was for, instead explaining that while Kate ""appreciates the interest"" in her wellbeing, ""she hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private."" Despite not providing details, it was later confirmed that her condition is non-cancerous.

Emily, 34, has previously said that she ""didn't feel ready to tackle"" such platforms until she was in her thirties and didn't launch her Instagram account until 2020, for example. She's also shared concern as a parent about cyberbullying.
The doctor is a parent to Millie, nine, and Theo, seven, with her husband Peter, 50. Emily and Peter - who are expecting another baby together, due in the coming months - do not show their two children's faces on such platforms.
Peter reflected on Emily's admission in his column for New! magazine. He said she talked about not having social media accounts ""until she was in her thirties"" whilst promoting her newly-released book Healthy Mind, Happy You.
Discussing the situation, Peter - who has been married to Emily since 2015 - wrote about his wife: ""I really admire her for making that decision and I often think we should all have reservations when it comes to things like that.""
He added in his weekly column for the outlet: ""I didn't have social media until I was in my forties - I used it a lot for work but I'm part of a generation who is still learning about it. It's important to find a balance that works for you.""
Emily spoke about social media to OK! magazine recently, sharing concern about her kids having accounts in the future. She said: ""I'm concerned it might get to the stage where bullying might occur if you don't have [a phone], even though there's the worry of cyberbullying. I'm stuck between wanting to protect them but not excluding them.""
Discussing her experience, Emily said that she'd been ""frightened"" of what people could say and how it would affect her. She said that she didn't sign up until she ""had the confidence"" to feel comfortable with people having their opinions. She added: ""It does worry me exposing the kids to something I didn't feel ready to tackle until I was in my thirties.""

A3D02GKYRG_N2NOI1OB4O7G83O,Loose Women star slams Nicola Sturgeon for 'not being a human being',Alan JohnsonReporter,"19:19, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/loose-women-star-slams-nicola-31969114,"Loose Women star Kaye Adams has lashed out at former Scottish First Minster Nicola Sturgeon.
Kaye, 61, labelled the former SNP leader and first minister as ""not a human being"" during a chat about the UK Covid Inquiry on her BBC Radio Scotland show, Mornings with Kaye Adams. Mother-of-two Kaye hit out at the politician over her failure to keep WhatsApp messages dating back to the time of the pandemic -even though most of her communications have been submitted by her recipients.
Kaye's comments led to the BBC suffering a backlash online, with senior SNP MP Pete Wishart describing them as ""absolutely shocking"". He declared on X (formerly Twitter): ""I hope @BBCScotland think about an apology, or at least some sort of correction, for this.""
Defending Sturgeon at the time on the show, meanwhile, The National's Kelly Given explained: ""Nicola Sturgeon has submitted evidence to this inquiry, she’s submitted her informal messaging, and I think we need to take that at face value, she’s done that. Why are we holding these people to account as if they’re not human beings? Nicola Sturgeon got a new phone or deleted her messages or whatever...""
Kaye then interjected with her controversial remark: ""Because in this instance they’re not human beings, they’re politicians."" Kelly replied: ""Politicians are human beings.""
The BBC has since taken the stance that it has no case to answer for, however, with regards to complaints. A spokesperson for the broadcaster explained: ""This comment was made as part of a wider discussion on the Covid inquiry and in particular holding politicians to account for decisions made during this time. Taking the comment out of context in this way is not a fair reflection of the discussion throughout the morning.
""Of course, our presenters don’t believe politicians aren’t human, the point being made was that they also hold elected office, as was completely clear to anyone listening to the full programme, as opposed to a short clip of it.""
Earlier this week Kaye revealed she had been rushed to A&E after suffering a ""traumatic"" health scare. Kaye said she was left ""terrified"" that something was seriously wrong after she suddenly lost all hearing in her right ear ""minutes"" before she went live on air for Friday's instalment of Loose Women.
Describing her ordeal on Instagram, Kaye wrote: ""I was absolutely terrified, I thought, 'Oh my god, what has gone wrong?' On Friday when I was doing Loose Women, minutes before we went in air, my right ear just went dead. I put my earpiece in, there was no sound I couldn't hear a thing.""
After getting through the show without mentioning the problem she returned to her Glasgow home where she researched her symptoms. With no sign of improvement the next day, she was sent for an audiogram that left her mortified by its findings and cause of the problem - a huge lump of earwax. ""I mean I am embarrassed to say this because, honestly, my head was going to some terrible terrible tumour, I am very melodramatic,"" Kaye told her followers. ""Paula pulled out the biggest bit of wax you have ever seen.""

A4DVOIB20Y_AU1GVK73SSVJLY5,Nottingham killer- volatile 'Jekyll and Hyde' terrified housemates barricaded themselves away from,Julia BanimAudience Writer,"15:00, 25 Jan 2024Updated17:09, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nottingham-killer-volatile-jekyll-hyde-31949898,"Former housemates of the Nottingham killer Valdo Calocane have spoken out about their terror while living with the 'volatile' student, who they nicknamed 'the psycho' behind his back.
Mature student Calocane, now 32, was likened to 'Jekyl and Hyde' by fellow University of Nottingham roomates, one of whom was so scared of him they fitted a lock on the inside of their bedroom door.
Haverfordwest-raised Calocane, who studied mechanical engineering, was described as 'quiet' and 'aloof' by his coursemates, but those who lived with him saw a very different side.
On Tuesday, Calocane's manslaughter pleas on the basis of diminished responsibility were accepted following consultation with the victims' families, after he denied charges of murder back in November. Calocane has now been handed a hospital order, which means he will be detained in a high-security hospital for an indefinate period of time. He will now be detained at Ashworth High Security Hospital, in Maghull, near Liverpool, and it's likely he will stay there for the remainder of his life.
Calocane randomly targeted and stabbed university students, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, both 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, on June 13, 2023. Peter Joyce KC, Calocane's defence lawyer, has stated that the attacks were committed while his client was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
One former student previously told the Mirror that Calocane 'hated noise' and was known to snap if disturbed while sleeping or studying. They recalled: ""He would lose it if we came back late from a night out and woke him up. It was a bad mix. He was a guy in his late 20s, we were party animals barely out of our teens. Valdo was so volatile. He come storming out of his room in a rage without warning.
""He didn't attack any of us, he would just erupt shouting and get right in our faces. A few times he literally came into my room and was ranting and raving because I had my music on. It freaked me out, so I got a sliding lock put on the inside of my door to stop him doing it again."" Recently unearthed footage shows Calocane, who moved between various student accommodations, putting one of his flatmates in a headlock following a row in January 2022.
On top of the three charges of manslaughter, Calocane was also sentenced for three counts of attempted murder due to his attempt to run over three pedestrians with a van on the same day of his stabbing spree.
Prosecutor Karim Khalil KC told Nottingham Crown Court: ""We have also consulted with the families of the deceased. We considered carefully representations made in the course of those consultations; we also considered the particular gravity and complexity of this case, including that which we submit are the grossly aggravating factors of the multiplicity of fatal and intended fatal offending.
""In these circumstances, the Crown concluded that it was appropriate to accept the pleas to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. For the avoidance of any possible doubt, it is the Crown's position that the appalling facts of this case render it to be one of the utmost seriousness.""
Handing down the sentence, judge Mr Justice Turner told Calocane that he would be detained in a high-security hospital 'very probably for the rest of your life'. Addressing the killer, he continued: “You committed a series of atrocities in this city which ended the lives of three people in this city. Your sickening crimes both shocked the nation and wrecked the lives of your surviving victims and the families of them all.”
Speaking on the steps of the court after sentencing, Emma Webber, mother of Barnaby, said: ""We were presented with a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges. At no point during the previous five-and-a-half-months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder. We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out. We do not dispute that the murderer is mentally unwell and has been for a number of years.""
She continued: ""However the pre-meditated planning, the collection of lethal weapons, hiding in the shadows and brutality of the attacks are that of an individual who knew exactly what he was doing. He knew entirely that it was wrong but he did it anyway.""
Speaking before the court, as per Sky News, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, Grace's father, said that his family will 'never come to terms' with her death, stating: ""She was a gift to us, she was a gift to the country."" He continued: ""We will look for answers regarding missed opportunities to intervene and prevent this horrendous crime.""

Meanwhile, in the Cotswolds, Adam's animals got checked by the vet, and Tom looked into oil drilling plans in lovely places. It comes after viewers couldn't believe their eyes when they saw the price of a sausage roll at a local farm shop in West Sussex in a previous episode.
Fans sat back in their seats as the popular show, which first aired in 1988, took them to the South Downs and visited the village of Kirdford in West Sussex. But it was when presenters John Craven and Sammi Kinghorn filmed a thriving rural community shop that many fans were left in disbelief over how much shop owners were charging for their sausage rolls. Having a local farm shop means that villagers do not have to face the long commute to the nearest town to find a supermarket.
And instead, can enjoy the locally sourced and homemade sausage rolls - for a price of £2.99. But that was not enough of an incentive to quell the anger for some viewers. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter one person said: ""£2.99 for a f***** sausage roll?"" Another person added: ""Does he spit in it? It's a sausage roll FFS.""
But it seems as though the price did not deter some viewers. One fan said: ""That's a sausage roll that is."" While another penned: ""I want a sausage roll now. Damn BBC propaganda."" And it also looks like the price is a bitter pill many of the villagers are willing to swallow. Shopkeeper Craig said: ""We will sell between 50 to 100 sausage rolls nearly every day of the week.""
Countryfile fans were dealt a bitter blow last month when it was announced that presenter Ellie Harrison was quitting the show after 13 years on the BBC series. But Ellie, who has presented the show since 2009, promised viewers that she will see them ""again someday.""

A72ZPWOZXX_BA28TIEEUWRZW1I,'Tank-like' Donald Trump's 'smug' victory speech shows 'desire to humiliate',Alex Croft,"14:20, 24 Jan 2024Updated16:04, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/tank-like-donald-trumps-smug-31957195,"A body language expert described Donald Trump as 'tank-like' with a 'desire to humiliate' during his victory speech in New Hampshire.
The former president, who won his second straight nominating contest against Nikki Haley, was said to be showing 'smug shock and awe'. Despite not verbally attacking Haley as harshly as he usually does with Democrats and other Republican candidates, Trump couldn't resist a jibe at her during his speech. He called her an 'imposter', following his convincing win that brings us closer to a repeat of the 2020 election.
Trump, with former opponent Tim Scott standing behind him, said: ""I can say to everybody 'oh thank you for the victory, it's wonderful', or I can go up and say, 'who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before, and like claimed the victory'.

She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said 'she's gonna win, she's gonna win, she's gonna win', then she failed badly.""
Body language expert Judi James noted Trump's less direct attack on Nikki Haley.
She told The Mirror: ""Trump's 'attack' on Haley here could be telling. In his usual, tank-like style he crushes anything that gets in his way, but although he calls her an 'imposter' his rituals of anger and a desire to crush and humiliate are not aimed directly at Haley here,"" she explained.
James added: ""His approach to her has been, by his standards, muted, which could hint that someone behind the scenes has been telling him to avoid a more open, Hilary Clinton insult-style attack. His recent mention of Haley at a NH rally actually turned into a deflection aimed at Hilary Clinton, who he was and still is openly scathing about,""
Trump used his usual mocking voice to tease the governor who suggested Haley was on track for a primary win - a victory some pundits believe she needs to prove her chances. ""‌Trump has become very fond
of using role-play mimicry to refer to people and moments,"" said James. ""It's a very strong form of attack by ridiculing them. Here though his mimicry is of the governor, not Haley, hinting he's still keeping his powder dry when it comes to her.
""His squeezebox hand gesture runs throughout this moment, suggesting a rather smug shock and awe that anyone would try to contradict him. His 'I don't get angry I get even' might sound sinister on paper but it was delivered with less venom he has shown for some of his recent foes. He tries for a precision gesture that becomes truncated and there is a display of his lower teeth that looks tough but mainly good-humoured.""
With Trump winning in Iowa and New Hampshire, Nikki Haley will be hoping for a victory in Nevada or the Virgin Islands, both hosting their caucuses on February 8. This comes before the primary in Haley's home state of South Carolina. There are whispers that if Haley doesn't win in the southeastern state, she may be pressured to step down, allowing Trump to focus on Joe Biden.

ACRX5J6M58_O76A4D71CJEB8YP,Business leaders urged to take 'firm grip' on cyber security to strengthen defences,Lawrence Matheson,"13:02, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/business-leaders-urged-take-firm-31947027,"Business leaders have been given new advice on how to strengthen their cyber defences.
The Government has urged companies to view cyber threats as a major business risk, just like financial or legal challenges. The draft code of practice on cyber security has been published in partnership with industry experts and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). It is aimed at executive and non-executive directors.
The code advises senior leaders to make cyber security a key focus for their business. It recommends setting out clear roles and responsibilities across an organisation, increasing protection for customers and safeguarding the firm's ability to operate safely and securely. The NCSC has repeatedly warned about the ongoing cyber threat to the UK, especially from ransomware attacks.
These are where hackers gain access to a user's system and either steal or block access to data and demand a ransom payment to release it. The new code suggests firms should have detailed plans in place to respond to and recover from any potential cyber incidents. It also recommends regular testing of such plans and formal systems for reporting incidents.
The code also encourages firms to improve the cyber skills and awareness of their employees where possible. The government's AI and intellectual property minister, Viscount Camrose, has warned that cyber attacks can hurt businesses just as much as money troubles or legal issues.
He said: ""This new code will help them take the lead in safely navigating potential cyber threats, ensuring businesses across the country can take full advantage of the emerging technologies which are revolutionising how we work. It is vital the people at the heart of this issue take the lead in shaping how we can improve cyber security in every part of our economy, which is why we want to see industry and business professionals from all walks coming forward to share their views.""
The Government wants to hear what businesses think about this new code to make it even better. Lindy Cameron, who's in charge of the NCSC, added: ""Cyber security is no longer a niche subject or just the responsibility of the IT department, so it is vital that CEOs and directors understand the risks to their organisation and how to mitigate potential threats.""
She encourages all big bosses to have their say: ""This new cyber governance code of practice will help ensure cyber resilience is put at the top of the agenda for organisations and I'd encourage all directors, non-executive directors, and senior leaders to share their views. Senior leaders can also access the NCSC's cyber security board toolkit, which provides practical guidance on how to implement the actions outlined in the code, to ensure effective management of cyber risks.""

AEZ02K696D_E02MYGDD7J9ZRQM,Anna Wintour makes rare public appearance without her famous sunglasses,Zara WoodcockShowbiz Reporter,"17:04, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/anna-wintour-makes-rare-public-31968596,"Anna Wintour looked a little different as she stepped out without wearing her iconic sunglasses.
The 74-year-old media executive is known for wearing sunglasses no matter where she is - from fashion week shows and red carpets to meetings at Vogue. Although Anna has never publicly confirmed the brands of sunglasses she favours, the star makes that the black-rimmed frames are oversized.
Anna even kept her sunglasses on while sitting next to Queen Elizabeth II at Richard Quinn's London Fashion Week runway show in February 2018. She previously discussed her reason for wearing glasses and revealed it became 'armour' for her. And now, the editor-in-chief was seen leaving the Valentino show without her glasses during Haute Couture week in Paris.
Staying loyal to her consistent style, the Vogue editor-in-chief held onto her sunglasses in case she wanted to hide behind the frames.
In 2019, Anna sat down with CNN's Christian Amanpour and explained she found the eyewear ""incredibly useful because you avoid people knowing what you're thinking about. They help me when I'm feeling a bit tired or sleepy,"" she added. ""And maybe they've just become a crutch in part of who I am. But today I really did need them.""
She continued: ""I'll be brutally frank: I have been unbelievably ill all week. And, plus, I just had eye surgery, so those are the real reasons I'm wearing them today."" A decade before, she also touched upon her iconic sunglasses. During a 60 Minutes interview, she said: ""They are seriously useful. I can sit in a show and if I am bored out of my mind, nobody will notice … At this point, they have become, really, armour.""
Anna isn't always wearing the sunglasses and has shown up on red carpets without them on several occasions. Last year, Anna ditched the frames as she arrived arm-in-arm at the Met Gala with the Hollywood actor Bill Nighy. Bill and Anna have been sparking romance rumours since 2018 when they were spotted attending multiple plays together.
At the time, the Love Actually star brushed off the rumours, saying: ""There are a lot of rumours about me and probably about Anna. However, following their appearance in 2018, onlookers were led to believe their close friendship had blossomed into a relationship after Anna was spotted ""beaming"" while out with Bill for a coffee.
She had even removed her trademark sunglasses to enjoy the moment with the actor.

AFYL0ZQI7S_LEELK6YR9IHUZWN,UK scientists developing the first vaccine to fight bowel cancer,Martin BagotHealth and Science editor,"19:20, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-scientists-developing-first-vaccine-31969619,"A first ever vaccine against bowel cancer is being developed by UK scientists.
The jab will initially be used to attack the tumour prior to surgery and help kill it. If successful it will bolster the immune system to help it stop bowel cancer returning and transform survival rates. It is hoped the vaccine will eventually remove the need for surgery, instead helping the body eradicate the cancer.
The international trial is being led by Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust. Chief investigator Dr Tony Dhillon, a consultant medical oncologist, said: “I feel as if we are on the edge of something really big here. It will be life changing as it means potentially, patients may not need to have surgery – they may just have the vaccine.”
Awareness of bowel cancer, the third most common form, surged thanks to the camp-aigning work of TV presenter Dame Deborah James, who died from the disease in 2022, aged 40. Her Bowel Babe appeal raised a total of £11.3million towards vital research.
The new trial will be available for 44 patients at participating hospitals around the world. After that the vaccine will either be licensed or bigger trials may be launched to expand its uses. Dr Dhillon said: “We have high hopes it will be successful.”"
AGDXTUZWG3_VLCPKK1S8BNY2MA,Tory minister Huw Merriman accuses Art Attack's Neil Buchanan of 'bias' in on-air blunder,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"10:08, 23 Jan 2024Updated10:37, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-minister-huw-merriman-accuses-31944632,"A Tory minister has been savaged after accusing the BBC of being biased - and naming the presenter of Art Attack in an on-air blunder.
Huw Merriman called bafflement when he lashed out at reporting of welfare changes by Neil Buchanan - who was a kids' TV favourite for years hosting the famous art show. And the minister also whined that a comedy show he listened to in his car was an anti-Tory ""diatribe"".
Mr Merriman, the latest Conservative figure to criticise the corporation, was pressed to give an example of biased reporting. First he rattled on about a radio show he didn't find funny before launching his puzzling attack on Mr Buchanan.
He said: ""So when I worked at the Department of Work and Pensions doing work on Universal Credit there was an individual there who would report on it, Neil Buchanan, who I always felt gave one side of the story and not the other side, which was the government side.""
Mr Merriman appears to have confused the Art Attack presenter with BBC Social Affairs Correspondent Michael Buchanan who has reported on the rollout of Universal Credit.
The excruciating moment came after he was challenged by Kay Burley to give examples of bias against the BBC. First he tried to point to popular show The News Quiz. He said: ""Let me give you an example, I know that you were searching for them yesterday. I was listening to the News Quiz, which is on Radio 4 at 6.30pm on Friday when I was driving to my constituency office.
""For 10 minutes all I heard, and it wasn't satirical, it was just diatribe against Conservatives, not the government. And I did listen to that and think 'for goodness sake, where's the balance in that? So yes, I'm afraid to say despite the fact I've always been a big supporter of the BBC, that struck me as completely biased.""
An unimpressed Ms Burley responded: ""You understand that the News Quiz is comedy and nothing to do with actual news."" Mr Merriman struggled on, saying: ""I love it when politicians get lampooned. But that was the whole point. There wasn't actually anything in that particular regard, which struck me as being sort of amusing. ""
It comes after Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer claimed there was a ""perception"" of bias among the public. When Ms Burley pointed out this isn't evidence, she said: “That is evidence. Impartiality is about perception of the things that are being broadcast by the BBC, and the evidence in relation to that perception is that …”
Labour's Thangam Debbonaire wrote on Twitter: “Just the latest in a long line of secretaries of state for culture wars.”
No10 was yesterday forced to deny it was pursuing an agenda against the BBC. Rishi Sunak's official spokesman, asked if this was the case, responded: “No. This is rightly about ensuring the BBC is able to continue to thrive long into the future.”
The Mirror has contacted the BBC for comment."

The former leader of the English Defence League - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - is accused of failing to comply with a direction to leave an area in Westminster, London on Sunday, November 26 of last year. The 40 year old was arrested near the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the demonstration began, after organisers said he would not be welcome at the event.
Robinson, who now claims to be a journalist, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning, wearing a blue shirt and dark grey waistcoat. He denied the charge of one count of failing to comply with a dispersal order. Alistair Williamson KC, defending, made an application to the court to prevent the publication of Robinson’s address.
He said that his client had been subject to 12 police visits where he was warned of threats to his life, known as Osman warnings. Tristan Kirk, a journalist from the Evening Standard, opposed the application on behalf of the press. He referred to the principle of open justice, and noted that the application had been made at the last minute, with little time for the press to prepare.
Judge Briony Clark refused the application. Asked to give his address to the court, Robinson said that he had no fixed address. Bail conditions that prevent Robinson from entering within the M25, or attending or organising a protest within London, remain in place.
He will next appear at City of London Magistrate’s Court for trial on Monday, April 22."
AJU4V6885S_FRN721MLNV0AZOP,"Dad of Brit, 20, who died after Turkey weight loss surgery has heartbreaking wish",Matthew YoungNews Reporter,"17:16, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dad-brit-20-who-died-31950124,"The heartbroken dad of a young woman who died after surgery in Turkey has slammed the botched procedure and pleaded with others to never travel for operations.
Richard Ribeiro, 44, told the Mirror how his daughter Morgan, 20, had researched the most reliable place to head for her gastric band procedure. He said Morgan, who had struggled with her weight for a long time, had used trust fund money from her parents, released to her aged 18, for the £2,500 op in Istanbul.
“We want to make sure something like this doesn’t ever happen again,” he said. ""That no more children are taken away from their families because of these ridiculous surgeries, where they do not operate properly and do not follow proper procedures. I don’t want any other families to ever suffer like this.”
Morgan had paid the money to a company in Switzerland, her mum Erin Gibson, 44, said. After being given the green light to return home from surgery three days after the January 5 operation, she fell seriously ill during the flight back to Gatwick. The plane made an emergency stop in Belgrade, Serbia, where she died on January 13. Hospital medics in Serbia told her boyfriend Jamie Brewster, 19, that his girlfriend was going into septic shock.
Doctors had to operate on Morgan after discovering her small intestine had been cut during the gastric sleeve procedure, which led to an infection. The family says surgeons removed 10cm of her small intestine and were hopeful she would pull through.
Erin said Serbian doctors told her it was the third time a plane carrying a British cosmetic surgery patient has had to make an emergency landing in Belgrade because of medical complications. ""The Serbian prosecutor’s office and the British authorities have launched investigations into Morgan’s death,” she added.
Dad Richard, who is separated from Erin, said Morgan had researched the best place for the surgery. “She did her due diligence, she checked the success rate of the operations and the reviews, how long the healing process was,” he said. ""She weighed her options up and decided the hospital she chose had a better reputation.
“She contacted me while she was out there, after she had the operation, said it had gone OK and that she was starting the healing process, but that she was sore. Morgan was cleared to fly but they had perforated her small intestine. It’s just heartbreaking.”
The last Richard, from south London, heard from his daughter was a WhatsApp voice note she sent him before she boarded the Wizz Air flight back to Gatwick. “That was the last time I heard her voice,” he said. “I haven’t been able to listen to it again.
“She had done a lot of growing up, she was a lovely, mature girl. She was doing what she wanted to do - working as an assistant for children with special needs. She cared about people. Now it’s about holding the surgery and the surgeon to account after what has happened to Morgan and the many others who travel for operations.”"

The airline, based in Dublin, has often complained about OTAs selling its flights without permission. Ryanair's director of marketing, communications and digital, Dara Brady, said at a London press conference: ""Nobody is looking to overcharge customers here.""
He added: ""Nobody is looking for customers not to get the right information, and in the case of where it does go wrong, we've a process that guarantees customers can get refunds. We've always said that if (OTAs) play by our rules, we'd be happy to work with others.""
He concluded by saying: ""From a Ryanair respective I think it's a very important step forward."" and ""We will continue to campaign hard against OTAs who don't play by the rules. They're pirates, we don't want to deal with them.""
""For legitimate partners like loveholidays who are invested in the customer and are going to not apply mark-ups, and will give us the correct customer information, we're happy to work with them."" Loveholidays is the third largest provider of package holidays in the UK, and the largest OTA.
Chief marketing officer Al Murray said: ""This new partnership highlights our commitment to championing consumer choice, with the overall aim of making travel more affordable and accessible while opening the world to everyone."" Ryanair said OTAs stopped selling its flights in December, which caused a slight decrease in the proportion of seats filled on its aircraft.
Mr Brady said the loveholiday partnership is ""certainly not in response to that"" as the airline was happy for OTAs not to sell its flights.

ASNVKQI3MS_F2JSJQ05M2LH8X5,Disgraced Stephen Bear whines he's 'lost everything' and cries himself to sleep after jail release,Daniel BirdAssistant Showbiz Editor,"10:22, 24 Jan 2024Updated10:23, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/disgraced-stephen-bear-whines-hes-31953925,"Stephen Bear cries himself to sleep after coming to terms with his disgraceful actions, he said.
The disgraced reality star - who last week was released from prison halfway into his sentence - has been adjusting to life on the outside world again. Stephen, 34, was found guilty of voyeurism and two counts of disclosing private, sexual photographs and films with Love Island star Georgia Harrison. He shared images and videos on his OnlyFans page without the consent of Georgia - who waived her right to anonymity.
He was sentenced to 22 months behind bars and was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and also to pay Georgia the sum of £200,000 – the highest sum awarded in an image abuse case. But following his release, he's shared an insight into his mindset.
""I've come out of prison and I was very overwhelmed, it was a lot,"" he said. ""I've had to adjust again to real life. That was the biggest shock, the biggest shock is, all I remembered is my old life. I went to prison and I was frozen in that mindset of my old life.
""You come out and you realise 'Oh, I've lost everything', everything is gone, everything you can imagine is gone."" The former Ex On The Beach personality continued: ""It's taken me a couple of days. I came home and the first night, I was crying, when I was in bed, I was crying.
""I was thinking of all the nice things that I had, it was like 'Wow, man I had it so good!', I cried myself to sleep."" He went on to say he's ""embracing having no money"" and living in his parents' spare room once again. Discussing his time in prison, Bear recalled: ""There was times when it was hard. You've got to be very mentally strong when you're away in those places.""
Following his release, Bear was slapped with a restraining order against Harrison and must stay away from her for five years. He must also share his whereabouts with the police for a decade and is conditioned to stay at his parents' home for at least 12 months.
As he walked free from HMP Brixton on Wednesday, January 17, he looked unrecognisable. The former television personality ditched his trademark short black hair and instead had shoulder-length locks as well as a bushy beard. Having reportedly found religion while incarcerated, he also wore a set of black rosary beads around his neck as he headed towards an awaiting vehicle.

AWHS1S71VU_792CZNP4YGPW2PZ,Would you support the British public being called up to fight against Russia? Have your say,Paul SpeedOnline Reporter,"11:01, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/would-you-support-british-public-31953369,"As tensions continue to escalate with an increasingly belligerent Russia, the head of the British Army says the government will need to call Brits up to the armed forces - as our military is too small.
Soldier numbers have fallen to below 76,000 - and the gaps need to be filled, General Sir Patrick Sanders will reportedly tell the International Armoured Vehicles expo in Twickenham today.
While not advocating for conscription, he will emphasise the need for a mental shift among the public, urging them to think 'more like troops' and be prepared for potential conflict with Russia. The Army Chief has previously said: “This is our 1937 moment. We are not at war, but must act rapidly so that we aren’t drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion.”
Gen Sir Patrick’s words echo those of Admiral Rob Bauer, chairman of the NATO Military Committee, who this week said nations should be ready to “find more people if it comes to war”, and to consider “mobilisation, reservists or conscription”.
Additionally, former Chief of the General Staff of the British Army, General Lord Dannatt, has voiced concerns about the UK facing a situation similar to the 1930s unless more investment is made in the armed forces, highlighting the rapid decline of our military might over the years.

NATO recently announced its largest call-up in decades, with 90,000 troops preparing to begin drills in preparation for any futire conflict. Among them are 20,000 British troops as the alliance plans to test allies on their ability to fight an adversary as capable as Russia.
And there are fears that conscription could be reintroduced here in a bid to get the British Army numbers up. If this were it to happen, it would be the first time in more than 60 years that Brits would be required to fight.
Mandatory military service was introduced in the First World War following the government's Military Service Act in 1916. It continued until the final servicemen were demobbed in 1963.

AXJXJ8PIUR_HYR6M4PQDD23RQA,Nicola Sturgeon branded Boris Johnson 'f****** clown' in secret Covid WhatsApp messages,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"11:18, 25 Jan 2024Updated15:52, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-branded-boris-johnson-31964335,"Secret WhatsApps between Nicola Sturgeon and her former aide show the former First Minister branded Boris Johnson ""a f****** clown"".
The scathing description came when the ex-PM announced a second national lockdown on October 31 2020 after weeks of ignoring calls for more stringent restrictions.
In messages uncovered by the Covid Inquiry, Ms Sturgeon said his address was ""f****** excruciating"" and that the UK communications were ""awful"". She added: ""Their comms are behind awful. We're not perfect but we don't get nearly enough credit for how much better than them we are.""
The former First Minister and ex-SNP leader also told her former chief of staff Liz Lloyd: ""His utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere."" Ms Lloyd said she was ""offended"" on behalf of special advisers everywhere. Ms Sturgeon replied: ""He is a f****** clown."" She went on: ""They really are a shower... ""
During the Inquiry hearing on Thursday Ms Lloyd was also asked if the relationship between the ex-First Minister and the then-PM had ""broken down"". She replied: ""That overstates what was there to break.""
She said of the ex-PM Mr Johnson: ""He didn't want to be on those calls, he wasn't well briefed, he wasn't listening, engagement with him became slightly pointless. They didn't get us anywhere. We started with the approach we should work together, in co-ordinated fashion, but a substantive discussion isn't what we got.
""The Prime Minister was reading a script and would largely ignore points made."" She said Ms Sturgeon's strong language showed her ""frustration"" towards Mr Johnson.
What are your thoughts on Nicola Sturgeon’s Whatsapp messages? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
The former chief-of-staff also told Ms Sturgeon she wanted a ""good old-fashioned rammy"" with the UK Government so she could ""think about something other than sick people"" in WhatsApp messages.
She told the First Minister she had ""set a timetable"" for the UK Government to answer the Scottish Government on furlough as a ""purely political"" move in the messages on November 12020. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Yeah, I get it. And it might be worth doing. I've sent a rough formulation of what I might say tomorrow.""
The Covid Inquiry announced on Thursday that Ms Sturgeon will take the stand for the first time next week where she will be grilled on the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic. The former SNP leader stood down as First Minister in a shock announcement almost a year ago, saying she had been ""wrestling"" with the massive decision for some time."
AZ54P2MYPE_8JBCDHXV4VRDBEZ,Furious mum says baby given 'death sentence' as cystic fibrosis drug too expensive,Kelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter,"15:50, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/furious-mum-says-baby-given-31946367,"A furious mum says her five-month-old daughter faces a ""death sentence"" as she is being denied a life-changing drug on the NHS.
Rula Samara-Sellers has pleaded for her baby Layla to receive the wonder medicine Kaftrio, costing up to £160,000 a year per patient, to treat her cystic fibrosis. The mum-of-three said she and her husband Connor, 31, endured the “worst days of our lives” when her daughter was given the devastating diagnosis.
Layla has the rare genetic condition and struggles with infections from mucus build-up in her lungs and digestive system. Those with the condition often have tragically shortened lifespans. Rula, 37, said her family were originally told Layla could qualify for Kaftrio at the age of two, which NHS England previously hailed as a ‘miracle treatment’.
But she now fears Layla may never get it after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) put the drug's cost-effectiveness under review. Rula from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: “I think it’s absolutely disgusting. If they did say that she was not entitled to it when she was two, they are literally giving her a death sentence. She is sick, and now you’re saying that it’s too expensive - and her life is too expensive?
""So she’ll continue having a terrible quality of life for the sake of saving money for the NHS. They’ll be providing everyone in the community with a death sentence and saying their lives are not worth it… This is inhumane, they cannot decline it.”
Rula, who is head of customer experience at a financial company, said Layla was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at three and half weeks old following a heel prick test. Rula said her daughter, who is susceptible to bacterial infections, now requires constant care and has made numerous trips to the hospital.
She says she felt the promise of the 'miracle drug' Kaftrio by specialists had kept them going through some “extremely difficult” situations. “It was the worst day of our lives because we didn’t know much about cystic fibrosis. Everything that you look at on Google isn’t that great. But what is factual is that it does lead to a shortened life expectancy and a life that is difficult.
“Typically, children born with cystic fibrosis, until they get to the age of one, shouldn’t experience many issues. But Layla has currently had multiple rounds of IVs in hospital, she’s had surgery, and she’s had multiple rounds of antibiotics. The only thing that was keeping us going was that she’ll be entitled to Kaftrio.”
Rula said Layla currently requires 12 scoops of micro 'Creon' tablets per day so she can digest her milk as her pancreas doesn’t produce enough enzymes. But she might be forced to take up to 60 of the adult-sized pills daily just to process certain kinds of foods when she's older.
In November last year, NICE published new 'draft' guidance that suggested Kaftrio, in their view, was likely too expensive for use on the NHS. Their report concluded: ""The cost-effectiveness estimates were substantially above the range NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources.""
This meant those who had already begun a course of the drug or been prescribed it could keep taking it, but new patients, like Layla, might be barred in the future. Rula said about hearing the news: “The whole of the community, us included, couldn’t sleep, we couldn’t stop crying. It was genuinely the worst experience in the whole entire world.
“What they are saying is anybody who is born after 2023, essentially, will no longer be entitled to it, so they are discriminating by age. Because you’ve missed the cut-off, you can just have a shortened life expectancy.”
Rula is now campaigning to ensure the voices of cystic fibrosis sufferers are heard ahead of an update from NICE, expected this week, and a final decision in March. She added: “I will fight tooth and nail to make sure it's approved in the UK. I will work with the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and they will support me all the way.”
A NICE spokeswoman aid: “NICE is liaising with key stakeholders to determine the most appropriate next steps for NICE’s assessment of these treatments. This will include exploring potential commercial solutions The NHS commercial framework for new medicines outlines how NHS England can negotiate complex confidential commercial agreements with companies.
“The feasibility of implementing a commercial access agreement is assessed directly by NHS England, and NHS England has indicated that it is willing to enter formal commercial negotiations with Vertex once the NICE committee outputs are clear for all parties. Negotiations would be entered into with the aim of ensuring the full portfolio of licensed cystic fibrosis medicines are available to everyone who may benefit, now and in the future, in a way that is fair to patients and fair to taxpayers.
“NICE will only consider a commercial access agreement proposal after NHS England approval.”"

The pair, who first met on E4's Celebs Go Dating, had a turbulent relationship before welcoming their daughter Bonnie four months ago. Before Bonnie's birth they had split but later rekindled their relationship.
But that appears to now be over with reports claiming that Gary was seen cosying up to another woman while enjoying a night out in London. Both Gary, 42, and Laura, 34, have also unfollowed one another on Instagram and appear to have been single for some time.
According to the MailOnline, the Hollyoaks actor appeared to be in high spirits as he was seen getting cosy with a mystery woman at the launch of a swanky London restaurant on Wednesday.
A source told the publication: ""Gary looked very cosy with a girl at the table and was whispering in her ear. He was clearly here for a fun night and didn’t care who was watching.""
Meanwhile, an onlooker told The Sun: ""He also looked very cosy with a brunette lady at the table and was whispering in her ear. Gary was also joined by a stunning blonde lady at the table. They were sat at a booth and partied the night away."" While Gary was out, Laura was documenting her time at home with their daughter. Neither Gary nor Laura have shared snaps with one another since New Year's Eve. The former The Bill actor shared a video of himself, Laura and their daughter, before he planted a kiss on the former Love Island personality.
In the video, the pair were smiling after kissing each other's cheeks. The former spent the Christmas period in Scotland before eventually returning to London. Early in December, Laura shared a photo of herself, Bonnie and Gary meeting Santa and wrote: ""All about B. First Christmas I feel a bit of pressure. It won't be perfect Angel but every year I promise to make it even more magical #BabyB.""
But Laura previously revealed that she was determined for Bonnie and Gary to have a relationship before they rekindled their romance. She told Closer that whenever she was in London, she would always tell him so he was able to see their daughter.
The Mirror has approached Gary and Laura's representatives for comment.

B3VR14EVXS_LJ1J6UL7K478PI7,'I felt too ashamed to attend my smear test after abnormal results - I regret it now',Nia DaltonSpecialist Writer,"15:14, 25 Jan 2024Updated15:12, 26 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-felt-ashamed-attend-smear-31938528,"Feelings of shame stopped Jenna Al-Ansari from following up on her abnormal smear test results - and now she regrets ever burying her head in the sand.
Smear tests are available to anyone in the UK with a cervix aged 25 to 64 - and yet, one in three do not take up their screening invite. Research by leading charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust in 2019 found that women from minority ethnic backgrounds are less likely to attend cervical screenings than white women.
In many conservative cultures, female sexuality is a taboo topic and discussions may be frowned upon or non-existent. A 2015 study found that ethnic minority women felt there was a lack of awareness about cervical cancer in their community. Fear, embarrassment and shame were also identified as barriers.
According to a Department for Health report in 2022, embarrassment was the most common reason for not booking or missing a screening appointment. As an Arab and Muslim woman, Jenna understands the negative connotations associated with smear tests and grew up associating them with being 'painful and shameful'.
Speaking to The Mirror during Cervical Cancer Prevention Week, she explained: ""There is a stigma attached to it - universally and within different cultures. Everything I'd heard about smear tests was negative and no one ever discussed it with me directly growing up.""
Jenna, 33, from London, attended her first smear test at 25, but when her results came back with HPV and borderline cell changes, she was put off returning for three years. ""HPV instantly made me feel as though I'd done something wrong - I associated it with an STI,"" she said. ""Specifically as an Arab and Muslim woman, there is shame in our culture around sex and it added to that sense of isolation and embarrassment.""
Jenna's fear of being judged contributed to her decision to ignore the advice to return. ""My first smear test was also a really horrible experience. The nurse and team were from a similar ethnic background and I internalised the idea that they were judging me. It was painful and I felt really vulnerable,"" she explained. ""In reality, it's an overstretched service, and looking back, I felt like the situation was bigger than it was.""
When Jenna received her test results letter in the post, she instantly didn't want to follow up. ""I buried my head in the sand for three years - and it would've been a lot longer than that. My partner had a sudden heart attack and it made me realise that I was taking my health for granted,"" she said. ""I went on Jo's website and read stories and information before booking my smear test again.
""I told the nurse on arrival that I was very nervous. She could not have been more empathetic and kind. It didn't hurt at all. She told me that if it's hurting, something isn't right. You need to be vocal."" Jenna's results came back and she had abnormal cells. She was invited to have a colposcopy, a procedure to closely examine the cervix for signs of disease. ""I thought I had cancer immediately and bawled my eyes out. I had a meltdown,"" she said.
""I had so much guilt for missing my appointments. But again, Jo's website was so informative and explained that it was a pre-cancerous check. It ended up being a completely painless procedure and the doctor was brilliant."" If left untreated, there is a risk that some abnormal cells can go on to develop into cervical cancer in the future. Jenna had the choice to undergo a procedure to remove them and she went ahead with it for peace of mind.
""Now they are gone and I have a routine smear every three years,"" she said. There are lots of reasons Jenna was put off her initial follow-up appointment, but cultural shame played a huge role. ""It felt like a taboo topic and, as sexual health was never really spoken about at home, I didn't have any experiences to relate to,"" she said.
""The reality is that it isn't easy for everyone to talk, but if you do feel isolated and embarrassed, you can read all of the information online. It should be an open conversation and we need to make it as normal as discussing a GP appointment, rather than thinking it's so serious and secretive. If you are going to any of these appointments, tell someone and go for a cocktail or ice cream after. Don't live with your worries alone.""

B3W110RDA7_GJ2HXSAVISK2GFV,Tory rebel Lee Anderson says he'd take his old job back in screeching U-turn,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"11:12, 24 Jan 2024Updated11:13, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-rebel-lee-anderson-says-31954560,"Flip-flopping Tory hardman Lee Anderson has said he'd take his old job back if Rishi Sunak offered.
The outspoken Ashfield MP dramatically quit as deputy Tory chairman last week in protest over the PM's latest Rwanda Bill. To make matters worse, he said he wanted to vote against the legislation, but changed his mind because other MPs laughed at him.
But now he's had a change of heart and said he wishes he had supported it. Mr Anderson revealed the screeching U-turn as the party descends into a fresh civil war after former minister Sir Simon Clarke said the PM must go in order to avoid an election ""massacre"".
Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Anderson he should have voted for the Safety of Rwanda Bill, which split the party and saw 11 Tories rebel. And he went further. When asked if he would take back his job as deputy chairman, Mr Anderson said: “Yeah, of course I would.”
Reflecting on the drama of the last fortnight he said: “I did wrong. Well I say I did wrong, I acted on a point of principle. I had to resign."" He said he has no malice toward the party leader, who he said his colleagues should back. Mr Anderson told rebel Tory MPs to ""stop being silly"".
It is a puzzling change of heart after Mr Anderson and fellow hardliner Brendan Clarke-Smith both quit saying they couldn't support the Safety of Rwanda Bill. The duo said it needed to be strengthened in order to work. Although he abstained in the crunch vote, he gave a cringeworthy TV interview saying he had planned to oppose it. But giggling Labour MPs put him off.
Explaining why he lost his nerve to GB News, the channel that pays him £100,000 a year as a presenter, Mr Anderson said: ""I was going to vote no. I went into the no lobby to vote no, because I couldn't see how could support the bill after backing all the amendments.
""I got into the no lobby I spent about two or three minutes with a colleague in there. The Labour lot were giggling and laughing and taking the mick and I couldn't do it. In my heart of hearts I could not vote no. So I walked out, and I had come out, so I've abstained. I wanted to vote no, but when I saw that lot in there laughing, there's no way I could support them above the party that's given me a political home.""
His remarks were met with derision. Lib Dem chief whip Wendy Chamberlain posted on Twitter: ""Real conviction in the right of your cause displayed by Lee Anderson there."" Another Twitter user quipped: ""You can imagine 30p Lee in the trenches can’t you?"" Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Anderson said he felt like he was ""letting my party down"" by walking through the 'no' lobby. And he said he ""thought that I probably should have voted for it"" because there was no alternative plan."
B7N8IKP117_CGIQ2F2OTAWVFUM,Steven Moffat slams 'snobby' TV firms for no new sitcoms like Fawlty Towers and Alan Partridge,Mark JefferiesShowbiz Editor,"22:13, 23 Jan 2024Updated12:40, 24 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/steven-moffat-slams-snobby-tv-31951870,"The lack of great new British sitcoms to rival Fawlty Towers, Dad’s Army and Alan Partridge is no laughing matter, according to TV writer Steven Moffat.
Moffat blames “snobby” production companies for turning their noses up at the sitcom, leaving a gap in the television comedy market. The screenwriter had a hit in the Noughties with BBC sitcom Coupling, about the dating adventures of three women, played by Gina Bellman, Sarah Alexander, and Kate Isitt.
He said: “I loved my days back on Coupling. I do think there’s a gap for that ... I don’t know why we stopped making sitcoms. People love them.”
Proof of that, he said, was Not Going Out, starring Lee Mack and Sally Bretton, which began in 2006 and has just finished its 13th series. It is the second longest-running British sitcom behind Last of the Summer Wine.
Moffat said: “Not Going Out is a huge hit. But amongst chattering people, like ourselves, we don’t talk about it as much, but it’s a great show. Every time they put Dad’s Army on it wipes out everything else. I think the general public love sitcoms, and snobby people like, well, me, probably got a bit high-minded for them. It’s well past time we brought back the audience sitcom. People love them.”
As well as being a former showrunner and head writer of Doctor Who, Moffat is also known for teen drama Press Gang and co-creating BBC drama Sherlock alongside Mark Gatiss, but his latest project is a play, The Unfriend.
Moffat said writing sitcoms helped him when it came to getting the live audiences for his play laughing.
He said: “I do think writing those sitcoms educated me a bit in what you have to do with a live audience... and how you make them laugh.” He said his number one sitcom was Fawlty Towers, the 1970s BBC hit. He said: “Fawlty Towers is my favourite sitcom. It’s the best thing ever. I’ve laughed more at Fawlty Towers than anything else, ever.”
But hapless hotel owner Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, is not his most-loved comic creation. He said: “My favourite sitcom character is Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge, because I think the militant maintenance of quality in the presentation of that character is outstanding. Every single iteration has been superb.”
Despite the lack of sitcoms, Moffat believes Britain should be “proud” of the television programmes it makes. Speaking on Times Radio, he said: “We do really well at it. It’s a tremendously thriving business.”

BACM14R2F4_2ENHYT5SAPTFV0F,Love Island star Luis Morrison dumped by secret girlfriend after early exit from All Stars villa,Susan KnoxAssistant Showbiz Editor,"12:32, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/love-island-star-luis-morrison-31974238,"Love Island star Luis Morrison has been dumped by his secret girlfriend after he was the first one to leave the All Stars version of the show.
The reality TV star, 29, was forced to make an early exit on the ITV2 show alongside Demi Jones earlier this week and, despite sharing a passionate kiss with her, it seems he also had someone waiting for him outside. Luis had reportedly been dating a single mum who he met early last year before embarking on his villa return.
Sources suggest that Luis managed to keep this relationship hidden by urging her to ""pretend he was acting in a movie"". To avoid raising any alarms, Luis is said to have decided to keep everything hush-hush so he could return on the show freely. It was also reported that Luis had gone as far as to introduce his daughter Vienna to his secret love interest.
However, while Luis was enjoying his time on Love Island, his secret girlfriend was less than impressed, especially when, as claimed, she was taking care of his child back home. She spoke about her discomfort with his previous girlfriends, Chloe Elizabeth and Cally Jane Beech, according to The Sun.
""She explained she has been hurt by him hooking up with Demi and shocked by the stories about him not paying child maintenance,"" the insider shared. ""Luis told her he was going onto Love Island but had no intention of them breaking up. He told her to pretend he was just acting in a movie. Having a break away from him while he was in the villa gave her the space she needed to find the courage to break up with him.""
Chloe, who has a son named Romeo with Luis, spilled the beans on social media about Luis' plan. She posted: ""Let's also mention, he's left his girlfriend and told her to just think of it like her like he's in a movie, and he'll be back for her.""
In a chat with The Sun, Chloe called out Luis for showing off online but not helping their son. ""He's on lovely holidays, drives a nice car, lives in a nice house in a nice area, wearing his designer clothes yet he hasn't given Romeo any money or support for most of his life.""
She also claimed that Luis is hardly there for Romeo. ""It blows my mind to think if Luis appears in just ten episodes of this series, then Romeo's seen his dad more on TV than he has in person,"" she said.
The Mirror has approached Luis' representatives for comment on this story.
Love Island: All Stars airs every Sunday to Friday at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX.

BD71XACY7A_MX5U2Q6WYSN1SJU,Two Tories defect to Labour with devastating verdict on weak Rishi Sunak,John StevensPolitical Editor,"12:40, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/two-tories-defect-labour-devastating-31938300,"Two Tory councillors have quit the party and defected to Labour with a brutal takedown of Rishi Sunak’s failure to lead the country.
David Wilkes and Archer Williams, who sit on Sandwell Council, said the Conservatives were “unfit to govern”. The pair criticised local West Bromwich MPs Shaun Bailey and Nicola Richards who they accused of failing to stand up to the PM.
Mr Wilkes said: “I made this decision based on a simple question - could I tell my constituents to vote Conservative in the next general election? The answer was no.
“Rishi Sunak is a weak leader, out of ideas, unable to deliver on anything he's promised. Here in Sandwell, the Conservatives are either running away to safer seats or are selfishly squabbling to further their own careers. They are unfit to represent this brilliant part of the country.”
Ms Richards, who is currently the MP for West Bromwich East, is trying to find a seat in another area to stand in at the election. Mr Wilkes added: “Under Keir Starmer, Labour has completely changed into a serious political party that welcomes new ideas and has a positive vision for Sandwell and the whole of the UK.”
Mr Williams said: “Since being elected in 2021 I have put all my energy into serving the people of my community but I can no longer do this with my hands tied behind my back. Over the past 14 years, Conservative government cuts have drastically reduced our ability to deliver for residents across Sandwell.
“I have pleaded with fellow Conservatives - including other councillors and our MPs - to stand up to Rishi Sunak and give our communities what they deserve. My words landed on deaf ears.

BEWHCPU2AG_6J411BTUFLSIIQX,"Teenager named as having deliberately pushed boy, 13, who drowned into river pictured",Benedict Tetzlaff-DeasNews Reporter,"19:37, 22 Jan 2024Updated15:25, 23 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/teen-19-pictured-after-deliberately-31942487,"A teenager named today as having deliberately pushed a 13-year-old boy into a river as part of a 'prank' before he tragically died has now been pictured for the first time tonight.
Christopher Kapessa died after being pushed off a ledge by then-14-year-old Jayden Pugh, into the River Cynon in Fernhill, near Mountain Ash, South Wales, in July 2019. Mr Pugh, now 19, and other school friends jumped into the water to try to rescue Christopher but were unable to save him.
The teenager’s body was recovered by the emergency services nearly two hours after he had entered the water. South Wales Police investigated Christopher’s death and passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider a manslaughter charge.
Prosecutors decided it was not in the public interest to pursue Mr Pugh, a decision later upheld by the High Court after a legal challenge by the Kapessa family. After a two-week inquest, South Wales Central assistant coroner David Regan recorded a narrative conclusion and said Christopher drowned after being pushed into the river by Mr Pugh during a “dangerous prank”.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found “some shortcomings” in the way police communicated with Christopher’s family. Speaking afterwards, his mother, Alina Joseph, criticised decisions made by South Wales Police and said she did not trust the force because of the way her family had been treated. She said: “They had a biased view of me as a black single mother living in the Valleys. The police did not investigate the pattern of racism suffered by Christopher and the family. It was only after I raised concerns that they began to investigate properly. I was a victim of the institutional racist practices of South Wales Police. I deserve better.”
She added: “I have not been able to grieve for Christopher. I’ve been forbidden from grieving for Christopher or mourning his passing. The decision not to prosecute despite the evidence is something I wouldn’t wish upon any mother or any family.”
Ms Joseph said Christopher, who was not a confident swimmer, had been pushed without warning and was “unlawfully killed”. The inquest heard evidence from four teenagers who saw Mr Pugh push Christopher into the river, which contradicted Mr Pugh’s claim that he stumbled and fell into his friend. Mr Pugh had first told police Christopher had slipped and fallen – an account Mr Regan described as “clearly untrue” – and then said he had accidentally knocked him in after stumbling.
However, delivering his conclusions in the case, Mr Regan said: “In my judgment, Christopher was deliberately pushed into the back from behind by Jayden Pugh using his hands. Jayden Pugh pushed Christopher into the water in a misplaced sense of fun, namely as a prank, and not with any malicious intention.”
During the inquest Ms Joseph described racist abuse that the family had suffered since moving from London to Wales, including her children being beaten, Christopher being urinated on, and being physically dragged by his neck. Mr Regan described their experience as “extremely disheartening” and said it was to the family’s credit that, despite it, Christopher remained an “active and well-liked member of his community”.
He added: “There has been no suggestion during the inquest that Christopher’s death resulted from a racially motivated act. It is important that I make clear at the outset of these findings that there is no evidence at all that Christopher’s death was caused by any racially motivated action or antipathy. When he was present at the riverbank he was there with a group of school friends of broadly the same age.”
The coroner said there had been previous misreporting of the case, which meant a narrative conclusion was appropriate given the need to clarify what happened. During the inquest, police described how Mr Pugh had been dubbed a “killer or murderer” on social media, with one campaign linking Christopher’s death to the murder of Stephen Lawrence.
At times, Mr Pugh’s family were moved from the area and police safeguarding measures were put in place to protect them and their home. The IOPC published its findings into complaints made by Christopher’s family, after the inquest.
It said it found “some shortcomings” in the way South Wales Police dealt with Christopher’s family, adding that communications by officers could have been better. A complaint by his family that officers concluded he had died as a result of an accident, without proper investigation, was not upheld.
Evidence did not suggest the family were treated less favourably by police because of their race. David Ford, director of the IOPC, said: “While it is clear that aspects of communication with Christopher’s family could and should have been handled better by South Wales Police, we found no evidence to justify bringing any disciplinary proceedings against individual officers.”
Assistant Chief Constable Danny Richards, of South Wales Police, said Christopher’s death had “deeply shocked and affected” many people. ""We hope that this independent scrutiny and the outcome of the inquest proceedings will give us a greater understanding of the issues which have been raised about this case,” he said.
Jenny Hopkins, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Cymru/Wales, said the reasons why Mr Pugh was not prosecuted had been made clear previously. She added: “Our decision that a prosecution was not in the public interest was considered and upheld as lawful by the Administrative Court in 2022.”"
BK7U67N87H_Y0JNB0UJJDLZKAI,Tory chairman teases two tax-cutting announcements this year to keep MPs on-side,Lawrence Matheson,"15:34, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tory-chairman-teases-two-tax-31977131,"The Tory party chairman has hinted at two tax-cutting financial announcements this year, as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak battles to keep his MPs on-side amid fears he will lead them to defeat.
Richard Holden mentioned tax cuts in the March 6 Budget and added that there will be ""more of that later in the year as well"" after a tough week for the Prime Minister. With the Conservatives lagging behind Labour in the polls by 20 points, ex-Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke warned they risk being electorally ""massacred"" if they don't oust Mr Sunak.
Will Dry, a former aide who conducted polling in No 10, said the country is ""on course for at least a decade of Labour rule"" as it was revealed he had joined a rebel plot to topple the PM. Mr Holden insisted the polls ""can move quite rapidly"" as he tried to reassure the party by promising popular tax cuts.
He told GB News: ""What we are now in is a situation where we are coming out of that very tough period, and we're able to outline our plans for the future. And I think the actual tax cut you mentioned the national insurance cut for working people is the start of that."" ""We'll see more of that in March, and more of that later in the year as well. We have that new direction of travel, which is clear.""
It wasn't clear from his comments whether the second fiscal event would be before or after the election, with the power to trigger a vote being down to the Prime Minister. Mr Sunak has hinted that he expects to hold the election in the latter half of this year. This comes amidst a storm for the Tory leader, sparked by an opinion poll suggesting a potential landslide defeat similar to 1997.
Tory peer Lord David Frost used the YouGov research to warn that the Conservatives are ""going to lose, and lose bad, unless we do something about it"". The former Cabinet minister was listed as the contact on the poll, which was commissioned by a group known as the Conservative Britain Alliance.
The Times first reported that Lord Frost could face losing the Conservative whip for refusing to disclose who funded the poll. He was reportedly surprised by the persistent questioning from the Conservative leader of the Lords, Lord True.
It's believed that Lord Frost was warned he could lose the whip if he had collaborated with another party, following questions about whether Reform UK provided the funds. A source close to the peer stated: ""I can confirm the meeting took place but Lord Frost, even on background, won't reveal the content of a private meeting. It's not his style.""
In other news, senior Tory backbenchers including Harriet Baldwin have reportedly called for a change in party rules to secure Mr Sunak's position. At present, 15% of Conservative MPs currently 53 need to send letters to the 1922 Committee of backbenchers to trigger a vote of no confidence.
There's chatter that MPs might need to double their numbers to show they're unhappy, with 175 needed to speak up. Ms Baldwin, who leads the Commons Treasury Committee, didn't say no to this. She said: ""Call me old-fashioned, but I like to adhere to the privacy and discretion of the 1922 Committee as a forum for backbench colleagues to raise discussion points about topical matters.""

BKU0O10EZQ_PY7OE1JU16YP2X1,'My boyfriend is in prison so other men buy me gifts and send money - it's a win-win',Niamh KirkLifestyle Writer,"13:22, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/sex-relationships/relationships/my-boyfriend-prison-men-buy-31946173,"A woman has revealed that despite her boyfriend being in prison, she still gets spoilt - it's just from other men.
Saffron opened up about getting lavish gifts and money from other blokes while her boyfriend Luke is serving time behind bars, as she she sees her situation as a win-win.
Her generous gift-givers are usually married men who spoil her with designer goods and cash. Before meeting Luke, Saffron was a self-confessed sugar baby, and quickly became used to the expensive gifts and lavish lifestyle. Now she's gone back to her old ways while her man is behind bars to bridge the gap.
The stay-at-home girlfriend says she met Luke in a casino while she was working in a strip club in Soho, London, claiming it was ""love at first sight"". As the relationship grew, Saffron decided to give up her stripping gig as Luke was providing for her and buying her expensive gifts. But this all changed when he got arrested.
""When Luke told me he was going to jail, I was frozen. It felt like a shameful thing... at the end of the day prisons exist because people do things wrong things,"" she shared in a chat with YouTube show Love Don't Judge.
However, she wanted to keep up her fancy lifestyle while Luke was behind bars and started up being a sugar baby again. Saffron says that other 'prison wives' don't agree with her decision to take gifts from other blokes, as they argue it would make them feel uncomfortable when visiting Luke. But she's doubled down on her decision.
Saffron said: """"I started being a sugar baby again 6 months ago whilst Luke is in jail. He has no choice that I'm a sugar baby. He's in there and I'm out here and I need to maintain the lifestyle that I'm accustomed to.
""I am used to just waking up and not having to think about money, not having to worry about money it's for my own financial reassurance because I always wanted to be sort of a stay-at-home girlfriend and I always envisioned I would be surrounded by money and wealth.""
Although Saffron finds it hard, she and Luke will write letters to each other, which she says makes her feel ""loved"" and ""safe"". He is a year and a half through his sentence, and Saffron hopes he will be home in just under another year and a half. The woman admitted she's reduced her visits to see him as it's ""emotional"", while accepting gifts from other men.
In a documentary clip, Saffron held up a pair of £400 designer trainers she received from one of her sugar daddies and called them ""cute"" while saying it was ""£400 I didn't have to spend on myself"". She explained: ""Every sugar baby is definitely different I really rely just on financial transactions I barely even talk to these men.
""I have never ever been intimate with any of these guys I have actually only been with my partner Luke. I fell into the stripping industry when I was really young some of the girls in the industry introduced me to being a sugar baby and it just went on from there.""
When it comes to what type of sugar daddies Saffron looks for, she revealed she prefers a married man because there is ""no hassle"". She said: ""[He] wants to protect his wife so when you hear from him it will literally be because he wants to buy you something or give you some money. I don't feel bad for the man's partner or children because at the end of the day, it should be up to him to say no and to turn away other women.""
Saffron then shared the first gift she ever received from a sugar daddy was a Louis Vuitton handbag that cost £900 - and is now worth a lot more. This is what started her ""want and need"" from men. She now buys Luke gifts with the money she makes from being a sugar baby too.
""Luke probably feels like emasculated at times because he is so used to gifting himself and me and then it's now coming from another man's pocket. Luke can't have a bag in prison so these will all just be wrapped and waiting for when he comes home. What I do is I send him a picture of the bag so he'll know what brand he's got,"" the woman explained.
Saffron will go shopping and find items she likes, and will then ask one of her sugar daddies to send her the money for the items. Despite her friends not being a fan of her and Luke's relationship and trying to convince her to find someone who gives her the love she needs - she is happy with her relationship and is waiting for him to be released.

BL0030RPW8_ML7NZP3FL68XII1,Donald Trump's 'mental fitness' questioned as he struggles to remember campaign slogan,Abigail O'LearyNews Reporter,"09:28, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trumps-mental-fitness-questioned-31944549,"Donald Trump's 'mental fitness' is being questioned again after a series of blunders and confusion at his campaign rally.
Democrats are now questioning Trump's mental abilities, turning the tables after years of Republicans criticising Biden for being mentally unfit to serve due to his age. Now 81-year-old Biden has joined in, sharing a video of Trump's latest verbal slip-ups, including past confusing statements.
Just days ago, Donald Trump seemed to confuse Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley while talking about the January 6 Capitol attack. At a New Hampshire rally, Trump commented on the size of the crowd, saying: ""You know when [Haley] comes here she gets like nine people, and the press never reports the crowds you know"".
He continued: ""By the way, they never report the crowd on Jan. 6. You know Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they - do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it.""

Trump got mixed up and the Biden team quickly tweeted about it: ""A deeply confused Trump confuses Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley multiple times: Nikki Haley was in charge on January 6. They don't want to talk about that."" Democrats, including Biden, have been spreading a video of Trump mixing up former Speaker Nancy Pelosi with his political opponent Nikki Haley.
The Biden campaign also said: ""Can you imagine the field day @FoxNews and Trump would have had if @JoeBiden had gone on, at length, confusing Gavin Newsom with Kevin McCarthy?!??"" David Axelrod, who used to work with Obama, wrote this on X.
Last week, Trump showed up with odd red marks on his hands. He waved to everyone, and people saw three big red spots on his hand, making them wonder about his health. Some people online guessed he might be using a special ink or even that the marks could mean he has syphilis - a rumour that James Carville, who worked for Bill Clinton, seems to believe.

Despite wild rumours, it turns out the marks on his hands came from something way less dramatic. Confirming to TMZ, his team said it was merely a paper cut. He'd accidentally smeared the blood across his hand creating an illusion, it emerged. There was no sign of the cut by the time he went to his mother-in-law's funeral in Florida.
Former top Democrat posted a video on his YouTube channel making an outrageous, unverified claim. He suggested that Trump's hand marks were symptoms of syphilis, a sexually transmitted condition usually marked by sores. He claimed: ""They don't look like cuts to me. They look like sores. And I've asked a number of MDs (doctors), what medical condition manifests itself through hand sores and the answer is immediate and unanimous - secondary syphilis.""
Syphilis, a predominantly sexually transmitted infection, is typically characterised by red sores and a rash. There are four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary, each presenting different signs. Symptoms of the second stage often include sores around the mouth or genitals, as well as a rash on your palms or soles.

Chippewa County Judge Steven Gibbs, in a 22-page decision issued Monday, sided with the state in ruling that court proceedings in the slaying of 10-year-old Iliana ""Lily"" Peters will remain in adult court, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
Gibbs recently heard arguments from lawyers representing the suspect who sought to have the case moved to juvenile court. They argued the teen would receive better treatment in the juvenile system. The teen, listed in court documents as C.P.-B., is charged with first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree sexual assault in the girl's April 24, 2022, death.

In his decision, Gibbs agreed with prosecutors that moving the case to the juvenile system would diminish the severity of the act.  ""The court disagrees that a possible 10-year confinement in the juvenile system, registering as a sex offender and that the Defendant would be vulnerable to the adult system would be punishment enough for the Defendant,"" the judge wrote.
The teen allegedly persuaded the girl to leave a trail and explore the surrounding woods as she was riding her bike home from her aunt's house in Chippewa Falls. Searchers found her body the next morning.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
The boy told investigators that after they left the trail, he punched her, hit her with a heavy stick and strangled her until she died, then sexually assaulted her body, according to a criminal complaint. Lily’s father reported her missing on April 24 after didn't return home from a visit to her aunt’s house in the 400 block of North Grove Street in Chippewa Falls. Her bike was found later that night in some woods less than a mile from where Lily’s aunt lives.
Lily's body was found the next day. She had been strangled, sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a large stick. The suspect, who was 14 at the time of the killing, was arrested and held on $1 million bail.
The teen faces a mandatory life sentence if he's convicted on the homicide charge alone. Anyone who is at least 10 years old and is accused of first- or second-degree homicide is considered an adult in Wisconsin's court system."
BN226RZR1K_R1OJN8KNGIH5LN4,WHO warns of 'alarming rise' in Victorian disease measles cases - full list of symptoms,Susie BeeverNews Reporter,"23:23, 23 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/who-warns-alarming-rise-victorian-31951871,"Measles cases have soared exponentially with an almost 45-fold rise in cases across Europe, the World Health Organisation has warned.
Health officials are seeing an alarming rise in cases of the disease, which predominantly affects children and has been known to be deadly or cause lifelong disabilities. According to WHO, there were 42,200 cases reported by member states last year - compared with 941 the year before.
Two in five cases were children aged between one and four, while one in five were patients who were 20 or older. WHO officials have now said the figure could rise further if parents do not vaccinate their children against the disease.
It comes as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) released new figures revealing 144 new measles cases in the UK this month alone, 74 of which were in the first week of January and a further 70 over the following seven-day period. The biggest rise in cases so far has been in the West Midlands where 36 cases were reported in the week to 14 January.
Measles is a viral infection resulting in a fever, cough and small red spots with white-blue centres on the skin and inside the mouth. While children in most cases will recover, it has been known to affect the lungs leading to serious complications which can cause permanent health issues.
It's been linked to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures, and in 2021 WHO recorded 128,000 measles deaths – most of whom were children under the age of five. UK health officials are now also pushing for more parents to get their child inoculated with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR).
Measles often starts out with cold-like symptoms, but then is followed by a rash.
Cold-like symptoms:
Then, small white spots can appear in the mouth, these usually last a few days. Then the distinctive measles-like rash develops.
Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said it was ""vital"" to respond rapidly to the outbreak. “Vaccination is the only way to protect children from this potentially dangerous disease,” he said. “Urgent vaccination efforts are needed to halt transmission and prevent further spread.
“It is vital that all countries are prepared to rapidly detect and timely respond to measles outbreaks, which could endanger progress towards measles elimination.” WHO said that sliding vaccination rates were to blame, but more people were now travelling abroad after Covid-19, increasing the risk of cross-border disease transmission and spread within communities.
On Friday, the head of the UKHSA warned the UK is on a “trajectory for everything getting much worse” when it comes to measles spreading. Professor Dame Jenny Harries told the PA news agency that “concerted action” is needed to tackle the virus, as she visited a measles blackspot in the West Midlands.
She suggested the majority of people are not against their child receiving the MMR jab, but that they need more information to feel confident about their decision. She added: “What we are seeing at the moment with measles is that people have forgotten what a serious illness it is…
“We have had very high vaccination rates, especially for young families, but they are low at the moment.” Vaccination rates across the country have been dropping, but there are particular concerns about some regions, including parts of London and the West Midlands.
UKHSA data on measles cases in the UK shows the majority have been in children aged under 10. The authority has declared a national incident, which it said is an internal mechanism signalling the growing public health risk and enabling it to focus work in specific areas.
Official figures show uptake of the vaccine is at its lowest point in more than a decade. In 2022/23, some 84.5% of youngsters in England had received both doses of the jab by the time they were five years old – the lowest level since 2010/11. Some 92.5% had received one dose.
Mike Tildesley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick and an expert in disease spread and Covid, said the R number for measles – the number of people that one infected person will pass the illness on to – is much higher than for Covid. “This means we need over 90% of the population to be immune or you’re going to start seeing cases growing,” he said.
“We have childhood vaccinations for measles which for many years have helped us to get rid of the disease. Unfortunately, if those vaccination levels drop then we will start to see cases going up and that’s what we are seeing at the moment.”"

And luckily, the glass test should help you find it early and get the requisite medical treatment.
Some of the bacteria that cause the infection are also responsible for septicaemia, which can develop into a rash of tiny red or 'pin-prick' marks, which if not treated appropriately can have a negative impact.
Luckily, experts have revealed the details of the glass test. The simple experiment is used to see whether a rash fades under pressure. In this instance, if someone has a combination of a fever and a rash that does not fade under these circumstances, it is recommended to head straight to the doctor for immediate medical attention.
If you're concerned that you may be suffering from the infection, follow Meningitis Now's simple steps to conducting the glass test on yourself.
A meningitis rash is caused by bacteria in the bloodstream. They multiply at a staggering rate, releasing extremely harmful endotoxins (poisons) from their outer coating. Sadly, while our body has a remarkable natural defence system, there is little it can do to deter these poisons, which damage our blood vessels. As the septicaemia charges through the body, it begins to dismantle everything in its path, causing potential organ failure.
The rash, synonymous with the condition, comes to the surface through blood leaking into the tissues under our skin. However, while most merely look out for a rash, septicaemia can cause an array of symptoms that you should keep an eye out for. These include:
If you live on your own and start to deteriorate, do not feel bad about reaching out to someone for help. Furthermore, if you visit the doctors and don't receive a diagnosis, bear in mind that early diagnosis is difficult. Do not feel guilty about going back to the doctor if you deem it necessary.

This comes as the former First Lady continues to be noticeably absent from her husband's side, especially during his recent victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire.
Despite this being his second primary win, Melania was nowhere to be seen during the celebrations. This absence followed shortly after the couple were seen travelling separately following Melania's mother's funeral. An expert suggests that this could be part of Melania's attempt to distance herself and Barron from Donald's increasing legal issues.

Donald Trump is currently facing multiple investigations at both state and federal levels. These have resulted in him being sued by the New York attorney general and criminally indicted in four separate cases. Two of these cases have been brought forward by special counsel Jack Smith, one by the Manhattan district attorney, and another by local prosecutors in Georgia.
In addition to this, there are several attempts to prevent him from appearing on state ballots following his rally before the deadly riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He is also dealing with numerous lawsuits and 91 felony charges across four states, all while running his campaign for the presidency.

Grant Reeher, a political expert, told TheMirror.com that Melania might not want to be in the spotlight again because of her husband's troubles. He said: ""The family was very involved in the past two campaigns for president, so I'd think they would be involved again. From a distance, it seems that Melania became less enthusiastic about this role as the controversies and the scandals mounted, so I don't know how involved she'll want to be this time around.""
He also mentioned that Melania might want to protect her son Barron from too much media attention. He added: ""And she may be keen to guard Barron from becoming too exposed. Once you draw on your family, they become fair game for the media and opposition research.""
Professor Reeher added that Trump's other family members are likely to support him again. He said: ""His other adult children and in-laws were very keen to be involved in both his campaigns and his White House administration, and I see no reason why they wouldn't want to do that again.""
Donald and Melania Trump didn't publicly celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary recently. After the death of Melania's mother, the former President and First Lady were seen traveling in separate cars.
Despite Melania being out of the spotlight, Donald Trump has insisted that his wife Melania will be a key part of his campaign. A video clip circulating online shows Melania getting into a black SUV with her security team, while Donald waits before heading to another vehicle. This sparked speculation online about their relationship, with one Twitter user commenting: ""Separate cars,"" and others suggesting they lead ""Separate lives.""
However, Trump dismissed these rumours during an interview with Fox News' Brian Kilmeade. He said: ""She's gonna play, and she always did play a big role,"" adding, ""She was somebody that you could rely on. She's very smart, a very compassionate person...she wants to make America Great again, too.""
He also revealed: ""And I would rely on her for advice,"" Trump said. ""I think she's going to be very active in the sense of being active, at the same time, I don't want my family to be too active because they did such a great job last time.""

On his show, Morgan said: ""We hadn't spoken since our rather contentious interview we did, actually launching this show a while ago. We had a very nice chat and I've got to say he was exuding chilling confidence about what is happening. He really just believes he is going to win."" Piers also admitted he was wrong about Trump before, comparing him to Frank Sinatra.
Talking on TalkTV, Morgan discussed Trump's big win in the Iowa caucus, saying: ""A year ago [Trump] was completely written off, not least by people like me! He helmed the Republicans into a disastrous midterm. He was facing a mountain of legal action. He's been a serial loser.""
He added: ""Many think he's a serial liar and dangerous, but he had the biggest win in Iowa caucus history last night, the comeback king is on the march."" Trump's recent win appears to have boosted his confidence, as Trump immediately took to TruthSocial to write a number of comments about Nikki Haley and Joe Biden, before calling Morgan to brag - much to the talk show host's delight.
Lara Trump, Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and senior campaign advisor, said Donald was feeling ""confident"" about reclaiming the Presidency. She stated: ""He is in it to win it, we've had a couple of great primaries... we are going to go on now and head to November 5th""
In a previous interview, which ended with Donald Trump storming out, the two TV figures traded insults and criticisms. Trump labelled Morgan dishonest and a ""fool"" before refusing to continue, ending the interview and shouting ""turn the camera off.""
Former mates Donald Trump and Piers Morgan had a heated exchange during their chat, with the ex-president being questioned about the US presidential election. Piers reminded Trump that he lost in 2020 and it was a ""free and fair election,"" which made Trump lose his cool. ""Only a fool would think that,"" Trump retorted. ""You think I'm a fool?"" Piers shot back. ""I do now, yeah,"" Trump replied. The interview ended with Trump storming out.
But this isn't the first time these two have had a row - or patched things up. Their friendship began to crumble in 2020 when Piers criticised the US President for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Piers once wrote: ""President Trump's bats*** crazy coronavirus 'cure' theories are not just shockingly senseless and stupid they're going to kill people.""
In what seemed like a clear sign of a fallout, Trump quickly unfollowed Piers on Twitter, marking an apparent end to their friendship. After Trump tested positive for coronavirus, Piers labelled him as ""an anti-role model,"" ""tone-deaf,"" and a ""super spreader."" He also called the president ""reckless"" for getting into a car with his security team and putting their ""lives at risk.""
Trump hit back, branding Piers Morgan as ""disloyal"" and a part of the ""fake news media."" However, a year later, the pair patched things up when Trump rang the presenter, who had been slammed for going easy on him during his show, rekindling their friendship.

BSAP7U9QUW_GU9FLAJ5VVS2HD1,Death Row killer who SURVIVED execution will become first put to death with nitrogen gas,Christopher BucktinUnited States Editor,"14:33, 22 Jan 2024Updated15:25, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/death-row-killer-who-survived-31939178,"America is to move forward with its first-ever nitrogen gas execution as a US inmate faces the death penalty for a second time.
Barring a successful appeal, Kenneth Smith will be moved to Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility's ""death cell"" on Tuesday ahead of his killing on Thursday. It will be the second time the 58-year-old will have gone through the procedure after a previous bungled lethal injection failed to work. Speaking ahead of his execution, Smith said: ""I am not ready for that. Not in no kind of way. I'm just not ready, brother.""
The convicted murderer has told how he has been left haunted by a recurring nightmare of being escorted back into the death chamber. He said: ""All I had to do was walk into the room in the dream for it to be overwhelming. I was absolutely terrified. It kept coming up."" Smith added: ""I dream that they're coming to get me.""
Alabama attempted to execute him in November 2022 by lethal injection. He was strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber for nearly four hours, being prepared for lethal injection, but the state called it off when staff had difficulty connecting the second of two required intravenous lines to his veins.

Nitrogen hypoxia is authorised as a capital punishment method in Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma. Still, it has never been used to put an inmate to death. The proposed execution method would use a gas mask placed over Smith's nose and mouth to replace breathable air with nitrogen, causing the inmate to die from lack of oxygen.
Attorneys for the convicted murderer have argued the new execution method is unconstitutional and also cited religious concerns. His attorneys said the mask, which Alabama intends to place over his face before execution witnesses arrive, would interfere with his ability to pray aloud and make a final statement before his execution.
After Smith is strapped to the gurney, the state said in a court filing that it will place a ""NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator"" - a type of mask typically used in industrial settings to deliver life-preserving oxygen — over his face.
The warden will then read the death warrant and ask Smith if he has any last words before activating ""the nitrogen hypoxia system"" from another room. The gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or ""five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,"" according to the state protocol.
The Alabama attorney general's office told a federal judge that the nitrogen gas would ""cause unconsciousness within seconds and cause death within minutes."" On Friday, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals heard differing descriptions of the humaneness and potential risks of the proposed method. The three judges on the panel asked questions about the proposed method, including claims that it could cause Smith to choke to death on his own vomit. They did not indicate when they would rule.
A stay would leave Alabama with a potential problem as US prisons can no longer source the drugs used for lethal injections after the makers banned their use for executions. It is why many states have been left seeking alternative methods with some even considering firing squads.
Prosecutors said Smith and another man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett in 1988 by her husband Reverend Charles Sennett, who was in deep debt and wanted to collect on insurance. He killed himself a week after his wife's death when the murder investigation started to focus on him as a suspect. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the killing, was executed in 2010. Smith was sentenced to death by a judge in 1996, despite a jury voting 11-1 to recommend that he receive life imprisonment."
BTY7QQSRR1_4XYFOVL0WZSQTUU,Tory London mayoral candidate Susan Hall stumped by most basic question in LBC meltdown,Sophie HuskissonPolitical Correspondent,"11:57, 22 Jan 2024Updated12:18, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-london-mayoral-candidate-susan-31937091,"The Tory candidate to be London Mayor has admitted she doesn't know the price of a bus fare - just days after criticising a decision to freeze fares in the capital.
Susan Hall was unable to answer the basic question in a painful LBC radio interview, where she was grilled on issues facing Londoners. Asked how much people have to pay to get on a bus in the city, she said: ""I don't use them. I use trains all the time."" The astonished presenter, Nick Ferrari, said: ""You don't know what a bus fare is?"" Ms Hall responded simply: ""No.""
Labour's Dawn Butler said Ms Hall was ""seriously unfit to be London Mayor and clearly doesn’t understand the cost of living in London"". The Brent Central MP said: ""She's running for Mayor but hasn't grasped the basics - like the price of a London bus fare, how little a Met police officer earns, or who owns Hammersmith Bridge. And her values are also totally out of line with Londoners
""We’re asking Londoners to once again vote for Sadiq, who has a proven track record in delivering for London, and prevent someone being elected who is out-of-touch, totally out of her depth and would be a disaster for the capital.""
The radio gaffe comes after Ms Hall criticised Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's announcement on Friday of a funding boost of £123million to freeze Transport for London (TfL) fares until March 2025. The freeze will apply to pay-as-you-go fares for bus, Tube, DLR and tram journeys, and the majority of those fares for London Overground and Elizabeth line trips. It means a bus fare will remain at £1.75.
Ms Hall, his Conservative opponent in May's mayoral election, described the policy as a ""last roll of the dice"". ""This fares freeze is Sadiq Khan's last roll of the dice, because he knows that his eight years of failure will catch up with him this May,"" she said.
""After pleading poverty throughout his mayoralty, Sadiq Khan expects us to believe that he has miraculously conjured up this money, when the truth is we will be paying for it through increased council tax, his unfair Ulez expansion and a new tax that will charge you for every mile you drive."" A spokesman for Mr Khan hit back: ""Pay per mile charging has been ruled out by the mayor and no such scheme is on the table.""
Pressed on LBC whether she would reverse the fare freeze, Ms Hall said: ""I don't know. Let's wait and see what the finances are… Nick, Sadiq Khan has been screaming that he hasn't got enough money for the last seven years… I suspect it would stay in place. I wonder where the money has come from. Don't forget, he has spent seven years saying he's got no money. He's been underfunded. And yet suddenly he's got money to do a fare freeze. Oh, guess why? There's an election coming.
""He'll find other monies for all sorts of other things. And it's because there's an election coming. But in the last seven years, he's been depriving various vital services from money – and I would suggest definitely the police – in order that he can have a bumper year now just before an election and buy the votes, quite frankly.""
Conservative politicians previously criticised Mr Khan for freezing fares for the first four years after he was elected in May 2016, claiming this damaged TfL's finances and contributed to the transport body being reliant on Government bailouts following the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Khan has insisted the need for funding was caused by the collapse in revenue from the drop in passenger numbers due to the virus crisis.
City Hall said an example of the benefits of the freeze include someone commuting from Hornchurch to a central London station five days a week avoiding a potential 20p increase to their fare, saving up to £90 a year.
The car crash LBC interview also saw Ms Hall unable to say who owns London's Hammersmith Bridge, which has been closed to vehicles for almost five years. It was revealed last week the cost of repairing the bridge have nearly doubled from initial estimates. Ms Hall was criticised by an LBC caller after saying ""it's not very clear"" who owns the bridge.
She said: ""Well it's between the two councils apparently. It's not very clear but at the end of the day the Mayor is in charge of London and if things are not working they have to step in."" A member of the public who phoned in hit back: ""Well I'm a bit disappointed by this response because it shows a basic factual misunderstanding of the case. The bridge doesn't belong to two councils. It only belongs to one council, which is Hammersmith and Fulham."""
C3SA9LGTG2_DILQ129RQJOMO6V,"Bill Roache facing bankruptcy despite earning £250,000-a-year as Ken Barlow on ITV Coronation Street",Jeremy ArmstrongNews Reporter,"19:19, 25 Jan 2024Updated20:38, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-bill-roache-facing-bankruptcy-31969792,"Coronation Street star Bill Roache is facing bankruptcy after HMRC filed a petition against him.
It is understood Roache, 91, who has played Ken Barlow in the soap since 1960, is the highest-paid member of the cast, earning around £250,000 a year.
HMRC said it does not comment on individual cases. But a spokesperson said tonight: ""We take a supportive approach to dealing with customers who have tax debts, and do everything we can to help those who engage with us to get out of debt, such as offering instalment plans.
“We only petition for bankruptcy as a last resort.” A spokesperson for Coronation Street said: ""We're really sorry to hear of Bill's financial situation. Bill has an ongoing contract with Coronation Street and remains a much-loved member of the cast.""
In 2018 the Mirror told how the actor faced a huge bill after investing in a £500million Cayman Islands tax avoidance scheme. It was not known how much he had invested in Twofold First Services LLP, owned by a company in the Caymans. But he was one of 288 investors who entered the scheme and put in, on average, £1.75million.
Papers seen by The Mirror showed he joined the scheme in March 2012. It involved claiming tax relief from the artificial losses of a land-owning business. The complex arrangement meant investors could use the paper loss to reduce their income tax.
A tribunal later ruled in favour of HMRC, which successfully argued Twofold was ""a tax avoidance arrangement"". It was branded ""abusive and artificial"" by the Treasury. Explaining why a bankruptcy petition is issued, a HMRC spokesman said yesterday. “When we file a petition for bankruptcy that is us applying to the court in order to allow us to obtain a bankruptcy order.”
He said filing a petition was a “last resort”. “We might have an outstanding tax debt, if someone refused to engage with us and pay the tax that is due, then as a last resort we will issue a bankruptcy action and issuing petition for bankruptcy is obviously how we go about that in terms of the correct legal process. That is in order to recover the tax that they owe but as I say, it is the sort of thing we do as a last resort.""
Bill was declared bankrupt 24 years ago after he successfully sued a newspaper for describing him as “boring”. He was awarded £50,000 in damages but it was the same amount he had turned down in an out-of-court settlement before the case, leaving him liable for £120,000 in costs.
Bill sued his law firm for negligence but was declared bankrupt in 1999. He is one of Britain’s best-loved TV stars and signed another year-long deal to stay on as Ken Barlow last month.
He has appeared in the ITV1 soap since it was first broadcast on December 9, 1960, and has said he wants to keep playing Ken until he is 100. In 2022 the actor, who lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, received an OBE from King Charles for services to drama and charity.
Bill, the world’s longest-serving soap star, who already had an MBE, said at the time: ""I'm delighted to be receiving an OBE as it's such a wonderful honour. I can't tell you how proud I am.
""Coronation Street has given me so much in life and I absolutely love the programme and everyone who works on the show.”

C5TNA2SF9P_I3ROI8HHMBH3CGI,Bank of England and Government issue update on launch of digital pound,Lawrence Matheson,"14:46, 25 Jan 2024",20230125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/bank-england-government-issue-update-31967073,"The Bank of England and the Government are still unsure about launching a digital pound, following feedback from around 50,000 responses.
The Bank and the Treasury started a consultation last year about the potential for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), but a final decision won't be made until at least 2025.
A design for the system is being created, which could see digital money used by UK households and businesses alongside cash and bank deposits. If the plans go ahead, a prototype digital pound could be built and introduced to the public by the end of the decade.
The consultation has cost the Bank between £1 million and £10 million so far and gathered feedback from over 51,000 people, businesses, think tanks and academics. Many respondents expressed concerns about whether a digital pound could infringe on their rights, as the currency would be issued and held by the central bank.
""The Bank and HM Treasury recognise the strength of feeling on these matters and the need to build public trust in a digital pound"", the response read. The Government has announced that new laws would need to be introduced before a digital pound could be launched. This is to ensure the state and the central bank can't access people's personal data, giving users freedom in how they spend their money.
Legislation won't be introduced until at least next year. UK banks have voiced concerns about the potential for people to quickly withdraw money from their current accounts after the currency is launched, a situation known as a ""bank run"". They compared this with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the US last year, which was caused by a rush of customers withdrawing money.
Most banks suggested a limit of between £3,000 and £5,000 that people could hold. Designs are currently being drawn up, but it's likely that the digital pound could be used similarly to a current bank account, with people's money stored in a ""digital wallet"".
The Government said the digital pound is intended to be a means of payment, not a savings product, so like cash, it wouldn't pay any interest when launched.
There's also likely to be an initial limit of between £10,000 and £20,000. Economic secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami said: ""We are at an exciting time of innovation in money and payments, and we want to ensure the UK is ready should a decision to build a digital pound be taken in the future. This is the latest stage in our national conversation on the future of our money and it is far from the last."" ""We will always ensure people's privacy is paramount in any design and any rollout would be alongside, not instead of, traditional cash.""
Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, revealed: ""We know the decision on whether or not to introduce a digital pound in the UK will be a major one for the future of money. It is essential that we build trust and have the support of the public and businesses if we decide to introduce it.""
The Treasury Committee, a group of cross-party MPs, believe that laws must protect privacy to avoid data misuse. Harriett Baldwin, Chair of the Committee, stated it was ""vital that this is only undertaken if the benefits are shown to clearly outweigh the risks"".

CA7H05UXWR_QF7SEOXIWJPFBWJ,BBC Dragons' Den fans label 'caveman' business 'really weird' as viewers blast 'p*** take' pitch,Alan JohnsonReporter,"23:30, 25 Jan 2024Updated10:06, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-dragons-den-fans-label-31970934,"An unorthodox pitch left Dragons' Den viewers baffled on Thursday evening, with one of the programme's businessmen going as far as labelling it ""really weird"".
Aspiring husband and wife entrepreneurs Dan and Naomi Walmsley stole the show as they entered the BBC's Den dressed as a barefooted caveman and cavewoman. The couple, along with their 'cave children' appealed to the five Dragons for an investment of ""40,000 acorns"" in order to expand their business.
Dan began the pitch, explaining: ""We are the Stone Age company, and we deliver Stone Age education and workshops to primary school children. Natalie added that their family's clothes were made with bare hands and had been designed for living in the wild."" She told the Dragons: ""We’ve lived out in the wild twice, for around about a month, just surviving off the land.""
Naomi continued: ""We hunted, we fished, we foraged, we slept in caves, and pretty much survived."" Intrigued, it prompted Deborah Meaden to admit she had ""connected with the Earth"" by going barefoot too. The peculiarity of the discussion left her co-star declaring it was all ""really weird"", however.
Deborah, who has been a mainstay on the show since 2006, was less than impressed by the pair's number crunching though, hitting out at their ""Stone Age budgeting system"". In a bid to rescue the pitch, Naomi confessed: ""Currently we live in a static caravan in my parents’ driveway so we’re not paying rent and we can practice living sustainably. We live pretty frugally.""
Perplexed viewers soon took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare their confusion at the episode, with one commenting: ""The first pitch tonight and looks like The Flintstones have entered the den."" Another asked: ""Are they taking the p***?"" A third wrote: ""It’s descended into an absolute joke now this programme."" A fourth saw the funny side at least though, penning: ""I haven’t stopped laughing yet. Oh damn. I honestly can’t believe this is for real.""

Unsurprisingly, all five Dragons went on to declare they were ""out"", though Stephen Bartlett hailed the ""importance"" of their idea and Peter offered to help them in the future in some form. Optimist Dan exited the Den, declaring: ""They gave us hope in a way,"" to which his spouse replied: ""We can continue being us.""
A statement by Dan on the Stone Age Company's web site reads: ""The lessons learned from our time in the wild continue to resonate and weave through our teachings, breathing life into the Stone Age for those eager to explore the essence of survival, resourcefulness, and the profound connection between humans and nature.""

CCJ3ZW3CA3_QBIYUMS4H1MRZ4O,Man died after falling asleep in mobility scooter and plunging off seafront promenade,Bradley JollyNews Reporter,"19:38, 26 Jan 2024Updated15:01, 29 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-died-after-falling-asleep-31979140,"A man died after accidentally falling asleep in his mobility scooter and plunging off a seafront promenade.
John Gray's accident sparked a coroner to write to a council to share concerns there could be similar falls in the future without a barrier or warning signs in place at Felixstowe, Suffolk.
Mr Gray suffered multiple rib fractures after he fell “several feet” onto the sand below on July 9, 2022. He was dashed to hospital where he died four days later following respiratory failure.
Nigel Parsley, Suffolk’s senior coroner, filed a prevention of future deaths report published this month, highlighting fears more falls could happen. An earlier inquest concluded that Mr Gray’s death was an accident.
But, in the report, Mr Parsley says: ""At the location this occurred, there was no barrier in place to prevent a fall, and the drop was one of several feet. In his fall, John suffered multiple rib fractures leading to respiratory failure.""
Mr Parsley said evidence was heard at the inquest that the “height of drop from the edge of the promenade to the sand at the location John fell, whilst on his mobility scooter, was approximately five feet”.
""The court was told that, at a number of locations, the height from the edge of the promenade to the sand was prone to change, and a system was in place to monitor this. It was however, acknowledged, that unusual high tide conditions, and/or weather activity could significantly change the drop height in a short period of time.
“Evidence heard that at high-risk locations, such as areas with persistent long drops, drops onto concrete, or drops onto rock sea defences, permanent barriers were installed. In other areas signage and/or painted markings were used to highlight the risks of a potential fall. It was acknowledged that individuals on mobility scooters were known to regularly access and use the promenade.
“Due to the demographics of the local area it was acknowledged that the use of mobility scooters on the promenade may increase in the future. Evidence was also heard from a mobility scooter supplier and engineer, who explained that falling asleep on a mobility scooter was not uncommon, and happened more frequently than the general public might think.
“The supplier explained that this often led to accidents, leading to damage to the mobility scooters, which required repair. I am therefore concerned that falls from the promenade onto the beach, in areas where there is no barrier, would occur again in similar circumstances, as the current signage and markings provide no warning to an individual asleep on their mobility scooter.
“If this were to occur (as in this case) in an area where the height of drop from the edge of the promenade to the sand was greater than normally expected, I am concerned this would lead to future loss of life.”
East Suffolk Council must respond to the report by March 15. A spokesperson for the authority said: ""We welcome the report from the Coroner, which we will respond to in full, and our thoughts are with those close to Mr Gray following this tragic accident.
“We continually review all risk assessments for land which the Council is responsible for, and we are identifying what further appropriate measures should be put in place to help ensure the safety of all users of the promenade.”"
CG7MGTRGYV_GQHY1IEF04AY9PQ,BBC The Apprentice star slammed for supporting companies who weigh employees at work,Zara WoodcockShowbiz Reporter,"18:21, 23 Jan 2024Updated18:25, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-apprentice-star-slammed-supporting-31950367,"A former The Apprentice star was criticised by viewers after he shared his support for a law in Japan that allows companies to weigh their employees.
Japan implemented the 'metabo' law in 2008 in an attempt to overcome increasing obesity rates. The law states employers must measure their employees' waistlines annually if they are between 40 and 75. The country's Ministry of Health claimed that the campaign would keep the spread of diseases like diabetes and strokes in check.
Some businesses could be fined if their staff fail to try and shed the weight. On Tuesday, Apprentice star Tim Campbell, 46, defended the controversial law on Good Morning Britain and debated that employers have a 'duty of care', upsetting viewers who rushed to social media to slam his comments.
He said: ""Employers have a duty of care to their employees to make sure they are as productive as possible. [Duty of care] should incorporate your physical health as well and measuring around your waist is a key indicator of health challenges or health problems like cholesterol or blood pressure.
""And I want my staff to be as healthy as possible. That’s my duty as an employer."" Disagreeing with the law, Danielle Broadbent said it 'shouldn't matter how much you weigh and what clothes size you are.' Tim claimed it could be a 'positive, motivating thing', before bringing out statistics.
He said: ""The stats are unequivocal if you are healthier you are more productive and you have less time off work."" Tim went on to say he wants his children to be healthy as a parent, so the same should be applied to offices. ""It’s not about fat shaming. This is all about making sure, 'Are you as healthy as possible?' As I would like to know earlier than later if my blood pressure was high,"" he added.
When host Susanna Reid asked whether he weighed his staff, he said he doesn't but 'encourages' his staff to 'go off and do so' themselves. GMB viewers rushed to social media to slam the star, who found a London-based digital marketing agency, and said: ""God no! I don't wanna be weighed at work. triggering as hell.""
Another viewer commented: ""He sounds like a horrid boss to work for,"" while one unimpressed viewer pointed out: ""Work demands/stress is probably the single biggest cause of unhealthy and/or overeating. But let’s shame people for that by weighing and measuring them.""

The remnants of Isha should start to clear by the afternoon, giving way to some sunny spells with highs of 10C in the Southeast. The Met Office's amber weather warnings for wind ended at 6am on Monday morning, although there are yellow weather warnings on Tuesday evening for most of the UK.
Storm Isha made landfall in the UK and Republic of Ireland last night, with wind speeds topping 90mph in Wales and Scotland. Travel chaos ensued, with flights cancelled in Bristol and Scotland, while rail operators across the nation were limited to 50mph.
The Met Office posted on X last night: ""There will be plenty of blustery showers to start on Monday, these heaviest in the north and west. Remaining windy for all, although easing a little in the south later. Some sunny spells in the southeast, but still feeling chilly with northwesterly winds.""

Short bursts heavier rain were forecast in the Northwest of England and Scotland as we head into Monday evening, according to Ventusky weather maps. It could lead to powerful thunderstorms with up to 3mm of rainfall dropping within three hours. But, the sun should eventually push through the rainclouds - particularly in the south - bringing milder temperatures after last week's Arctic deep freeze.
Kent and Sussex were forecast to reach double-figures on the thermometer by mid-afternoon, whereas the north of Scotland still faces near-freezing temperatures. The Met Office added: ""Rain soon clearing from the southeast leaving a generally brighter day with sunny spells. However, the gales will only slowly ease, and blustery showers will affect the north and west.""
After a milder evening, the UK will once again be under a Met Office weather warning for wind. The yellow warning encompasses the whole of Northern Ireland and Scotland, and northern England. It's due to last from 4pm on Tuesday until midday on Wednesday.
The warning read: ""A spell of strong west or southwesterly winds is likely to affect Northern Ireland, north Wales, northern England and much of Scotland from Tuesday evening. Winds are likely to gust 50-60mph.

The Somerset brewery became embroiled in a high court battle with the budget supermarket chain over its 'Taurus' brand of 'cloudy lemon cider' launched in 2022, which lawyers claimed infringed on their trademark. But a judge threw out Thatchers' claim after tasting the two to compare, saying the two drinks did not taste similar enough to create confusion.
The German retailers were taken to court last year with a trial hearing Thatchers' case that Aldi creating a cheaper version of their rink to gain an ""unfair advantage"" and ""riding on the coattails"" of their reputation. While the supermarket accepted it had used the family-run cider brand's drink as a ""benchmark"" for its own, it denied infringement or that it was ""passing off"" the drink as a copycat.
Judge Melissa Clarke was invited to take a ""taste test"" of the rival drinks, saying in her judgement she was ""no expert and have never tasted cloudy lemon cider before"", but that the drinks tasted ""very similar"" but discernibly different. She said she was ""satisfied on the balance of probabilities"" that seeing the Aldi product ""would call to mind"" the Thatchers trademark, causing ""a link in the mind of the average consumer"".
But she concluded that Aldi had not infringed and was not liable for ""passing off"", adding that the German supermarket's product did not take unfair advantage of nor was ""detrimental"" to the reputation of the Thatchers trademark. Judge Clarke found that Aldi did not develop its product ""with an intention to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation"" of the Thatchers trademark, adding that she was satisfied ""there is no misrepresentation"".
An Aldi spokesperson said: ""There's nothing cloudy about this judgment. It's clear-cut. Aldi exclusive brands are just that: exclusive to Aldi while leading the market on quality and price.""
Martin Thatcher, a fourth-generation cider maker at the firm, said they had been ""compelled"" to bring the case ""as we were concerned"" that Aldi's packaging was ""misleading"" shoppers due to its similarity. Despite saying he was disappointed with the ruling, he added that the action was ""the right thing to do"".
Thatchers' barrister, Martin Howe KC, said the company spent nearly £3 million on marketing between 2020 and 2022 and had sold £20.7 million worth of the cloudy lemon cider drink as of September 2022. Mr Howe said Aldi had achieved ""extraordinarily high"" sales of its Taurus product - more than £1.4 million - after a ""lack both of development investment, or marketing spend"", adding that this ""can only have been achieved by reason of Thatchers' investment in the Thatchers product"".
The dispute came in the wake of Aldi losing a separate court battle with Marks and Spencer after being accused of copying its light-up Christmas gin bottles. Aldi has since appealed a High Court ruling that it infringed the design of the British retailer's product, with a judgment expected at a later date.
The supermarket was most notably involved in a legal battle with M&S over its Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake, reaching a settlement back in 2022 over the children's party cake."

But while grieving your loss, it's important to remember the happy memories you made together and the impact you had on each others' lives.
This has prompted a family to share the heartwarming letter they received from their vet just days after having their dog, named Sunny, put down. They said: ""We had to put down our dog. He was 18. We got this letter from our vet. No words right now."" The vet's letter starts: ""Hello. My name is Helper. I am an angel. There are a lot of angels in Heaven and we all have different jobs. My job is to write to people and let them know that their pets have arrived in Heaven.""
""One of the head angels told me that you were worried about Sunny and asked me to write you about him."" Reassuring the family that Sunny made it into Heaven, the angel said he has settled in and is ""doing just swell"". The letter added: ""I know that he was ill when he was with you. He had gotten very old and when you get old, your body is not as strong as it used to be.""
""Sunny was tired and I think maybe he knew that it was time to come here. And it is a good thing he did because now he is not old anymore and he isn't sick either. In fact, I saw him just a little while ago and he was running and jumping with some other dogs and having a great time"".

Relaying a message from Sunny, the angel told the family just how much their dog has been missing them - but said he wants them to know that he will see them again one day. ""Sunny misses you and hopes that you understand he had to come here,"" it continued.
""I am sure that one day Sunny will be there to greet you when you come here and you will have a grand reunion. Until then, we will keep him busy and happy. Here we don't have time like you do. It never gets dark. It is just one long day. And everyone here is your friend, so don't worry.""
""Sunny is not ever going to be lonely. Someday when he sees you again, it will be like you were never apart. Don't feel sad. Sunny is just fine. He is happy and he sends his love to you."" Sharing their thoughts on the letter, which has been shared on Reddit, one user said: ""Our vet sends sympathy cards signed by all of the staff. It's kind of hard to take, but they know people are hurting.""
""Ask vet staff what the hardest part of their job is, and it's putting down a pet who has been part of your life and family day in and day out for many years."" In agreement, another veterinary worker added: "" Sometimes we ask another employee to swap with us if we are too emotional.""
""It doesn't do anybody any good if you're crying louder than the owner. They add up though, and sometimes it just explodes. One of the most memorable experiences for me was this sweet old widow and her friend. They both quietly sobbed while we put down her senior dog. We gave them time alone afterward with him, and after 10 minutes, they exited the room and closed the door quietly behind them.""
""I went in to prepare her pet for the next step, and the dog was covered in beautiful handpicked field flower bouquets. Maybe they had a little ceremony for him. It brings tears to my eyes every time I think of this, and now whenever I have to euthanise a pet, I try to pick some flowers along the way.""

CT8G1BIK6G_FXGO5AECLTQJ8DL,Tata Steel worker with 11-month-old says lives will be ripped apart by job losses,Sophie HuskissonPolitical Correspondent,"18:06, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tata-steel-worker-11-month-31950209,"Worried steelworkers told how their lives will be ripped apart if they lose their jobs.
Trade union members gathered in Westminster after 2,800 jobs were put at risk. Most of the jobs will be at the Tata Steel’s Port Talbot plant in South Wales, where two blast furnaces will be closed this year. In the Commons, Labour called on the firm not to make any ""irreversible decisions"" until after the general election.
At a protest outside Parliament organised by Unite, Ieuan Eltham, 29, who has worked at Port Talbot since he was 16, said he never imagined he’d be at risk of losing his job as he was told it was “a job for life”. ""It is devastating news,” he told the Mirror. “I’ve got a partner and an 11-month-old daughter. My partner is really worried. We haven't got answers yet. Everybody's really worried. There’s lots of uncertainty.”
Ian Williams, 39, who has worked at Port Talbot for 22 years, said: “Me and my wife have been looking at our way of life and with the cost of living and everything now, me and my wife are started obviously looking at the effect of losing a new job because going from two wages down to one is obviously extremely worrying at the moment.”
He added: “I think what we can’t forget is that it's about the jobs of the future. We're only custodians of the jobs. “There's people in school now, eight, nine years old, where are they going to get jobs? This is decimating the whole community of South Wales.”
Jason Wyatt, 41, who has worked at Port Talbot, said: “There is a lot of worry and trepidation at the moment because people haven't got a clue what the detail is yet. People haven't been told how they are directly going to be affected. It'd be very, very devastating to lose my job. My little boy’s 19. My little girl is 11. My wife - they're all reliant on me. I'm the main breadwinner in the house. I’ve got the same as most other 41-year-olds: the mortgage, the bills to pay.”
He said he hasn’t got “any nice words” to say about the company or the Conservatives. “We've had no support from the Tory government. We've had very little from the business. They're holding us in contempt, to say the least,” he said. “If the steelworks was in more of a swing seat area or more of a Tory voting area, then we may have seen a little more support [from the Government].”
Speaking at the protest, Labour MP Paula Barker said it was an “absolute disgrace” steelworkers were facing this. “This is one of the great industries that is left in this country and if you look back to the 80s and the decimation of the mining communities under the Thatcher government, it's very reminiscent of that to be honest,” she said.
“This is going to decimate families. This is going to decimate communities, and quite frankly, it's just not needed. What we don't want to see is cheap imported steel. We want the Government to back UK steel and UK workers.”
Unions have warned the decision risks turning the area into a ghost town and accused the Government and Tata of throwing ""workers on the scrapheap"". Peter Hughes, Unite secretary for Wales, said the situation was “farcical”. “It's unbelievable that a Government will give half a billion pounds to make two and a half people redundant with no job guarantees around the money they're giving,” he said.
“Families have worked there through generation after generation. What this has done is not guarantee the future. We believe if the right investments are in place, this could be the green capitalist deal for Europe.”
Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the Commons it was “a calamitous mistake for the UK, under the Conservatives, to become the first major economy in the world without the ability to make our own primary steel”. Addressing ministers directly, he said: “I’m asking you, quite honestly, I am begging you to consider the arguments, consider what is really value for money and do not make decisions that are irreversible and prevent a far better outcome in future.”
Mr Reynolds said Labour has earmarked £3billion of investment from our spending plans to deliver a ""pragmatic"" and ""flexible"" solution for steelworkers. “What a tragedy it would be in the future to find a Britain that is building again, that is getting homes and infrastructure built, that has secure, low-carbon energy generation, that has a new wave of floating off-shore wind but which isn’t making the steel to provide those things,"" he said. “Labour has a plan to build a better plan and we want to build it with steel made in Britain.”
Business Minister Nus Ghani expressed her “sympathies for the employees of Tata Steel” and said the Government’s focus was “to ensure that steelmaking continues at Port Talbot”. “I want to assure this House that the Government is committed to doing just that, working very closely with Tata Steel, who are the decision-makers here and the Welsh Government to support the affected as much as possible,” she said.
The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since 2015."
CTS6UKMESL_QRE87J251PAPKKX,UK airports give updates on scrapping 100ml liquid rules ahead of summer deadline,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"15:22, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/uk-airports-give-updates-scrapping-31945304,"Half of the biggest airports in Britain could end up missing a deadline to scrap the 100ml liquid rule in hand luggage.
Last year the UK government announced that all major airports in the UK would need to install new scanners by June 2024, which would allow passengers to bring up to two litres of liquids in their hand luggage without having to stick to the existing rules.
Currently, you can take liquids under 100ml but these must be in a re-sealable plastic bag that can be no larger than 20cm x 20cm and cannot exceed one litre. It's worth noting that you’re limited to one plastic bag per person.
The June deadline is proving particularly difficult to meet for the larger airports, which have admitted that they will either partially or completely miss the deadline. If only some scanners are installed - but not enough to serve all passengers in any given airport - then most likely none of its customers will benefit from the more lenient rules.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience. We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes.”
Currently, only London City Airport and Teeside Airport have already installed all the scanners and scrapped liquid rules.
The Mirror has contacted the UK's biggest airports for updates on how the scanner installation is unfolding.
Edinburgh will have at least some of the high-tech scanners up and running by June, the Mirror has been told. Some passengers may have to use the old scanners however. It is currently unclear what this means for luggage requirements in general.
A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ""Work is currently ongoing to install the new scanners at Edinburgh Airport and we’re confident we will have a number of these in place for the majority of passengers to use by June. Replacement of the remaining scanners is scheduled to be complete by late 2024.""
The West Midlands airport will have the required amount of scanners up and running by June, it has said. A BHX spokesperson told the Mirror: ""We’re on our way to completing our new +£60m security hall, which will ultimately offer customers a speedier and more efficient pre-flight security screening experience. We’re on course to have the new facility ready in June 2024, in line with the Government’s deadline.""
A spokesperson for the West Country travel hub has said that the scanners will be in place and running by the June deadline. They told the Mirror: ""Bristol Airport continues to align ourselves with all regulated guidance issued by the Department for Transport to deliver security requirements and welcome the introduction of new technology which could further improve the airport customer experience in the future from June 2024 onwards. However, customers should be reminded there are no immediate changes to the rules governing what can be taken through security as a result of this initiative, and the current hand luggage restrictions remain in place.""
A spokesperson for Gatwick told the Mirror that the new machines would not be fully installed until the start of next year. They said: ""London Gatwick will have made significant progress installing state of the art next generation security scanners by June 2024 in both terminals. We currently plan to have completed the major logistical operation required to install the remaining scanners in Q1 2025, after the busy summer peak period has concluded.""
Heathrow bosses have told the Civil Aviation Authority that it will be “difficult to deliver” new scanners across its 146 security lanes by June, as doing so requires some floors to be reinforced. The work will not be completed until 2025 despite £1billion being invested into making the changes.
A spokesperson for Heathrow told the Mirror that it was ""investing a huge amount of energy"" into installing the new scanners while ""ensuring we keep the operation flowing and our passengers have a smooth security experience at Heathrow during the transition"".
There is a similar situation at Stansted, Manchester and East Midlands, which are all run by the controlling group, MAG. A spokesperson for the firm told the Mirror: ""We continue to make good progress at all three of our airports on the introduction of new security screening equipment, as part of the UK-wide programme. This is a complex programme of work requiring the expansion of terminal facilities, while at the same time maintaining operations during construction.
""We are currently rolling out the new technology lane-by-lane at Manchester and London Stansted airports, with several new lanes already in operation. Work is also underway on major construction projects at both Manchester and East Midlands airports to expand the size of the terminals to accommodate the new equipment. This will see the new scanners in place on a large number of our security lanes by June 2024, with the full completion of the programme expected the following year.""
The Scottish travel hub did not respond to questions about its scanners.
The airport also did not respond to a request of information."
CUSTLRV6PO_WLNLPXMBQRF8ZBR,Donald Trump storms out of courtroom as judge threatens to lock up defense lawyer,Fiona LeishmanUS News Reporter,"15:39, 26 Jan 2024Updated17:32, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-donald-trump-storms-out-31977210,"Former president Donald Trump has stormed out of court during the closing arguments in the E Jean Carroll defamation trial.
Trump left the courtroom during a statement Ms Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, was making on behalf of the writer, asking jurors to send Trump a message to stop abuse of her client. Judge Lewis A Kaplan, no relation to Ms Carroll's lawyer, interrupted the attorney in order to make a note for the record that Trump ""just rose and walked out of the courtroom"".
The Republican primary hopeful walked out as Ms Carroll's lawyer urged the jury to award her client at least $12 million in damages, saying Trump had shattered her reputation and her world by unleashing a flood of hate toward her through his public statements branding her a liar. Just minutes after Ms Kaplan began her closing argument in Manhattan federal court, Trump was seen suddenly rising from his seat at the defence table as he walked toward the exit - pausing the scan the packed courtroom as members of the Secret Service leapt into action to follow him out.

The unexpected departure came just minutes after the judge threatened to send Trump's attorney Alina Habba to jail for continuing to speak when he had told her she was finished. He told Habba: ""You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now, sit down.""
Later, Trump returned to the courtroom to hear Habba argue that he should not be made to pay Carroll for comments that set off hate messages from strangers. Habba showed the jury a video in which Trump said a jury's verdict last year finding that he had sexually abused Carroll was ""a disgrace"" and ""a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.""
""You know why he has not wavered?"" Habba asked the jury. ""Because it's the truth."" That statement prompted an objection that the judge sustained with a warning that ""if you violate my instructions again, Ms. Habba, you may have consequences.""
Trump, who is not required to attend the civil lawsuit proceedings, had appeared agitated throughout the morning and was seen vigorously shaking his head during attorney Kaplan's closing arguments. Ms Carroll's attorney had made a statement saying: "" Donald Trump has tried to normalise conduct that is abnormal"", prior to the presidential hopeful walking out.
In a statement posted to his Truth Social platform, Trump said: ""We asked for one trial, on the E Jean Carroll false accusation case, but the judge wouldn't give it to us, he made us have two trials on the same hoax, and then, on the second trial, they were allowed to use whatever information they wanted from the first, but we weren't allowed to use anything!
""As an example, the depositions they're using on the second trial were taken in the first. He wouldn't allow us to use the totally exonerating Anderson Cooper/CNN interview on either trial, but none of it in the second. Our legal system is in shambles!
""This is another Biden demanded witch hunt against his political opponent, funded and managed by radical left Democrats. The courts are totally stacked against me, have never been used against a political opponent, like this, but in the end, we will win it all, and make America great again!""
Closing arguments were being given in the defamation case against Trump brought by writer Jean E Carroll just a day after the controversial politician had left the courtroom fuming. His apparent foul mood yesterday was reportedly as a result of the fact he had not been given an opportunity to refute the accusations from Ms Carroll that Trump has sexually abused her.
Lawyers were summing up their arguments for the nine jurors who are due to start deliberating in order to reach a decision as to whether Ms Carroll, a longtime advice columnist, is entitled to more than the $5 million she was awarded in a separate trial last year. The final remarks from lawyers are being made just a day after Trump managed to sneak past a federal judge's rules severely limiting what he could say during his stint on the witness stand, which ended up lasting just three minutes.
""She said something that I considered to be a false accusation,"" Trump said, later adding: ""I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency."" The jury was told by the judge to disregard both remarks.

A different Jury found last May that Trump sexually abused Ms Carroll in the spring of 1996 in the changing room of a luxury department store in Manhattan. It also found that he defamed her in 2022 by claiming she had invented the allegation in order to aid the sales of a memoir.
Trump has said he has long regretted his decision not to testify at that trial, blaming his lawyers for giving bad advice. During her closing, Ms Kaplan told jurors the current case was not about the sexual assault.
""We had that case,"" she said, referring to the first trial. ""That's why Donald Trump's testimony was so short yesterday. He doesn't get a do-over this time.""
The jury in the new trial has been told it is there purely for the purpose of deciding whether Ms Carroll should be entitled to more than the $5 million awarded last year and jurors must accept the verdict reached last year. The current jury will only make a decision on whether additional damages are owed for statements Trump made in June 2019 during his time as president. The claims had been delayed for years by court appeals.
Ms Carroll's legal team are seeking more than $10 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Ms Habba has argued against damages, saying Ms Carroll's association with Trump had given her the game she craved and that death threats she received cannot be blamed on Trump's remarks.
Ms Carroll, 80, testified during last year's trial that she had a chance encounter with Trump at a Bergdorf Goodman store that was flirtatious and lighthearted until Trump cornered her in a changing room. Her claim that Trump raped her was rejected by last year's jury, though it agreed she was sexually abused.
Last week, Ms Carroll testified that her career was shattered by Trump's statements about her claims over the last five years, most recently on the campaign trail for president. She said she bought bullets for a gun she inherited from her father and installed an electronic fence around her home.
On Thursday, Trump testified that he stood ""100%"" behind comments he made in an October 2002 deposition in which he denied Ms Carroll's accusations, calling her ""sick"" and a ""whack job."" Judge Kaplan intends to instruct jurors Friday that the jury last year concluded that Trump had digitally penetrated Ms Carroll in the department store, but the same jury did not find that he had raped her, according to how rape is defined under New York state law."
CWX7K4Y9VV_L19UPPRP9WI49UE,Energy firms vowing to cut emissions 'will produce billions of tonnes of CO2',Lawrence Matheson,"14:38, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/energy-firms-vowing-cut-emissions-31975964,"Oil and gas companies that signed up to an emissions reduction plan at Cop28 will collectively produce more than 150 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050, according to analysis by Global Witness.
That is around 454 times more than the UK emitted in 2022, with campaigners calling the Cop28 plan ""marketing and spin"", as it does not include cutting emissions from the oil and gas they produce. The climate conference in Dubai last month was the first time in its near 30-year history that countries agreed to move away from using fossil fuels.
Its president Sultan al-Jaber, who is also the CEO of the country's national oil company, hailed a deal by 50 oil and gas companies to make their operations net zero by 2050 and cut flaring by 2030. They did not make any agreement to slow production of oil and gas however, the emissions from which are known as scope 3, which Global Witness said represents about 90% of these companies' total carbon footprints.
A mixture of national and international oil companies signed the pact, with ExxonMobil, Equinor, TotalEnergies, Eni and Shell set to produce enough oil and gas between now and 2050 that would equal 15 years' worth of the European Union's annual emissions, according to the analysis. Global Witness said they calculated the emissions by using data from Rystad Energy, which projects what each company is likely to produce in the years ahead.
They took CO2, methane and other greenhouse gases and combined them in one metric to produce a carbon dioxide equivalent a common practice in measuring the combined effects of the various greenhouse gases and not just CO2. Patrick Galey, senior fossil fuels investigator at the NGO, said: ""How can these CEOs keep insisting that their products play a role in solving a problem, the very root of which is those same products?
""How long will we keep letting them get away with such sleight of hand? We need a rapid and equitable phase-out of fossil fuels, and fossil fuel bosses must be locked out of climate talks. Everything else is marketing and spin, pure and simple.""
Global Witness said it contacted each of the named companies about their analysis.
A spokesperson for Shell said the company is halfway to its target of reducing its operations' emissions by 50% compared to 2016 levels. They added: ""On Scope 3 emissions, global energy demand will continue to grow and be met by different types of energy, including oil and gas, for some time to come.""
""The pace of transition depends on action in many areas, including government policy, changing customer demand and investment in low-carbon energy. Our aim is to play our part in a balanced energy transition, where the world achieves net zero emissions without compromising on delivery of secure and affordable energy which has improved so many lives, and which people will continue to need today and for many years to come.""
Other campaigners said it is hypocritical of these companies to pledge to reduce emissions but continue to produce the fuel that is the main driver of climate change. Jamie Peters, climate coordinator at Friends of the Earth, said: ""This analysis, while jaw-dropping, only reinforces what we've long known that fossil fuel companies will stop at nothing to extract every last drop of profit from the world's remaining fossil reserves, no matter the cost.""
""At a time when people all over the world are facing extortionate living costs with the volatility of global gas and oil markets among the biggest factors driving up prices and the mounting effects of climate breakdown, the companies fuelling both continue to cash in at our expense. That execs from these very same companies are getting prime access to influential climate talks is so absurd that it hardly registers as surprising. The injustice is breathtaking.""
A spokesperson for TotalEnergies said the company fully supports the charter it signed during Cop28, known as the Oil & Gas Decarbonisation Charter (OGDC). They said: ""The IEA (International Energy Agency) has assessed what the effect would be of the full implementation of the methane pledge of the OGDC and indicate that the 50 companies (who are) signatories to this charter 'account for about 40% of global oil production and 35% of combined oil and gas production'.""
""In addition, IEA analysis shows that the full delivery on these pledges covering renewables, efficiency and methane/flaring by the current signatories would result in global energy-related GHG in 2030 being around four GtCO2e (gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) lower than would be expected without them based on the Stated Policies Scenario in the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023."""
CWY1USN1UD_X17XNZQFBV2RT9S,Nottingham triple killer Valdo Calocane sentenced to stay in hospital indefinitely,Matt ClemensonNews Editor,"12:04, 25 Jan 2024Updated12:57, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nottingham-stabbings-valdo-calocane-sentencing-31964738,"A knifeman who stabbed three people to death on a rampage through Nottingham last year will be detained at a high security hospital indefinitely.
Valdo Calocane, 32, was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he stabbed students Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, to death with a dagger in Nottingham in the early hours of last June 13. Despite initially facing murder charges, the prosecution eventually accepted guilty pleas on charges of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.
Calocane “hid in the shadows” waiting for Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19. The university students had been on their way home, after an end-of-term night out, at 4am on June 13 when Calocane attacked them. Brave Grace tried to fight Calocane off, pushing him into the road as he attacked Barnaby, but both tragically died.
After the court took extensive evidence from psychiatrists and other medical professionals, Calocane was today (Thursday) sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at a high security hospital, subject to special restrictions.
Sentencing Calocane at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday, judge Mr Justice Turner said the killer would be detained in a high-security hospital “very probably for the rest of your life”.
He said: “You committed a series of atrocities in this city which ended the lives of three people in this city. Your sickening crimes both shocked the nation and wrecked the lives of your surviving victims and the families of them all.”
The judge went on to say that the “harrowing” details of the attacks have been “fully recounted and explored” in court over the past couple of days.
On Wednesday, Calocane’s barrister Peter Joyce KC had urged the judge not to consider a whole-life order, saying paranoid schizophrenia is an “unwanted visitor” which “stalked down” a man of previously impeccable character and behaviour.
Before sentencing took place, one of the sons of stabbing victim Ian Coates was applauded after standing up in courtroom one to make an impromptu address.
Speaking towards the families of Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, Mr Coates said: “No matter what the outcome is our family are here for you from now until whenever. I am so sorry that we had had to go through this and this is how we have met. If I don’t manage to stay the whole day because I can’t keep my mouth shut, I apologise. But we are in the same boat.”
Relatives of those killed and injured in the attacks, sitting in the public gallery, responded by applauding Mr Coates’ remarks.
Mr Justice Turner told Valdo Calocane that his actions had sentenced many relatives and friends of the victims to “a life of grief and pain”. He told the triple killer: “There was never any doubt that it was you who had committed these appalling crimes.
“It soon became clear, however, that the central issue in this case would relate to whether at the time of committing these offences you were suffering from symptoms of severe mental disorder.”
The judge added that the psychiatric evidence did not detract from the “horror” and impact of the offences, but he said, in his view, Calocane’s abnormality of mind had significantly contributed to him perpetrating the string of attacks. Speaking after sentencing, Barnaby Webber’s family unleashed a broadside at Nottinghamshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) that “true justice has not been served today”.
What can you be sentenced to under the Mental Health Act?
In a statement read on the court steps after sentencing, his mother Emma Webber said: “We as a devastated family have been let down by multiple agency failings and ineffectiveness.
“The CPS did not consult us as has been reported – instead we have been rushed, hastened and railroaded.”
She said the first meeting with them was on November 24. “We were presented with a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges. At no point during the previous five-and-a-half-months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder.
“We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out. We do not dispute that the murderer is mentally unwell and has been for a number of years. However the pre-mediated planning, the collection of lethal weapons, hiding in the shadows and brutality of the attacks are that of an individual who knew exactly what he was doing. He knew entirely that it was wrong but he did it anyway.”"

The Doomsday Clock has been ticking away and scaring the life out of us for decades now as it makes its yearly calculations for when the world will end. But do you really know what it is, who came up with the bleak idea and why there are a growing number of critics who dismiss it as nothing but a publicity stunt?
The concept was dreamt up in 1947 by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which was founded two years previously by Albert Einstein and University of Chicago scientists, who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project.
Because of the danger to humanity these catastrophic weapons posed, the clock was intended to be a symbol and warning about how close we were to ending the world through our own dangerous nuclear technologies.
The Manhattan Project was a secret government mission and most of the people involved weren’t aware what they were building, although the scientists were said to be dubious from the start. Their warnings about the bombs getting into the wrong hands and to only be used as a demonstration weren’t heeded and in 1945 the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In its early years the clock was purely based on the danger that nuclear weapons posed to humanity and was intended to act as a warning and a call to action for the public and policymakers. But as threats to our existence expanded, other factors were introduced.
In 2007, the bulletin began considering climate change catastrophes and now factors in more recent developments such as artificial intelligence when it decides how close to midnight the hands are.
The furthest from midnight it has been set was in 1991 when it was 17 minutes away. This was after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the signing of an arms reduction treaty. Last year it was moved forward 10 seconds and reached two minutes to midnight - the closest it’s been to the end of the world - following the Russian-Ukraine war and the nuclear weapon threat in China and North Korea.
While this time of “unprecedented danger” will give many nightmares, there are those who say the clock has had its day and the hands should be stopped completely because it is nothing but a PR stunt and based on guesswork, not scientific evidence.
Some point to inconsistencies in how it is calculated and how it has changed over the years to include other issues the world is facing. Why some events move it closer than others is never properly revealed and they say changing methods during studies means the results don’t make sense.
Stuart Ritchie, Science writer for inews, emphasises this point and believes time is up for the clock: ""The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists can’t have it both ways: they’re either scientists, and work to keep their measures consistent and interpretable, or they’re activists, willing to say outrageous things to grab publicity for a cause,"" he says.
""Lumping together very different kinds of risks into one highly subjective, inconsistent measure and press-releasing it to the world isn’t very useful, or very scientific. It’s time to stop the clock.""
American columnist and editor-in-chief at The Dispatch, Jonah Goldberg, agrees that there's nothing truly scientific about the clock and it’s based mainly on opinion. He says they can’t predict when or even if Vladimir Putin will use an atomic bomb or how the world will react.
""There’s nothing particularly ""scientific"" about the clock. There’s no complicated risk-assessment algorithm or anything resembling the scientific method involved. It’s just a bunch of experts expressing an opinion and boiling it down to a dopey clock intended to scare the bejeebus out of people,"" he says.
He says the fact they hold a press conference every year that attracts massive media attention and hundreds of headlines just makes the people behind it the masters of spin and the Doomsday Clock the most successful PR event since the radio.
Jonah also believes its success at PR could be dangerous and highlights how they actually gave Putin a positive publicity push when they moved the clock's hands because of war with Ukraine.
""Russiawants everyone to be terrified of nuclear war, and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists gave them a huge PR coup by lending ""scientific"" credibility to their threats,"" he writes.

The Florida governor said in a video that he would be ending his campaign two days before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation GOP primary. In the clip, DeSantis opened up about his campaign and why he decided to join public service. He said government spending is sky-high and it is time to bring it down, whilst also protecting ""America's children from being indoctrinated"".
He also pledged his support for Trump, saying: ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance."" But body language expert Judi James told The Mirror that the video - posted on Twitter - looked ""like an AI version of DeSantis"" who initially seemed to be ""delivering a friendly upbeat address"" before going on to say he would be dropping out of the presidential race.

His body language did not show ""actual regret"" as if his decision ""might be inevitable"", Ms James said. She explained: ""This looks like an AI version of DeSantis, smiling robotically and incongruently as though he's delivering a friendly upbeat address before suddenly sinking in the middle and announcing he's dropping out instead.
""He appears to read this message while avoiding body movement, meaning he puts very little signs of authentic enthusiasm into his words of endorsement of Trump. There is a very subtle mood change when he announces he is stepping down but no dramatic looks of actual regret and his recent outings have thrown up body language that suggested this decision might be inevitable.""

Ms James noted ""a much sadder eye expression"" when DeSantis mentioned the end of his campaign. However, he appeared to show disagreement with the idea that Trump should get another chance at becoming president, the body language expert added.
According to Ms James, DeSantis' endorsement of Trump does not show any signs of enthusiasm. She said: ""On the actual stepping down line itself the rather mannered eye smile falters to be replaced by a much sadder eye expression. When he talks about the public wanting to ‘give Donald Trump another chance’ his shoulders bristle to suggest he still disagrees with this idea and his brows steeple into an expression of bewilderment.
""His endorsement of Trump looks lacking in non-verbal signs of enthusiasm. Saying he is ‘superior to Biden’ his head turns slightly to the side as though trying to hide his facial expression. His tongue is white and he licks his lips in a way that suggests stress, despite his ‘happy family’ ending where he refers to his wife and children.""
Following the announcement, Trump described DeSantis as ""a really terrific person"" and said: ""I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job. He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.""
DeSantis concentrated his campaign in recent months in Iowa, where he finished in second place in last week's caucuses - 30 percentage points behind Trump and barely ahead of Nikki Haley. Haley, meanwhile, has long prioritised New Hampshire as a potential springboard ahead of her home-state South Carolina primary next month.
Trump noted on Sunday that he won New Hampshire's 2016 primary by about 20 points. He lost the battleground state twice in general elections. On Monday, he plans to be in New York at a civil defamation trial stemming from a columnist’s claims he sexually attacked her. Then he is scheduled to return to New Hampshire for an evening rally in Laconia."

Just days after Storm Isha barrelled through the British isles, Jocelyn delivered 97mph gales to huge swathes of the country and its surrounding waters. On Tuesday night, rescuers continued to scour the waves off the coast of Porthcawl in south Wales after the alarm was raised at around 6pm.
Rescue teams continued their search off the coast of Porthcawl, south Wales late into the evening after the alarm was raised just before 6pm that same day. A spokesperson from HM Coastguard said their helicopter from St Athan was ""supporting the search"", along with the RNLI's all-weather lifeboats from Mumbles and Barry Dock. South Wales Police was also alerted.
Public transport in many locations was scrapped completely due to the severity of the storm. Train passengers were told there would be no journeys running north of Preston, while drivers were told to avoid the roads, and to not park near trees due to the risk of them toppling in the mighty gales.

This morning, Brits were involved in a massive cleanup operation after Storm Jocelyn barrelled her way across the isles, uprooting trees and causing widespread travel chaos.
A number of weather warnings remain in place for a few more hours today as high winds remain in several locations.
Thanks for following along with our blog, which is now finished.
Network Rail Scotland shared a picture of a large trampoline on the line at Livingston South.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, they said: “We’re arranging a temporary switch off of the overhead wires so we can remove it safely.
“Once that’s done, the @CalSleeper locomotive waiting at Midcalder can move forward to inspect the Shotts line for us.”
They urged anyone who sees something that could affect the safety of trains, or debris or fallen trees on the tracks, to 03457 11 41 41 to reach the company’s 24/7 helpline.
A plane full of passengers declared an emergency after failing to land at Manchester Airport several times because of high winds.
The Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 had been due to land at Manchester after taking off from Singapore Changi Airport at around 2.30am this morning. However, after two attempts to touch down were missed it declared an emergency, believed to be over a lack of fuel, and instead flew south to East Midlands Airport where it landed safely.
It comes amid high winds caused by Storm Jocelyn in the area, sparking a yellow warning from the Met Office which remains in place until 3pm today.
Almost 2,500 homes have been left without power in Scotland after Storm Jocelyn pounded the country with gale force winds overnight.
Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks Distribution said it had reconnected 2,200 properties by 8am on Wednesday. But thousands more remain without electricity.
Andy Smith, operations director at SSEN Distribution, said: “Jocelyn is the second severe storm the north of Scotland has faced in three days, and I’d like to thank our customers for their patience while we respond to it.
“Our network has held up well overnight given the strength of winds we have seen across western and northern Scotland, but our teams still face another day of challenging conditions as we work hard to reconnect all of our customers.”
Flood warnings and alerts have been put in place across Yorkshire as Storm Jocelyn continues to hit the country.
Strong winds have impacted much of Yorkshire overnight, with heavy winds impacting a number of other places. Yellow weather warnings for wind have been implemented by the Met Office across all of Yorkshire, with the warnings set to expire at 1pm in western areas and 3pm in eastern and southern areas.
As a result of the storm, a number of different flood warnings and alerts have come into force in Yorkshire so far.
Flooding has hit parts of Yorkshire as a result of the storm with the city of York bearing the brunt of heavy rain. Many parts of the city are underwater with homes and businesses flooded.
Tributes have been paid to a retired NHS nurse who died after plunging down a hole left by workmen on his way back from the pub.
Father-of-two Andrew Barker, 56, was found dead in a hole dug by gas engineers on Monday morning.
Safety barriers erected at the site in Bradford, West Yorks., were blown over by Storm Isha and openings in the road were visible, locals said.
Lifelong pal Richard Elliot said of Andrew: “He was the life and soul around anyone, everyone and everywhere he touched and was present.
""You meet very few people in your life who mean so much to you. Andy was this person to me, a funnier person you could not meet. A real character for sure.
“He was highly intelligent, professional, charismatic, loving and - luckily for me - my best friend. I will miss him very much.”
Yet another weather warning has been issued in connection with Storm Jocelyn.
This time, the yellow advisory is for the north east of England, and relates to the ""strong winds in association with Storm Jocelyn, leading to possible disruption to travel and utilities"", writes the Met Office.
In a statement, the forecaster wrote: ""Strong winds in association with Storm Jocelyn continuing across northern parts of the UK into this afternoon, but gradually easing from the west.
""Winds are widely expected to gust 55-65 mph, with a few exposed locations and over high ground possibly seeing in excess of 70 mph.
""Gusts of 55-65 mph are fairly typical for a winter storm across these areas, but following the impacts caused by Storm Isha resilience is expected to be lower and it may also hamper any ongoing recovery and repair efforts.""
Images taken at a number of busy UK train stations show deserted platorms as rail travel came to a halt in many regions as Storm Jocelyn continues to wreak havoc.
Travellers wishing to arrive in or leave Scotland will have to wait as all journeys have been suspended until at least 12pm. Network Rail Scotland said it had to manage flooding, fallen trees and damage caused by the powerful gales.
In England, Avanti West Coast told its passengers they cannot travel north of Preston until at least the same time.
Though the UK will awake to another day of stormy weather, the rest of the day looks somewhat more positive.
Today:
A day of sunny spells and blustery showers, though the south will be mainly dry. Winds gradually easing from the south as Storm Jocelyn moves away from the UK. Turning cloudy from the southwest later with patchy light rain.
Tonight:
Light winds and clear skies with a frost likely in the north and east. Cloud and outbreaks of mostly light rain moving northeast from southwest England.
The Welsh coastguard has ended its search for a person who fell into the sea in Porthcawl in Wales amid this week's storm.
The alarm was first raised at around 6pm. After several hours of scouring the waves in dangerous conditions, the search had to be called off.
Rescuers plan to make a decision on further action this morning.
A Hamilton school campus was closed due to storm damage and hundreds of fallen trees are being cleared across Lanarkshire in the aftermath of Storm Isha - with the next weather system already on its way.
St Ninian's Primary in Hillhouse and the adjoining Whithorn support base for pupils with additional support needs were closed on Tuesday for roof repairs following the impact of the high winds.
The Met Office confirmed that the Lanarkshire weather monitoring station at Salsburgh recorded the highest wind speed in Scotland during Sunday night's storm with a gust registering 84 miles per hour.
Pupils and familes at St Ninian's and Whithorn were informed of the closure on Tuesday morning.
A spokesperson for South Lanarkshire Council said: ""The storm caused damage to the roof and to allow repairs to be made safely, the school was closed; the repairs have now been carried out and the school will re-open on Wednesday.""It came after two Clydesdale schools were closed due to power issues on Monday, while another seven opened later than usual to pupils following the challenging weather.
Five roads across South Lanarkshire remained closed by Tuesday afternoon, including Overton Road in Netherburn due to a dangerous tree, Devonbrae and Brocketsbrae Road due to a damaged overhead power line following a tree fall, and flooding at Holehouse Road in East Kilbride, Westburn Road in Cambuslang and Stonehouse Road in Sandford.
The Queen Elizabeth II bridge at the Dartford Crossing, M48 Severn Bridge and A66 in County Durham and Cumbria were closed due to high winds with the Humber Bridge, A19 Tees Flyover and the Woodhead Pass in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire closed to high-sided vehicles.
The M1 was also closed in both directions to high-sided vehicles at Junction 34 for Sheffield, according to Traffic England.In Scotland, the A76 was closed in both directions between Skelmorlie and Largs due to water breaking over the sea wall. The Forth Bridge was open to cars and single decker buses with restrictions on high-sided vehicles on several bridges.Eight flights were cancelled at Dublin Airport and four at Glasgow Airport on Tuesday evening.
An amber warning for wind, issued by the Met Office, is in place across the north and west of Scotland until 8am on Wednesday with a yellow warning in place until 1pm across Scotland, Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. A further yellow warning runs until 3pm across northeast England, the Midlands and south Wales.
Storm Jocelyn's powerful gales and torrential downpours have caused widespread travel disruption across the UK< with rail operators some of the hardest hit.
Further transport disruption is expected with rail services to and from Scotland suspended until at least noon on Wednesday.
Martin Thomson, national operations manager for resilience at Transport Scotland, said: ""Across the wider network, we can expect to see more delays and cancellations with ferries, flights and rail into Wednesday morning.""
Network Rail Scotland said it had dealt with incidents including flooding, fallen trees and a shed roof blowing onto a high wall above a track on Tuesday evening and would be inspecting routes for damage from first light.
A statement said: ""It'll be done in many ways - teams on foot, in road-rail vehicles, freight locos and empty passenger trains. Our helicopter will be out too, as soon as winds ease.""
ScotRail said all lines will be checked before services restart, saying ""it will be later on in the day before any trains can run"".
Avanti West Coast told passengers not to attempt to travel north of Preston until at least noon on Wednesday and warned journeys in northwest England may take longer due to speed restrictions.
In Snowdonia, wind gusts peaked at 97mph. This dropped to 79mph in Aberdaron, Wales, and 77mph in Shap, Cumbria.
Honister Pass in Cumbria was drenched in 77mm of rain - which is about half the area's average for the whole of January.
This morning, the Met Office predicts gusts could hit 80mph in some exposed areas. 40-50mm of rain is also possible over higher ground.
Some weather watchers have already suggested that Storm Jocelyn, which peaked last night between 10pm and 2am this morning, was stronger than Storm Isha.
Earlier this week, Storm Isha's powerful gales devastated huge swathes of Britain, causing five deaths, forcing schools to close, and leading to widespread travel chaos.
Yep peak was to be 10pm to 2am but they continued into the night. Managed 48mph in the end overnight so beating #StormIsha overall. https://t.co/EYlfUHvcrg
Rail services from the North West to Scotland have been issued with 'do not travel' advice north of Preston, affecting some TransPennine Express and Avanti West Coast services from Greater Manchester.

An Irish council has been slammed after homeless residents were denied access to emergency accomodation during the storm.
Wexford County Council usually advises rough sleepers to make contact with Ozanam House, but local politicians and homelessness charities said several people were turned away, reports the Irish Independent.
A major search has been launched at sea during Storm Jocelyn following reports of a person in the water.
Rescue teams continued their search off the coast of Porthcawl, south Wales late into the evening after the alarm was raised just before 6pm on Tuesday.

CZ76C4YZYH_NZ5Y5MJXFOVRWMD,Head-to-toe how measles can ravage the body - with fatal complications years on,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"11:45, 24 Jan 2024Updated12:18, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/head-toe-how-measles-can-31953043,"People are being warned of potential serious complications and even death from measles following a spike in cases.
The World Health Organisation has issued a fresh warning over measles after an almost 45-fold rise in cases across Europe. Experts from the organisation said Europe is seeing an “alarming rise” in the spread of the disease, which has “accelerated in recent months”.
It comes with the UK having launched its own campaigns to encourage parents to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children.
Measles can lead to serious complications, lifelong disability and death. It can affect the lungs and brain and cause pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures.
One in five people who catch measles can end up in hospital and one in 15 kids develop serious complications such as meningitis and blindness. With no specific treatment for the virus, health officials are recommending vaccinations as the best way to protect people against it.
Professor Dame Jenny Harries said that “concerted action” is needed to tackle the virus, as she visited a measles blackspot in the West Midlands. She suggested the majority of people are not against their child receiving the MMR jab, but that they need more information to feel confident about their decision.
She added: “What we are seeing at the moment with measles is that people have forgotten what a serious illness it is… We have had very high vaccination rates, especially for young families, but they are low at the moment.”
First symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you’re infected
Measles rash appears around two to four days after the initial symptoms
After 10 days
Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about seven to 10 days without causing any further problems. If someone has a more severe case of measles then they may suffer from affects like diarrhoea, vomiting or eye and ear infections.
While less common, infected people could develop meningitis, pneumonia or hepititis. Even more rarely is encephalitis which is inflammation of the brain that can lead to convulsions, deafness, blindness and have a long term impact, while some people can die from the virus.
Long term complications
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life. It generally develops seven to 10 years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness.
The condition causes progressive destruction of the brain resulting in dementia, loss of motor function, fits (epilepsy), and eventually death. There is unfortunately no cure for SSPE.
Vaccination rates across the country have been dropping, but there are particular concerns about some regions, including parts of London and the West Midlands. Figures released by the UKHSA last Friday showed there have been 216 confirmed measles cases and 103 probable cases in the West Midlands since October 1 last year.
Four-fifths (80%) have been found in Birmingham while 10% were identified in Coventry, with the majority being in children aged under 10. The UKHSA has declared a national incident, which it said is an internal mechanism signalling the growing public health risk and enabling it to focus work in specific areas."

The Traitors star, 22, responded to rumours of his girlfriend cheating with Gogglebox's George Baggs earlier this week, by sharing some loved-up snaps of himself with CBBC presenter Anna Maynard.
George spoke about the alleged kiss on Chloe's YouTube show Chloe Vs The World earlier this year and again in his own podcast Not My Baggs in July. This was long before Harry rose to fame himself as one of the stars on the hit BBC murder mystery series and became everyone's favourite Traitor.
But it seems like Harry - who is tipped to scoop the cash prize when season two of The Traitors comes to an end on Friday - is unfazed by claims his girlfriend did the dirty on him, with the British army engineer hitting back at speculation on social media once again.
Just hours before The Traitors returned to our screens once again on Wednesday night, Harry took to his Instagram Stories to share a snap of the back of his girlfriend taking a selfie as he stood behind her and mimicked a trigger-ready gun pose. ""Don't believe everything you read online people!!!"" Harry warned his followers as he captioned the image.
He continued: ""Some people are absolute sausages and will get what's coming to them. Love you more than anything my [love heart emoji] @annamaynard99."" Harry's sassy Instagram Story comes just days on from the 22-year-old sharing some cute pictures of himself and Anna enjoying a sweet family outing.
Harry and Anna showed unity as they celebrated The Traitor star's sibling's birthday on Monday. ""Beautiful night, celebrating my beautiful little sister's birthday with my beautiful family,"" Harry told his Instagram followers as he posted a photo of himself giving Anna a kiss on the cheek during the family celebration.
Anna, a popular influencer and CBBC presenter, couldn't help but leave a sweet comment saying ""Loverrrr [love heart emoji]"" on her boyfriend Harry's Instagram post amid all the rumours swirling about her alleged kiss with George.
A source spilled the beans to MailOnline about Anna's supposed secret smooch earlier this month, saying: ""This has been bubbling under the surface for months. But now Harry is on one of the BBC's biggest shows so his relationship is in the spotlight - Harry chose to forgive Anna, they're all young and everyone makes mistakes. The cheating has become even more ironic because of his appearance on The Traitors, which is all about deception."" Harry's team had no comment when Mirror Online reached out.
Harry and Anna have been an item for around two years since meeting in a Brighton club in 2022. They love posting cute photos together, like the one from their holiday in Greece that Anna captioned: ""Cheers to my best friend, who I'll forEVER do life with."" Before heading into the castle, Harry posted a snap with Anna, calling her his ""special person"". He wrote: ""Everyone's got that special person, I'm just lucky I've found mine already,"" with a red love heart to top it off.

Felicia Nicole turned to the fundraising site for assistance after getting fired over the weekend. The ex-Walmart employee said her clip went viral on TikTok—garnering more than 3,000 shares in just three days. She got an angry call from her boss soon after, demanding she take the clip down, which she did.
""Now Im jobless bc I was only trying to help and save that baby life,"" she lamented on the site. However, the internet seems to be on Felicia's side as hundreds of TikTok users thanked her for recording the video, which has since been re-uploaded and viewed more than 100,000 times.
Temperatures for that day plunged to 37°F (roughtly 2.78°C) in the Byram suburb of Jackson, Mississippi, where the incident took place.

Other comments ranged from individuals condemning the mother's actions to others citing the look on the boy's face, which they said looked desperate for help. Now, Felicia says she has two-months worth of rent thanks to the 623 people who donated to her fundraiser.
""I want to personally thank everyone who donated. I really appreciate it!!! I literally have enough to pay 2 months of rent thanks to u guys God sit high and look low and your blessings are coming too,"" she wrote. According to a post on Facebook by Central MS Mugshots, an account that posts mugshots taken in Hinds County, the mother, Gabrielle Kambria Darby was arrested the day Felica posted the viral clip.

The document states that she is charged with ""contributing to neglect,"" which can carry a maximum punishment of six years in prison. Felcia also said the mother claimed to have had Child Protective Services called on her two times prior to the incident. In the video, the boy is seen in nothing but a diaper as Gabrielle strolls him around. The ex-Walmart worker said it was as cold as -7 degrees celsius.
Before the video began, Felicia said a stranger draped a black jacket over the boy after Gabrielle declined to find something for him to wear. The mother totes a laid-back attitude the entire video, at one point twerking in front of the camera when a shopper threatens to call the authorities.
""As long as you got hot water, fire extinguisher...' she said, before dramatically pausing. When you come in the store fully dressed and your baby's not...""Felicia replied.
The situation simmered down once an older woman riding a mobility scooter bought a long-sleeved shirt and pants for Gabrielle's son, which she put on him at the store."
D1YY333L0L_ATU0CQFJ06K5XD4,'I made a terrible mistake trying to get my flat deposit back and almost poisoned myself',Danielle Kate WroeLifestyle Writer,"10:05, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-made-terrible-mistake-trying-31971964,"When you're leaving a rented property, you'll do anything to try and get your deposit back - but one woman took it to extreme lengths and ended up almost poisoning herself.
Emma Welsh was preparing to move out of her Birmingham home when she accidentally made chlorine gas while scrubbing her radiator clean. She had desperately wanted her £1,000 deposit back but didn't want to fork out the over £200 cleaning bill, opting to do it herself.
But when the 30-year-old wiped down her radiator, she realised that she'd made a terrible mistake by mixing two common household products together - bleach and malt vinegar - to remove stubborn stains.
She was using cotton pads to clean, and they turned bright orange. She was horrified by the pads, and after smelling fumes, she turned to the internet for help. ""I Googled it on my phone, and that's when I realised I'd accidentally created chlorine gas,"" she revealed.
""I knew I'd f***ked up because I was starting to smell fumes and wondered why the colour had appeared. The whole thing was so ridiculous, as I was just about finished cleaning the flat and had opened a beer to relax. The advice was to get away from the gas as soon as possible.""
As reported by Healthline, when bleach and vinegar are mixed, it can create potentially lethal chlorine gas. Emma said: ""I grabbed my cat, opened the balcony window to let some fresh air in, and told my friend, who found it hilarious but agreed I should call 111.
""At this point, my throat was burning, so I was glad I'd decided to be safe rather than sorry. The woman on the phone was really nice but concerned because chlorine gas can be so dangerous. I then got a callback and was advised to go to A&E.""
The unfortunate incident took place around 11pm, with Emma rushing to the hospital shortly after, arriving after midnight. When she realised that there was a six-hour wait to see a doctor, she attempted to leave but was told by the toxicologist that the risk was simply too great.
She explained: ""I felt like the biggest idiot in the world while in A&E. Thankfully, I ended up being seen quite quickly and the staff consulted the toxicologist, who did an amazing job. When a doctor inspected my throat, he said it looked like I'd burned the top layer of skin off. After that, I was sent for a chest X-ray.
""It was a really long wait for the results to come back, and I was so tired by this point. It took about four hours for me to get the all-clear. To pass the time, I ended up chatting to other patients, most of whom said they also had no idea how dangerous bleach and vinegar can be when mixed.
""Someone actually said they mixed bleach and vinegar in a bucket to clean, which is a lot more dangerous than my accidental mixing. We all learned something that night.""
Emma managed to get a few hours of sleep before the removal van turned up the next day, and after her ordeal, she also managed to get her deposit back. ""The mark was still on the radiator when I finally got home, but thanks to a post on Mumsnet, I was able to get it out with nail polish remover"", she said.
""The smell had gone and the flat was absolutely freezing, but I did the right thing by leaving the balcony door open. My cat was fine too - she just slept on the bed with the door shut while I was gone.
""In the end, I did get my deposit back, bar a minor deduction for some leftover cat hair. I'm hoping that by sharing this with a wider audience other people might learn from my stupidity. You honestly wouldn't think that two common products that most people use without thinking could be so dangerous.""
Dr Hamdan Abdullah Hamed, MBChB, a dermatologist, shared that if you're exposed to chlorine gas, you may feel ""itchiness or a burning sensation, followed by redness, blistering and peeling skin."" If you're further exposed, you could see ""dryness and scabbing below the initial layers of skin.""
He recommended that people ""move out of the area to reduce exposure and at the very least use water or cold milk to decrease the immediate effects of the chemical burns.""

It was reported this week that the EastEnders actor and Coronation Street star Ellie had enjoyed a string of dates, with them apparently seen holding hands. They were also said to have shared a kiss, after Ellie addressed rumours she was dating her pro dance partner Vito Coppola.
While neither of the pair have confirmed a romance, Ellie did share a sweet snap of them together online that only fuelled the rumours. Lorraine addressed the claims on her show on Thursday, calling it ""lovely"" and saying they had ""lots in common"".
Wishing them luck with their romance if it was confirmed to be true, Lorraine joked it was like ""primary school"" as she discussed their apparent secret meet-ups. She said: ""Welcome back. In the papers this morning there are reports Ellie Leach is dating fellow contestant Bobby Brazier.
""Apparently they've been holding hands on the Strictly tour bus. Like primary school that is, isn't that lovely. Going on secret dates, even sharing a kiss. It could be that they're just pals, who knows. Good luck to them if it is a romance. They've got a lot in common.""
It follows the reports that their friendship had blossomed into a romance. ""Their friendship has grown and grown, and they’ve been spending nearly all their free time together before and after performances,"" an insider claimed to The Sun. ""They’ve been having their meals together, and flirting increasingly openly. The chat on tour is they may have enjoyed a cheeky snog, and will go public with their romance any week now.""
Bobby and Ellie were recently pictured enjoying a cosy meal together ahead of the BBC show tour commencing. The two Strictly stars headed to Nando's to pick up a well-needed treat as they prepared to show off their dance moves across the UK.
Meanwhile, Ellie and her Strictly dance partner Vito confirmed their relationship status too, following rumours the couple were more than friends. ""We have a great relationship and honestly when you just find people, not just me and Ellie but their family which I love,"" Vito told The Mirror. When asked for clarification, the duo confirmed they were just friends.

Australian swimwear brand Moana Bikini (@moana_bikini) prides itself on empowerment and body positivity, but a recent campaign that features a male model has angered fans.
People are even going as far to say they are ""done"" with the brand, accusing it of trying to be ""woke"" after it championed a male model in a swimsuit shoot.
Moana Bikini have fiercely defended their decision, despite fans accusing the brand of going against everything they stand for.
""Is that a man? I thought you were about empowering women?"" One fan wrote on Moana Bikini's post, while another added: ""Horrible marketing. Why is it everyone is trying so hard to be 'woke' The model is gorgeous but this is not it.""
A third chimed: ""This is bad advertising if the target audience is women. A man wearing a piece designed for women....not going to make most women want to buy it.""
The post, which racked up over 1,000 comments, has caused outrage, but others didn't see the issue. One person wrote: ""These comments are weird...the bathing suits are for anyone who wants to wear them. Why does someone in a bathing suit bother you so much lol.""
After the post gained serious traction, the brand itself issued a statement and said: ""If Jake in our bikini upsets you that much we feel as though this may be a you problem.""
The model himself even clapped back at the negative remarks. Jake Wood stated that he's ""empowering"" a minority and said: ""There are many different types of women. Women with different anatomy to what you consider 'normal'.
""I am not a woman nor have I ever claimed to be. This post is simply empowering a minority and I'm forever grateful for that. Your hate is a reflection of your own insecurities, not mine. Thank you @moana_bikini.""
Another fan simply shared: ""We see plenty of women in Moana swimwear and showcasing an incredible man wearing a piece of literal CLOTHING does not take the empowerment away from women.""

D4NX021SKQ_IOV8MPGXAQ65WHO,Post Office investigator who pursued tragic postmasters bragged about clawing cash back,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"13:30, 23 Jan 2024Updated16:57, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/post-office-investigator-who-pursued-31945038,"A Post Office investigator who pursued two sub-postmasters who died without seeing justice bragged about the money he'd clawed back after being set high targets.
Robert Daily helped prosecute tragic Peter Holmes and William Quarm, whose convictions were finally overturned years after their deaths. The widows of both men said the wrongful prosecutions in 2010 had a devastating impact on their husbands.
An inquiry into the scandal heard Mr Daily proudly told his bosses in 2014 that he'd recovered over £68,000 in a year from suspects - well above the target he was expected to deliver. In a performance review the same year, he said he was ""taking all steps"" to claw back cash, as he confirmed investigators were given tough financial targets.
The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry, which is investigating the prosecutions of hundreds of innocent branch managers, heard Mr Daily rooted through Mr Holmes' house and car before even interviewing him. He refused to accept the former policeman's explanation that the faulty Horizon system, produced by software firm Fujitsu, could be to blame.
Instead he told colleagues he ""saw no reason"" not to take him to court, and Mr Holmes was convicted of false accounting in 2010. This was overturned in 2021, six years after he died from a brain tumour. Mr Daily, who refused to apologise, claimed he was unaware other sub-postmasters were also raising concerns about the software.
In a heartbreaking victim statement from 2010, Mr Holmes, from Newcastle, said: ""I do not believe that Royal Mail has conducted a thorough investigation and did not consider any alternative in relation to the allegation.""
In an interview with Mr Daily, the sub-postmaster said he had ""absolutely no idea"" where the money was, adding: ""I spent too many years in the police force seeing things go wrong to start stealing money from anybody.""
Representing victims including Mr Holmes' widow Marion, solicitor Christopher Jacobs told him: ""What I have to say to you is that Mrs Holmes and a lot of my other clients simply don't believe that. They can't accept that you had no idea that other sub-postmasters and assistants had problems with Horizon and were raising this.""
Asked if he felt personal responsibility for the injustice Mr Holmes suffered, Mr Daily responded: ""No I was only doing my job."" Mr Daily confirmed he and fellow investigators were expected to recover at least 65% of the money sub-postmasters were accused of stealing by 2014.
These were a factor in deciding their annual bonuses, he admitted. Just five years earlier, in 2009, the expected return figure had been 40%, the inquiry head.
Asked why it had gone up, Mr Daily said: ""I can only think it was because of the amount of losses the Post Office were suffering."" In a 2014 performance review, Mr Daily said he had ""achieved an 86% recovery"" in his cases - amounting to over £68,000.
Asked whether it was right that investigators were set targets for recovery of cash from those who were investigated, he replied: ""Yes."" Mr Daily, who joined the Post Office in 1979 and became a Security and Investigations Manager in 2005, also admitted that prosecutions were carried out in Scotland despite his colleagues not being qualified in Scottish law.
Before 2013, the inquiry heard, there were no Scottish qualified lawyers in the criminal law team, which made decisions on whether to proceed to court. Mr Daily said: ""It did concern me when I was on my own in Scotland in 2008/09.
""I was the only investigator, I felt as if at times I'd pass a case down to the criminal investigations teams and there wasn't an understanding of Scottish law."" Sub-postmaster Mr Quarm, who died in 2012, ran a post office in North Uist in Scotland.
His widow Anne said before the hearing that the ordeal left him a ""broken man"", and he was ""depressed and ashamed"" after being forced to plead guilty to embezzling money. And Mr Holmes' widow said the investigation and conviction had taken a devastating toll on him.
Speaking before yesterday's(TUE) hearing she said: ""Nobody believed him, I just wish somebody had just listened to him. It was obvious he wasn't guilty... Nobody that knew Peter ever thought that he was guilty."""
D7ZACIARP7_LMU718PQTGF9SFV,UN expert fears 'painful and humiliating' nitrogen gas death of Alabama inmate,Yelena MandenbergNews Reporter,"02:48, 25 Jan 2024Updated09:19, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/un-expert-fears-painful-humiliating-31961949,"America is to move forward with its first-ever nitrogen gas execution on Thursday as a US inmate faces the death penalty for a second time.
United Nations experts have “expressed alarm” over inmate Kenneth Eugene Smith's looming execution, saying this month in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Alabama to halt the execution, saying it “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”
Previously, Smith, 58, survived a botched attempt at lethal injection execution back in November 2022 where he spent four hours believing his death was only moments away. Now, 14 months later, if everything goes to plan, Smith will be the first ever person to be executed using this method in the US.

Smith is scheduled for execution in a 30-hour window starting just after midnight on Thursday, January 25, for his part in a murder-for-hire plot of a pastor's wife. Having had his share of life-threatening experiences, Smith is understandably concerned about what lies ahead.
He expressed his fears in writing, saying: ""I am worried that we have told Alabama that these risks could happen - will happen - just like we warned them last year. And they will do nothing to prevent these dangers from happening."" Smith's own attorneys have said the state is looking to make him the ""test subject"" for a novel execution method. Currently, Alabama is just one of three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that authorizes the use of nitrogen gas in executions.
Officials have said that during his execution, Smith will be strapped to a gurney, similar to those being executed by lethal injection. He will then be forced to breathe nitrogen through a mask until his body is completely depleted of oxygen and his organs shut down.
The state will fit a 'NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator,' a type of mask usually used by industrial workers, over Smith's face during the execution. After this, a warden will read out the death warrant and ask Smith for any final words before triggering the ""nitrogen hypoxia system"" from another room.
They have argued the mask the state plans to use is not airtight, and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, potentially even leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him.
A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit. Research has shown that when oxygen levels in the air drop to around 12.5 percent, humans can experience ""impaired respiration that may cause permanent heart damage"" along with nausea, vomiting, and ""very poor judgment and coordination.""
Therefore, if Smith were to inhale a small percentage of oxygen he could remain semi-conscious and suffer."
D9R7VY0CPR_ARODGVB2EP1DD5I,Scientists trialling breakthrough blood test that can help diagnose brain cancers,Ryan FaheyNews Reporter,"08:15, 26 Jan 2024Updated08:19, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/scientists-trialling-breakthrough-blood-test-31971450,"UK researchers are testing a world-first blood test that could help diagnose certain types of brain cancer in patients.
The simple test could reduce the need for invasive and risky surgery currently needed to diagnose some brain tumours, experts said. It could also lead to earlier diagnosis which in turn could speed up treatment and potentially increase survival rates for patients with one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer, they added.
Brain tumour experts have welcomed the news, saying that the test is inexpensive and would be easy to introduce to clinics. Experts said the liquid biopsy would be particularly beneficial for patients with “inaccessible” brain tumours, who could benefit from starting treatment as soon as possible.
Researchers at the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence, run by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, have performed the first studies to assess whether the test can accurately diagnose glial tumours including: glioblastoma (GBM), the most commonly-diagnosed type of high-grade brain tumour in adults; astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
They found the test had “high analytical sensitivity, specificity and precision”, according to a study published in the International Journal of Cancer. Scientists now hope to conduct larger studies in the UK to validate the results, and if successful, experts estimate that patients could benefit from the new test in as little as two years.
The TriNetra-Glio blood test, by Datar Cancer Genetics, works by isolating glial cells that have broken free from the tumour and are found circulating in the blood. The isolated cells are then stained and can be identified under a microscope.
Dr Nelofer Syed, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Imperial, said: “A non-invasive, inexpensive method for the early detection of brain tumours is critical for improvements in patient care. There is still some way to go, but this solution could help people where a brain biopsy or surgical resection of the tumour is not possible due to the location of the tumour or other constraints. Through this technology, a diagnosis of inaccessible tumours can become possible through a risk-free and patient-friendly blood test. We believe this would be a world first as there are currently no non-invasive or non-radiological tests for these types of tumours.”
Kevin O’Neill, consultant neurosurgeon at Imperial College Healthcare and honorary clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence alongside Dr Syed, said: “This test is not just an indicator of disease, it is a truly diagnostic liquid biopsy.
“It detects intact circulating tumour cells from the blood, which can be analysed to the same cellular detail as an actual tissue sample. It’s a real breakthrough for treatment of brain cancers that rarely spread around the body. This could help speed up diagnosis, enabling surgeons to apply tailored treatments based on that biopsy to increase patients’ chances of survival. I’m very grateful to everyone who has contributed to this study, especially the patients involved.”
Brain Tumour Research said that the findings are “significant” as less than 1% of patients with GBM live for more than 10 years and, for many, the prognosis is as little as 12 months. Dan Knowles, chief executive of the charity, said: “This ground-breaking research could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes for brain tumour patients. The research undertaken in UK universities is world class and something we should all be proud of, but we need so much more. There is an urgent need for novel approaches, particularly in the treatment of GBM, which is fatal in most cases.
Brain tumours kill more people in the UK under the age of 40 than any other cancer and we have to find a cure for this devastating disease. It is scandalous to think that there have been no improvements to treatment options for this type of tumour in two decades and the standard of care for GBM patients – surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – remains unchanged. This is why we are campaigning for the Government and larger charities to invest more and we will keep up the pressure until patients and their families get the help they so desperately need.”
And a family whose lives have been turned upside down after a glioblastoma diagnosis said that diagnosis delayed cost them “precious time”. Steve Ackroyd, a TV editor from Palmers Green, North London, was initially misdiagnosed with and treated for epilepsy. He was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumour three months later, in August 2022.
The 47-year-old, who has a 12-year-old daughter, had a biopsy followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy and is currently undergoing immunotherapy treatment in Germany. His wife Francesca Ackroyd, who set up a crowdfunding page to fund his treatment abroad, said: “In Steve’s case he went through a surgical biopsy to determine his tumour type, and we also found out that its diffuse nature meant it is inoperable. We waited seven weeks for the results only to find out that the tissue was later deemed to be a ‘poor sample’. Unfortunately, all the delays cost us precious time when he could have been on treatment.”"
DISEO56VJ2_02A1EKTX85N2YOK,Keir Starmer vows to finally get zombie knives off the streets with comprehensive ban,John StevensPolitical Editor,"20:00, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-vows-finally-zombie-31950288,"Keir Starmer today pledges to get knives off Britain’s streets, as he accuses the Tories of failing a generation.
The Labour leader says he will finally stop the weapons getting into the hands of criminals.
Five Tory Home Secretaries have promised a ban on zombie knives and machetes, but lethal blades are still available. More than 240 youths have been fatally stabbed since 2016, when the Conservatives first made the pledge. Families of victims have warned that the latest Government proposals are still too weak and exclude key weapons such as swords.
Labour will work with experts to extend the ban so that it includes a wider range of weapons, including changing existing rules on serration and length. They will also launch a clampdown to stop kids getting their hands on knives online.
Mr Starmer pledged to act swiftly and robustly if he becomes PM, saying: “If I announce a ban, you’ll get a ban.”
He added: “The number of these deadly weapons on Britain’s streets is shocking and unacceptable. “For years, Tory ministers have made grand promises of action while failing to deliver a proper ban on these killer knives and failing to crack down on online sales to kids. The tragic cost of this failure is being felt across our nation. Young people are being killed or maimed. Communities are blighted by fear. Yet these deadly weapons are still readily available.”
Mr Starmer warned that the Tories have “failed a generation of young people”. “While they dither and delay, Labour would act,” he continued. “There will be nothing short of a ban by my Labour government. And we won’t stop there – we’ll crack down on online sales, too. No child should be able to buy a deadly weapon as easily as they can online today.”
His promise comes after Idris Elba made a passionate plea to end the horror of knife crime as he launched the Don’t Stop Your Future campaign in the Mirror earlier this month. The actor stood outside Parliament among 247 piles of folded clothes, representing last year's knife victims in the UK. He is calling for an immediate ban on machetes and zombie knives.
In August last year, the Home Office announced new tougher rules on zombie knives on machetes. But the family of Ronan Kanda accused Tory ministers of going back on a face-to-face promise they made to outlaw the sale of swords.
The 16-year-old was stabbed with a 20 inch-long sword in a case of mistaken identity as he walked home from a friend’s house in Wolverhampton in June 2022. The teenage boys who killed him were able to buy a set of swords and a machete on the internet.
Progress on the Government’s new legislation has been slow and several high-profile incidents have occurred since it was announced including the killing of schoolgirl Elianne Andam. The 15-year-old was stabbed to death on her way to school in Croydon, South London, in September.
London mayor Sadiq Khan last night joined criticism of the Government’s failure to act in knives. He said: ""It's more difficult for a teenager to buy a lottery ticket than to buy online a machete or a zombie knife. There can be no reason why anybody would have a machete in this country, we haven't got forests like South America, there's no justification or reason to have a zombie knife."""

Morgan Ribeiro, 20, became seriously ill on a flight back to London Gatwick earlier this month after visiting Turkey for a £2,500 gastric sleeve procedure. The plane made an emergency landing in Serbia, and she died in a hospital in Belgrade.
Doctors told her boyfriend that her small intestine had been cut during the operation, leading to an infection and septic shock.
Her family said they did not know about her planned operation until just days before she was due to fly out and had told her of their concerns for her safety.
Her sister, 26-year-old Kayleigh Ribeiro, had begged her not to go through with the surgery, which comes with a number of health risks. Morgan had chosen to go for the private surgery in Turkey because she didn't want to be placed on ""an NHS waiting list for years."" She had also shared her plans with her followers on TikTok, and posted shortly before: ""My last post before WLS [Weight loss surgery]. See you on the other side"".
Morgan's mum Erin Gibson, 44, now needs to raise £10,000 to repatriate her body - and has discussed the heartbreaking reasons her daughter decided to have the operation. Speaking to the Independent, the mother-of-five said: ""Growing up she was bullied a lot, she's always battled with her weight and been a bigger girl and she had a really rough time with it.
""I told her she was beautiful inside and out, she really was a beautiful girl. By the time I found out it was too late, she was already on the plane. I had that sinking feeling because I'd heard horror stories about Turkey. I never ever want this to happen to another daughter. I don't want her life to be in vain.""
Morgan is reported to have had a virtual consultation in September 2023 with the company that operates the clinic in Turkey, before booking the procedure for January 5. But her boyfriend, James, said neither the medical staff nor any of the on-hand translators had explained to her the risks involved.
He also shared that that Morgan was ""really hot and in a lot of pain"" during the Wizz Air flight back to the UK, and had to be taken to the front of the plane by an attendant who tried to give her oxygen via a mask. ""I could tell something was seriously wrong"", he added.
In a tribute on her family's GoFundMe page, he added: ""My beautiful princess has passed away. She had been struggling with her weight all her life. She wanted to fit in. But in actual fact, she was the most beautiful woman and she was my other half. Me, my family, and her family are truly devastated. We must stay strong for her and give her the best possible send-off that we can. Any donations will go straight to giving her that perfect send-off. We will miss you Morgan you were the most beautiful person in the world and you were taken way too soon. Rest in peace, my beautiful angel."""

Chloe Norris' dad said he ordered the at-home manicure she had asked for, from the popular Chinese website which offers heavily discounted goods to consumers. But now Chloe's furious mother Stacey says she would never be ordering anything from the site again and argues the harmful product shouldn't have been available to buy in the first place.
The discount site apologised by offering the family from Sheerness, Kent, store credit for their ordeal. Chloe bought the nail glue with her own money at the beginning of December, with her dad Jamie, 45, ordering the product amongst some other items. Her mum, a 38-year-old who works as a carer, explained: ""My husband Jamie, Chloe’s dad, made the Temu order for her.
“She’d had a few things in the online basket, like keyrings, and her being his blue-eyed girl, he wanted to make her happy. He’s never bought nail glue before and didn’t know that buying cosmetics from some less-renowned companies can come with risks. Chloe chose the nails and glue separately. She’d done her own nails on numerous occasions, but never with products from Temu.
“She applied one nail to one finger whilst I was sitting opposite her chatting about biscuits. The nail glue must have fallen without any of us realising as Chloe suddenly said, ‘Mum, it’s burning’."" Mrs Norris said the nail glue, which had spilled onto Chloe's hands and along the length of her little finger, went white as soon as water touched it.
The mother-of-two added: “We held her hands under the water for 20 minutes and she said it was still burning. She was in a lot of pain and once it subdued a little we put Savlon on it and put her to bed.” The next day the secondary school pupil woke up with alarming blisters on her hands but still insisted on going to school as she didn't want to lose her 100 per cent attendance record.
“She went in but I received a phone call saying the blisters had gotten bigger and we needed to pick her up,"" Mrs Norris added “The blisters were about as long as a packet of chewing gum and they were filling up like balloons.” Chloe was taken to the Sheppey Community Hospital in nearby Minster, where she had her blisters popped by medical professionals - who told the family they'd been right not to try and pop them themselves.
""There was this jelly-like fluid inside. Underneath, where it was once skin, was just white. It was her nerves. Every layer of her skin had been burned off, there was no fresh pink skin beneath, just white, just nerves. She had no feeling where her skin was white but I was quite proud of her. She bossed it. She’s been a soldier.”
Sheppey Community Hospital contacted East Grinstead Hospital in neighbouring Sussex, which has a specialist reconstructive surgery centre where doctors confirmed Chloe would need to see them. ""The surgeons like to give burns two weeks to see if they will naturally heal themselves and after to-ing and fro-ing to the hospital for ten days, it was confirmed her burns were so deep she’d need a skin graft,"" Mrs Norris said.
Despite slight complications with Chloe having an allergic reaction to her dressings, the skin grafts proved successful, with Mrs Norris saying her daughter's burns were now 'healing really well'. But the concerned mother added that the dangerous product should never have been on offer in the first place.
“I just can’t get my head around it. The nails and the glue cost less than a pound, but that doesn’t excuse the damage it done. You can get nail sets from Primark for around the same cost that don’t do what the Temu glue did."" Her husband later contacted Temu, demanding an explanation from the discount retailer for his daughter's catastrophic ordeal and serious injuries.
The family sought legal advice but were told that because the glue had been sold by a third party through Temu, it would be near to impossible to track down the seller. Mrs Norris says she now wants to raise awareness of the dangers of buying unknown products from discount sites like Temu, and says she's just thankful her daughter got away with her injuries not being life-changing.
Asked if she would ever consider shopping at Temu again, she answered: ""Absolutely not. I want to know why Temu is selling this product. I don’t think the batch had been tested. Chloe is lucky she didn’t touch her eyes or face... I’ll avoid all nail glue from now on.”
A spokesman for Temu, though sympathetic towards Chloe and her injuries, said the product they sold did carry warnings to keep it out of the reach of children. He said: ""Firstly, we wish to express our sincerest sympathies to Chloe and her family. We are deeply saddened by the injury she has suffered. We were informed of the unfortunate accident by the family and immediately launched an investigation.
“The product was a cyanoacrylate-based nail glue, a substance known for its strong bonding properties. It is a popular item sold by many retailers and e-commerce platforms, primarily used for adhering artificial nails, attaching nail tips, nail repair, and nail art. While cyanoacrylate, or commonly known as super glue, is generally harmless when it comes into contact with the skin, there have been reported cases of burns resulting from its reaction with certain materials, such as cotton and wool.
“It is essential to emphasise that we take product safety very seriously. The product carried specific warnings to keep it out of the reach of children, and the merchant provided the necessary certification for the product. However, we understand accidents can happen, especially in situations where the glue was inadvertently spilled and then touched. Our focus has always been on supporting Chloe and her family during this difficult time. We have extended an offer of £1,500 credits as a goodwill gesture.
“This decision is not intended to shift responsibility but reflects our acknowledgment of the unfortunate situation and our commitment to our customers’ well-being. Our thoughts remain with Chloe and her family, and we are committed to resolving this matter in a manner that is fair and respectful to all parties involved."""
DNIPXZI65E_OS91OXNZ8CVNAMQ,Tory leadership runners and riders as party told ditch Rishi Sunak or face 'massacre',Lizzy BuchanDeputy Political Editor,"13:32, 24 Jan 2024Updated09:31, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-leadership-runners-riders-party-31954435,"Tory MPs have been told to oust Rishi Sunak or risk being ""massacred"" at the general election by a former Cabinet Minister.
Sir Simon Clarke triggered a fierce bout of Tory infighting with his attack on the Prime Minister, as the desperate party spirals into further acrimony. Despite the Conservatives ousting Boris Johnson and Liz Truss in 2022, Sir Simon suggested that a FOURTH Prime Minister could be named before the next election.
His comments were branded ""self indulgent"" and ""divisive"" by Tory MPs but underlined the unhappiness with Mr Sunak's leadership as Labour maintains its commanding poll lead. Whispers have been growing about no-confidence letters to the backbench 1922 Committee, with only 52 needed to trigger a confidence vote.
It would be extraordinary for the Conservatives to topple another leader - but no party does regicide better than the Tories. Here are some of the names in the frame to succeed Rishi Sunak.
The Business Secretary became the darling of the Tory right after a better-than-expected run in the first 2022 leadership contest. Despite being an outsider in the race, she made it to the final four before being eliminated - and significantly boosted her profile with the Conservative grassroots.
Ms Badenoch, 44, is the bookies favourite and remains popular with Tory members, who help to decide who leads the party. She also topped the most recent Cabinet league table by Tory bible, Conservative Home, with a net satisfaction rating of 63.9. Rishi Sunak's rating was -26.5 in December.
As Minister for Equalities, Ms Badenoch often weighs into the culture wars and takes a hard line stance on trans rights. But she blotted her copybook with Tory Brexiteers after watering down the Government's promise of a ""bonfire of EU laws"" last year.
Hard-liner Suella Braverman is another name in the frame to be the next Tory leader. Popular with the grassroots for her tough stance on immigration, Ms Braverman, 43, has also made enemies in her own party for her divisive rhetoric.
A number of Tory MPs complained to the whips about a speech she made claiming refugees were pretending to be gay to make spurious asylum claims. Others were riled by her suggestion that rough sleeping was a ""lifestyle choice"" for some. Mr Sunak was finally forced to sack her when she accused the police of bias over pro-Palestinian protests.
But her endorsement of Mr Sunak was key during the contest to replace Liz Truss. She still commands support from MPs and Tory members but could lose out if Ms Badenoch picks up support from right-wingers as she did in the 2022 leadership contest.

The sword-bearing Commons Leader did no harm to her leadership chances with her prominent appearance at King Charles's Coronation last year. Indeed, Ms Mordaunt, 50, came joint second in the latest ConservativeHome league table, with a net satisfaction rating of 47.5.
The former naval reservist, who was made the first female Defence Secretary by Theresa May, has an eclectic CV, including an appearance on ITV's Splash! and a stint as a magician's assistant. She is seen as more to the moderate side of the party - but is a long-time Brexiteer.
Ms Mordaunt has run twice to be Tory leader, coming third in the race to succeed Boris Johnson in 2022, and losing out to Mr Sunak in the fast-tracked contest to replace Liz Truss later that year. Could it be third time lucky?
Gaffe-prone James Cleverly has had a rocky start to his time in the Home Office. He was forced to apologise when the Mirror revealed he joked about spiking his wife's drink at a Downing Street reception - the day the Home Office launched a crackdown on the crime.
Mr Cleverly, 54, was also accused of calling his department's Rwanda deportation scheme ""batshit"" and branding Stockton North a ""shithole"". He denied insulting the constituency and claimed he was actually insulting the MP Alex Cunningham.
Despite his tendency to put his foot in it, Mr Cleverly has held a number of top Cabinet jobs including Foreign Secretary and Education Secretary, and served as Tory co-chairman. The Army reservist ranks 16th in the ConservativeHome Cabinet league table but attracts decent odds to be the next Tory leader from most bookies.
It would be extraordinary if the former Prime Minister had another stint as Tory leader. But let's face it, who was expecting his bombshell return as Foreign Secretary last year?
Enough people clearly believe it's possible for bookies to offer odds as good as 20-1. Lord Cameron, 57, would have to become an MP again to run for the top job - something he recently ruled out.
He also said he is “not after any other role” in the Tory party. But that doesn't mean he couldn't change his mind.
He's not even a Tory - but Tories love him, with bookies offering decent odds on him becoming leader. The former Ukip leader has been flirting with his old party for months, even showing up at Tory conference in Manchester last October.
Mr Farage, 59, claimed he could be Tory leader by 2026 but later claiming he was speaking in jest. The I'm a Celeb contestant could simply be enjoying winding the Tories up, and making the most of the media attention.
There are plenty of hurdles for him to overcome. He would have to be readmitted to the Tory Party and quit Reform UK, which he founded. He would then have to win a Commons seat - something he has repeatedly failed to do. But he is likely to play a prominent role in Tory fortunes, whether he is in the party or not.
Could he really come back? The disgraced former Prime Minister is still beloved in Tory circles and some MPs think he's the only one who can save the party from electoral oblivion.
Tongues have been wagging in Westminster over whether Johnson allies are behind recent attempts to destabilise Mr Sunak. In eye-brow raising timing, a mega-poll was published in the Daily Telegraph ahead of the crunch Rwanda vote that suggested the PM was leading the party into electoral oblivion. It was paid for by a shadowy group called the Conservative Britain Alliance - who have no online footprint. Lord Frost, a longtime ally of Mr Johnson, was the only name associated with it.
The main issue is he doesn't have a seat after resigning as an MP last year to avoid being ousted over his Partygate lies. But there has long been speculation that he could nab a safe seat if the party decides it needs him."
DP8EH6QXIH_IA5BSK1HZNEB8WD,Man who lived in flat where Grenfell Tower fire started speaks for only second time,Matthew YoungNews Reporter,"19:55, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-who-lived-flat-grenfell-31951220,"The man who lived in the flat where the Grenfell Tower fire began says the disaster has left him as “a ghost of a man”.
A statement by Behailu Kebede was read out yesterday at the start of Grenfell Testimony Week, an event which was put together after a compensation deal was reached last year for people affected by the June 2017 tragedy.
A legal hearing in May was told there had been a settlement of about 900 cases and a global sum of about £150million compensation agreed. Before the testimonies began, the names of all those who died in the fire were read aloud, followed by a 72-second silence – one for each life lost.
Behailu, who was born in Ethiopia, said he came as a refugee to the UK in 1992. He said: “I know, in my head, that the fire was the fault of RBKC [the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea], Celotex, the Government... in my heart – which is full of fear and grief, it was in my flat, my kitchen, where it started. It’s a deep pain, a shame that I carry.”
Behailu was cleared of blame by the official inquiry into the disaster but felt unable to attend the community’s marches or the inquiry.
He said: “I did not have the courage. I can’t really say I’m any better [today]. My partner and my children live with a ghost of a man.” Organisers of the four-day event said it is being held to give the bereaved, survivors and residents an opportunity to “speak directly to organisations that many hold responsible for the fire”.
Marcio Gomes, the father of a baby stillborn following the blaze, described the life his son could have had, telling the firms represented: “This is what you have taken away from me.”
Marcio and his wife Andreia Perestrelo were expecting their third child on August 21 2017, but Logan was stillborn in hospital following the blaze. The couple lived with their two daughters in the North Kensington tower for 10 years, and all four escaped the blaze.
Other testimonies included from Emma O’Connor, who lived on the 20th floor and managed to escape with her partner on the night of the fire. Ms O’Connor, who is disabled, said: “I still struggle every day with survivor’s guilt.”
The 24-storey tower was covered in flammable cladding in a refurbishment which finished in 2016. Representatives from Celotex, Exova, London Fire Brigade, Kingspan Rydon, and Whirlpool Corporation all accepted invitations.
Cllr Kim Taylor-Smith of the RBKC attended, as did representatives of the Home Office and Ministry of Housing, which was run by Eric Pickles from 2010 to 2015, and who gave evidence to the inquiry. Inquiry chair Sir Martin Moore-Bick was among those gathered at Church House in Westminster, sitting alongside lead counsel Richard Millett KC.
Arconic, which supplied the cladding, helped fund testimony week but was not represented."

It was exactly a week ago that Kate was admitted to the London Clinic for her successful, planned operation. The 42-year-old princess is expected to remain there for between 10 and 14 days in total. Her husband Prince William has cleared his diary of official visits and meetings, with no mentions of William in the Court Circular – the daily record of royal engagements – since his wife was admitted.
Kate's last public appearance came on Christmas Day when she accompanied the rest of the Royal Family for the traditional walk to church in Sandringham - and there was no indication of any impending health issues.
And according to PEOPLE magazine, within William and Kate's broader circle of family friends and even those who work closely with the royals, the news of her hospitalisation came as a surprise. The publication says it also understands that after Christmas, Kate and the family had spent time at their Anmer Hall home in Norfolk catching up with friends before the princess spent her birthday on January 9 privately.
Kensington Palace announced news of the princess’s surgery last Wednesday, with Buckingham Palace sparking a double royal health scare just 90 minutes later by revealing the King was preparing for treatment for an enlarged prostate. The King has also cancelled engagements ready for his corrective procedure in hospital this week.
Meanwhile, Kate was last week said to be ""doing well"", with William spending time at her bedside. She is not expected to return to official duties until after Easter. A royal source told The Sunday Times the Waleses have switched to ""100% family first, day job second"". Aides insist the princess will be out of sight over the next few months but is likely to be working behind the scenes.
""Her passion for the early years is clear – there will be a huge continuation of that campaign and she will be keen to be out continuing that conversation with the nation as soon as possible,” the source told the newspaper. Kensington Palace has not revealed further details of the princess’s condition but confirmed it was non-cancerous.
A spokesman said: ""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible, and her wish that her personal medical information remains private."""

Rishi Sunak promises ­open-ended combat against Iran-funded rebels in Yemen. He’s already upped military aid to Ukraine by £200million to £2.5billion a year.
“We are living in a pre-war society,” blusters Defence Secretary Grant Shapps.
A top NATO commander says the alliance is preparing for a conflict with Russia “in the next 20 years”. As part of the build-up, 20,000 British troops will take part in the biggest European exercises against the Kremlin since the Cold War.
A new, populist government in Slovakia warns that taking Ukraine into NATO – as demanded by Field Marshal Boris Johnson and other Tory bigmouths – “would be a basis for World War Three”. And now British defence chiefs warn of conscription to fight a potential NATO war against Russia, because the Army is too small.
What does all this hawkish talk amount to? In one sense, just that: talk. But to my mind, it’s dangerous talk, that could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The more the top brass and the chest-beating politicians compete with each other, the more their warlike rhetoric risks the real thing.
I was born on the day German troops occupied Monte Cassino in the Second World War. My generation lived with the consequences of that global struggle. Casual talk of war, especially by old sweats and bellicose has-beens in public life, is a luxury we cannot afford."
DVG1C7TPSM_BM9O2BRGI263IAM,Kenneth Smith: Everything we know about Death row con facing 'human experiment' execution,Liam BucklerUS News Reporter,"12:25, 25 Jan 2024Updated09:47, 26 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/kenneth-smith-death-row-inmate-31965241,"Kenneth Smith, a 58 year old convicted murderer on Alabama's death row, is set to face the death penalty in a controversial ""human experiment"". His lawyers' last-ditch attempt to halt the ""cruel"" execution has failed.
Smith was due to be executed by lethal injection in 2022, but it was called off at the last minute when authorities couldn't connect an IV line before the midnight deadline. Now, Alabama plans to put an industrial-type respirator mask over Smith's face and replace his breathing air with pure nitrogen gas, causing him to die from lack of oxygen. This method has been slammed by human rights campaigners as a ""guinea pig"" experiment and there have been legal battles to stop this controversial method.
Having previously survived a botched lethal injection, Smith is understandably worried about his upcoming execution and the new method planned. He wrote: ""I am worried that we have told Alabama that these risks could happen - will happen - just like we warned them last year. And they will do nothing to prevent these dangers from happening.""
EXCLUSIVE:  Mystery over nitrogen execution death with fears it'll be 'incredibly painful'
But just who is Kenneth Smith, the man who has been on death row since 1996?
The 58 year old man was one of two men found guilty in the 1998 contract killing of Elizabeth Sennett. Prosecutors say he and another man were each paid £1,000 to murder Sennett by her pastor husband, who was drowning in debt and wanted to cash in on her life insurance.
Elizabeth Sennett, aged 45, was discovered dead in her home in Colbert County with eight stab wounds in her chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner's report. Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr., took his own life when the investigation turned towards him as a suspect, court documents reveal. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the murder, was executed in 2010.

Smith's initial conviction in 1989 was overturned. He was found guilty again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge overruled this and sentenced Smith to death. Alabama no longer permits a judge to override a jury's decision on the death penalty.

Charles Sennett Jr, the victim's son, insisted that Smith ""pay for what he has done. "" He said: ""And some of these people out there say, 'Well, he doesn't need to suffer like that.' Well, he didn't ask Mama how to suffer?"" ""They just did it. They stabbed her - multiple times.""
Smith, who has been on death row since 1996, had attempted to be executed by lethal injection in Alabama two years ago. However, the executioners were unable to find a vein before the state's death warrant expired at midnight.
An inmate lay fastened to the execution bed for nearly four hours, according to his lawyers. They were waiting to know if he would be executed.
His solicitors made a plea stating that trying to execute inmates numerous times infringes on the Eighth Amendment of the American Constitution. This law protects people from punishment that's ""cruel and unusual"". Nevertheless, the powers that be turned a deaf ear to his appeal. His execution was given the green light.
Nitrogen hypoxia is a new method of execution. It causes death by making the prisoner breathe pure nitrogen, which takes away the oxygen they require to survive.
No major states have used this method so far. However, there are some like Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi, where it has now been legalised since 2018.
Some American states are exploring new ways to conduct executions as drugs currently used in lethal injections are hard to find.
Nitrogen forms 78% of the air present around us. It is both odourless and colourless. It doesn't harm humans, provided there are proper levels of oxygen to go with it.
The logic behind nitrogen hypoxia is turning the air composition fully into nitrogen. The aim is to make the offender lose consciousness and then die due to an inadequate supply of oxygen.
Most of what we know about how nitrogen exposure kills people comes from industrial accidents and suicide attempts, according to medical journals.
Smith's lawyers argue that the state wants to use him as a ""test subject"" for a new execution method. They claim the mask they plan to use isn't airtight, and oxygen could leak in. This could lead to a prolonged execution, potentially leaving Smith in a vegetative state rather than killing him. One doctor testified that the low oxygen environment could cause Smith to become nauseous and choke on his own vomit.
The United Nations Human Rights Council warned earlier this month that using this execution method could be considered torture. Similarly, the American Veterinary Medical Association stated in their 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia might be okay for pigs under certain circumstances but not for other animals because it can cause distress.
Smith's lawyers fought to stop the execution. They claimed the state wanted to use the 58 year old as a ""test case.""
The 11th US Circuit of Appeals listened to Smith's plea on Friday to halt the execution. Smith claimed that the state's planned methods breach the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
He also stated that Alabama violated his rights by scheduling the execution while he has ongoing appeals, and that the face mask will disrupt his ability to pray.
Smith also argued that it would break the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment for the state to try a second time to execute him after he already survived one execution attempt. However, his appeal was denied.

The unnamed 53-year-old man's body was recovered by local police after he disappeared during a walk near the Pico de Las Nieves in Gran Canaria on Monday. A helicopter search was carried out, sadly retrieving his body on Tuesday.
The man's wife raised the alarm at around 5pm on Monday following the outing near the 6,390ft peak - the second highest on the island. The hunt for the missing man was halted just before 8pm due to a lack of light, but continued on Tuesday morning on the ground as well as in the air with the incorporation of an emergency and rescue helicopter.
Rescuers spotted him just after midday in an area described as being “difficult to access”. He was recovered around 5pm today after an operation involving Civil Guard officers, firefighters and Civil Protection workers.
An investigation was launched into the unnamed man’s death and remained ongoing this evening. Police sources who confirmed his nationality said everything was pointing to him losing his life in a ""tragic accident"".
A spokesman for a regional government-run emergency services co-ordination centre, confirming the search operation and subsequent discovery of the man’s body, said: “Around 1pm an emergency and rescue helicopter located the body of a man who had died and after receiving judicial authorisation, evacuated it a car park at the viewpoint at Pico de Las Nieves so the Civil Guard could take over. The alarm had been raised around 5pm on Monday.
“The information received was that a person had gone walking from the lookout at Pico de las Nieves and hadn’t returned. The search operation was launched immediately.”
The man is thought to have been on holiday in the area, although there has not yet been any official confirmation from police. The ongoing investigation is being coordinated by a local court.
Pico de Las Nieves, meaning 'Snow Peak' in English, is easily accessible by car, bike or foot. Despite its name there is hardly ever any snow on the peak.
It was regarded as Gran Canaria’s highest peak until it was ousted from its top spot by another mountain next to it called Morro de la Agujereada after it was discovered to be just 19 feet higher."

Ivan Petrelli was arrested in October 2018 on suspicion of kidnap for ransom and assault in Italy and was identified as a suspect by one of the victims. He and five others were accused of taking revenge on two people they believed had stolen from the house of the dad of one of the members of the group. The pair were forcibly taken to a secluded field near Carmiano, Italy, where they were showered with kicks and punches.
The two pals were then ordered to hand over €8,000 (£6,800) to “compensate” for the alleged theft. When Ivan, 45, was first questioned by the police, he exercised his right to remain silent but he later decided to plead innocent.
His sat nav and mobile phone data corroborated his claim that he was elsewhere with others on the day of the assault in September, 2018, but judges in nearby Lecce ruled his claim of innocence as unreliable and so it was thrown out. Petrelli's dead-ringer brother Mimmo came clean to the police about how the events really unfolded as did Ivan’s co-suspects and even the wife of one of the victims, who was present when the pair were snatched - which led to Ivan’s release on bail in January 2020.
But a month later, judges sentenced him to 11 years in prison and this sentence was finally overturned on appeal. By the time Ivan was found innocent, he’d spent almost a year-and-a-half between remand and house arrest. After he was ruled innocent he told Corriere del Mezzogiorno: “Thank God this bad nightmare is over. I have never lost hope of being acquitted from this unpleasant situation, because when you are innocent you believe in justice, even if this story, in some moments, It led me to have some doubts.
""From one day to the next I found myself in prison, torn from the arms of my wife and daughter, locked up in the maximum security section of Lecce prison for something I didn't commit."" He has now returned to court in Lecce, but this time to ask for €300,000 (£256,000) in compensation for his ordeal, which he says has also affected his family. The case is ongoing."

Joe Conaboy starred on the former ITV talent show in 2013 alongside his Kingsland Road bandmates, making it to the live finals of the programme. The band who amassed thousands of followers before even entering the competition were instantly a hit with viewers at home.
Matt Cahill, Joe, Jay Scott, JJ Thompson and Josh Zaré sadly found themselves being the fourth act to be eliminated from the competition, despite the public voting to save them. But 11 years on, the group have since parted ways and although Joe is still making and releasing music, the 29-year-old has taken a very different career path.
Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, Joe revealed that shortly after leaving the show, he was working in restaurants to pay the bills while the band were still making music. But during the coronavirus pandemic, his decade-long career in hospitality came to an end when he was made redundant.
""I was working three jobs, I was working in Aldi, doing takeaway bits,"" he said, before signing up to do an apprenticeship in plumbing alongside his brother-in-law, Steve. But Joe later embarked on a course in tiling, adding: ""The rest is history – that's how I went from doing that to tiling, it's a weird old journey.""
Although his career often sees Joe out at all hours, he admits family life comes first, especially his 13-month-old son and his wife, Lisa. Discussing his hectic schedule which he fits around making music, Joe said: ""I need to work to pay the bills and to feed him. And then on top of that, just finding time, being self-employed helps a bit."" Nowadays though, he's known online and to his customers as ""The Singing Tiler"".
""I kept getting reviews on my business pages saying 'Great work, clean, tidy and considerate but I'm going to miss his singing,'"" he explained before adding: ""One of the plumbers I was working for said 'Why don't you just play on that a little bit as a singing tiler?' And he was he actually wanted to brand my whole business around being a singing tiler.
""I started a little TikTok to see where it takes me. I've just been doing TikTok for about four months just whilst I'm at work, certain jobs, something to keep the fire ignited."" Joe went on to reveal that after leaving the show, he and his bandmates were ""sitting around for about a year,"" waiting for Syco (Simon Cowell's label) to decide whether the band were being signed.
During this time, Joe took up a job at the London Cabaret Club, working as a VIP waiter. He said: ""I was working the press night and loads of industry people were like 'Why are you here? Are you performing?' and I was like 'No, I work here now,' and they went 'Oh, ok,' so that was a bit demoralising. It's been a mad journey but I enjoy tiling, I'm my own boss.""
Shortly after leaving the programme, Joe found himself seeking help for his mental health and was prescribed anti-depressants. "" Looking back, I thought I was mature and grown as a person,"" he said, adding: ""But now, in hindsight, I realised that probably it wasn't a great environment for a 19-year-old lad to be a part of. It wasn't great, I've found coping mechanisms now.
""Since then, I've channelled that into my music, I've had a few problems which have focused on mental health and have had a few songs synched on Killing Eve and Cold Feet."" Before appearing on the show, Joe and the band had interest from record labels and performed a showcase for one major label which encouraged them to appear on the show.
Now, he acknowledges that record labels often discover talent and sign them through TikTok and although he hopes to be successful because of his solo music, he admits the platform is ""great"" for artists. ""All I want to do is music, it's been a battle over the last ten years since the X Factor,"" he said.
But these days, Joe releases music on his own accord, under the stage name Frown, with releases including Weightless, Lay With Me and Frayed. ""All I can do is try,"" he explained before adding: ""I've learnt not to get caught up on things or get too excited about opportunities that may arise.""
Despite the band officially splitting in 2015, they went on to release their debut single, Dirty Dancer in August the year before, instantly becoming a hit with fans. Several months later, they signed a record deal in America and went on to release their debut album, We Are the Young.
Although this may have seemed like a dream for most, Joe admits that things turned out very differently. ""We had management in New York and we had a 12-day East Coast tour of America planned,"" he said before continuing: ""We were going on the Amy Schumer show, we were supporting Shawn Mendes, we were doing a few Six Flags (amusement park) shows.
""Due to events, that all got cancelled and we ended up splitting up. That knocked me a bit, that would have been incredible. Even if we split up after America, you know, it would have been cool."" But to Joe's surprise, his cousin who was living in California often heard Kingsland Road's album being played at social events.
""That was mad to me, he was buzzing because he got to tell everyone it was his cousin,"" he said before adding: ""Who knows what would have happened.""

E7RYTVWAH9_W5MBN20S6HUFD5Z,Ex On The Beach star Jemma Lucy says she could have died after suffering ectopic pregnancy,Charlotte McIntyreAssistant Showbiz Editor,"07:02, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ex-beach-star-jemma-lucy-31971307,"Ex On The Beach star Jemma Lucy has bravely shared her terrifying ordeal of suffering an ectopic pregnancy last year, which could have ended her life.
She was rushed to the hospital in December with severe pains, which she now reveals were due to the dangerous pregnancy condition. The NHS explains that an ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes.
Speaking about her scary experience, Jemma revealed that doctors warned her she could die if her pregnancy ruptured. She said: ""Doctors told me that if the pregnancy ruptured, I could die so they wanted to take me in for emergency surgery.
She told The Sun: ""I was terrified of going for the operation and never waking up. I didn't know what to do, and every minute was like a ticking timebomb.""
Jemma also confessed that she was not only scared about the surgery but had previously experienced suicidal thoughts as a side effect of anaesthesia. Thankfully, Jemma was treated with an injection of methotrexate, which stops the baby from growing, and was later discharged from the hospital.
While in hospital, Jemma told her followers she didn't want her then boyfriend Nicholas Sinclair to visit. She said: ""It's my choice, I prefer to do these things alone so I can zone out and just deal with it. Nick wanted to come but I said no. Is that weird? Like I just prefer to be alone but feel like no one gets that.""
Jemma left the hospital on December 23 and soon after, it looked like she and Nicholas had broken up. She got people talking when she took down photos of Nicholas from her social media. They used to post quite daring photos together on Instagram, but now those pictures are gone from both their accounts.
Jemma and Nicholas were first seen as a couple in September last year, after he broke up with Ruby Adler from Made In Chelsea.

E8OINMZGIE_U3WPVFNXQIB0XIO,Futuristic theme park with attractions and 'space hotel' is just two hours from UK,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"17:22, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/futuristic-theme-park-attractions-space-31957770,"A theme park that plunges thrill seekers into a weird world of optimistic futurism is just two hours from the UK.
In Britain the biggest attractions tend to be sold on the enormity of their rollercoasters - see Thorpe Park and Alton Towers - or are themed in line with cheerful children's characters, such as Legoland, Peppa Pig World and Flamingoland.
The same cannot be said for France, where one of the country's largest attractions attempts to capture not just a concept but a whole tense - the future. Futuroscope, formerly known as Planète Futuroscope, is an unusual coming together of multimedia, audio-visual techniques and atypical rides that all have a distinctly 80s feel of scientific futurism.
Head to the park and you will find yourself equipped with a virtual reality headset racing alongside Sébastien Loeb, given a POV of space through French astronaut Thomas Pesquet's Eyes in the IMAX Laser 4K movie theatre and transported into space to the Cosmic Collisions planetarium.
Futuroscope is home to a number of one-off rides that are based less on taking riders as fast and high as other theme parks might, but by attempting to shift their perspective and employ multiple forms of media in innovative ways.
One ride which does this is L'Extraordinaire Voyage where a video screen and moving row of seats gives thrill seekers the impression that they are soaring through the air across the world to Sahara, Dubai, the Himalayas and the Ganges.
Objectif Mars is a rollercoaster that lets children as young as six simulate a mission to the Red Planet. The educational ride used to have a spinning element built in, but this was removed after one of the carts burst into flames last year.
Danse avec les Robots has remained happily flame free and sees riders strapped into a seat at the end of a robot's arm. They are then spun and swirled and flung around in time to very French sounding electronic music.
New this year will be the park's first waterpark, as part of the resort's huge investment plan designed to increase the park's 650,000 annual visitors to 2.5million. It comes after hotel Station Cosmos opened in 2022, which lets guests sleep in a space station"".
The park has a solid 4.3/5 on Google reviews, having been visited more than 50 million times since it opened in the early 80s. Reviews tend to be positive, although some people have complained of the fact Futuroscope only has one classic rollercoaster.
""One of the best 4D experiences my family and I have ever tried. Very futuristic and full of curiosity. You will never expect what's coming. Do not miss out on the Tornado Chaser ride and the robot dance. It's awesome!"" one person wrote.
Another added: ""Great place for family most of attractions are for kids at least 120cm, so pay attention for heights of your little ones. We went in February. Unfortunately the weather was a bit cold but the great advantage - we entered directly to attractions, no waiting lines.
""It was a bit annoying that most of the attractions are virtual so at some point I felt dizzy. Their final fountain show is just amazing. I have never seen something similar!""
From the UK, probably the quickest way to get to Futuroscope is to fly with Ryanair from London Luton to Poitiers, which is just a few miles from the theme park. A one way ticket is currently available for just £15. It is also possible to get the Eurostar to Paris and then change to a regional train. Buying tickets on the door costs €54 (£47) per adult and €44 (£37) per child."
EASUJJW5M1_76GJNWKVE7Z45C5,Police target Black kids as they ramp up use of stop and search on children,Sophie HuskissonPolitical Correspondent,"18:05, 25 Jan 2024Updated18:11, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/police-target-black-kids-ramp-31966173,"More than 100,000 children aged 10 to 17-years-old were stopped and searched last year as officers increasingly use the tactic on young people.
Home Office data revealed Black kids made up 20% of those stopped by police - even though they make up just 6% of the population. They are the only ethnic group to be disproportionately targeted.
Politicians and police argue stop and searches reduce crime but in the year ending 2023, 77% of the 107,800 uses of the tactic against children resulted in No Further Action. Just 10% led to an arrest. The total number of stop and searches involving children has gone up 13% in the past year.
London accounted for almost a third (32%) of stop and searches of children in England and Wales. A damning report into the Met Police last year by Louise Casey said the use of stop and search by the force needed ""a fundamental reset"". She also highlighted research that shows ""larger numbers of Black people felt traumatised and humiliated by the experience of stop and search than other ethnic groups"".
Meanwhile Black children also face huge overrepresentation in being held in custody while on remand (waiting for their case to be heard in court). They make up 33% of children held on remand in youth custody. In total 61% of kids on remand held in custody are from a minority ethnic group, with while children making up 39%. Almost two thirds (63%) of children remanded to youth detention accommodation at some point during court proceedings did not subsequently result in a custodial sentence.
Pippa Goodfellow, Chief Executive of the Alliance for Youth Justice, said: “Today’s shocking statistics serve as a warning sign about the increased use of stop and search powers on children, while remaining at the same level for adults. These alarming statistics also confirm racial inequalities within police interactions with young people, showing the disproportionate and systematic targeting of Black children.
""Rather than a narrow focus on enforcement and stop and search, we need recognition and investment for organisations and programmes rooted in our communities, enabling appropriate and holistic support for children and young people where and when it is needed to keep them safe.”
Last month the College of Policing, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, and the Independent Office for Police Conduct found ""a range of shortcomings"" in the police's use of suspicion-less section 60 stop and search powers.
The review was prompted by the Criminal Justice Alliance (CJA), which submitted a super-complaint about the use of stop and search powers across England, arguing that is ""significantly harming the interests of the public"". The super-complaint raised concerns about ""harms caused by 'suspicion-less' stop and searches and inadequate scrutiny of stop and search powers"". The CJA said it was concerned that it is a “discriminatory and traumatising power” and that “the impact of stop and search can be long-lasting and traumatising, especially when used on children and young”.
Nick Glynn, the head of the police racism watchdog, said: ""Research shows big increases in stop search have an imperceptible impact on crime, and we know lots of stop search drives a wedge between police and young Black people in particular. The police should prioritise investment in long term solutions to violent crime, as should government because they both know simply doing more stop and search makes good headlines but doesn't work.""
Mr Glynn, who is interim-chair of the Independent Scrutiny and Oversight Board (ISOB), is holding police forces accountable to the Police Race Action Plan, which was set up in June 2020 after the murder of George Floyd in the US by a white policeman. He added: ""Policing keeps going round in circles, with periods of ramping up stop and search. When they do, it leads to perverse outcomes, encouraging officers to break the law by doing searches where they don't actually have reasonable grounds as the law requires.""
A National Police Chiefs' Council spokesman said: ""We know that the use of stop and search can have a significant impact on individuals and communities, particularly our black communities and young people.... We know we haven’t always got that balance right and we are committed to transparency about our use of the powers.
“Currently confidence in the police among Black people is far too low and we need to change that to be legitimate and effective. The Police Race Action Plan sets out the commitment of chief constables in England and Wales to become an anti-racist police service that Black people can trust.
“One of the key actions in the plan is to adopt an approach that seeks to understand any race disparity, seek to explain it or build a case for potential reform and develop a new national approach to help forces tackle race disparities in their use of powers, including stop and search. We anticipate this is likely to include some changes in training.""
The Prime Minister's spokesman, when asked about a surge in stop and search use among children, said: “All I would continue to emphasise is we are seeing, and indeed the ONS continue to note, a long-term downward trend on crime. I think that is something the public would welcome. Obviously it is the police in the first instance that would address any change or patterns of behaviour around specific crimes but we’ll be backing them to do so with 20,000 more police officers on our streets.”
Pressed on a disproportionate number of black children being targeted, he said: “I think it’s entirely right that our police officers have clarity on the appropriate ways to deploy stop and search. It is a valuable tool and has helped contribute to falls in crime but of course it must be used appropriately at all times and officers use significant training on how to use it.”
Asked whether it can be assured stop and search is reducing crime enough, given 77% of child stop and searches did not requite any action, he added: ""I think obviously it would be for the National Police Chiefs Council, working with the Home Office, to consider emerging trends of changes in statistics in the first instance but it’s for police operationally to deploy the best use of the powers they have.”"

Customers on a recent flight were shocked when a ""hungover"" passenger was making strange noises while passengers were boarding the plane. According to one eyewitness, a man was seen swearing under his breath and looked ""disgruntled."" Their concern was over whether he had been on a big night out before the flight or was suffering from some kind of bowel issue.
“Before most people had boarded, I observed that this man was audibly disgruntled about something, maybe hungover, rough day idk, but as soon as he sat down he was grumbling about something under his breath, like ‘f—ing hell’ or something,” user lamgalatx wrote on a viral Reddit post.

Once the majority of passengers boarded the flight from Phoenix, Arizona to Austin, Texas, the man reportedly shouted: “You thought that was rude? Well how about this smell” - and farted extremely loudly. “(I don’t know) what provoked that comment, and while kinda funny to overhear, it was uncalled for especially coming from a grown man on an airplane nonetheless,” the user wrote. “The man who just purposefully farted moments ago decides to loudly and condescendingly say ‘Yeah, everybody, let’s just eat the smelliest food possible all at the same time.
“A guy in the row over replied, ‘If you don’t like it you can fly private’ to which fartman says ‘That’s so f—ing rude,’ and another person nearby chimes in ‘I think we’d all agree you’re the rude one here,’” the witness added.

During this bizarre interaction, flight attendants went over and told the man ""that's enough"" as the plane was taxiing to the runway but was forced to come to an abrupt stop, according to the passenger. “An announcement comes over saying ‘Apologies for the interruption but we are returning to the gate, we will give you more info when we have it,’” the user wrote. “We get back to the gate and a flight attendant comes back and informs fartman that he will not be staying on this flight. He simply replies, ‘I don’t understand’ and she tells him they’ll talk about it off the plane.”
The man was ordered off the plane once he grabbed his belongings. The airline was praised for its actions and thankfully passengers were on their way after a 25-minute delay.
“We all breathed a sigh of relief when he was removed, I think most ppl were on edge about what he may say or do next. The trip was only delayed by 15-30 minutes, so all in all, I think American handled it swiftly,” he added. The comical story led to many Reddit users with their gas-related jokes as one person wrote: “Maybe another flight was low on gas?” and another added: “He missed an opportunity to fart on the way out and yell, ‘SMELL YOU LATER!’”
American Airlines has been contacted for comment."
ECM7G10Z52_54A4AZ0FKJ8L286,"'Sensible' man who fell to his death from balcony on holiday was 'clumsy', inquest told","Ben Mitchell, PA agency","17:55, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sensible-young-man-who-fell-31959117,"A Brit holidaymaker fell to his death from the third floor of a Vietnam guest house while “seriously intoxicated”, an inquest has been told.
Benjamin Milner, from London, was visiting Ho Chi Minh City during his travels to south east Asia when he died in the early hours of November 5, 2022. The 46-year-old was seen by the guest house manager “talking to himself” so she told him to go to his room on the third floor, the inquest in Bournemouth was told.
When a noise was heard from the street outside, the manager realised Mr Milner had fallen and laying on the ground, bleeding. CCTV footage showed him “standing unstable and he fell into the main door of the guest house” when he arrived earlier, coroner Rachael Griffin said.
Callously, Mr Milner's phone and wallet were found to be stolen after his death. Vietnamese authorities concluded there were ""no signs"" of suspicious circumstances in his death.
A post-mortem back in the UK found Mr Milner had died of multiple injuries from the fall, including multiple factures to the skull. Blood tests also showed he had 278mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood at the time - more than three times the legal UK drink-drive limit and which would have meant “serious intoxication”.
In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Milner’s sister Amanda said: “Ben was a very sensible young man, very into healthy eating and looking after himself. He was interested in computers and was very knowledgeable in that area.”
She said he “rarely” drank sociably in the UK, though the inquest was told his family described him as a “clumsy drunk”. Ms Milner said on behalf of her family that her brother’s death “left a huge hole in their lives”.
Ms Milner also told of her frustration that the Vietnamese authorities had not provided the CCTV footage mentioned by the guest house manager. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Ms Griffin said: “There is no evidence of any third-party involvement in his death.
“I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he died as a result of multiple injuries sustained from a fall from height.” She added: “I understand it’s disappointing for the family not to have the exact circumstances of what happened to Ben.”
She continued: “Ben was very much loved and his death has caused great devastation. He was somebody who lived life very much to the full. He enjoyed life and he enjoyed travelling.”"

Christopher Kapessa had been playing near the River Cynon, near Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in Wales, on July 1, 2019, when he was pushed into the river, and drowned. The 13-year-old Mountain Ash Comprehensive pupil was deliberately pushed into the river, Assistant coroner David Regan ruled today, after a two-week hearing at South Wales Coroner's Court.
A group of teenagers were spending time by a bridge known as the Red Bridge. Christopher tragically died when another boy, who was today named as Jayden Pugh, now aged 19, pushed him into the water in what the coroner said was a “misplaced sense of fun, as a prank, and not with any malicious intent”.
The teenager claimed he had slipped and knocked Christopher off the edge - something the judge said was incorrect, rejecting Pugh's evidence. In January 2022 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to prosecute Pugh. Four witnesses told the inquest in Pontypridd that Pugh, then aged 14, had pushed Christopher from a ledge into the water, after saying words to the effect of ""shall I push him in"".
Christopher, described as ""loving, caring, passionate and very protective"" by his family, died after entering the River Cynon. His mum said the family had been racially abused in the area before her son tragically died.
Delivering his conclusions in the case, Mr Regan said: ""In my judgment, Christopher was deliberately pushed into the back from behind by [the boy] using his hands. [The boy's] actions deprived Christopher of the opportunity to decide whether or not to enter the water. I have no hesitation in finding that Christopher did not consent to being pushed into the river.""
Christopher, who was not a confident swimmer according to his mother, began panicking and shouted for help. Other children, including the boy alleged to have pushed him into the river, jumped in and tried to rescue him, but Christopher disappeared below the surface at about 5.30pm.
The CPS said a prosecution was not in the public interest. Christopher's mother Alina Joseph later challenged that decision at a High Court hearing in London but two judges ruled against her. Ms Joseph has previously accused the CPS and South Wales Police of institutional racism in their failure to prosecute Pugh.
She said the inquiries stopped a day after the incident had taken place, when it was decided her son’s death had been an accident. The BBC reported that when the decision not to charge the 14-year-old was reviewed, Jenny Hopkins, who oversees the appeals and review unit within the CPS, said: ""Although there was evidence to support a prosecution for manslaughter it was not in the public interest to prosecute.""
Mr Regan described how Christopher fell 2.5 metres from the ledge into the river, into water that was 2.5 metres deep, and had not been able to prepare for his entry. Christopher's head became submerged, he is likely to have suffered from cold water shock, which would have led to the involuntary ingestion of water, the coroner said. Emergency services attended and Christopher was recovered from the water at 7.25pm. He was later declared dead at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.
The coroner praised the evidence of one witness, Isabella Watts, who gave “clear, precise, and measured” evidence helping prove Christopher was pushed into the water. She described the boy accused of pushing Christopher as standing directly behind him. Ms Watts said she directly saw the boy push Christopher, with his hands on the middle of his back.
Mr Regan referred to Ms Watts becoming distressed. He said the witness had refuted the boy had stumbled into Christopher and had said “It weren’t about blaming, it was about telling the truth”. When asked if it was important to be truthful from the beginning, she said: “Yes, we were 13 and we were scared.”
Mr Regan said: “She struck me as an intelligent, open and honest witness doing her best to assist the court in circumstances it was natural she became distressed by events she witnessed.”
Before the hearing concluded, Mr Regan expressed his condolences to Alina Joseph and her family. He said: “I wish you all the best for the future and I’m sorry for your loss.”"
EEY9HZNOUP_AHUXQLL657YJ0HD,Man suffers serious injuries after house explosion blows windows out on Leicester road,Tom Mack,"17:35, 24 Jan 2024Updated20:09, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-man-rushed-hospital-serious-31959841,"A man has been rushed to hospital with serious injuries after an explosion at a flat.
Police continue to investigate the blast near Beaumont Leys, Leicester, which happened at around 4pm today. Witnesses said they saw people, including children, run for cover and windows were left shattered. An Amazon delivery driver dashed to help rescue the man, believed to be in his mid-30s, from the ground-floor property.
A Leicestershire Police spokesperson said: ""Officers received a call at 4.07pm today (24 January) following a report of an explosion at a flat in Kelbrook Close. A man within the property has sustained serious injuries and is being taken to hospital.
""Kelbrook Close and a number of surrounding roads remain closed, and some nearby flats have been evacuated as a precaution. Colleagues from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service are also at the scene while enquiries continue.""
There were multiple firefighters in the street, and police tape spanned the width of the residential road, witnesses said. A Cadent Gas van is also parked close to the scene, and a representative from the company has confirmed it was called out.
Traffic was heavy in the residential area due to the investigation, as a result of which several roads were closed. Beaumont Leys is a suburb with a growing population, around three miles from the city centre.
Josh Cooper, 25, told Leicestershire Live the blast was so powerful he thought part of his own home, across the street from the blast, had blown up. He said: ""It was loud. I dropped my packet of crisps.
""I came out and saw lots of smoke. I had been panicked because I thought it was my own house. I saw people coming out of the buildings, some with kids.
""An Amazon driver had gone inside and came out with the man. I saw the man who was hurt. He was conscious but he was badly burned.""
Neighbours said they suspected the incident was a gas explosion, having heard that some people in the area had smelled gas beforehand. One resident, who didn't want to be named, said: ""It's just so scary. The gas can build up and then one spark and boom. It really makes you think. I heard from someone that the blast was so powerful it blew their front door right open.""
Kelly Wilson, 37, who lives in a house across the street from the explosion, said: ""I heard a hiss first, then the bang and it exploded.
""The windows all blew out and there's glass all across the street and it went everywhere. It was a really big explosion. It shook my whole house.""
Cadent do not believe the explosion is related to the gas network. A spokesperson for gas emergency service said: “We are at the scene of this incident to support the emergency services and ensure everything related to gas is safe. Whilst it is too early to say what caused the explosion, we do not believe it is related to the gas network.
“Incidents like this serve as an important reminder – to call the national gas emergency service on 0800 111 999*, day or night, if you smell gas.”
Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service was called to Kelbrook Close at around 4.10pm today to reports of smoke seen coming from a flat and an explosion heard.
A spokesperson said: ""There is no cause at the moment but we are going back to investigate tomorrow. An appliance has just left the scene but we will be returning for reinspection for any hotspots."""
EFKQ1JQU1F_OC0D7CBRQ05AAWM,BBC The Traitors Jaz' rollercoaster real life from dad's heartbreaking betrayal to luxury proposal,Beth Hardie,"21:15, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bbc-traitors-jaz-rollercoaster-real-31964756,"The Traitors contestant Jaz's world behind the scenes is anything but quiet as he tries to 'rebuild' his life after a devastating blow with the help of his stunning fiancée and their cosmopolitan lifestyle.
As one of the Faithfuls on BBC show The Traitors, Jaz Singh is tragically well-equipped for sniffing out lies. Fans of the hugely successful reality series have witnessed his impressive detective skills and strategic thinking but there's a reason the National Account Manager from Manchester is now so switched on in this area.
When 30 year old Jaz was concerned that fellow contestant Paul was a Traitor rather than Faithful after noticing a few tactical moves, he gave a big hint at his inner pain. Speaking to the camera, he said: ""[I] never take kindness for weakness because I've been through so much in my life after having quite a rocky upbringing. I know what it's like to be lied to, so I don't trust anyone in this place.""
Jaz eventually shared what was behind his utter heartbreak to the other dumbfounded contestants when he told them how his entire world fell apart after he discovered his dad, who was his ""idol"", was leading a double life.
He revealed that if won the prize money he would use it to rebuild his family following the exposure of his father's terrible secret. ""Growing up my dad was my absolute idol, everyone respects him, he's considered quite influential, powerful. That's the man I want to be. And then we found out he had a whole second family that we didn't know anything about. He was a grandad,"" he said.
Jaz also confessed he knew his mistrust of people came from the devastating bombshell. ""It just hit us hard. That level of betrayal is just difficult to experience at a young age, so then you start to think 'can you trust people', like that's my dad. That is painful. When your dad is your idol, you don't want to be told that he's not what he was supposed to be,"" he said.
""My father was a central piece of the jigsaw, so when you take that central piece out, it's almost like a Jenga block that comes crashing down. And slowly but surely I'm in the process of building up my family because that was absolutely devastating.""
Despite suffering the ultimate betrayal, it doesn't seem to have stopped Jaz from trusting his feelings and it seems he is already repairing his life by starting a new one. He's in a long-term relationship with stunning fiancée Harneet Kaurl and it was her parents who encouraged Jaz to apply for the Traitors.
The TV star got down on one knee back in August 2021 when he went all out with his proposal on a city rooftop terrace decked out in red with a huge heart on the floor. A firework went off behind Harneet as he asked for her hand and he posted the moment on Instagram.
The couple also love to share their incredible life together and enjoy many luxurious get-aways. Last December the pair visited New York where they visited famous landmarks, with Jaz naming the images ""Liberty Living"".
They spent Christmas there and were also pictured under a huge green archway decked out in baubles and fairy lights with the caption, ""Christmas in NYC, completed it.""
Dubai appears to be a favourite destination, with Jaz enjoying boat trips in the wealthy country and flexing his ripped body in a pool beside a bar. The pair also visited the Algarve, Portugal where they stayed in a fabulous hotel with amazing sea views.
As well as their holidays together, they like to eat out at fancy restaurants back home in Manchester and Jaz seems to enjoy a spot of fishing in the English countryside as well to relax and come back down to earth.

EIT2Q2PUTA_6JIWMT8RR2QQ97H,King Charles urged to 'slow down' by Queen Camilla following major health update,Susie BeeverNews Reporter,"23:14, 22 Jan 2024Updated23:20, 22 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/king-charles-urged-slow-down-31943525,"King Charles has been urged to ""slow down"" on his duties following a health scare, it has been reported.
Queen Camilla has reportedly told him to reduce his engagements in a bid to rest up. It comes after Buckingham Palace announced the monarch was due to undergo an operation on an enlarged prostate later this week.
In the past year, the King has already undertaken royal visits to France, Germany and Kenya, on top of his coronation in May. Charles was seen driving around the Sandringham estate on Monday after travelling there by plane from Balmoral on Friday. Camilla, 76, told well-wishers he was ""fine"" as she carried out engagements in Swindon, Wiltshire, on Monday.
According to The Sun, an insider claimed: ""The Queen has told him he needs to slow down a bit.” The Palace issued a statement on the King's scheduled ""corrective procedure"" shortly after it was revealed Princess Kate was recuperating after abdominal surgery. Statements on the Royals' health are unusual, particularly two in close proximity.
It comes as royal expert and historian Dr Tessa Dunlop believes it may have actually been an obvious move - in order to protect Kate. She explained to the Mirror: ""It is highly unusual for the Royal Family to divulge private health matters. In that respect the shared information about the King's enlarged prostate was unprecedented, and it was also canny.
""Buckingham Palace doesn't do spontaneity; the release of a statement containing private matters about the King's health immediately after news of the Princess of Wales' major abdominal surgery was deliberate. The timing deflected from his daughter-in-law's major operation, likewise, the private detail concerning his prostate gave the public something else to think about. (The NHS website saw increased traffic on the subject).
""But beyond that obvious strategy, I believe there was something else at play. By sharing a slice of the personal, Charles's statement served to underline the absence of any real detail concerning Kate's condition. The protective King may as well have said 'Here, have some information on me, but keep your prying eyes away from my daughter-in-law.' Read side-by-side the statements are a powerful example of well-coordinated PR. Here was a modern, public service Royal Family, but one with very clear boundaries.""
It's understood the King made his diagnosis public to encourage more men to get checked out. The announcement clearly worked, however, prompting more than 26,000 visits to the NHS England page on prostate enlargement in the following 48 hours - compared to the average of just 1,400 a day.
It's not the first time the family are thought to have urged Charles to take a breather. Prince William remarked in a 2018 documentary released for his 70th birthday how the man ""never stops"". “When we were kids there were bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him,” he claims.
Charles is also known to only eat two meals a day, and takes his evening meal ""ridiculously late at night"", according to Prince Harry. He told the documentary: “And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he’ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.”"

Speaking to PEOPLE at the premiere of his movie titled The Underdoggs, Snoop said: ""She's doing a little bit better."" He went on to admit that his daughter's health scare had put life into perspective in a way. Snoop, who parents Cori with his wife Shante, shared the slightly positive update while Cori remains in hospital receiving medical care.
It appears as though she is ready to come home following successful scans. Taking to her Instagram Stories, Cori thanked fans for their outpouring emotions. She also shared a clip of bouquets of flowers by her bedside as she promised to share more in depth information shortly.
She revealed she was getting a CT scan of her chest in a bid to discover what exactly caused her stroke, sharing a boomerang video to her Story of her bed being rolled into the scanning room. When back in her room, she shared the good news of her results while watching Goofy on the TV.
She wrote: ""My ct scan of my chest came back normal and I'm going home today. I can prolly cry omgggg. Thank you thank you for the continuous prayers, love etc.""
Cori's news last week stunned her followers. As she announced her stroke, she heartbreakingly asked, ""what did I do to deserve this?"". In the emotional reveal, she detailed the scary ordeal, writing: ""I had a severe stroke this a.m. I started breaking down crying when they told me. Like I’m only 24, what did I do in my past to deserve all of this.""
At the time, she didn't detail what led up to her stroke, but she was only six-years-old when she was diagnosed with lupus. Lupus is a disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems — including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs, according to Mayo Clinic. It can also increase the risk of a stroke.

EMT82OR8QP_RPWXGBJ75T8329O,British expats told to 'f*** off back where you came from' after church bell letter row,Kieren WilliamsNews Reporter,"09:25, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/british-expats-told-f-back-31953209,"British expats were told to “f*** off back to where you came from” after moaning about local church bells.
Dutch neighbours were left less than impressed after some Brits abroad launched a petition to ask a local church to can its bell ringing overnight. An unnamed Brit, living in the Dutch capital, penned a letter to fellow residents of their neighbourhood, Leliegracht, where they had lived for around two years, about the restoration of the nearby Westerkerk clocktower.
When the works are completed, it would see the Cathedral restart its bell ringing, which they said took place every 15 minutes throughout the day and night. In the note, the Brit said they had already complained, but that they had been informed the City of Amsterdam would need more complaints. This led to the author prompting others to follow suit and complain as well.
They wrote: ""For over a year now, the Westerkerk tower and its bells have been under renovation. It is expected to look beautiful when finished. My partner and I have lived in the neighbourhood (Leliegracht) for over two years now. Before the renovation, as you probably also know, bells rang every 15 minutes, all day and all night.
""The City of Amsterdam has already received complaints. We also asked ourselves the City if bells could stop at night (for instance from 23pm to 7am) in order to guarantee a better sleep. The city responded that it had brought the topic to its internal committee, but they concluded that it would need more complaints to make a change.
""If you are also bothered by the bells, you can send a message to the City of Amsterdam (see contact details below) explaining your concern. So that we could all enjoy the beauty of the cathedral without the inconvenience of noise.""
However, their letter didn’t go down well with their neighbours and De Telegraaf reported that the first response told her to ""f*** off"" and ""go back where you came from"" as well as to ""learn good Dutch first"".
The remarkable response will draw comparisons to anti-migrant rhetoric in the UK when people have told migrants to go back where they came from amidst the toxic debate over immigration.
The noise-hating author, for whom the bell now may be tolling, told De Telegraaf: ""I am so sorry, I did not want to offend anyone. I only wanted to exchange ideas about it … I am learning Dutch, I am doing my best and I love the city. What should I do now? Move?""
The Westerkerk debate sparked responses from across parts of the European nation. But this isn't the first time it has hit the news as in 2019 expats similarly moaned about the bells - drawing similar ire from locals."

Karen Beale is on trial accused of spiking the coffee jar with the male erectile stimulant, as well as other chemicals, at the fire protection plant Envirograf in Dover, Kent. Suspicions were first raised after a staff member in the plant's office noticed her cuppa tasted off and had blue and white specks in.
Jurors at Canterbury crown court heard how secret footage - set up after suspicions were first aroused - then captured Beale fiddling with the Nescafé jar. Opening for the prosecution, barrister Matthew Hodgetts told the court: “Not what you would expect to be in Nescafe.”
The jury was shown camera footage from September 2018 lasting 13 minutes showing Beale, 62, handling the jar with blue latex gloves, occasionally shaking it and removing the lid to decant some of the contents before placing it back on a shelf.
In another clip, Beale was seen handling the jar with her sleeve pulled over her hand, which the prosecution claim was an attempt not to leave fingerprints behind. After the footage emerged, police were alerted, testing jars in the offices where she worked to find two contained a number of abnormal ""ingredients"" including Viagra and a drug to treat high cholesterol.
Beale was charged with attempting to administer a poison or other destructive or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy. Beale denies the two charges, claiming she has been the victim of “malicious allegations”, having told police she had only been “inspecting” the coffee.
Mr Hodgetts told the jury that, while neither substance would seriously hurt anyone ingesting it, Beale had intended harm was “hoping and intending it would have some effect and, at the very least, some annoyance”.
The court heard accountant Katrina Gravenor, who suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, even wrote a letter to her GP in August that year saying something was making her ill and she had “narrowed it down” to her brew. But the doctor told police Ms Gravenor’s arthritis was “unlikely” to be linked to the coffee.
A jar in company secretary Jean Smith's office was found to contain what appeared as a blue, white and pink granulated substance. When interviewed by police and told about being filmed, Beale, now of Westbury, Shropshire, denied any wrongdoing but admitted she had “handled” the jar.
“The reason she had done that, she said, was to inspect its contents because she had heard a rumour something was going on at work,” explained the prosecutor. “But she declined to provide any details of what that rumour was.”
Former holistic therapist Beale also gave evidence, maintaining her innocence and claiming she had been asked to “keep an eye on [the coffee]” by the general manager and, when challenged as to why she had not told police of his instructions when arrested, Beale told the court she feared reprisals from him on her return to work.
“He just said Katrina Gravenor was concerned about her coffee and believed one of the night staff was tampering with it and for me to just take a look and keep an eye on it,” the defendant said. It was also heard Beale's husband and daughter had previously worked for Envirograf, but she denied wanting her family to get both women's jobs or any grievances with Ms Gravenor or Ms Smith.
When asked during cross-examination by Mr Hodgetts whether the alleged contamination was “an amusing power trip” for her, Beale, who has no previous convictions or cautions, replied: “I have never put anything in anybody’s coffee.”
The court also heard that following her arrest she was sacked by Envirograf for gross misconduct. She appealed that decision however because she “didn’t do anything wrong”, she added. The trial continues."

Sam Atkins, 29, attacked his former partner, Raehanna Cameron, 36, at a flat in Granton Crescent, Edinburgh in March 2023. Atkins' pal Charles Paul, 69, tried to intervene before he was stabbed at least 22 times before dying.
Appearing at the High Court in Glasgow, Atkins pleaded guilty to murder as well as two charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Lord Clark, described the horrific situation as an ""act of appalling brutality.""
Raehanna started a romantic relationship with Atkins back in January 2022. The court heard that as time passed, she began to feel 'unsafe' around him.
Realising that she no longer felt comfortable being Atkins' girlfriend, she decided to split up with him. On the day of the attack, she left his belongings outside her flat. However, what she didn't realise was that he was already in the building.
She discovered him in the hallway, holding two knives. Hotel porter Charles, who was also at the scene, had become an integral part of Raehanna's life, vowing to protect her after her father passed away. Charles tried to plead with Atkins to ""calm down"" before attacking Raehanna. Atkins then launched his fatal attack on Charles.
In a desperate attempt to save her friend, Raehanna contacted 999. However, when police arrived Atkins jumped out of the second-storey window and took off on foot. He was later tracked down by police dogs. Charles sadly died at the scene.
Defending Atkins, Ronnie Renucci KC, claimed that his client had been ""under the influence"" at the time and could not recall the killing. He said: ""He has had difficulty accepting what he had done. He does not recognise the person who committed these offences.""
Lord Clark sentenced Atkins to at least 18 years, explaining that the parole board would decide as to ""whether and when"" he would be released. scotland>Police Scotland hopes that the killer's imprisonment will bring closure to Paul's loved ones.
Det Ch Insp George Calder said: ""These were despicable and callous acts carried out by Atkins, who showed an utter disregard for the life of Charles Paul or for the woman he seriously assaulted."""

Right-wing Conservative Miriam Cates raised the case of 14-year-old Mia Janin, who is believed to have taken her own life, after claims she was cyber-bullied emerged. Schoolboys allegedly used a group chat to make fun of her on Snapchat, an inquest heard.
Speaking to Mr Sunak at Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Cates said: ""This morning the press reported the tragic case of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life following horrific social media bullying, including on TikTok and Snapchat. Since 2010, across the English speaking world, there's been a marked increase in poor teen mental health, teen suicide attempts and children addicted to pornography.
""The United Kingdom has a strong tradition of legislating to protect children from serious threats to their safety and welfare. So does my Right Honourable Friend agree with me that it's time to consider banning social media and perhaps even smartphones for under 16s?""
The PM responded: ""My Honourable Friend is absolutely right to highlight the impact of what happens online on our children and that's why our Online Safety Act tackles both criminal activity online and protects children from harmful or inappropriate content such as bullying, or the promotion of self-harm, accessing pornography and also exposure to eating disorders.

""Ofcom are now rightly developing and consulting on the guidance in the codes and practices for how those platforms will meet their duties. And if they don't clean up their act, then Ofcom will be able to impose fines of up to 10% of global turnover on the social media firms.""
Mia, a year 10 pupil at the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton, north-west London, was found dead at her family home in Harrow on March 12 2021. In the statements given to the police, her friends said that Mia was bullied by other pupils at the school, and that their friendship group was nicknamed the ""suicide squad"" in the months leading up to her death. They said that one of Mia's TikToks was shared to a Snapchat group chat run by male pupils at JFS, where they made fun of her.
Ms Cates, who was elected as MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge in 2019, co-founded the right-wing New Conservatives group alongside fellow backbencher Danny Kruger. The group support traditional family values. Ms Cates has said that getting Britain reproducing again is ""fundamental to our survival"" as she claimed the education system is ""destroying children's souls"". She has been outspoken in her concern about declining fertility rates in Britain, calling for policies to promote marriage and having children.
In 2021, Ms Cates and Mr Kruger also established the New Social Covenant Unit (NSCU) to promote ""families, communities and the nation"". Earlier in 2023, the NSCU published a review commissioned by Ms Cates criticising sex education and claiming children were being shown inappropriate material, prompting the Prime Minister to order a review of guidance on the subject. Teaching unions denied Ms Cates' claims, saying there was ""no evidence to suggest there is a widespread problem"" and calling the review ""politically motivated""."
ETKLE1G8VS_D807SY3Z55OA0YS,Royal Mail latest: Are letter deliveries being cut down to three days a week?,Levi WinchesterMoney Editor,"10:18, 25 Jan 2024Updated09:15, 29 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/royal-mail-latest-letter-deliveries-31963362,"A review into the future of Royal Mail has this week suggested the postal service could reduce the number of days it delivers letters to UK households.
Under current rules, Royal Mail is required to deliver letters six days a week, Monday to Saturday, to all 32 million addresses in the UK. But the company argues that the volume of letters being sent has halved from 14 billion in 2011 to roughly seven billion in the 2022/23 financial year.
Royal Mail is also battling substantial losses, having posted a £319million loss for the latest half-year. Industry regulator Ofcom has warned the UK postal service risks becoming “unsustainable” without reform, which is why it has looked at potential changes that could be made.
However, campaigners have argued that reducing the number of days it delivers letters would be detrimental to the elderly and vulnerable people. Almost four-fifths – 79% – of more than 2,000 people questioned by Ofcom said there are “some things they will always need to send by post”.
The number of parcels Royal Mail is delivering - it is required to deliver parcels five days a week - rose to a record 3.6 billion in the 2022/23 financial year. So what changes have been suggested as part of the review, and would they likely become law?
Ofcom has said Royal Mail could be allowed to drop the number of days it delivers letters to five days, or even three days, a week. The regulator said the company could save between £100million and £200million if letter deliveries were reduced to five days, while the savings would be between £400million and £650million if it went down to three days.
It could also make changes to existing first and second class and business products, so that most letters are delivered through a service taking up to three days or longer, with a next-day service still available for any urgent letters. Ofcom has stressed that these are just proposals at this stage.
The regulator is ""inviting views from interested parties"" to contact it by April 3 to ""understand the potential impact on people and businesses"". It continued: ""This includes vulnerable people, those in rural and remote areas of the UK’s nations, as well as large organisations who use bulk mail services.""
Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom Chief Executive, said: “Postal workers are part of the fabric of our society and are critical to communities up and down the country. But we’re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels.
“The universal service hasn’t changed since then, it’s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don’t take action. So we’ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we’re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of second class stamps.”
Any change would require Government and Parliament approval - and this week, Prime Minister appeared to slam the proposals and said he ""will not countenance"" ending Saturday postal deliveries. A spokesperson from No10 said: ""Obviously Ofcom has a role here and is reviewing the future of Royal Mail.
""But the Prime Minister's strong view is that Saturday deliveries provide flexibility and convenience that are important for businesses and particularly publishers and the Prime Minister would not countenance seeing Saturday deliveries scrapped.""
Before the review was released, Ofcom said: ""It would ultimately be for the UK Government and Parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service."""

A team of independent experts is preparing to prove whether the infamous three-fingered Peruvian mummies are alien life forms for a new TV documentary. Producer Serena DC has expressed her frustration that all previous investigations into these mysterious bodies have been conducted behind closed doors. She said: ""It is now time for the world to know the truth.""
Unlike scientists in Peru who labelled the figures as dolls, Serena's team will film independent autopsies and medical scans related to these controversial beings. This comes after an independent study from Mexican officials claimed the ET figures were ""dolls"" made from human and animal parts.

Serena, an Emmy-nominated documentarian and alien investigator, has been given exclusive access to examine the ""non-human bodies"". These were presented to the Mexican congress last year. In exclusive photos, Serena is seen with the mummies and promises to ""once and for all find out the truth"" in her new show, The Nazca Alien Autopsy.
The photos show Serena and her team with what are declared as recovered bodies. Mexican journalist and self-proclaimed ""UFOlogist"" Jaime Maussan initially presented these unidentified objects. Serena is working diligently to clarify uncertainty around the figures, which seemingly have ribs and internal organs. She shared a snapshot of herself next to one of the claimed creatures during filming. Her crew will also travel to Peru to inspect 14 more bodies found in a mass grave.
Working closely with Maussan, who discovered these mummies four years ago,is Serena DC. Her new film, We Are Not Alone, has been a hit worldwide. Through her intriguing documentary, she aims to delve into and dissect Maussan's controversial find in Nazca, Peru.
Eager to discover the truth about these supposed bodies, Serena said: ""We are representing the people to discover what the truth is about these bodies. We do not know. I believe in extraterrestrial life and if this is a fake we will expose it as a fake. I need to know if it is true or not.
""If it is not true I will lead the charge to expose these people for the charlatans that they are. It is driving me crazy. I have seen these bodies in the cases. From the outside they look real, but they could be fake. After examining them in a laboratory and doing these tests, we will share our findings with the world.
""We will stand in that room and watch the testing and film the scientists. We have been granted permission to view, film and dissect a small part of these alien mummies to help determine their true origins. Our aim is to draw a conclusion on whether they are real or not.
""Everyone has opinions but we are taking people who are qualified to do independent DNA tests and medical scans. This comes down to science. We will engage with experts in genetics, anthropology, and archaeology to scrutinize the methodologies and findings of the mummy examinations and explore the validity of the DNA testing and body scans, addressing skepticism and uncovering potential implications for our understanding of human evolution.""
Over the weekend, Flavio Estrada, an archeologist from Peru's Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences Institute, declared two discovered mummies in Peru as non-alien, according to a report. In Lima, these small specimens were described by experts as humanoid dolls, possibly made with both human and animal parts.
Estrada announced: ""They're not extraterrestrials. They're dolls made from animal bones from this planet joined together with modern synthetic glue. It's totally a made-up story.""
The two figurines were found in the Lima airport offices of courier DHL in a cardboard box, dressed up to look like mummified bodies in traditional Andean clothes. This led some media outlets to wonder if they could be of alien origin.
""You have one group saying they are real and another saying it is fake. We feel what is ambiguous is the chain of custody but we have not seen anyone do tests. The team will aim to find out the question marks about the chain of custody too.
""Ultimately we are trying to get to ground zero and learn the entire story of who found them and how it came to pass. We understand that it was an independent 'tomb raider' who discovered the bodies, who then passed them to Jamie.""
Serena also asked Peru's Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences to let them see the bodies they examined - which might or might not be linked to the same site as Maussan's discovery. ""I am investigating the aliens that were taken to congress by Jamie and have an origin story that goes back to the hole they dug out of in Peru.
""We would urge these scientists to please hand over these dolls so we can have them analyzed at the same time. We will conduct all the same tests. There are so many unanswered questions, which we are determined to find answers.""

Filmmakers Serena and Jason Shurka, alongside alien experts Paola Harris, Danny Sheehan, Bob Sala and Michael Mazzola, will devote several days to exploring these mummies. This is following reports of unusual mummified remains discovered in the Nazca region of Peru back in 2017.
Fast forward a few months, and another 14 bodies were uncovered from a mass grave in Peru. Maussan's team heads this new investigation, with collaboration from university labs in Mexico and Peru.
The documentary will be shot on location in Peru, including Nazca where the bodies first emerged. Other features include interviews with those integral to finding the mummies like Maussan, his scientific research team, local experts, and eyewitnesses. The final analysis happens in Los Angeles before presenting the findings in a show, ""The Nazca Alien Autopsy"". The programme is set for an April release on TVOD platforms such as Unifyd, Eclipse, Amazon, and Apple TV.
Serena has made significant strides in inspecting interactions and the existence of extraterrestrials on Earth. Her film ""My Transparent Life"" was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Documentary. Another noteworthy piece is ""Contact - The CE-5 Experience"" featuring Dr. Steven Greer, We Are Not Alone, Beyond The Grave.
Elysium Media, an Emmy Nominated production company with studios in Los Angeles - USA and Melbourne Australia, is known for its UFO content. With titles like Contact: The CE5 Experience, My Transparent Life, The Marfa Lights, We Are Not Alone, Preparing for Contact, Hollywood Disclosure, Dream Life and Beyond The Grave under its belt, and the upcoming releases of The Visitors and Interview with the Extraterrestrial, it's one of the biggest producers of UFO content globally.

Last year on the ITV soap, Paul Foreman was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) and in recent scenes, Moses joined as his PA, replacing his usual PA Jim. It wasn't long until Moses proved to be a godsend and Todd Grimshaw has also taken a liking to the PA after being smitten from the first time they met.
Earlier this year, Paul, Billy Mayhew and Summer Spellman decided to matchmake Todd and Moses by arranging a surprise dinner for everyone. So far, Moses appears to have settled in well on the cobbles yet this is sadly set to change in upcoming scenes.
In upcoming episodes this week, Bernie Winter, who was released from prison on Friday, finds Billy in agony on the sofa after putting his back out helping Paul out of the bath due to Moses running late. Meanwhile, on the cobbles, a stressed Moses explains to Todd how overworked he is.
Todd offers Moses a comforting hug but the sweet gesture is spotted by a furious Bernie from a distance and it's not long before Moses receives a call from his boss telling him he’s now been suspended. And in spoilers next week, it appears that a dejected Moses is preparing to leave Weatherfield as he tells Todd that he’s moving to London to find another job. Will Moses really leave and what will this mean for both Todd and Paul?
It comes as actor Peter Ash left the show's fans guessing as he offered update on his character Paul Foreman's future last week. The actor posed for a mirror selfie from his dressing room and shared the snap with his Instagram followers, saying: ""First day back at work! Not finished Paul's story yet.""

F7E131OKAA_6XYFM1KER2V7JPG,Locals fears idyllic cottage owned by paedophile Jimmy Savile could become Airbnb,Susie BeeverNews Reporter,"21:55, 24 Jan 2024Updated16:43, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/locals-fears-idyllic-cottage-owned-31960330,"An idyllic Scottish cottage once belonging to paedophile Jimmy Savile could be turned into an Airbnb, locals fear.
The whitewashed cottage near Glencoe in the Highlands was bought by the vile DJ in 1998 and used it as a holiday home until his death in 2011. Since then, it was sold at auction for £212,000 to a Glasgow builder, before being sold to retail tycoon Harris Aslam.
But now locals are worried the tainted property could be rented out to tourists after development plans were submitted to Highland Council by the Aslam family. The family previously submitted similar development plans before withdrawing them last year, MailOnline reports.
Several objections have been made to the latest proposals, including Stirling resident John Nish, who said: ""I have nothing against the idea of the property being inhabited again, particularly in the context of declining population in areas of the Highlands such as Lochaber. However, as per other comments, the scale of the redevelopment does make me wonder if this is indeed for a family dwelling, or rather for a potential Airbnb/holiday home.""
Graham Lawrie, from the Highland village of Kinlochleven, said: ""Yet again this proposal is not in keeping with the Glen, and will be a two-storey build and not the one-storey of the original. This is NOT a family residence, which is made obvious by extra accommodation in the outbuilding.
""The layout screams of a high-end holiday/Airbnb let, which is also not in keeping with the area. As a local to the area of 56 years, I wish to object strongly to this monstrosity of a building that is replacing a one-storey building.""
A mountaineering group is among the many to raise objections to the latest plans for Allt-na-Reigh, which Savile bought off legendary mountaineer Hamish MacInnes. Mountaineering Scotland has urged the Highlands Council to reject the proposal, claiming a modern development would ruin what it describes as ""one of Scotland’s most iconic views"".
A spokesperson said: “We understand the desire to redevelop the existing cottage and have no issue with the renovation of a cottage on the existing development footprint or the principle of demolishing the existing cottage to enable it to be replaced with a new build. We urge Highland Council to reject this proposal as it stands, until the applicant provides a landscape and visual impact assessment of the development against the special qualities of the national scenic area, from key recreational routes and viewpoints in this part of Glencoe.”
“It is our opinion, which we trust the Highland Council shares, that a modern structure which may have an impact on views within a national scenic area should be carefully considered.” The Mirror has contacted both Highland Council and National Trust for Scotland, which owns 14,000 acres in Glencoe and has also spoken out against the plans.
A spokesperson for the Highland Council said the planning application for the cottage was ""currently under consideration"" and, as a result, it would not be ""appropriate to comment"" on a ""pending application"". “All we can say is that all comments received during the planning process will be taken into consideration before a decision is made,” the spokesperson told The Mirror.
The property has previously been targeted by vandals over its link to notorious Savile, who abused hundreds of children and young people during his career as a DJ and BBC presenter, as well as through his charity and volunteer work for various hospitals and organisations.
Savile is unmentioned in the official planning documents for the house. It's understood that the Aslam family has previously denied any claims the cottage would be transformed into an Airbnb. The Mirror contacted the Glenshire Group, run by Mr Aslam, for further comment."

The couple, who tied the knot in 2012, rarely step out together at public events but last night was an exception as they rubbed shoulders with movie stars at the All Of Us Strangers screening, starring Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott. But the This Morning presenter certainly stole the limelight as he and Dee posed up a storm.
Dee, 45, is a film producer who previously worked on The Crown and Bridgerton and looked sensational as she braved the violent winds as Storm Isha continued to batter the country. She looked sensational rocking a black velvet mini-dress which featured gold embroidery around the collar and a long black double-breasted jacket. Dee completed her look with a pair of striking gold high-heeled shoes, while her brunette tresses were swept up into a neat do, keeping her hair off of her face.
Meanwhile, This Morning presenter Dermot, 50, looked suave as he complimented Dee's look by wearing a similarly styled black coat and black polo top. He paired his look with black trousers and patent leather shoes, along with a flat cap for his outing. The couple certainly put on a loved-up display as they posed alongside one another with Dermot wrapping his arm around his loving wife.
Dee and Dermot met when they both worked for the same television production company, before embarking on a nine-year relationship before he popped the question. Despite Dermot asking Dee to marry him during a trip to New York in 2011, they kept their news relatively quiet.
But that same year, Caroline Flack announced on the Xtra Factor that the couple had become engaged. The late presenter grilled him on why it had taken so long for him to propose, to which he replied: ""Well, you don't rush into these things.""
Dermot and Dee tied the knot a year later at St Mary's Church in Chiddingstone in September 2012 and they kept to a strict, small guestlist for the occasion. Although they share very little about their life, Dermot has previously shared his ""secret"" for his happy and ""successful"" partnership.
During a question and answer with fans, he said that it's all about ""slack and compromise"". ""No marriage is perfect. From the start we gave each other a lot of slack and compromised,"" he explained. ""This person's your best friend. Try not to give them a hard time. It's down to letting someone still have an active life individually. It's about being there when you need to be there.""

FAV2NOHHSC_ISU76ZD3158LLJO,'We're still fighting Tories for our right to strike 40 years after Thatcher banned unions',Ros Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist,"20:01, 25 Jan 2024Updated09:37, 26 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/were-still-fighting-tories-right-31969823,"Exactly 40 years ago yesterday, Conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe made an announcement.
Margaret Thatcher’s minister told the House of Commons that trade unions were to be banned at the Government Communications ­Headquarters in Cheltenham, “in the interests of national security”. “GCHQ staff are being informed of these measures this afternoon,” Sir Geoffrey said.
Listening to the radio inside GCHQ on January 25 1984, was Brian Johnson, a telecoms technician who had joined the intelligence agency straight from serving in the air force.
“I was the only one in the office who actually heard Geoffrey Howe make the statement,” Brian, now 90, tells me. “So, when we were told we couldn’t leave work without receiving a letter no one knew the contents of, I had an idea what was happening.”
Inside was the offer of £1,000 and the chance to keep his job, or to remain a union member and leave the job and service he loved. Members were ordered to leave their trade unions by March 1. “It all felt very unreal,” says Brian, who was one of 14 to be sacked – and over 100 who left their jobs – for refusing to give up his union rights. “I was lucky I had strong support at home. It led to the break-up of some people’s marriages.”
For 13 years, the GCHQ dispute was a cause celebre for the Labour ­movement, led by the Civil and Public Services Association – which later became PCS – and supported by the TUC. Until 1997 – when incoming Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reversed the decision as one of the very first acts of the Blair government. Eligible workers were reinstated, while others were re-awarded the full pensions they had lost in the intervening years.
“We always had faith that we would win,” Brian says. “That’s why we kept on fighting. Tony Blair, John Smith and Neil Kinnock all stuck to their word in supporting us, and ultimately in reversing the legislation.”
But 40 years on, there are painful parallels, as increasingly spiteful Tory anti-trade union legislation culminates in a new “Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act” – that could mean workers losing their jobs for taking industrial action in certain sectors. “In some ways the minimum service levels proposals of now are even more murderous than what we went through,” Brian says.
Labour’s Angela Rayner has pledged her party will bring forward legislation to improve workers’ rights within 100 days should it win the next election. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka says the GCHQ ban was part of Margaret Thatcher’s wider attack on the movement.
“The principled decision not to give up their trade union membership saw them pay a massive price,” he says. “Now, 40 years on, as we celebrate their courage and determination, a different Conservative government is attacking trade union rights – this time they’re introducing minimum service levels in a naked attack on our right to strike. Our message today is the same as it was in 1984 – we shall fight this injustice for however long it takes.”
TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says that “a generation later, the heroic fighting spirit of the GCHQ workers” is needed again. “This time the Tories have gone even further,” he says. “Their draconian Strikes Act could take away the right to strike of one in five workers. The message from the union ­movement is loud and clear – we won’t let this happen.
“We will name and shame any employer that uses this legislation. And the full force of the entire ­movement will be behind any worker disciplined or sacked for exercising their democratic right to strike.” Also at work inside GCHQ that day in 1984 was Gareth Morris, who had joined straight from school in 1978 and been promoted through the ranks.
“At the time of the 1984 ban, I was working in a sensitive area,” Gareth, now 64, says. “I can’t tell you what I was doing. When we all got the envelope with the news our rights were being taken away, it was really hard to take in. People were very shocked and upset. They implied we were unpatriotic – saying that being a trade union member was incompatible with national security. It was a slur on our integrity. We knew we had to stand up for what we believed in. Because if the Government could get away with this then other public sector workers could face similar restrictions.”
GCHQ staff were given just five weeks to make up their minds.
“A lot of people with families and mortgages signed under duress,” he says. “And 150 chose not to sign. There were months of appeals and court cases during which those fighting on were denied promotion and other benefits. Many retired, left or were sacked. I was sacked in 1989, when I’d just got a mortgage and was due to get married, so it was good my family and my wife supported me so much. I ended up getting a job at the Bank of England – so much for being a threat to national security.”
When Labour righted the wrong in 1997, only three former GCHQ members were eligible to return – Gareth among them. “I was 29 when I was sacked and 38 when I returned,” he says. “I was welcomed back with open arms.”
Brian had already reached retirement age when Labour overturned the ban. “But I went back into GCHQ for an hour with many others who were sacked or who left during that time,” he says. “It was very emotional.”
Every January for 13 years, trade unionists marched in Cheltenham in support of the sacked GCHQ workers. And tomorrow, they will march once again, to commemorate the 40th ­anniversary of the ban and support those whose union rights are once again under attack from a ­Conservative government. Nowak says marchers will remember the moment working people called out Margaret Thatcher’s attack on workers’ rights – and won. “Together,” he says, “we will win again.”"
FHLDXDC5C1_TBUA7NL263WYE1E,Twisted Ted Bundy's brain was removed after execution for stomach-churning experiment,Jane LavenderAssociate Editor,"10:24, 24 Jan 2024Updated14:43, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/twisted-ted-bundys-brain-removed-31953943,"Ted Bundy seemed like the model young man - a law student who even worked at a suicide prevention phone line. But behind the respectable face hid a disturbed murderer who butchered at least 36 young women and girls.
One woman knew him better than almost anyone, his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall. She was the person who gave Bundy's name to police and finally broke her silence four years ago to tell her side of the story in Amazon documentary, Ted Bundy: Falling For A Killer.
For years in the 1970s, Bundy- who was executed 35 years ago today - targeted young women and girls. Raping, killing them and then dumping their bodies. In one final sick insult to those he had murdered, he would often return to where he had abandoned the bodies and have sex with their corpses.
Bundy only stopped this final indignity when the body became too decomposed or had been eaten by animals. He would also collected several of his victims' heads as sick trophies and would perform sex acts on them after covering them in make-up. In a further gruesome confession, Bundy even admitted to eating parts of his victims' bodies so he could ""possess"" them and they would become part of him.
The killer claimed he was addicted to murder, saying: ""You feel their last bit of breath leaving their body. You?re looking into their eyes. A person in that situation is God!?"" Bundy was finally arrested, tried and sentenced to death.
He was executed by electric chair in 1989 and following his death, scientists were determined to find out what had turned this seemingly upstanding citizen into a monster. Bundy's brain was removed and a series of experiments carried out to determine why he had carried out his horrific crimes. Certain brain injuries have been linked to criminality by some researchers.
And Bunday had told the detective who was instrumental in bringing him to justice that when he felt the urge to rape and kill, it was like a ""chemical tidal wave washing through his brain"". He compared it to being addicted to drugs.
But when scientists examined Bundy's brain, it was found to be totally normal, with no legions, injuries or deformities. His body was then cremated and Bundy's final wish was bizarrely honoured, with his ashes scattered on the same mountain where he had dumped several of his victim's bodies.
His reign of terror had begun in 1974 when he broke into the basement of an 18-year-old student, beat her and sexually assaulted her with a metal rod. She was left in a coma for 10 days and suffered with her brain inury for the rest of her life.
Bundy had no previous criminal record, but just a month later he committed his first murder. He broke into another student's flat, Lynda Ann Healy, knocked her out, dressed her and carried her out to her car. She was never seen again but a partial fragment of her skull was found in the place where Bundy dumped many of his bodies.
He preyed on the kindness of many of his victims, donning a fake leg or arm cast, and asking them to help him carry something to his car. Then, he would bludgeon them until they were unconscious before raping, killing and them dumping them. Long before he was finally captured, several women came forward to say they had been approached by 'Ted'.
Three women, including one of his ex-girlfriends, even pointed the finger directly at Bundy, but police didn't believe his claims because he was such an upstanding member of society. Bundy was accepted into law school and moved to Utah but his thirst for violence only increased.
He picked up a hitchhiker, who he raped, strangled and then dumped in a river, before returning to her body the following day to take snap shots and dismember her.
Bundy raped and strangled 16-year-old Nancy Wilcox in Salt Lake City and buried her body. The 17-year-old daughter of a police chief, Melissa Anne Smith, was abducted by Bundy as she left a pizza parlour. Her body was found nine days later, with a postmortem indicating she may have remained alive up for to a week following her disappearance.
Bundy seemed to view murder as a sport and even admitted he had an ""off season"" where he would pick women up to keep his skills sharp and then free them. He seemed to take just as much pleasure in running rings around the police with what he believed was his far superior intelligence.
In 1975 he was arrested for kidnapping Carol DaRonch, one of the few who survived his attacks, and jailed for 15 years. But just two years later, while acting as his own lawyer after being indicted over the death of a Colorado woman, he jumped out of the jailhouse library window and disappeared.
He was caught eight days later but in December the same year, 1977, he climbed out of a hole in the ceiling of his cell and fled to Florida. What came next was truly horrifyig. Bundy broke into the Chi Omega sorority at Florida State University and raped and killed four women in just 15 minutes in January 1978.
He battered Margaret Bowman to death with a chunk of firewood then strangled her with a stocking. Next, he beat and strangled 20-year-old Lisa Levy before sexually assaulting her with a bottle, ripping one of her nipples and leaving a deep bite in the flesh of her buttocks.
He then bludgeoned death two other students, Karen Chandler and Kathy Kleiner, who were sleeping in an adjoining bedroom. His last known killing was 12-year-old Kimberly Leach, who his kidnapped from school, raped, murdered and then dumped her body under a pig shed. A few days later Bundy was finally arrested because his Beetle was stolen.
After confessing to 36 murders, Bundy was jailed and it has been reported that he was repeatedly raped by four men while he waited for execution on death row.
When the day of his execution came there were huge crowds outside, screaming 'burn, Bundy, burn'. He was put to death in the electric chair.
Eleanor Rose, the mother of one of his victims, Denise Naslund, said: ?For everything he did to the girls - the bludgeoning, the strangulation, humiliating their bodies, torturing them - I feel that the electric chair is too good for him.?"
FJ8MJKM36B_5T252S70JWIP90A,Urgent 'danger' warning issued to Brits who use hot water bottles at night,Lucy MarshallLifestyle Reporter,"19:00, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/urgent-danger-warning-issued-brits-31942189,"An urgent warning is being issued to hot water bottle lovers to not use them in bed at night.
As Britain was battered by Storm Isha, causing havoc with 100mph winds on top of the chilling temperatures, it is no surprise that people are looking for the best ways to stay warm. Especially now Storm Jocelyn is here.
As rising energy bills continue to put a burden on households, Brits and are looking for cheap alternative ways to keep themselves and their homes warm.
Many have purchased electric blankets, while others are boiling their kettles to fill up hot water bottles. However, a new warning has been issued to those turning to hot water bottles as they pose a potential danger. In November last year, some people were rushed to hospital with burns after their hot water bottles split.
While they can be used to warm up, an expert is advising people to not use them in bed at night; it can lead to severe burns and rashes as well as night sweats.
Sleep experts at WinstonsBeds.com say that over time, the material on a water bottle can start to degrade, making it less protective with burns and injuries more likely. The experts say that your heated pad should be replaced every three years and you should clean it after every use.
""Their ribbed design being the perfect breeding ground for bacteria,"" the pros said. Other dangers people should be aware of include burns - keeping the hot water bottle in direct contact with your skin for too long can lead to burns, and direct heat and material of the bottle itself can also lead to red rashes and irritated skin.
Water bottle users should also be aware that hot water bottles are not designed to be sat on and accidentally laying on top of them in the night could cause them to split which can lead to blisters and burns. This is more likely if you have older water bottles.
Unless you are cleaning your hot water bottle after every use then it can become a breeding ground for bacteria especially if it's being kept in your bed every night. So, sleeping with a hot water bottle for eight hours straight can increase the risk of infection. Falling asleep with your hot water bottle can also lead to overheating and night sweats.
Rebecca Swain, sleep expert at WinstonsBeds, said: ""Hot water bottles are a great way to warm up in bed before you nod off but it becomes a problem for those who have gotten into the habit of sleeping with one all night. They aren't designed to handle any type of stress, pressure or weight which means if you roll onto it during the night, you risk causing the bottle to leak and this could lead to some serious burns and blisters if the water is still hot.""
She continued: ""If you've had your hot water bottle for a while then this is a concern as the material is likely to have degraded over the years making it weaker and more prone to splitting.
""Using a hot water bottle is a great alternative to putting the heating on so there's no reason to stop using them, just ensure you're taking it out of the bed before you drift off to sleep!""

FLVY2IKGEO_AYVI8JKPKJ0IPDV,King Charles has 'protected Kate Middleton with clever strategy' amid double health scares,Jennifer NewtonRoyal Features Writer,"13:10, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/king-charles-protected-kate-middleton-31937497,"King Charles' unprecedented statement about his health was designed to protect the Princess of Wales as she also recovers from surgery, a royal expert has claimed.
In a highly unusual move, a double royal health scare was triggered last week when in the space of 90 minutes it was revealed Kate, 42, was in hospital following abdominal surgery, while the King was to be treated in hospital for an enlarged prostate. The nature of Kate's surgery has not been revealed, with Kensington Palace only saying it was non-cancer related. But in contrast, details of Charles' diagnosis has been made public, with the King keen to raise awareness of the condition, which is extremely common among men.
And even though the nature of the news about Kate and Charles coming in quick succession might have been a shock, royal expert and historian Dr Tessa Dunlop believes it may have actually been an obvious move - in order to protect Kate. She explained to the Mirror: ""It is highly unusual for the Royal Family to divulge private health matters. In that respect the shared information about the King's enlarged prostate was unprecedented, and it was also canny.
""Buckingham Palace doesn't do spontaneity; the release of a statement containing private matters about the King's health immediately after news of the Princess of Wales' major abdominal surgery was deliberate. The timing deflected from his daughter-in-law's major operation, likewise, the private detail concerning his prostate gave the public something else to think about. (The NHS website saw increased traffic on the subject).
""But beyond that obvious strategy, I believe there was something else at play. By sharing a slice of the personal, Charles's statement served to underline the absence of any real detail concerning Kate's condition. The protective King may as well have said 'Here, have some information on me, but keep your prying eyes away from my daughter-in-law.' Read side-by-side the statements are a powerful example of well-coordinated PR. Here was a modern, public service Royal Family, but one with very clear boundaries.""
Kate, who is expected to remain in hospital following the surgery for around another nine days, is not believed to be resuming royal duties again until after Easter. The King will also take time out of public engagements for a period of recuperation.
And Tessa believes Kate would have been keen to apologise for any upcoming diary entries that will have to be rearranged. She added: ""That the seventy-five-year-old King felt able to share information about a common 'old man' ailment is understandable. If anything it underscores his 'father-of-the-nation' appeal.
""But for Kate, a woman in the prime of her life, whose identity has long been staked around her can-do attitude and impressive physique, abdominal surgery is a different matter.
""It is all credit to Kate that when Kensington Palace announced the princess wishes to apologise to all those concerned for the fact that she has to postpone her upcoming engagements' we knew she meant every word. The Princess of Wales knows her own value in the public space and will be keen to get back to work. But first, she has to fully recover."""

On a particularly tough work morning, many of us look forward to tucking into the lunch we have brought for that day. While a 2023 study found that 46% of Brits find their lunchbreaks ""boring"", 58% wished they knew how to make better use of the time. But, imagine being stripped of your one workday break altogether.
Entrepreneur Ben Askins, who is known for ""calling out b*******"" companies"" on social media and champions younger generations in the workplace, shared an anonymous submission from an office worker who was banned from taking a break. The employee went out of his lunch following a ""shattering"" morning at work, but was stunned when his employee sent him a barrage of texts telling him he needed to return to his work immediately.
The manager sent a message to the employee asking where he was an insisted he returned to ""immediately"", adding ""it's not up for debate"". When the worker explained he was out getting lunch his boss told him everything was ""not OK"" in the office and said: ""I told you how busy we were today, I need you back here.""
Confused by the messages, the employee said: ""You what? As in we are not allowed a lunch break?"" He tried to explain that he was entitled to a lunch break and it would in face be illegal if he were refused one.
But, his boss said: ""'No, that isn't true. Besides, it doesn't matter, do you know how busy we are at the moment?'
He explained: ""Of course I do, I have been working all morning and I am shattered. It is why I need a lunch break."" "" 'I am telling you that you need to come back now, this isn't up for debate,"" the manager finally commented.
But the stunned employee was not going to tolerate the company's unusual rules, and claimed he ""doesn't need this"". He added: ""I killed myself this morning for you and the company, I am taking this. I quit.""
Commenting on work break laws in the UK, the government states: ""Workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day, if they work more than 6 hours a day. This could be a tea or lunch break.""
Commenting on the situation, Ben Askins said: ""I mean, let's be clear, he [the manager] doesn't get to decide that. You have to have a lunchbreak by law so I don't know what the hell this guy's playing at. Come on, you've got to be better than this.""
He continued: ""The company, they're obviously stacked. I love it that it's never occurred for them to get additional staff. It's not fair on the team and it's a dumb decision.""
After a clip of the dilemma was shared on Instagram, a number of people rushed to share their thoughts. One individual said: ""Bosses like that definitely were slave overseers in their previous lives.""
Another added: ""No need to quit. Take your lunch, return to work and see what they do. They'd do nothing because you can't sack someone for this.""
But some agreed with the boss; one individual said: ""I agree with the boss - sometimes you've just got to be a team player,' one said. Another wrote: ""The boss is handling this poorly but there are situations where there are urgent needs of the company.""

Mia Janin was a Year 10 pupil attending the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton, north-west London, before she was found dead in her family home in Harrow on March 12 2021.
Her father, Mariano Janin, believes she was cyber-bullied by fellow pupils at the school, telling the inquest that his daughter asked him if she could move schools a day before she died.
The court heard statements given by Mia's friends to the Metropolitan Police following her death. The statements, which gave further details of her bullying ordeal, were read out at Barnet Coroner’s Court on Tuesday.
Mia's friends told how the 14-year-old was picked on in the months leading up to her death - by a group of boys at their school nicknamed the 'Suicide Squad'. They added that one of her TikTok videos was shared to a Snapchat group chat, run by the group at JFS, where they ridiculed her. One child added that the boys used the group chat to share nude photos of girls.
The child said: “They took screenshots of girls’ faces on social media and made fun of them. They shared a video of Mia’s TikTok and made fun of her"".
They added that the boys would also Photoshop girls’ faces onto the bodies of pornography performers: ""They used girls faces on porn stars’ bodies to upset us.""
The child also recalled a conversation they had with Mia the day before she died. They said that Mia asked: “If you died would people care about you the next day?”
“We laughed it off, that was all she said, it was just in normal conversation,” the child said.
Another child said Mia had posted the TikTok video the night before returning to school after Covid restrictions ended. The inquest heard that police believe the TikTok was posted on March 10, and Mia returned to school on March 11.
Mia's friend said that she received lots of negative comments on the TikTok video from fellow pupils at JFS. “Mia said she was fine, but I don’t think that she was fine,” the child said.
Her dad, Mr Janin, told the inquest that Mia asked if she could move school after coming home on March 11.
The inquest also heard that his wife Marisa, who has since died, told Mia she could be homeschooled for the rest of the school year, and that they would look into moving her to a new school after. Mia then went to bed, but was found dead hours later.
Area coroner Tony Murphy said there was no evidence that images or videos of Mia were shared in the group chat, except for the TikTok. The inquest heard that former deputy headteacher at JFS, Rabbi Cohen, told the boys to close the group after Mia’s death.

Married David Brown, 49, from Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear, allegedly lured the children into his office during dinner breaks for extra English lessons. However, he is said to have performed sex acts on at least four different children over an unknown period of time at the Siam International School in Pathum Thani, on the outskirts of the capital.
A shocked teacher only discovered the alleged abuse when she claimed to have overheard girls in the classroom talking about what Brown had done to them. Brown was arrested on Wednesday morning, January 24, at 6am in front of his horrified wife. He collapsed and was taken to hospital before being discharged and grilled at the police station at 1pm.
Police said today that Brown 'confessed to everything' and it was now investigating how long the alleged abuse was going on and how many other children were attacked. He had worked at the school since at least September 2017.
Speaking today at the station to a reporter, Police Colenal Jirawat Piampinseth confirmed the accusations, and the name and identity of Brown, who he said was in a cell a few yards away. The policeman, who is leading the investigation, said: ""The suspect has been living in Thailand for seven or eight years. He started working at the school in 2017. Parents of four children have filed complaints claiming that David took the children to his office to teach them English and then sexually abused them until he ejaculated. When the parents found out about this, David was stressed and didn't sleep at night. He told everything to his wife and admitted what he had done. He was arrested the next morning at 6am at his home and he fainted, so he was taken to the Pathumvet Hospital. He arrived at the police station at 1pm. David's wife acted as an interpreter and he confessed everything. He has been detained in a cell at the station while the investigation continues.""
Police Colonel Piampinseth, said a judge will decide tomorrow if bail can be granted. The officer said: ""He is staying in a cell while we go through the legal process of sending the paperwork to the court. A judge will decide tomorrow if he can be granted bail. We are also investigating if there are other victims, that could result in more charges being added.""
Brown is understood to have a young daughter with his Thai wife, Toey Srisangar, who accompanied him to the police station. She is seen in the video translating the police complaints for him. Brown is seen in pictures and video from the Thanyaburi Provincial Police Station wearing a blue t-shirt, green hat, and a white face mask.
The alleged abuse is said to have been uncovered by a teacher at the school, which charges parents up to 300,000 Thai baht (£6,600) a year in fees. The school headmistress said that when the conversation was overheard, the pupils were immediately questioned. Several others were also asked if they had experienced similar situations with Brown. Police were informed and told the school that the parents must file complaints against the teacher. Brown was later arrested when the parents of four girls made complaints.
A mother of an eight-year-old girl who is one of the alleged victims told local media that she was furious. She said: ""I expect the school to take responsibility for what happened. I am concerned about how many more students might have been abused by David. It all took place in the teacher's office. I don't know how many years he has been doing this. I am very angry but also shocked and I feel sorry for the children.""
A second parent of another victim said their eight-year-old daughter had been studying at the school for five years. He said: ""My daughter was under the care of David. I only found out about this yesterday when the school informed me. They said that he would trick my daughter into going to his office to learn how to read English.""
A horrified father of a girl at the school, who was not one of the four alleged victims that have made complaints, told local television that his daughter ""was close to David"".
He said: ""My daughter started at the school when she was three years old and is now around five years old. My daughter was under the care of this teacher. She was under the care of several teachers but she was close to this one. I can't believe it. It's unfair, and I can't believe that such a thing has happened. When a Thai teacher learned about it, they were shocked and discussed it with the headmaster, who was also shocked.""
The school has been contacted by phone and they declined to comment. A receptionist said: ""The director will have a meeting and decide next week if they will release a statement.""
The minimum jail term for 'committing indecent act against children under 13' is seven years and the maximum is 20 years along with a fine of 80,000 to 400,000 Baht."
FQ0EC8KSIJ_UWVB1L2YP36UNDV,Europe's 'booziest city' is packed with night clubs and has pints under £2,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"12:46, 26 Jan 2024Updated13:45, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/europes-booziest-city-packed-night-31955843,"The booziest city in the world is a land of heavy drinkers, £1.92 beers and an incredibly high density of clubs.
If you are desperate to toss Dry January to the curb and get back off the wagon, then you could do worse than booking a trip to Prague. The Czechia capital has an impressive number of nightlife establishments per capita, being beaten by only Las Vegas and New Orleans in global rankings compiled based on World Data Bank, Tripadvisor, and Numbeo figures.
A pint of beer can be ordered for £1.92 - a third of the price in London and Dublin. As many as 18.8% of all Tripadvisor 'things to do' in the city are typically boozy, late-night activities. While you don’t have to drink when visiting Prague, but its bustling evening roster might be too hard to resist, according to Holidu.
For those looking to avoid alcohol on holiday, Czechia is not the place. In fact, the country consumes the most booze per capita of any in the study (and the world) at 14.45 litres of pure alcohol per year. Bear in mind that one pint of beer at an average 5% ABV only has an alcohol content of around 0.03 litres according to data, so that’s around 481 beers a year per person.
The prospect of a sodden holiday on the Continent is one that is less tempting for many people in the UK now than at any time in recent British history. As many as a quarter of Brits are now shunning alcohol according to YouGov data, and Gen Zers are reigning as the ‘most sober generation’ - with 39% of 18 to 24-year-olds not currently consuming any booze at all.
Recent research conducted by Heineken 0.0 has highlighted that Gen Z’s alcohol consumption has dropped by 25% over the last four years.
Consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritz Birah said: “I think that there has been a rise in people adopting a more sober-curious lifestyle as people educate themselves more on the impact of alcohol on the brain and body.
""They are becoming more self-reflective and thinking about the consequences of alcohol cognitively, emotionally and behaviourally. For example, a theme that often comes up with my clients is the potential for a wasted day and how pointless a person can feel from consuming alcohol.”
If you don't count yourself in that dry-category, then perhaps a holiday to Dublin is in order. Home of Guinness, Ireland’s capital is also up there with the booziest holiday destinations. One of the main reasons is that it’s hard not to be influenced by the Irish, considering that as many as 81.3% of its population consume alcohol – the highest percentage of any country in the study. However, the average price of beer is not too cheap, with the city's average pint costing £5.59.

However, these prices aren’t enough to stop some people from getting on the sauce, with almost half of Irish alcohol drinkers having had a heavy session in the last month. The city is well-regarded as a boozy destination, with one of its top attractions, The Guinness Storehouse, seeing more than 1.1 million visitors in 2022.
Another destination that is not recommended as a destination for a sober holiday is Berlin. As many as four in five Germans drink alcohol, and of these, almost half admitted to having a ‘heavy session’ in the last thirty days. If you want to keep sober and find it hard to not be influenced by those around you, maybe avoid the German capital.

Lonely Planet has released its annual list of the finest coastal destinations in the world, highlighting many of the best beautiful bays, sublime sandy stretches and pretty pebbly places. Unsurprisingly destinations like Hawaii, Australia and the Caribbean feature - but the UK has also held its own thanks to its gorgeous coast, soft sands and swim-friendly waters.
The list does not say which of the 100 is the best, meaning those with a particular affection for one of the British beaches could reasonably argue that their favourite is the number one globally.
We take a look at the four UK spots that made the cut - check them out below...

Rhossili Bay in Gower, Wales can be found at the western end of the popular holiday destination of the Gower peninsula, offering a taste of a foreign holiday without the need to travel out of the country.
The beach is covered everyday by an incoming tide, meaning it is fresh and clean for daytrippers when the water has retreated. It is widely regarded as one of the UK's finest surf beaches, with places for both beginners and experienced surfers.
Lonely Planet wrote: ""Part of the 73-sq-mile (188-sq-km) Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, this wonderfully secluded pocket of Wales retains a special soul-stirring energy, framed by blonde dunes and Rhossili Down’s heather-scented slopes.""
Gower Peninsula was designated Britain's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1956. Sightseers can glimpse the remains of shipwrecks at low tides - including the Helvetia which ran aground here in 1887.
Durdle Door, on southern Dorset's UNESCO-protected Jurassic Coast, was also named as one of the world's best beaches.
The iconic stretch of sand lies about 25 miles away from Bournemouth and is known for being home to one of the most famous stone arches in the world. The limestone arch is said to have been formed 10,000 years ago.
Its most recognisable feature is the Goskar Rock which burst out of the centre of the sandy beach at the water's edge. The area is known for being rich with sea life including fish but also jelly fish, which can pack a powerful sting.
The beach is a challenging one for those with mobility issues, with the shingle-and-sand stretch down 140 steep steps.
Kynance Cove has been enchanting coastal enthusiasts for hundreds of years, in no small part to stunning scenery which can make it easy to forget that you're in Cornwall rather than some far-flung tropical island.
The waters off the beach are some of the warmest in the UK and are calmed to a gentle swell by the rocky walls of the cove. When the tide goes out little caves and rockpools that are perfect for exploring appear.
The beach experts at Lonely Planet wrote: ""Near the southernmost tip of mainland England, this is one of the country’s dreamiest beaches – a pristine all-natural inlet dominated by craggy serpentine-rock outcrops, stone-carved arches and grassy green headlands. And on a sunny blue-sky day, Kynance easily rivals any beach in the Caribbean.""
The beach in Berneray was the only beach in Scotland to make the list. Although the wind chill factor and icy bite of the sea may render if a difficult place to sunbathe on, it is a beautiful spot.
Lonely Planet wrote: ""The powdery silver-white sand might feel more Southeast Asia than North Atlantic, but the chilly aqua waves, dramatic wind-lashed setting and beautifully green adjoining machair (grazing land) are pure, wonderful Outer Hebrides.""
The judges described the three-mile long beach as a ""wildly remote jewel"" in the Outer Hebrides."

But when it comes to using deodorant to keep us smelling fresh, there doesn't seem to be any complicated rules or etiquette that we must follow. Simply spray (or roll) and you're ready to seize the day, right?
Well, a skin expert has revealed the proper method to help keep those pesky sweat patches away - and it all comes down to when you apply the product. The hack has gone down a storm on social media, with people describing it as a complete 'game changer'.
Dr Lindsey Zubritsky is a board-certified dermatologist, and has amassed a whopping 700,000 Instagram followers due to her beauty and skincare advice. In a recent video, she shared several hacks she said she could no longer 'gatekeep'.
""If you're not applying your deodorant at night time, you're doing it wrong,"" she said. ""At night time, our sweat glands are less active. Therefore, it absorbs the antiperspirant more effectively."" Other hacks included dealing with dry, chapped lips by using hyaluronic acid - and how to get rid of fungal acne.

FVIRED121A_73I16LH4YPS9M5Y,"Dire Turkey surgery warning after victim left with dead, rotting nipples in botched operation",Saffron OtterAssistant Features Editor,"11:20, 24 Jan 2024Updated13:43, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/dire-turkey-surgery-warning-after-31949681,"'It's one of them where you never think it'll happen to you until it does' - these are the sorrowful words of Collette Pickering, who in the past week was left fearing for her sister-in-law's life following a botched boob job in Turkey.
As a 36EE, 22-year-old Chloe Rose, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, had felt insecure about her large chest for some time and was experiencing immense back pain. Since the age of 18, she had wanted to go under the knife for an uplift in a bid to help relieve the agony, but put it off until she had enough money.
She researched the procedure - which usually costs from £8,000 in the UK - online, and over a 12-month period, communicated with a 'well-established' clinic in Turkey. She booked the operation for January 16 and flew over to the Middle East with a friend, Rachel Mucha.
However, when she came round after the operation, Chloe was left screaming in pain after it 'went terribly wrong' - with graphic images showing how her nipples had turned into oozing, open sores. Collette claims surgeons removed too much skin, resulting in her circulation being cut off and her nipple dying.
The young woman developed necrosis - the death of body tissue - but says the clinic has claimed that the procedure went 'perfectly.' Chloe, who is described by Collette as a ""one in a million with a heart of gold"", told the Mirror: ""I was concerned about the surgery, but what sister wouldn't be?
""I get nervous every time she goes on a night out or doesn't get back to me in an hour. But I trusted her judgement and it's her life and body, it's not up to me what she does with either. I had heard rumours of turkey. But I had also heard so many success stories, it's one of them where you never think it'll happen to you until it does.""
When Collette, a mum-of-one checked in on Chloe, she responded to her message saying ""really bad"". She then video-called her crying her eyes out. ""My heart broke watching her be in so much pain,"" the 27-year-old said.
""She said she hadn't told anyone but her mum because she wanted to trust what she was being told by the surgeon, she wanted to believe it was fine. She was in a state of confusion at that point. She was also scared of the 'I told you so'. That night I listened to her sob, scream, and beg and she kept telling me she didn't want to die.""
Collette says Chloe claims there were no English-speaking staff at the hospital, despite being told an interpreter was included in her package. Amid a language barrier, Chloe and Rachel had to rely on Google Translate, which proved difficult.
She claims cannulas were poorly inserted and needles were left lying around the room. The blood drained from her was allegedly sometimes left in the toilet bowl, and her stitches were apparently reopened without her understanding why, and without pain relief.
The duo say her wounds were only restitched halfway, with Chloe left with open wounds. They claim that it was only after speaking to the British Embassy that Chloe was given antibiotics to treat infection, however her health didn't improve.
""Chloe knew the complications, she knew what she was getting herself into regarding the surgery,"" Collette said. ""What she didn't expect was the poor treatment and neglect from the staff who were supposed to help her recover. I can't describe the pain she was in, only that I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.""
Collette claims the company demanded more money for her to stay in the hospital to recover, which saw her and Rachel turn to GoFundMe to set up a fundraiser to bring her home. Thanks to the kindness and generosity of strangers, they raised more than £8,000 for a medically assisted flight home for the pair on Sunday.
But the journey back was just as terrifying, as Chloe's blood pressure and heart rate went extremely high. As soon as she landed in the UK, she was blue-lighted to the closest hospital.
""Having such a huge positive response has warmed my heart beyond words,"" Collette continued. ""We are all so overwhelmed with not just the donations, but the kind words and the effort people made to make it possible to bring her home. There's been backlash, but the love and support we've been given outshines anything negative.""
Upon discharge, Collette claims Chloe was supplied Turkish medication but without instructions on what they were and when to take them. The family's hope is for Chloe to get better and back to normality as she currently receives treatment for necrosis. There are no regrets, but a warning for others.
""She feels weird about the whole situation. She doesn't regret the choice she made to make herself feel better,"" Collette explained. ""But she didn't choose to have the awful experience she has had, things went wrong that were completely out of her control.
The family do not wish to name the hospital until she is better, but they hope people rethink their trips and think twice when coming across surgery companies on social media. ""Chloe wants people to rethink their trips if they've booked to get surgery, to not trust the Instagram companies that make it seem so amazing,"" she warned.
""She did all the right research but she was treated so poorly. She doesn't want another person to have to go through what she has. None of us do. We have urged people who have reached out to us, to cancel their bookings and definitely don't choose surgery abroad.""

FWU6EVKK27_E5CBBEH779VDPT2,Only Fools and Horses' Sir David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst's snipes over the years and fallout explained,Zoe DelaneyAssistant Showbiz Editor,"11:01, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/only-fools-horses-sir-david-31953582,"Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter and his younger brother Rodney Trotter were thick as thieves during Only Fools and Horses' 22-year run on our TV screens, but things haven't always been so rosy for the two actors who portrayed the market trader brothers.
Sir David Jason, 83, and Nicholas Lyndhurst, 62, both won critical acclaim for their performances in the much-loved BBC comedy, with the pair last appearing on screen together for the Only Fools and Horses Christmas special back in 2003.
The pair reunited and reprised their roles as the Trotter brothers for a one-off charity special in 2014, but their once close bond has seemingly broken since then - with David admitting he doesn't really speak to his former co-star much these days.
Following BAFTA-winner David admitting he'd love to film another episode of Only Fools and Horses - despite knowing it ""will never happen"" - we take a look at his relationship with his on-screen partner Nicholas and what caused the former pals to drift apart.
David and Nicholas were once so close they used to be able to fake falling out - once staging a row so intense during filming in the 1980s that an Only Fools and Horses producer was left ""fuming"". The Del Boy actor shared this memory from 1989, recalling: ""One day, Nick and I were in our very small caravan on location. We were all fed up because nothing was happening so [we] said 'why don't we stage a huge row and you can storm out and say you're leaving and I can shout at you saying 'don't you ever come back again'.""
He went on to say: ""'I never want to work with you'. The whole crew went stiff. Five minutes later, the producer and director came to see me, looking terrified. They asked what was happening and I told them to go see Nick. When they did, I couldn't hold back my laughter any longer. Their faces turned from white to purple. I don't think the producer was very impressed.""
Despite their pretend row in the late eighties, David and Nicholas' once close friendship sadly did deteriorate over the following years - even though they had previously admitted to being good mates off the Only Fools and Horses set. David once said in an interview that he couldn't have asked for a better co-star and was ""good friends"" with Nicholas.
Similarly, Nicholas told Red Carpet News in 2017: ""We had a very similar work ethic and ethos - that we wanted to do our best as quickly as possible. You didn't have very long to record an episode [...] We didn't have much time to rehearse it so we had to have each other's back.""
However, by 2022 things had clearly changed. Sir David confessed in an interview that he and Nicholas no longer chat, admitting: ""He's much more, how can I say, self-contained, perhaps, than he used to be. So, unfortunately, we don't see each other as much as I'd like to. But that's how things work out sometimes.""
It's understood that Nicholas has kept a low profile following the sudden death of his 20 year old son Archie in 2020. Tragically, Archie passed away due to a brain haemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Nicholas, speaking on behalf of himself and his wife Lucy Smith - said in a statement at the time: ""Lucy and I are utterly grief stricken and respectfully request privacy.""
Following David's comments in 2022, rumours were rife he and Nicholas had bitterly fallen out and were no longer on speaking terms. However, it appears that wasn't the case - with David reportedly supporting his on-screen brother following the death of his son in 2020.
Following Archie's death at the age of 20, it was claimed Touch of Frost actor David reached out to Nicholas and his wife Lucy, with a source telling The Sun at the time: ""He’s [David] been in regular touch [with Nicholas] ever since and – like everyone else who cares for Nick and his family – is just trying to provide whatever support he can.""
David further quashed the rumours last month when a Channel 5 documentary about the success of Only Fools and Horses aired over the festive period. Speaking about Nicholas in the special, David insisted: ""You couldn't have had a better co-partner than Nic. We liked and respected each other so much, we were genuinely good friends. You couldn't have had a better co-partner than Nic.""
Earlier this month, it was revealed that David would love to reprise his role as Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter one final time but knows it's not meant to be following the death of the BBC show's creator John Sullivan. But an Only Fools and Horses reboot is off the table for another reason possibly - Nicholas' new-found success over in America.
Nicholas returned to the spotlight last year following the tragic death of his son in 2020, with the Goodnight Sweetheart actor joining the cast of Frasier for the comedy sitcom's reboot. Following Nicholas' first on-screen appearance in October as newcomer Alan, a British professor at the local college, Frasier played homage to former stars and Nicholas' late son.
Paying homage to Archie, as the credits began to roll on the first episode of the Frasier reboot, a message appeared on-screen which read: ""In loving memory of Gabrielle James and Archie Lyndhurst."" A clip of John on the set of the original Frasier then played as he touchingly said: ""It all works out.""
It seems like Nicholas has settled nicely into his new comedy home, with his new on-screen sparring partner Kelsey Grammar speaking highly of his new co-star. While speaking of the reboot last year, the Frasier Crane actor told Deadline: ""And then, of course, there’s Alan, played by a dear friend of mine, Nick Lyndhurst.
""He’s stealth warfare. He is just the sneakiest most talented actor I’ve ever worked with. We worked previously together in London on the musical, Man of La Mancha. We made plans to get [our partners] together and we became best friends. So when the idea of Frasier having a best friend came into the mix, it was always Nicholas. I asked him when we were back in England before we even started if he would like to be in the new Frasier. He said, 'Are you kidding? I would do anything to work with you again every day for the rest of my life.' The feeling is mutual.""

The former couple share three children and announced their decision to split in 2022 after 11 years of marriage. Following the news of their decision, both Christine and Paddy stated that they would remain friends for the sake of their children, twins Penelope and Leo, nine, and Felicity, seven.
In an unusual move, they also decided to live under the same roof to co-parent their three youngsters, despite both moving on with their lives. Now, a source has revealed Christine's true feelings about Paddy preparing to move out of the Cheshire home. The former Real Housewives of Cheshire guest star said she was ""worried"" about the moment.
""Christine is worried about the inevitable time when Paddy will move out,"" a source told new! magazine, before adding: ""Even though they're not romantically in a relationship, they've been together so long that not living together any more scares her. They've built a life together and she knows she will feel vulnerable when he does go.
""She also sees it as the final step for them. There are times she is worried about letting Paddy go, but she is a strong independent woman who is a great mother and will thrive on her own."" Reflecting on their decision to live together for the sake of their children who have autism. Christine previously said: ""The children don't know any different and they're growing up in a happy and loving home. I just want it to continue like that.
""We don't know what the future holds but right now it works. The thought of eventually co-parenting in separate houses is something I'm going to really struggle with.""
The source went on to claim that she's ""worried"" about being on her own after sharing so much of her life with Paddy, whom she met in 2007, before tying the knot in 2011. It recently emerged that Christine had hired divorce lawyer Catherine Bedford who doesn't take any prisoners.
""Catherine is one of the best in the business,"" a source recently claimed. They went on to say that it would be ""heartbreaking"" for Christine to leave the family home that she had ""poured many hours of love, care and attention into."" Bedford was previously described as a ""Pitbull attorney"" in American media.
Her famous clients include Game Of Thrones icon Sophie Turner in her split from Joe Jonas and Dubai royalty Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in his case against Princess Haya bint Hussein.

G2QU9J0VZS_I5844JZ4J3Y2VBE,Measles symptoms warning - hidden key sign of the infectious disease in your eyes,Zahra KhaliqNews Reporter,"11:20, 24 Jan 2024Updated12:19, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/measles-symptoms-warning-hidden-key-31953866,"As measles cases surge across the country, parents will be taking extra precaution to make sure their little ones are protected against severe symptoms. But while some signs of the infection are fairly noticeable - including initial cold and flu-like symptoms, as well as a distinct, red blotchy rash - others can be easy to miss.
Measles is known to be one of the most contagious viral diseases, belonging to the same family of viruses as mumps. For children, it is an unpleasant and potentially severe disease that starts with cold and flu-like symptoms, before developing into a rash. The NHS says receiving the MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent it.
Anyone can catch measles if they haven't been vaccinated or had it before. It can be more severe in immunosuppressed individuals, young infants, and pregnant people. In total, the illness typically lasts from seven to 10 days.
In some cases, you might notice your child has small white spots inside the mouth, on the cheeks, and the back of the lips. Like the body rash, these spots usually last a few days.
In more severe cases, the measles virus can lead to various complications if it spreads to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain. This can cause further, more serious problems, inclduing pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures (fits). While these problems are rare, some people are more at risk, such as babies and people with weakened immune systems.
But many people are unaware that measles can also affect the eyes. Red, blotchy eyes, otherwise known as conjunctivitis is a lesser-known symptom of the virus. Conjunctivitis causes inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin layer of tissue covering the front of the eye. It is also known as 'red eye' due to its inflamed nature.
The condition usually impacts both eyes and treatment depends on the cause. It usually clears up within a few weeks.
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recently declared a ‘national health incident’ amid surging measles cases, with latest figures suggesting that more than 3.4million children have not had their MMR jab. In the West Midlands, measles cases are currently at their highest level since the mid-1990s.
Labour's Shadow Health Minister Karin Smyth said allowing health visitors to administer the jab would “make a big difference in countering the measles outbreak and preventing it from worsening"", urging the government to let health visitors administer vaccines during home visits.
According to the NHS, the best way to prevent the disease it to get the MMR vaccine."

Órla Baxendale, a professional dancer living in New York City who is originally from Manchester in the UK, decided to indulge in a holiday cookie at a social event in Connecticut on January 11, not knowing that it contained peanuts, it has been reported.
She immediately went into anaphylactic shock, later dying from the ordeal in what law firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackauf called an ""unfortunate incident"" that involved ""gross negligence and reckless conduct"" by both the manufacturer and seller of the packaged cookies.

Sold at Stew Leonard's, a local supermarket chain found around Connecticut, the vanilla-flavoured Florentine Cookies, which are made by Cookies United in Islip, New York, on Long Island and that carry the supermarket's brand name, contain peanuts, which Baxendale is highly allergic to. But the package reportedly failed to disclose that fact.
Now, Stew Leonard's and Cookies United are pointing fingers at each other. The former alleges that the latter never disclosed the ingredient, but the latter insists that they did in July 2023, months before they even hit the shelves and made their way to the social gathering at which Baxendale died.
Cookies United said in a statement: ""Stew Leonard's claimed in an earlier press release that 'the cookies contain peanuts, which was an ingredient not disclosed to Stew Leonard's by the manufacturer. Unfortunately, considering the tragedy of these circumstances, we need to point out that Stew Leonard’s was notified by Cookies United in July of 2023 that this product now contains peanuts, and all products shipped to them have been labeled accordingly.""

Nevertheless, the supermarket chain issued a recall of the cookies, which had allegedly only been sold in its Danbury and Newington stores, both cities in Connecticut. The CEO, Stew Leonard, Jr., said in a video obtained by News 12 : ""I'm here with our family and, I mean, we're all devastated, very sad. I have four daughters. One of them is in her 20s. I can imagine how that family feels right now.""
""Preliminary investigation has revealed that Órla’s death occurred due to the gross negligence and reckless conduct of the manufacturer and/or sellers who failed to properly identify the contents of the cookie on the packaging. This failure in proper disclosure has led to this devastating yet preventable outcome,"" the lawyers involved in the case wrote.
The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Food, Standards and Product Safety Division released a statement of its own saying that it was investigating the matter in partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and officials in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey as well as the supermarket chain.
Baxendale moved to New York City to train at the Ailey School in 2018, the school's website revealed, and had been a performer during New York Fashion Week and was also a part of several productions at the city's prestigious Lincoln Center. The school added her death to her bio on its website, remembering the woman for her love of dance and the passion she carried for the arts."

From the outside the property at 40 Ybbsstrasse in Amstetten, Austria, appeared like any other, as behind the walls it hides the crimes of the sex monster. Fritzl was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2009 after pleading guilty to rape, false imprisonment, manslaughter by negligence, and incest.
Often after horrific crimes have taken place inside, buildings are demolished; such as the infamous case of Fred and Rose West’s home on Cromwell Street in Gloucester. But while Fritzl has been in jail, the house was not pulled down or left empty, and instead it has been converted into flats.
It was bought by landlord couple Herbert and Ingrid Houska from Fritzl's bankruptcy estate and the couple renovated it. They said: ""All nine apartments are rented out. There are young people among them who have no connection to the Fritzl case.""
They purchased the property in 2016 to provide a new start for the local community. The town of Amstetten, 70 miles from the Austrian capital of Vienna was left in shock when Fritzl’s crimes came to light as he had been seen as a dedicated hard working grandfather.
While all the flats are rented out, the owners added that the basement where Fritzl’s daughter Elisabeth was tortured has been partially filled with concrete. The garage has been bricked up and only the stairs and a single room remain as they were.
Mr Houska said: “From the worst possible situation, we have found the best solution. After 10 years, we don’t speak about the Fritzl case anymore. It is not the Fritzl house anymore. We can move on.”
Meanwhile, Fritzl has now been granted conditional release from a prison for the mentally ill today following appeal. The 88-year-old was snapped in a car as he arrived at Landesgericht District Court at 7.20am UK time for a hearing - the first time he's been seen outside prison for 15 years.
It was in the cellar of the building that Fritzl dragged his terrified daughter Elisabeth, then 18, into the dungeon lair that would be her prison for 24 years. He would drug and beat her into submission so she did not try to escape and she gave birth to seven of his children during 8,642 days in captivity. He had told his wife and police that Elisabeth had run away to join a cult.
The case finally emerged in 2008 when Elisabeth told police during a trip to hospital, in the town of Amstetten, that she had been held captive by her father. The woman, along with three of the seven children she had with Fritzl, were finally freed from their brutal life of captivity."

The presenter usually fronts the BBC morning programme with Charlie Stayt every Thursday to Saturday. However, she did not make an appearance on Thursday (January 25) with Nina Warhurst replacing her. Naga's absence wasn't addressed by either of the hosts as they discussed the day's headlines.
Nina has only recently just returned from maternity leave as she welcomed her third child with husband Ed Fraser in July. Earlier this month Nina returned to the BBC studio as host Jon Kay happily introduced her, with Nina telling her co-star that she missed them. She went on to gush about her baby and said her baby girl is ""the best"".
Jon told viewers: ""I am delighted to say that back from maternity leave it's Nina. Lovely to see you."" Nina said: ""Thank you very much it's lovely to be back. I have missed the gang. I'm missing the baby this morning very much but yeah it's lovely to be back. Best job in the world. And best baby in the world. She added: ""I know everyone thinks their baby is the best one but sorry guys, mine actually is.""
BBC Breakfast has been hit by other presenter shake ups this month after Charlie was ""missing"" from the show last week. Naga was joined by journalist Ben Thompson as viewers noted it was the third weekend the veteran presenter hadn't appeared.
It left fans wondering where he was spending his Saturdays as Naga and Ben talked viewers through the day's headlines instead. At the start of the year Jon Kay announced there would be changes to BBC Breakfast as they launched their extended shows. He wrote: ""It’s a big week for the #BBCBreakfast team. From now on, the programme will be 15 minutes longer Mon-Fri.
""Then at 0930 our friends and neighbours @BBCMorningLive take over - and their show has been extended, too! The UK’s two biggest morning shows just got BIGGER!"" Breakfast was previously live from 6:00am to 9:15am, and Morning Live airing for 45 minutes until 10:00am.
While Naga has also turned her had to presenting other shows as she recently fronted satirical news programme Have I Got News For You. Naga presented alongside Maisie Adam and Richard Osman, with her appearance going down a treat with fans. ""Great hosting. Hope to see you in the chair again soon,"" said one fan as they flocked to X, formally Twitter. ""Naga Munchetty needs to host Have I Got News For You every week,"" said another. While someone else said: ""Naga's fun cheeky side is perfect for HIGNY BBC should utilise her fun side more.""

GF8HQ5XXIC_5NPCB1TMA5T7KGT,Experts shares exactly what to do if your landlord tries to increase your rent,Liam GilliverOpinion Writer,"15:48, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/experts-shares-exactly-what-your-31957969,"It's a tenant's worse nightmare: being told their rent is going up.
Amidst the cost-of-living crisis, cash-strapped Brits are struggling to get by, with soaring energy bills and sky high food prices. As a result, getting on the property ladder for some is seemingly impossible, and many are forced to live in rented accommodation.
But what are your rights if a private landlord tries to increase your rent - and what are the exact steps you should take? Last night, on the Martin Lewis Money Show, one man revealed his son's landlord wants to increase his rent by a staggering 71 per cent to £2,4000 per month. The landlord also wants to increase the man's deposit.
Finance expert and host of the show Martin Lewis was joined by Nadeem Kahn of the housing charity Shelter to help give the tenant some much-needed advice. Both described the situation as 'outrageous'.
Kahn made it very clear that no landlord can increase the deposit mid-tenancy. ""When it comes to increasing your rent however, if you're in the fixed term of your contract it can only be increased if you have a rent review clause in your contract,"" he added.
Once the fixed term is over, the landlord can increase rent but has to give legal notice and tenants can appeal that notice to a tribunal. ""What the tribunal will do is set a rent based on what the market rates are for your area,"" Kahn explained. ""So it's always worth researching what the local rates are for your area before going down that route.""

According to Shelter, there is no limit on agreed rent increases for assured shorthold tenants - and whilst renters don't have to agree to an increase, it could result in the landlord trying to end the tenancy. This is often done through a section 21 notice.
It is also worth noting that even if you express unhapiness at the increased rent, once you pay the higher amount it legally becomes your new rental price. For those fearing eviction, both Kahn and Lewis confirmed that landlords can issue an eviction without a legal reason. However, they will be unable to do so during a fixed term contract.

GFJ2RYN1NX_48TBO4NMY7L9H1V,Donald Trump 'pumped up in battle mode' as he sizes up Nikki Haley in 'line of fire',Fiona LeishmanUS News Reporter,"14:23, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-pumped-up-battle-31938986,"Donald Trump is reportedly ""in full battle mode"" for a showdown with Nikki Haley in the race to become the Republican presidential candidate, according to a body language expert.
This comes as Ron DeSantis, Florida Governor, stepped down from the race ahead of the New Hampshire primary with the race for Republican presidential candidate between Trump and former UN Ambassador Haley. Body language expert Judi James analysed Trump's recent appearances and shared her insights with The Mirror.
""There are several key body language clues that Trump is now going into full battle mode now the ground is cleared and only Haley stands in his line of fire,"" she explained. ""First, the loud growling voice is back, sounding alarming when the vocal and tonal emphasis is placed on key words or phrases. This comes peppered between long sections of 'purring' where he sounds happy and smug.""
READ MORE: Donald Trump has 'lots of skeletons in his cupboard that may yet come out', expert warns
Judi continued: ""Then there is the return of the signature hand gesture rituals Trump was using on a consistent and regular basis during his first campaign for the White House. His rigid, upward-pointing index finger is back, followed by the forming of an 'O' shape with his thumb and index finger.
""The message from this ritual is clear: 'Do what I say and everything will be ok'. The rigid index is a command-and-control gesture of authority and the 'O' is a precision gesture that also signals 'OK'.
""It looks like a powerful and unequivocal signal that, like many of his grandiose claims to end wars and lock down borders etc, suggests his voters can just relax and leave it with him and not worry about questioning the detail. In business this used to be called the 'Just show me the baby' effect, as in 'Don't talk about the labouvr pains, just show me the baby'. He is also using a one-hand downward chop gesture with the hand then moving from side to side like a priest giving his blessing.""
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US
Judi also explained how Trump's gestures and way of speaking show a ""pumped up"" ego now the field has narrowed. She explained: ""His repeated verbal use of the third person in Manchester, as in his 'Thank you very much President Trump' and 'A man named Trump' etc show pumped up levels of ego.
""At Manchester his smug signals went off the scale as he stood wearing a clamped-lip smile, rotating slowly as, like a rock star, he allowed his audience to do most of the work with the chanting and cheering. In Rochester, he used a similar effect to deal with a heckler.""
At a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Saturday, Trump was labelled a ""dictator"" by a protester whom the former President swiftly had removed, telling security ""Get him out"". He then joked that he would only be a dictator for ""one day"" if re-elected.
During another rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, Trump was heckled again. This time, he remained silent as the crowd's cheers drowned out the heckler, said Judi. She added: ""One small tongue-poke from Trump revealed his disgust at being interrupted but his 'he looks like a nice person' suggested external calm.""
While Trump may appear calm, Judi warned that the ex-President might not be as composed as he seems. She explained: ""There's also the signals of barely-suppressed anger.
""When he goes on the attack for enemies like the 'Washington swamp' or the 'fake news media' his top lip tightens in anger and his lips form the small round shape that displays his lower teeth in an animal sign of attack. Telling his audience he got 'Indicted more times than Alphonse Capone' he tucks his elbows into his sides and throws his hands out in a gesture of mimed innocence.""
Trump has also been using his rallies to poke fun at his Democrat counterpart. Judi said: ""Biden gets the full force of his insults, from his 'Crooked Joe' to the way he now has a small comedy routine of mimicking Biden as he walks off a stage.""
Meanwhile, she shared that when it comes to his Republican rival Nikki Haley: ""His mentions of Haley actually appear muted. There's no name-calling or insults and he actually swerved off from her to Hilary Clinton at one point, who he still seems to see as a bigger target. His body language as he speaks of Haley looks neutral, either as though she is not worth the effort or that he might actually be seeing her as a potential running mate.""
Judi isn't the only expert to pick up on the notion of Haley becoming Trump's running mate for the 60th presidential elections. David Dunn, Professor of International Politics at the University of Birmingham, told The Mirror: ""In New Hampshire, it's a case of whether Haley picks up the cudgel and goes after Trump, recognizing that it's now between him and her who comes first in New Hampshire.""
Adding: ""There's a reluctance to do that because she [might be] keeping open the prospect of being vice president, that's one thing. Or she also doesn't want to alienate the Trumpian base, the fanatical cult-like support for Trump within that section of the Republican party.
""She has a narrow path to tread there, but it may well be the case that it's now or never in terms of actually putting the boot into Trump in a way that actually makes a material difference to his standing by taking him on.""
He added: ""She remains an outsider at this stage, it has to be said, but there is still a pathway for her to come through and to be there in the background as the number two candidate long into the primary process, enough for Trump to stumble through the legal processes in New York and elsewhere.""
Looking at Trump's former competitors, DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are now supporting the outspoken Republican, Judi said: ""[Trump's] references to Ramaswamy and DeSantis in New Hampshire were much more powerfully, if subtly, damning. When he mentioned DeSantis his worst were favourable but he also performed a poker face and played with the mic in an act of distraction as though not really interested and Ramaswamy was described in Manchester as having 'A lot to say and saying it fast'.""

With her blessing, I hasten to add. Neither Brooklyn Beckham nor his nan are here, but some of the food he’s offering in the pop-up restaurant he’s launched via Uber Eats Hosts is. It’s easy to have a pop at Brookers, fresh prince of the Nepo Babies, infamous for releasing a photography book of blurry pictures, and online videos where he attempts challenging culinary feats like making a cheese toastie.
But when you consider that he could be sitting on his bum doing absolutely nothing, or a full-time messy party boy - well, he’s not actually doing any harm is he? That said, this latest foray into food is probably not going to gain him many new admirers.
This is his restaurant, but he won’t be anywhere near it – or even, apparently, in the same country - and he won’t be doing any of the… you know… cooking.
Admittedly, it’s not like Gordon Ramsay is slaving over the stoves in every one of his restaurant kitchens simultaneously, but he probably did pop into his first one ever once or twice. And this is a pop-up, only lasting ten hours.
The five dishes on his menu are Iberico pork and Atlantic prawn dumplings (£10), Buffalo Cauliflower with Brooklyn’s homemade (ahem) ‘secret’ hot sauce (£10), Charcoal barbecued corn-fed tikka chicken (£15), 12-hour slow cooked Wagyu Bolognese (£15) and Nanny Peggy’s English Breakfast Sandwich (£10).
As the chef explains, “My Nanny Peggy taught me how to make her English Breakfast sandwich when I was 5, and it’s been my favourite ever since. I’ve always been into trying different foods, cuisines, and cultures, but that was one of my earliest memories of loving cooking.
""Spending time in the kitchen is definitely something me and my dad bond over… even though I think I make my English Breakfast sandwich better, he does make a pretty good one!”
Of the three dishes I’m trying, the sandwich is the most underwhelming. Limp toast, pale bacon, fried egg, sausage, ketchup - if you got it in your local greasy spoon cafe you’d think it was… fine? The cauliflower in batter is… ok? The secret hot sauce is… hot-ish? The Wagyu Bolognese is nice, in that way spag bol always is, but pretty unremarkable.
Overall, none of it’s a disaster. None of it’s that great either though. Brooklyn, don’t give up the day j… oh never mind. Brooklyn’s five dishes are available only in London today and tomorrow between 5pm and 10pm.

The paranoid schizophrenic was tackled as he sat in his third victim’s stolen van after mowing down innocent pedestrians. Police released the dramatic footage after Calocane, 32, was sentenced today for the horror attacks in June last year.
On June 13, the country awoke to horrific news from Nottingham, that a knifeman had gone on a rampage across the city. It emerged that Valdo Calocane had killed two university students, Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19, as they walked home from a night out. He had then attacked and killed school caretaker Ian Coates.
Mr Coates had been weeks from retirement and the two students had been celebrating the end of the academic year. During his rampage, Calocane had also tried to break into a youth hostel, but was pushed from the window. Calocane had his pleas of not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter accepted and today (Thursday) was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at a high security hospital, subject to special restrictions.
After killing the beloved school caretaker, he took his van and rammed three people, leaving them badly injured - but thankfully all survived. Police gave chase to Calocane after he drove into three people, and stopped at a nearby junction. Various officers followed the van, including PC Whysall who rushed to the van as it started moving.
As a police vehicle pulled up one side, PC Whysall could be seen rushing to the driver's door. When he pulled open the driver’s door to be confronted by Calocane wielding a ""large dagger"". Then on his bodycam footage, he can be seen drawing his Taser as he shouts at Calocane to ""stay where you are"".
In court, the prosecution described the moments of the arrest. It said: ""PC Whysall opened the passenger door and found the defendant in the driver’s seat holding a large dagger in his hand.
""The officer shouted for him to drop the dagger, but he didn't, so the Taser was activated. He was joined by PC Bower who also discharged his Taser, following which the defendant dropped the dagger into the footwell.""
After the incident, there was an outpouring of grief and support across the city of Nottingham, including vigils and services. James Coates, the son of victim Ian Coates, said his father was just five months away from retirement before he was killed.
He said: “He didn’t get the chance because a selfish monster decided to go on a spree killing. We shouldn’t be here, we should be at work but we can’t because he killed our father. You can’t imagine how hard it is to take the phone call that their dad has been murdered in a killing spree. To have a life taken so horrifically is something you will never come to terms with. The effect this has had on us cannot be put into words. The reason for our very existence, gone.”
Mr Coates had suffered 15 wounds, including defensive wounds to his hands, the court heard and a pathologist later concluded the wounds had been inflicted ""at the severe end of the scale"".
Mr Coates was discovered by members of the public shortly after 5.30am, found to be unresponsive and was pronounced dead shortly after paramedics and police arrived."

Lorraine Stanley is set to reprise her role on the BBC soap, just weeks after she left Walford for Spain. Karen left under a cloud when she took full responsibility for the orchestrated kidnap of Albie, Sharon and Keanu's son. She decided to leave the Square for good, taking Phil Mitchell's money - which he gave to Sharon to pay off the kidnapper - with her.
However, new listings for the BBC soap have confirmed Karen will make her return in early February. Not much is known about her being back, or whether it will be permanent, but there's no doubt Phil will want his money when she returns.
She will also be heading back to Walford following the death of her son Keanu Taylor, who was killed by Linda Carter in shocking scenes on Christmas Day. No one apart from The Six know he's dead yet - so what will Karen think when she returns to see he's gone, with the women having spun a story to say he attacked Nish and fled Walford?
Taking to Twitter, now X, viewers have been sharing their theories for Karen's return, speculating whether Karen's daughter Bernie Taylor could be leaving or if Keanu's body is discovered. One person said: ""What if Karen’s back for Bernie’s exit? #Eastenders"", a different account put: ""I won’t be able to cope if we lose Bern! The kindest soul in all of Walford,"" while another added: ""What are the odds Bernie and Felix will leave with Karen next week? #Eastenders.""
Elsewhere, one viewer said: ""So rumour has it Karen is back week after next. Hope this means Keanu is found #sheanu #eastenders,"" while a different account put: ""Yes - Karen’s back on the square w/c 5th Feb. Strange she’d risk coming back and not just be video-calling again when she still owes Phil £50k, but praying it means they’ll find Keanu. We need him found. #EastEnders.""
Speaking about her exit from the show previously, Lorraine said: ""I just want people to remember her as the best mum on the square, a heart of gold, she'd give you her last fiver and would do anything for her kids - a bit like myself.""

GQ0AT2JBGD_PRC2PJHRXYJQGJQ,Alzheimer's can be diagnosed after visit to an eye doctor - key sign to look out for,Yelena MandenbergNews Reporter,"22:31, 24 Jan 2024Updated10:20, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/alzheimers-can-diagnosed-after-visit-31961629,"Experts have revealed that one visual symptom can help doctors predict Alzheimer's disease.
A team led by UC San Francisco has identified several visual symptoms linked to a degenerative visual condition found in Alzheimer's patients. Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), also known as Benson's syndrome, often signals the onset of Alzheimer's disease. It can be diagnosed by an eye doctor if they know what to look for. Symptoms include trouble with spatial judgment, difficulty identifying movement, and problems performing everyday tasks.
Despite normal eye exams, this disorder is often missed. The researchers aimed to ""improve PCA characterization and recommendations."" The study, published in Lancet Neurology, involved data from over 1,000 patients across 36 sites in 16 countries. It focused on a lesser-known aspect of Alzheimer's that affects visual processing.
The researchers found that PCA overwhelmingly predicts Alzheimer's. Some 94 percent of PCA patients had Alzheimer's symptoms or a diagnosis, while the remaining 6 percent had conditions like Lewy body disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
General thinking skills aren't usually affected early in PCA, but mild dementia symptoms often show up by the time patients are diagnosed. This is typically nearly four years after symptoms first appear. The average age of PCA onset is 59, which is younger than when memory symptoms linked to it start showing, making diagnosis tricky. Dr. Marianne Chapleau from UCSF's Department of Neurology emphasised the need for better diagnostic tools for PCA.
""Most patients see their optometrist when they start experiencing visual symptoms and may be referred to an ophthalmologist who may also fail to recognise PCA,"" she said. ""We need better tools in clinical settings to identify these patients early on and get them treatment.""
Patients usually first visit a doctor 3.8 years after symptom onset, by which time mild or moderate dementia is often apparent. At diagnosis, many patients showed signs of ""constructional dyspraxia, space perception deficit, and simultanagnosia."" Additionally, nearly half struggled with basic maths calculations and reading.
Dr. Renaud La Joie, a colleague of Chapleau at UCSF, stressed that early detection of PCA could enhance Alzheimer's treatment. The study found that PCA patients ""show similar levels of amyloid and tau,"" like those in typical Alzheimer's cases, suggesting they might benefit from new treatments.
Senior author Gil Rabinovici, MD, director of the UCSF Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, highlighted the need to understand why Alzheimer's targets visual areas in the brain rather than memory areas. He also pointed out the higher prevalence of PCA in women as a key area for future research.

Roman Heini is leading an expansion of Woolworth Germany in Europe and says new UK shops are on his “bucket list”. Once famed for their pick and mix sweet counters, the stores vanished from our town centres when the British firm went into administration in 2009 after 100 years.
Mr Heini said: “I don’t know of any brands where the recognition will be as high as it is in Britain, without having any stores. We have secured all the trademarks for the brand for the whole of Europe, so we could operate if we make the decision. It may be in the mix for the mid or long-term future.”
Woolworth Germany also collapsed into insolvency in 2009 but made a comeback, expanding into Austria and Poland. It has over 600 shops, does not sell online and specialises in own-brand household goods and clothing, including underwear.
Mr Heini, previously boss of Aldi and Lidl, told trade mag Retail Week: “There are over 300 million potential consumers in Europe and no dominating player. The market is still there to be divided between the potential players for the future.”"

James Moore was on a dream trip to the southeast of Asia and due to return home in February. However, a few days into the trip, James fell ill but dismissed it as a local virus going around. Later on, his friend Dave Moss was unable to reach him so went to check his hotel room and found him seriously ill. He raised the alarm and James was rushed to hospital, but shortly afterwards was declared dead by doctors.
James’ sister Rachel Tate said of the tragedy: “When Dave couldn’t reach him, he grew worried and went to James’ hotel. What he found in that room was beyond belief. James lying motionless on his bed, clutching his asthma pump.” His sister is coordinating with the British Embassy and Thai authorities to bring his body back to the UK. The grieving family has since launched a GoFundMe page to help pay for James’ funeral once his body arrives home to Newmarket, Suffolk. It has so far raised around £1,700.
Rachel wrote online: “I can’t believe this is happening to us, James has died out in Thailand so many things need doing. Thank god he was insured so we can get him home to bury him “This is all helping towards that as we live week to week most of the time and do not have hundreds and thousands in bank to cover this and everything given is very much appreciated by me and my family
“Thank you everyone for sharing and donating, this is a great help and comfort to my family right now as they are stressing about everything. This situation is like a jigsaw puzzle slowing but surely we are getting the situation sorted to get my brother home so we can bury him here so thank you and please keep sharing.”
One heartbroken friend wrote: “James had the most extraordinary force of character of anyone I've ever met, and was like that from the very day we first started at school together. “James was a kind soul who brought so many people much laughter, and exuded charm and impish wit everywhere he went. You really only had to meet him once, but I'd known him all my life.
“Although I'd not seen James for many years he was always with me in my thoughts and always will be. You will be dearly missed my friend. Rest in peace James.”
A UKG Spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Thailand”."

The University students, both 19, were heading back to their student accomodation when they were targeted by Valdo Calocane, 32, on Ilkeston Road, prosecutor Karim Khalil KC told Nottingham Crown Court.
Barnaby dropped to the ground at around 4am after Calocane inflicted ""grave injuries"" as he stabbed the student multiple times on June 13 last year. The court heard how Grace showed ""incredible bravery"" and tried to fight Calocane off by pushing him into the road. But the killer then turned his attention to her and was ""as uncompromisingly brutal in his assault of Grace as he was in his assault of Barnaby"", Mr Khalil said.
Family members in the public gallery sobbed as Mr Khalil told the court Grace's injuries were too severe and she collapsed as Barnaby tried to defend himself from the ground, kicking out at his attacker, before Calocane ""calmly"" walked away.
He then launched a fatal attack on school Caretaker Ian Coates, 65, and stabbed him to death before he allegedly stole his vehicle. Calocane, who answered to the name Adam Mendes in court, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to the manslaughter of Mr Coates and that of university students Barnaby and Grace. He denied their murder.
He also admitted attempting to murder three pedestrians who were hit by a van he had stolen from Mr Coates. They all survived the attack. However, Mr Coates was found dead in Magdala Road around an hour later, having also been stabbed “repeatedly”. Calocane’s barrister Peter Joyce KC told a previous hearing the defendant “does not dispute the physical facts of the prosecution’s case” but was suffering from “extreme” mental illness at the time of the incident.
Prosecutor Karim Khalil KC said: ""We have also consulted with the families of the deceased. We considered carefully representations made in the course of those consultations; we also considered the particular gravity and complexity of this case, including that which we submit are the grossly aggravating factors of the multiplicity of fatal and intended fatal offending.
""In these circumstances, the Crown concluded that it was appropriate to accept the pleas to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. For the avoidance of any possible doubt, it is the Crown's position that the appalling facts of this case render it to be one of the utmost seriousness."" The prosecution’s decision to accept the pleas entered by Calocane on November 28 means he will not face trial for murder. He now faces a sentencing hearing expected to last for around two days."

GU80WD4AYS_BBN1GQ3MR9W7L64,Army chief warns ordinary Brits will be called up to fight if UK goes to war,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"09:50, 24 Jan 2024Updated11:38, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/army-chief-warns-ordinary-brits-31953182,"The head of the British Army today warns that ordinary Brits would have to fight if the UK went to war because the armed forces aren't big enough.
General Sir Patrick Sanders will sound the alarm in a bombshell speech, telling ministers they need to ""mobilise the nation"" if war breaks out with Russia. The chilling alert comes amid growing concerns that the UK doesn't have enough troops.
He will address the International Armoured Vehicles expo in Twickenham, where is expected to voice his worries. According to The Telegraph, Gen Sir Patrick will say there needs to be a ""shift"" in the public's mindset.
It comes just days after a top NATO chief said civilians must be ready for an all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years. Admiral Rob Bauer said last week: ""It is the whole of society that will get involved whether we like it or not. That realisation, we didn't talk about that a year ago.""
The Dutch military chief said nations will need to mobilise civilians in case a global war breaks out - saying governments need to be ""war ready"". He went on: ""I'm not saying it is going wrong tomorrow. But we have to realise it's not a given that we are in peace. And that's why we have the plans.""
It comes as NATO ramps up pressure on Russia and China with its biggest military exercises in decades and a new intelligence-sharing deal with Japan.
Gen Sir Patrick has previously voiced his concern about Russia, saying in 2022 that the UK is facing its ""1937 moment"". He said back then that the nation needs to be ready to ""fight and win"", stating: “This is our 1937 moment. We are not at war, but must act rapidly so that we aren’t drawn into one through a failure to contain territorial expansion.”.
At the weekend, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps refused to say when a Tory pledge to raise defence spending will be met - despite saying the risk of war has increased. The Defence Secretary was challenged over whether the UK is ready for war, with defence spending below its target of 2.5% of GDP. Asked when the UK will meet the target, he told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: ""There is a trajectory upwards. I can't give you the exact date because we've always said it's as the economic conditions allow. But the point is we're working to a plan.""

It comes after a former chief of the general staff of the British Army warned this week the UK risks a repeat of the 1930s unless more is invested in its armed forces. General Lord Dannatt hit out at the shrinking size of the army, which he said has fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today ""and falling fast""
Writing in The Times, he drew parallels with the 1930s when the ""woeful"" state of the UK's armed forces failed to deter Hitler. ""There is a serious danger of history repeating itself,"" he said. Pointing to rising geopolitical uncertainty, he said: ""If our armed forces are not strong enough to deter future aggression from Moscow or Beijing it will not be a small war to contend with but a major one.""
Lord Dannatt said pay and conditions should be ""urgently reviewed"" and ""a pay rise to attract recruits and to retain current trained personnel should be a priority, as should addressing the appalling quality of some armed forces accommodation"".
Under Government proposals, the size of the regular army will be cut from a commitment of 82,000 troops to 73,000 by 2025. Mr Shapps has said the size of the British Army will not dip below 73,000 under the Conservatives, disputing projections that it could eventually sink to 50,000."

The incidents unfolded at a park on Childwall Valley Road in Belle Vale, Liverpool, which was cordoned off by Merseyside Police yesterday evening (Monday January 22) after reports that a total of four dogs had fallen ill.
Officers responded to reports from a veterinary surgery at around 2pm on Monday where a number of dogs were admitted after ingesting an unknown substance. Police have now confirmed that two of the dogs have died and a third is seriously ill, while the fourth dog is still receiving treatment.
Tests are now being carried out to decipher what the substance is, as police were yesterday seen at the park until evening.
Locals living opposite the cordon were told to keep their windows and doors shut last night, while pedestrians were advised to avoid the area.
Merseyside Police say enquiries are continuing to work out what exactly the substance is and how it got there. They added that CCTV, house-to-house and witness enquiries were being carried out in the local area last night.
Chief Superintendent Jonathan Davies said: “Whilst the incident is obviously of concern I want the public to be reassured that the matter is being dealt with and is under control. We would advise people to avoid the area as we seek to establish what the substance is and how it got there.
“Anyone who believes they were in the area and came into direct contact with the substance is advised to seek medical assistance if they believe they have suffered any ill effects. We would always advise anyone who comes across an unknown substance to not touch but to report it to police.”
Any members of public with information are being asked to contact Merseyside Police's social media desk on X (formely Twitter) under the username @MerPolCC - or ‘Merseyside Police Contact Centre’ on Facebook quoting log 454 of 22 January.

The head judge on the ITV talent show is often seen wearing jeans or smart trousers, paired with a shirt or t-shirt but he instead opted for a more casual look this time around. Simon, 64, arrived alone, like his co-stars Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, Bruno Tonioli and hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.
But his arrival didn't go unnoticed as a team of security officers swarmed his lavish car to escort him into the historic building in the heart of London's West End as Simon chewed on a piece of gum.
Media mogul Simon appeared in high spirits as he flashed a smile upon his arrival and carrying two laptop cases. The dad-of-one sported a black compression top along with black tracksuit bottoms. Despite the aggressive winds recently, Simon braved the chill and opted to ditch his socks, going barefoot in his trainers.
The auditions were dramatically delayed after police escorted a mystery intruder away after he allegedly tried to get backstage to see the judges. Security were seen trying to secure the area and police then arrived at the London Palladium when auditions were due to start today.
Audience members heard theatre staff talking about the wannabe intruder saying he ""tried to sneak in backstage"".
The first round of auditions comes just two months after former judge David Walliams settled a legal dispute with the production company behind the competition.
Walliams sued Fremantle for misuse of private information as well as breaching data laws after comments he made during filming were subsequently leaked. David made comments about contestants in 2020 during auditions at the Palladium. However, they were later published by the Guardian.
In court documents, he claimed that he and his fellow judges would often talk amongst themselves while on a break from filming and that the conversations were private. David claimed he was unaware that the conversations may have been recorded and later transcribed. But in 2018, bosses for the show stated that cameras would ""now be rolling 24/7.""
A source for Freemantle said: ""We are pleased that we have achieved an amicable resolution of this dispute with David. We are sincerely sorry that his private conversations when a judge on Britain's Got Talent were published, and the great distress this caused David. We have reviewed our production practices on the show to ensure they fully respect the expectations of our talent whilst satisfying the requirements of the show.""
""We have enjoyed a great relationship with David over many years. We thank David for being an important part of the Britain's Got Talent family and the enduring success of the show and hope to have opportunities to work with him in the future.""

GYAB4VMHVH_L6DV54K18Y25TSM,Uyghur forced labour risks 'not being addressed' in renewable energy sector,Lawrence Matheson,"15:07, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/uyghur-forced-labour-risks-not-31948914,"A warning has been issued about the failure to address forced labour risks in the renewable energy sector, particularly those involving the Uyghur population.
This comes from research conducted by Anti-Slavery International, the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice and the Investor Alliance for Human Rights.
These organisations have published a guide for investors and a policy briefing on green technology supply chains. They argue that business leaders and ministers need to develop better strategies to tackle forced labour risks in the sector, especially due to reliance on supplies from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China.
China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in this region. The report highlights that both the solar and electric vehicle industries have been heavily impacted by forced labour in the region, given its dominance in green technology material supply and production.
The researchers, who interviewed investment professionals to understand how they have responded to these risks, warned that any materials sourced or produced in the Uyghur region carry human rights risks. The report highlights that green technology processing in the Uyghur region heavily depends on coal-generated electricity.
This is a key factor in the ""cost-competitiveness"" of the region's solar industry, according to the International Energy Agency. The researchers argue this could lead to greenwashing in the solar industry and potentially delay the shift to net zero. The study also found that efforts by investors and corporations to avoid direct or indirect involvement in Uyghur forced labour are hindered by a lack of international governmental collaboration.
It calls for governments to work together to support the growth of alternative green technology supply chains. The paper provides guidance for investors on how to reduce these risks and offers a policy brief to the UK Government on addressing the concerns through legislative and regulatory action.
This includes tools for investors to identify and engage with businesses linked to these risks in their green energy portfolios. The report also discusses how investors can redirect investments into companies that promote sustainability, innovation and supply chain resilience. It also outlines policy measures that governments can take to facilitate such investments.
Anita Dorett, from the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, warned: ""Investors in green energy sourcing from the Uyghur Region face heightened risks and reduced options. The inability to conduct human rights due diligence on the ground, the impossibility of direct remediation and the absence of investor leverage will necessitate divestment from any supplier operating in the Uyghur Region.""
Caroline Dale, from Sheffield Hallam University's Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice, said: ""This guidance provides stakeholders with practical tools to uncover hidden risks within their portfolios and redirect investment into corporations which champion the protection of human rights and sustainability.""
Jakub Sobik, from the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre, stated: ""The global efforts to address climate change and move to clean energy should not come at the expense of increasing the risks of people being exploited. We hope this new evidence can inform the UK Government's and investors' efforts to minimise these risks in practice."" The Department for Net Zero and Energy Security has been asked for a response.

It was first thought Misha, whose surname has not been disclosed, was ""just being lazy"" when he struggled at school and suffered fatigue. But when he started limping, had difficulty with limb movement and complained of headaches, Misha went to hospital and an MRI showed the large growth on the right hemisphere of his brain. He had to have surgery in December to have the 12cm growth removed.
Alena, the boy's mum, said: “At first, it seemed like Misha was just being lazy. Then other symptoms appeared. Our son started limping, his arm was moving awkwardly, and he complained of headaches.""
Now, Misha, of Chelyabinsk, Russia, needs rehabilitation but doctors believe the operation was successful. Neurosurgeon German Safronov told local media: ""The child suffered from headaches, his face became distorted, he experienced weakness in his limbs. When the boy came to me, I was very surprised, looking at the MRI scans. The boy had neurocysticercosis of the brain.""
Neurocysticercosis, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), is a preventable parasitic infection of the central nervous system and is caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The medics who treated Misha believe he contracted the infection through dirty hands.
According to reports, the larva of the parasite “lived” in cystic bubbles in his head. There were so many bubbles, say local media, that the doctors lost count. Dr Safronov explained: “The formation outwardly resembled a giant hedgehog or raspberry, as it consisted of individual bubbles. The formation was completely removed, preserving the lateral wall of the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle.”
The surgeon continued: “It was crucial not to open any of the bubbles because if that happened, and the contents of the cyst entered the cerebrospinal fluid, it would lead to the contamination of the entire brain.”
According to Safronov, anyone can develop the infection, but he said it was strange that a case had happened in the Chelyabinsk area."

The company, known for its tonic waters and mixers, revealed that it had doubled its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the second half of its financial year. This boost took overall earnings to around £30 million for the period, which was in line with what Fever-Tree had predicted for its shareholders.
Despite cost-of-living pressures affecting its customers, the company still managed to increase its market share based on the value of the products it sold. The firm reported strong sales in pubs and restaurants over Christmas, particularly in the UK.
Its new Espresso Martini mixer was highlighted as a standout performer. CEO Tim Warrillow said: ""The Fever-Tree brand has performed well in 2023, growing our market share in all of our key markets, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment."" Although UK revenue dipped by 1% to £114.8 million, US revenues rose by 22% to £117 million.
This made the US the company's largest market for the first time. Mr Warrillow, the boss of Fever-Tree, added: ""The US ended the year as our largest region, where we have extended our leadership position in both the tonic and ginger beer categories.""
He also stated that their new Espresso Martini mixer was a hit over Christmas in the UK. Despite some setbacks in Germany and Australia, he remains confident about growth in 2024.
Fever-Tree predicts a 10% rise in brand revenue this year, with total group revenue expected to grow by 8%. The company believes new glass contracts and lower transatlantic freight rates will boost gross margins this year.
In other drinks news, Britvic reported an 8.1% rise in revenue to £443.5 million for the last quarter of 2021. The company saw a significant increase in Brazilian revenues, thanks to a recent acquisition. Changes in France offset a decline in product sales, but revenue still rose by 1.1%. In the UK, revenue was up by 6.9%.

H6HKLCFZ43_KXJPJHVNVXGIVPR,Harvard experts warned Donald Trump was 'mentally unstable' and 'shouldn't be president',Alex Croft,"03:04, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/harvard-experts-warned-donald-trump-31952471,"Medical experts from Harvard previously expressed concerns about Donald Trump's mental stability, questioning his suitability to be President.
This warning had initially emerged during the New Hampshire primary as his behaviour was increasingly unpredictable. Nevertheless, Democrats have continued to query Trump's mental fitness for office especially given a string of verbal gaffes, off-kilter rants and blatant falsehoods. Harvard medical professionals had pointedly claimed in the past that Trump didn't possess the mental capacity for the responsibilities involved in being a president.
A 2017 book, 'The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump ', had recorded the stern warnings delivered by these academicians. This publication featured contributions from 27 psychiatrists, psychologists and other professionals in the mental health field.
Judith Lewis Herman of Harvard Medical School and Bandy X. Lee from the Yale School were among those who roundly criticised the former president. They were quoted in the prologue of the book: ""Anyone as mentally unstable as Mr. Trump simply should not be entrusted with the life-and-death powers of the presidency.""
Retired Harvard psychiatry professor, Lance Dodes, said Trump's ""sociopathic characteristics are undeniable"", adding that they pose a ""profound danger"" to America's democracy. He warned that these traits could worsen over time.
Philip Zimbardo, an American psychologist known for running the Stanford prison experiment, described Trump as an ""an impulsive, immature, incompetent person who, when in the position of ultimate power, easily slides into the role of the tyrant.""
However, not all co-authors agreed with this view. Some suggested that such claims stigmatise the mentally ill. Clinical psychologist Craig Malkin said: ""Equating mental illness with incapacity merely stigmatizes the mentally ill."" He believes Trump displays ""extreme present hedonism"".
Biden, who has faced similar accusations from the Republicans, commented on Trump's recent verbal blunders. He highlighted a mix-up where Trump confused Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley while discussing the January 6 Capitol attack. ""By the way, they never report the crowd on Jan. 6. You know Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they - do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it,"" Trump said.
The video also showed Trump falsely claiming that you need voter ID to buy bread, and saying he ran for president against Barack Obama, which isn't true. Another clip from a rally in New Hampshire shows him ranting about old US forts changing their names. ""We won world wars out of forts. Fort Benning, Fort This, Fort That, many forts,"" he said, upset about the decision.

The 30-year-old victim died in hospital a short time after he was treated by emergency services at the scene in Didsbury, Manchester. An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning.
Police are appealing for information, including CCTV or dashcam footage, about the incident on the A34 Kingsway shortly before 1.40am on Tuesday. The victim and suspect are thought to have been travelling in separate vehicles along Kingsway leading up to the incident at the junction of Parrs Wood Lane to Queensway. An ""altercation"" took place at a traffic light, police added, and the suspect fled the scene in their vehicle.
Detective Inspector Alex Wilkinson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""We understand that an incident of such seriousness like this will cause shock to the local community and further afield. I want to provide reassurance that an investigation has been launched to understand what has happened fully and identify all those responsible swiftly.
""While the motive for this murder is not clear at this stage, we do believe the incident to be isolated.""

HALNS6ZMCL_HEWPHFFKQLE7ZHJ,Storm Jocelyn weather map turns completely red as chilling 80mph winds heads to UK,Graeme MurrayNews Reporter,"10:48, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/storm-jocelyn-weather-map-turns-31944297,"A map of Storm Jocelyn has turned completely red as chilling 80mph winds head to the UK.
Forecasters have claimed the storm could produce gusts of up to 80mph in some places, and is expected to hit later today. The north west of Scotland will bear the brunt of the storm, which comes in the wake of the last named storm, Isha, which caused severe damage across the country. Amber and yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued for much of the UK and yellow warnings for rain have also been put in place for parts of western and southern Scotland, and north-west England.
A map by Zoom Earth shows the whole country turning red at the peak of Storm Jocelyn's force, which is expected to cause widespread damage - but not be as fierce as Storm Isha. A yellow warning for ice has also been issued across northern and eastern parts of Scotland. Gusts of 80mph could be experienced in exposed areas, with 40-50mm of rain possible over higher ground, according to forecasters.
Steve Willington Met Office chief meteorologist said: “Although this system will be a step down relative to Storm Isha, with the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn. Outbreaks of heavy rain on Tuesday could bring rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20mm quite widely with 40 to 50mm over higher ground in southwest Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northwest England.
""Wind gusts are expected to reach 55 to 65mph across northwestern Scotland while there is potential for winds to gust to 75 to 80mph in a few places; in particular, exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal northwest Scotland early on Wednesday morning.”
More than 100 food alerts and warnings have been issued across the UK today. There are 85 flood alerts and 13 flood warnings in place for England. Elsewhere in the country, Scotland has 10 alerts and 15 warnings, while Wales has two alerts. The River Spey in Scotland is expected to be hit badly by flooding, as well as along the Nine Mile River and Bourne Valley in England.
Train services have also been disrupted by Storm Jocelyn and one rail firm urged passengers not to travel between England and Scotland. From 3pm today until noon on Wednesday, TransPennine Express (TPE) has said services in and out of Scotland could be hit by ""major disruption"". It said: ""High winds and heavy rainfall are set to cause major disruption to services in and out of Scotland.""
Routes affected are between Glasgow and Preston and between Edinburgh and both Newcastle and Preston. Services across are expected to be affected by the severe weather. Kathryn O’Brien, TPE customer experience and operations director told The Mirror earlier: “Our number one priority is to keep our customers and colleagues safe, and we will be doing all we can to keep people moving in difficult conditions.
""We are urging anyone travelling across the affected routes to plan ahead, allow extra time, check their journey up until the last minute and follow the guidance provided.”"
HFIY3W2Y1Z_2GF9Z2BXYYC5YT9,Mirror readers have their say on UK conscription if war breaks out with Russia,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"09:35, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mirror-readers-say-uk-conscription-31962650,"Mirror readers have given their view on conscription after the head of the British Army called on a “citizen army” to be ready for war.
General Sir Patrick Sanders, the outgoing Chief of the General Staff (CGS), said that the UK should “train and equip” civilians for a potential conflict. And he added that even that would be ""not enough"" as he pointed to allies in eastern and northern Europe ""laying the foundations for national mobilisation"".
He said: ""Within the next three years, it must be credible to talk of a British Army of 120,000, folding in our reserve and strategic reserve. But this is not enough. Our friends in eastern and northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilisation.”
But while he talked about preparation as being a “whole-of-nation undertaking”, many Mirror readers appeared unimpressed by the idea. Some people claimed that the ones who are pushing for conscription and war are those who would not be fighting while many wanted the politicians on the frontline.
“Wars are generally created by the Super Rich to make lots of money and to protect their interests,” said one person. Another stated: “We live in a country that panders to the few and the vast majority are perceived as of no consequence. It has become what it once was except nobody believes what lies the ruling class use anymore. Why should anyone think this country is worth fighting for.”
On a similar line, another person said: “All MPs and Lords in front leading the way I presume…” and another stated: “Not my war. They can go themselves”. One Mirror reader wrote: “Yes we will all gladly volunteer as long as Sunak, Gove and Johnson are right there next to us,” while a further said: “Well good luck with that hope everyone waits until the government fight on the front line first.”
Sadly there were some who claimed the UK now was “not worth fighting for” but at the same a few did appear keen on the idea of conscription with one saying: “sign me up.” Conscription existed in the UK during WW1 and WW2 while national service continued until the 1960s. Many countries around the world have national service during peacetime.
There have always been conscientious objectors to conscription in the UK and one Mirror reader said: “Conscription is outdated and won't work. Cannot force people to fight. Refuse, conscientiously object and leave it to the politicians who war monger.”
There were some more lighthearted comments on conscription from readers. “If they are called to serve will they be able to carry their mobile the youth of today. If you send them to war you most likely find them playing on their mobile rather than concentrating on war.” And another said: “I'm over weight, half blind, deaf in one ear and a f***** knee. Pretty decent at Call of Duty though.... sign me up.”
Meanwhile, Downing Street has insisted that people will not be forced to fight if war broke out with Russia. The Prime Minister's spokesman insisted that military service would remain voluntary.
Asked if Rishi Sunak could rule out conscription, his spokesman said: ""There is no suggestion of that. The Government has no intention to follow through with that. The British military has a proud tradition of being a voluntary force. There are no plans to change that."""

But as the cost of living crisis sees some people choose between feeding their family or keeping warm in winter - the ultra-rich elite remains unphased. Take for example the group of diners who racked up an eye-watering bill of AED398,630 (Approx. £85,000) at Salt Bae's infamous Nusr-Et restaurant in Dubai.
The Turkish restaurateur rose to fame and ridicule back in 2017 when a video of him elaborately seasoning an expensive piece of meat went viral. He has since opened branches around the world, including London, Dubai, New York, and Ankara - where customers can tuck into £1,140 steaks that are coated in 24-karat gold leaf.
Recently, the chef posted a receipt from one table with the caption: ""Money comes, money goes."" It showed an anonymous party had spent more than £80,000 on food and drink - more than double the mean average salary for all workers in the UK.
Items included a beef carpaccio at £60, three golden steaks at £3,300, a golden filet mignon at £240, as well as over £10 on a single portion of French Fries. For dessert, the group spent nearly £1,000 on baklava and £102 on two fruit platters.
This was, naturally, washed down by three bottles of wine costing a whopping £56,000, as well as luxury cognac priced at £6,000. Four porn star martinis, one sparkling water, and a Turkish coffee were also featured on the bill.

The customers were also slapped with a £19,000 service charge on top of the indulgent meal - which was all paid for with one American Express credit card. Social media users were quick to slam the diners and the eatery - describing the bill as 'embarrassing'.
""While all the kids in Gaza starve, you charge people absurd amounts to eat your mediocre, overpriced, food,"" one person wrote. Another commented: ""I bet the food wasn't even that good."" While a third added: ""Imagine being this wealthy and blowing it on food that isn’t worth it…""
Few people tried to justify the extreme level of wealth, arguing it is not up to one person to 'feed the world'. One user suggested the person could have donated lots of their wealth on the 'greater good' - and that people shouldn't criticise the hefty bill without knowing the full story.

Public Health Wales has urged those eligible to get vaccinated against whooping cough as cases have risen to levels that were seen in 2012 and 2015.
Whooping cough is highly contagious and can lead to serious health complications. According to PHW, babies under six months old are at most risk.
It can be very serious and lead to pneumonia and permanent brain damage. Young babies with whooping cough are at risk of dying from the disease. The vaccine for whooping cough (or pertussis) is routinely offered to pregnant women to give their unborn baby protection in the first few weeks following their birth.
The six-in-one vaccine is given to babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks and then again to pre-school-aged children. PHW said in recent weeks, cases of whooping cough have shown a ""rapid increase"".
According to PHW, whooping cough is an infection of the lungs and breathing tubes caused by Bordetella pertussis bacteria. It spreads very easily and can sometimes cause serious problems, especially in infants under one year of age. Health experts have warned that whooping cough tends to surge every 3-4 years. However, due to reduced social mixing during the pandemic from 2020 to 2022, the virus has spiked more than usual this year.
Public Health Wales (PHW) stated: ""current not current notifications are at levels not seen since 2012 and 2015."" While confirmed cases haven't risen alongside suspected ones yet, they're likely to increase once test results come in.
PHW also revealed that vaccination rates during pregnancy have dropped from over 80% to 70% in the past year, reports Wales Online. Dr Christopher Johnson, a Consultant Epidemiologist and Head of Public Health Wales' Vaccine Preventable Disease Programme explained: ""We typically see high rates of whooping cough peaking every three to four years, and with rates suppressed during the lockdowns of the pandemic we are naturally seeing a resurgence this year.""
He added: ""Whooping cough is highly contagious and is spread by breathing in small droplets in the air from other people's coughs and sneezes. Babies under six months old are at most risk. It can be very serious and lead to pneumonia and permanent brain damage. Young babies with whooping cough are at risk of dying from the disease.""
""The protection you receive from the pertussis vaccine in pregnancy passes on to your unborn baby and protects the baby in the first few weeks of their life until they receive their first routine immunisation when they are two months old. The vaccine also protects you from getting whooping cough and lowers the risk of you passing it on to your baby.""
""We would urge all pregnant women and parents of babies and young children to ensure they take up their offer of vaccination when given, or to ask their GP, midwife or health visitor if they believe they may not have had it.""

The spin-off series hit screens earlier this month as former Islanders head to South Africa for a second chance at finding love. Host Maya Jama has also returned to host the special as she welcomed back the likes of Georgia Harrison, Liberty Poole, Kaz Kamwi, Chris Taylor, Georgia Steel, Anton Danyluk and Hannah Elizabeth.
Despite the stellar cast of fan-favourite Islanders, many viewers have failed to be impressed by the new format. Taking to X - formerly Twitter - Love Island fans have shared their thoughts on the All Stars series. One said: ""So I have watched all episodes of #LoveIslandAllStars this week and tbh I'm struggling to watch as this concept is trash. It's dead and going nowhere. No surprises that the viewing ratings are low.""
Another reacted to the news the show reached one of its lowest ratings since season one back in 2015. They wrote: ""Because it’s bland and I’m sad because I really wanted to watch this. but no. #LoveIslandAllStars."" Someone else commented: ""Even friendships, Love Island friendships carry the show and we don't even have that to watch. There's no chemistry, romantic or otherwise.""
While a fan also commented on how the show was bringing former flames back together. They said: ""This is torture to watch and I don’t know why the producers thought bringing exes into the same villa is beyond me."" Love Island: All Stars has been competing with The Traitors, which airs Wednesday through to Friday at the same time of 9pm.
Last week over 4 million people tuned in to see The Traitors contestant Diane given an iconic stand-off, while over on ITV2, just 800,000 people tuned in to catch up on the latest from the Love Island villa in South Africa. The bad news didn't end there for Love Island bosses, with The Traitors: Uncloaked, a visualised podcast hosted by Ed Gamble, getting a new record rating high with almost 1million people watching on BBC Two at 10pm - beating Love Island All Stars by almost 200,000 viewers.
Fans of both shows have been reacting to the ratings on social media, with one declaring on Twitter (X): ""I love that a half an hour side show's visual podcast is beating Love Island."" Another agreed, musing: ""What a time to be alive! More watching podcasts about this than Love Island.""
Love Island: All Stars achieved the show's biggest launch since Summer 2022 on Monday night with 1.9m viewers across ITV1 and ITV2 (across all devices and including viewing on ITVX). It had a combined peak audience of 2.1m viewers, meaning that the evening's premiere gained the biggest 16-34 commercial overnight audience of the year.
When Love Island: All Stars kicked off earlier this month, fans also expressed their concern over the line-up. One wrote: ""The bombshells better be past islanders aswell cause this lineup is mid #LoveIsland,"" whilst a second added: ""This series should have been dedicated to the islanders who failed in casa amor and didn’t make it in the main villa. That lineup looks awful already and it hasn’t even started yet #LoveIsland."" A third shared: ""Deadest line up tho I’m gonna give this 1 week if it dead I’m not watching. #LoveIsland.""

The 33-year-old reality star was a contestant on the fifth season of Love Island back in 2019 - which also featured 33-year-old Irish bombshell Maura. And while the pair didn’t embark on a romance while they were win the villa, they did enjoy a brief relationship the following year.
Chris is still looking for love, however, and has returned to the franchise for the All Stars spin-off - which sees other past contestants return in the hope of finding romance with a fellow former contestant. In the current show, Chris has been growing close to 32-year-old Arabella Chi, who also appeared on season five of the original show.
While out on a romantic rowing date, Chris inadvertently gave insight to one of his past relationships - with fans convinced he was talking about Maura. Arabella asked Chris about his notorious sense of humour.
And in a candid and deep moment, the reality star admitted that he is ""deeply insecure"" and makes jokes in an effort to cover it up. He then commented that he ""lost his funny side"" whilst in a past relationship.
Viewers watching the scenes took to social media to make the connection between Chris’s words and his past romance with Maura. One fan on X wrote: ""ik chris isn’t speaking on his relationship with maura??"" And another questioned: “Chris is saying Maura wasn’t funny? Huh?”
Before entering the villa, Chris had said in an interview that he wouldn’t object to Maura appearing on the show. He said: “We’re on good terms. It was an amicable split. She’s doing her thing and I’m doing mine. There wouldn’t be an issues there. If she was in there we’d probably have a chat and it would be fine.”
While in another interview, Chris said he would feel awkward is an ex he had been intimate with were to walk into the villa. He said: ""I am really hoping that no one I have slept with is in there, as that’s going to be uncomfortable. I am not sure how I would deal with my ex being in there as we haven’t spoken since we split up.""
Chris and Maura dated for six months before splitting in May 2021. Maura had announced the end of the romance at the time, writing via social media: ""It breaks my heart to even type this, but I wanted to let everyone know that myself and Chris have made the joint decision to end our relationship.
""There is no wrongdoing on either side... We still love, care & respect each other deeply. From the minute we met each other we've been very close friends and that will never change. There is no regret. Life is about taking chances. We wanted to make this work but we have realised we work better being friends.""

HQPIHZ3OTP_O8RIHT71OBD7TEB,Ex-NATO chief says conscription of Brits necessary to stop Putin from launching WW3,Kelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter,"13:14, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ex-nato-chief-says-conscription-31973952,"The former head of Nato believes the only way to stop Vladimir Putin launching World War three is to ""think the unthinkable"" and consider bringing back conscription.
Earlier this week the head of the UK Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, said Britain should lay the foundations for a voluntary call-up if a war broke out and train a ""citizen army"" ready to fight. But now General Sir Richard Shirreff, who was a NATO chief between 2011 and 2014, says a voluntary system would not be enough.
In a letter to The Times, General Sir Richard argued it is now time to look at conscription in order to beef up the British Army. He wrote: ""Although the reserve army can go some way to reinforcing the regulars, now is the time to think the unthinkable and look carefully at conscription. To most professional soldiers (myself included), conscription is anathema. However, if deterrence is to be effective, Russia deterred and catastrophe averted, it might be necessary.""
In his letter, General Sir Richard also questioned whether the Ministry of Defence is prepared for a war of a ""scale and ferocity that would engulf the UK"" if NATO had to leap at the defence of a fellow member under attack in accordance to its principle of collective defence.
The earlier warning from General Sir Patrick, issued during a speech at an armoured vehicle conference, sent shockwaves through the country, sparking a widespread discussion on what a mass mobilisation would mean to everyday Brits. The outgoing Chief of the General Staff added: ""We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare - and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking. Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.""
Downing Street and the MoD said there was ""absolutely no suggestion of a return to conscription"". UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's spokesman said hypothetical scenarios of a future potential conflict were not helpful."

He has commanded with great distinction senior roles on the ground, managing troops in immensely complex and difficult conflicts, understanding better than most in our military machine the need for on-the-ground forces.
He is the UK's top soldier. But clearly, politics has bristled against his call to arms for the UK to get used to the idea of war and possible civilian mobilisation as our entire force is “not enough.”
He is not demanding all-out conscription, civilians ordered to sign up to the army - he is asking us to prepare for a call-up if conflict breaks out. His words are telling when he quotes “Kaiser Willhelm’s memorable and gleeful remark that dreadnoughts have no wheels.”
He calls out those who “extrapolate our maritime heritage too far,” demonstrating the need for not putting all or too much emphasis on the Navy or elsewhere. Perhaps also a pop at his boss, career Royal Navy man Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Chief of the Defence Staff.
Russia is willing to sacrifice soldiers in huge numbers - and a professional force, backed by a wave of citizen soldiers may have to stand in their way.
British forces may have the new technology but this outgoing General is sincerely reminding Westminster there will be a need for a larger number of boots on the ground. And yet again Number Ten is ignoring the experts."
I5AKSUT5XR_JIYK5388U7VQE60,Astronomers step closer to proving alien life after finding new planets beyond solar system,Ryan FaheyNews Reporter,"13:08, 24 Jan 2024Updated13:15, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/astronomers-step-closer-proving-alien-31956284,"Astronomers may be one step closer to proving aliens exist after discovering 85 possible planets outside the Solar System - and could potentially sustain life.
University boffins studied NASA data to find dozens of new planets similar in size to Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune after searching a sample of 1.4 million stars. Out of the 85 exoplanets - planets that orbit stars other than the sun - 60 are brand new discoveries with temperatures closer to those in our own Solar System.
Experts believe the climates are potentially cold enough to be able to sustain life. The out-of-this-world discovery was uncovered using data from a NASA mission called TESS (Transitioning Exoplanet Survey Satellite). Scientists have found the new planets are much cooler than most of those discovered from the original TESS mission, which launched back in April 2018.
As a result they have a ""habitable zone"" - meaning the exoplanets are in regions far enough away from their host stars and could be the right temperature to sustain life. They were found between 70 trillion (70,000,000,000,000) miles to 15 quintillion (15,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from Earth.
The new study was an international collaboration led by PhD researcher Faith Hawthorn at The University of Warwick. Using TESS, Hawthorn and her colleagues were able to observe dips in the brightness of stars, known as ’transits’, caused by objects passing in front of them. It allows scientists to identify exoplanets and determine their size.
Hawthorn said: ""The space satellite takes brightness from these stars and looks at how the planets passing in front of them causes the brightness to dip. We can look for that and find planets in this way. I hope from my research we'll not only be able to learn about all the type of planets that are really out there in the milky way but also we'll be able to learn something about how our own solar system came to be, why earth itself is so special. And it would also be nice for humanity to take a field trip one day to an exoplanet.""
Typically, at least three transits need to be seen to discover an exoplanet using TESS in order to determine how long they take to orbit their star. However, in this new study, systems that only transit twice were targeted. This results in exoplanet discoveries at longer orbital periods - which enables the discovery of exoplanets at cooler temperatures.
The 85 candidate exoplanets take between 20 and 700 days to orbit their host stars, whereas most exoplanets observed by TESS have orbital periods of 3-10 days. Researchers were keen to focus their observations on exoplanets in this region to study those at temperatures closer to our own Solar System planets.
At this stage the bodies still need to be confirmed as exoplanets, but the researchers hope that this will be achieved with future observations. Hawthorn continued: “We ran an initial algorithm searching for transits on a sample of 1.4 million stars. After a painstaking vetting process, we whittled this down to just 85 systems that appear to host exoplanets that transit only twice in the dataset. There is plenty of scope for continued research into these exoplanets - to learn more about their exact orbital periods, whether or not they have moons, and what exactly they are made of.”
Professor Daniel Bayliss, also involved in the research, added: “It’s very exciting to find these planets, and to know that many of them may be in the right temperature zone to sustain life. The project was a real team effort and involved researchers at varying stages of their careers; it’s wonderful to see it come to light. Alongside the lead researcher, PhD student Faith Hawthorn, an undergraduate student Kaylen Smith Darnbrook helped us to analyse the data during a summer project.
""It is a major achievement for an undergraduate to have their research work published, so it was a proud moment for us all. Encompassing the collaborative spirit of the TESS mission, we have also made our discoveries public so that astronomers across the globe can study these unique exoplanets in more detail. We hope this will drive further research into these fascinating exoplanets.”
Dr Sam Gill, second author of the study, noted: “Detecting exoplanets from just two transits is a clever way to find longer period exoplanets in transit surveys. It allows us to find planets that are much cooler than can be found with traditional transit searches. The study was published today (Wed) in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS)."

Mark Holden, 50, went away for a long weekend on January 18 and left his BMW at the Terminal 1 multi-storey car park at Manchester Airport and returning three days later he was horrified to find his car had been broken into. And the thieves had taken the cushions which had been made from his son's t-shirts following his death and Mark said gave him ""comfort"".
Mark said: ""My girlfriend was in the car and suddenly said 'they've taken Jay's cushions'. I was gutted... just heartbroken."" Jacob, 23, died in a horror crash in Malpas, Cheshire, on 28 October 2022. In a heartbreaking tribute, his family described him as ""a caring, gentle, kind soul who made time for everyone"", adding that he had an ""inherent goodness that is rare to find"".
Following Jacob's sudden death, Mark's mum Gillian Valentine, who works as a dressmaker, made cushions out of his t-shirts to help the family feel close to him. Mark said: ""The reason I have them in the car is because losing a 23-year-old in a road traffic accident has been really painful, and there are little things as a family we have found to help us through.
""When things like this happen it's just like a kick in the stomach. It makes you feel really sick when you think about it."" Mark told the Manchester Evening News that thieves also took the keys to his brother's car, a pair of glasses and aftershave.
He later put out an appeal for help on social media, saying he was ""distraught and absolutely disgusted"" that people could be ""so evil"". Mark added: ""The pain of Jay's sudden passing is unmentionable every day for me, but the presence of these cushions in my car gave me so much comfort while travelling and made me feel close to Jay. I put a cushion on the front seat so it's next to me. It's a little thing that helps.""
The post has been shared 16,000 times, with thousands of people offering Mark and his family kind words. Mark added: ""If I could have them back, it would mean so much. It would mean the world to me. They are irreplaceable. They're worthless to someone else, but priceless to me.""
Greater Manchester Police said the theft was reported, but no suspect could be identified following enquiries. The force said if further evidence comes to light, it will investigate. A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said: ""We are saddened to learn of this appalling theft and are working closely with Greater Manchester Police to help catch whoever is responsible.
""We take the security of our car parks extremely seriously and have an extensive CCTV network as well as a dedicated team that patrols them. Millions of passengers use our parking facilities every year and thanks to the measures we have in place incidents like this are extremely rare."""

Thomas Mills, 47, who had two epileptic seizures during the trial, began to sob in the dock after the verdicts were returned and then fell from his seat. The court was adjourned as medical assistance was given to Mills and an ambulance was called. He and his fellow defendants Brian McPadden, 61, Paul Lafferty, 42, and Jonjo O’Donoghue, 21, were all found guilty of violent disorder after a jury deliberated for six hours and fifteen minutes.
The four had been at a demonstration, said to have been organised by the right wing English Defence League, which took place outside Suites Hotel in Knowsley, Merseyside, on February 10 last year. The four defendants, all from Kirkby apart from O’Donoghue, of Liverpool city centre, had admitted being present on the night but denied violent disorder.
A fifth defendant, Daniel Fulham, 39, was found not guilty of violent disorder and of a lesser offence of abusive or threatening behaviour with intent to provoke violence. One member of the public left the court saying “you f****** bastards” after the first guilty verdict was returned.
During the trial, the court heard police were made aware on February 9 last year, that a protest was expected to take place outside the hotel, which was providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. There was “ill feeling” in the local area after a video was shared on social media appearing to show an asylum seeker from the hotel asking a 15-year-old girl for her phone number and a kiss, the court heard. The jury was told social media posts were made about the planned demonstration and leaflets were delivered.
On the Friday evening, members of a right-wing group and a left-wing group gathered outside the hotel on the outskirts of Kirkby. Detective Constable David Williams told the court at around 7pm a large group of people arrived at the scene on foot. Footage showed crowds chanting “get them out” and throwing fireworks at a cordon of police officers, as a police van burned.
Rocks and paving slabs were also thrown, with one police officer needing hospital treatment and another two suffering less serious injuries. Mills could be seen in footage standing on top of the van before it was set alight and holding a banner which said: “Let’s shout, get them out.”
McPadden was heard in the footage saying: “We protect our own, youse are not from Kirkby, we are. These are twats, the lot of them.” There was no evidence that any of the defendants were members of a far-right group. Five other men pleaded guilty to violent disorder at earlier hearings and have not yet been sentenced.
Seven youths, aged between 13 and 17, have been sentenced after they admitted violent disorder. Six were given referral orders and one was fined. Jared Skeete, 19, was sentenced to three years’ detention last April after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder, having thrown fireworks and snorted ketamine while shouting abuse at police.
Three women – Cheryl Nicholls, 44, Nicola Elliott, 52, and Jennifer Knox, 41 – were found not guilty of violent disorder halfway through the trial following a direction to the jury from judge Denis Watson KC, who said there was “insufficient evidence”."
I6AR6M15JT_MDBKAF8L4YQDM6S,Pasty Palmer spotted filming BBC EastEnders return scenes after five years away from soap,Zara WoodcockShowbiz Reporter,"18:15, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/pasty-palmer-spotted-filming-bbc-31968937,"EastEnders icon Patsy Palmer is making a huge comeback on the long-running soap after five years away.
The 51-year-old soap actress is known for her role as Bianca Jackson in the BBC soap, which earned her The British Soap Award for Best Actress. She was first cast in the role in 1993 and had many incredible storylines before she left in 1999 to spend more time with her family and concentrate on new projects.
She reprised the role in May 2002 in a special entitled, EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca. In 2005, she claimed she wouldn't return to the show but was seen back on screens in 2008. She left again in 2014 and returned for a short stint in 2019. In recent days, it was confirmed the actress would be coming back for one more short stint.
Bianca's last storyline included her being in Walford for Whitney's doomed wedding to Callum Highway. The character now lives in Milton Keynes and upcoming scenes will have Whitney Dean and boyfriend Zack Hudson visit her.
Of course, it isn't a true soap unless chaos ensues between the characters. In pictures shared with The Sun, Patsy looked right at home as she filmed on set with Shona McGarty and James Farrar. Fellow star Natalie Cassidy also joined them for the upcoming scenes.
Patsy wore a purple puffer jacket, skinny jeans and silver-heeled boots as she chatted with her castmates in between scenes. Shona's character Whitney was also seen with a baby bump as part of her current storyline. Earlier this month, Patsy discussed her return to the soap in a recent chat.
She said viewers can expect to see a much calmer Bianca – and a different Patsy from the hard-living party girl she was in the 1990s. It is five years since Patsy was last in EastEnders, and she can’t wait to return. Now living in Malibu, California, with her husband, Richard Merkell, and four children, she said: “I must admit, when I see people in EastEnders, when I go back to work it is like putting on an old pair of slippers.
""They are family. I spent more time with them when I was in the show than with any of my own family.” Patsy, who has been open about suffering from anxiety, tells the How To Own The Room podcast: “Looking back now, everything was so much bigger at the time.
“I was very young and we were thrown into the height of fame not realising there were 22 million people watching us. At some moments in all that madness back in the 1990 it would hit you and you would feel so overwhelmed and the anxiety would kick in. If you suffer from anxiety attacks, you don’t know what is happening. For me it was very environmental and about what was happening around me and what was happening in my life at that time. People see all the awards and people think it is glamorous, but it is the hardest work I have ever had at EastEnders.”

The Chiswick-based company, which runs 370 venues across the UK, told investors that sales jumped 21.6% over the five-week period around Christmas and New Year, compared with the same period a year earlier. It said the rise was driven by ""great performance"" across both its pubs and hotels.
It comes days after rivals including JD wetherspoons >Wetherspoon and Marston's also revealed a lift in festive sales as customers appeared to shrug off pressure from the higher cost of living to celebrate Christmas parties and dine out. Simon Emeny, chief executive of Fuller's, said the firm still sees the impact of the ""challenging economic environment"" but is positive about its trading future.
He said: ""I am delighted to see the business continue to deliver strong sales growth. It is testament to the hard work, dedication and energy of our amazing team members who pulled out all the stops to ensure our customers had a brilliant Christmas and New Year. The business is in great shape.""
Fuller's reported that like-for-like sales have grown by 11.5% for the financial year so far, covering the 42 weeks to January 20. The boss added that Fuller's will face upcoming rises in the national living wage and business rate property taxes, but has ""exciting plans"" to help grow the business.
""These include a number of high-profile, trade-enhancing investment schemes in our existing estate, which will ensure we continue to build on our current momentum,"" Mr Emeny said. Shares in the company moved 1.7% higher to 698p in early trading. The company said it will next update investors with its full-year results in June."
IBG1FVHYIX_GIVJMH1JC9YBHZG,'Is America stupid enough to choose Donald Trump again?',Fleet Street FoxColumnist,"13:07, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/america-stupid-choose-trump-again-31938406,"The worst national leader in history, it is widely agreed, was King John.
He lost wars, lost France, lost the Crown Jewels and frequently lost his mind in boiling rages. He starved the wives and children of his enemies to death, strangled his own nephew, and started a civil war. But out of his abominations rose Magna Carta, Parliamentary democracy, and a general presumption that such a king would never be tolerated again.
There is a reason Britain has never had a King John II. We didn't need telling twice. And, as with so many other things, like tea and socialised healthcare, it is a lesson from history which America would benefit from as it seriously considers whether to allow Donald Trump a second crack at the White House.
A fragile, narcissistic, rapist fraudster, who has diddled the US taxpayer out of more than he's ever given them is on track to be the Republican nominee. But is America really stupid enough to choose Donald Trump again?
He won in Iowa, the first state to pick a candidate, thanks largely to the weather. It had the lowest-ever turnout and by some dark magic, the win was called for Trump while the polls were still open, which meant many who'd have voted the other way just stayed home rather than venture out in -30 C temperatures.
His team have already rewritten Republican Party rules in Nevada and other places to make it easier for him to win. The sheer size of him - immense, doughnut-related personal girth aside, he acts like a media gravity well, sucking in all the available attention - means that he is polarising money and attention away from the other candidates.
Thanks to his first term, the Republican Party became a loose affiliation of the rustiest wingnuts to be found at the bottom of the toolbox, who'd happily ban books, hand out guns, build walls and other crazy-ass things the Founding Fathers would all be horrified by. It's not hard to get ahead, when the machinery's being operated by a committee of village idiots.
Now most of his challengers - a series of under-boiled eggs all about as unbearable as an Austrian holiday camp kommandant - have dropped out, leaving the only woman, Nikki Haley, still in the running. But America, one of the most blatantly-racist countries on the planet, picked a black man to be president over a female. Trump may be too cowardly to debate her, too grabby to be trusted to stand next to her, but America will still pick a sex pest pal of Jeffrey Epstein over a girl.
Unless Haley manages a West Wing-style surge to steal it away, Trump is on course - through some fairly foul and by no means fair means - to become the Republican nominee. And the fact he had to lie and lawyer his way to it won't bother him or his Trumpkins in the least. They've all forgotten that, in elections, freedom means following the rules.
Then it'll be this giant racist tangerine against Joe Biden, the incumbent president whose approval ratings are worse than Trump's were at the same stage in his first, internationally-catastrophic presidency. Although Biden's ahead in the polls, it's too narrow to guarantee victory for either of them.
In the absence of his long-awaited cardiac arrest, and with a fair wind which keeps any still-sane Republicans at bay, Trump could actually win a second term, and with it, a stay on all the prosecutions for his various crimes in and out of office. And that is why he's doing it - failure to win back the White House would not only damage that fragile ego, but it would mean that, at 77 and facing up to 20 years for stealing classified documents, he could spend the rest of his life in federal jail.
Get thee to the Oval Office, said the lawyer. And what Donald wants, Donald has always got, which is perhaps why he's still a fat racist baby.
And all this, despite the fact that Donald Trump is widely considered, at home and abroad, as the worst leader in American history. He made pals with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, destabilised NATO, admired the start of Russia's war against Ukraine, hid state secrets in his loo and frequently lost his mind in boiling rages.
He personally told people to stop counting votes that went against him, and all but demanded the nuttiest nut-nuts in America storm the Capitol and get shot for their trouble. Of course America is dumb enough to do it all again - a nation that eats cheese from a can and can watch under-10s be slaughtered at school without batting an eye about gun ownership can always be trusted to make the worst decision.
America has two fundamental problems. First, it drinks too much coffee and not enough tea. Second, nothing has changed in the American mindset since 1776. It's never reconsidered its founding principles, never asked whether a well-organised militia means the same thing as ""Wal-Mart customers"", never wondered if Benjamin Franklin, if he knew, would say ""f*** this"" and move back across the pond.
Nothing big changes without a revolution. Just as Trump's ass dimensions would alter only in the event of bariatric surgery, so the United States of Assholes will be cured only if it gets upended. And that's what the Disruptor-In-Chief is good at.
Just like King John, he has shown the flaws in the constitution, proved the system can be rigged, and that the only thing which kept the nation from worse anarchy was the fact his lieutenants kept him away from the spoons. Unlike John, his period in power is limited, and if he wins the White House again he'll only get four years before he's evicted permanently.
He sparked a riot last time he had to leave the White House - in 2028, it'll be civil war. It took one of those to form America, and a second to end slavery. Perhaps it'll need a third for the US to write its own Magna Carta, and have the rebirth it has long been in need of."

Recently, viewers saw Hannah Ashworth return to the show after 14 years away, and she was soon caught up in drama. Actress Emma Rigby reprised her role on the show, but this week viewers saw her make an abrupt exit.
Now, despite it initially being a small stint for Hannah's return, the actress has confirmed she is back full-time. Reports emerged recently that Emma had signed a year-long contract with her already filming again.
Emma herself has now confirmed she is back, and that ""unexpected"" but ""relatable"" scenes are on the way for the Hollyoaks legend. Hannah will return once more in the coming weeks and stay on the show, despite fleeing with a load of cash after being threatened by John Paul McQueen's secret lover Carter Shepherd.
Speaking about what's ahead, Emma spilled: ""I would just say it’s very unexpected which I absolutely love and I think it’s incredibly relatable and will really resonate with a lot of the audience so watch this space."" Emma also confirmed her full-time comeback, saying: ""I’m absolutely thrilled to be back. Nothing has changed at all.
""It feels like I’ve been in a time vortex like it was yesterday that I was here in a school uniform. I kind of miss the school uniform, we might have to reinstate that. It’s lovely to see all the cast and crew, a lot of the same people and then of course a lot of new people who are also lovely. It’s also funny for me to be the adult!""
With Hannah's mother Suzanne Ashworth also making a return after leaving in 2012, Emma talked of reuniting with co-star Suzanne Hall. She said: ""Suzanne is the most incredible woman. She is such as lovely human being.
""I was really close to all of my Ashworth family, we were really like a real family, so we always kept in touch. I’m really glad that I’ve come back with Suzanne, and I know she’s super excited to be back.
""We also have the new addition of the twins and that was even a shock for me that there were twins, I was like, do I have a brother and sister? Because that was when I left, so it was exciting.""

Jack Sharpe, 28, was issued a 23-month jail sentence after the bizarre stunt which landed his armed forces colleague in hospital. His pal was driving a silver Vauxhall at the time of the crash which took place on the A259 near Chichester in West Sussex.
The driver was unaware that Sharpe had pulled the handbrake, which caused him to lose control of the car on November 25, 2022. The driver, who was adhering to the speed limit, swerved over into the opposite lane and crashed head-on with a silver Hyundai.
An elderly person in the front passenger seat of the other car suffered life-threatening injuries, while the other pensioner was also injured. It has been reported that Sharpe's co-worker endured potentially life-changing injuries.
Sharpe confessed to two counts of causing grievous bodily harm, two counts of causing criminal damage to a motor vehicle, and one count of common assault. Police branded his behaviour ""inexplicable stupidity"" and said he displayed no remorse after the incident. He appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court and was sentenced on January 12, reports Metro. Investigating officer PC Tom Van Der Wee of the Sussex Roads Policing Unit, said: ""Sharpe caused a devastating collision as a result of his inexplicable stupidity.""
He added: ""He has shown no remorse or concern for those injured – a completely innocent elderly couple travelling in one vehicle and his two colleagues travelling in the vehicle he was in – one of which has had his career in the armed forces severely impacted due to the injury sustained. This case demonstrates our determination to get justice for the victims in this difficult case."""

The vessel, called Marlin Luanda, on charter to trading giant Trafigura was allegedly targeted by Yemen naval forces. Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said: ""‏Yemeni naval forces carried out a targeting operation on the British oil ship Marlin Luanda in the Gulf of Aden, using a number of appropriate naval missiles... The strike was direct, and resulted [in] the burning of the vessel.""
A Trafigura spokesperson confirmed that the product carrier, which the company operates, was hit by a Houthi missile. The spokesperson said: ""Firefighting equipment on board is being deployed to suppress and control the fire caused in one cargo tank on the starboard side. The safety of the crew is our foremost priority. We remain in contact with the vessel and are monitoring the situation carefully.""
Warships are on their way to provide assistance. The spokesperson said: ""No other vessels operated on behalf of Trafigura are currently transiting the Red Sea.""
Confirmation of the attack emerged after UK Maritime Trade Operations and two maritime security firms said a merchant ship caught fire in an attack by a Houthi missile about 55 nautical miles (102 km) southeast of the Yemeni port of Aden. Ambrey Analytics and Diaplous Group said crew members on the vessel are safe.
Since November, the Iran-backed Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.
The US and UK have launched air strikes on the group in response to its attacks, prompting the Houthis to warn they would increase their attacks on shipping. The UK and US are also targeting the Iran-backed militant group with sanctions to cut of its financial resources.
Friday also saw the USS Carney, a destroyer operating in the Gulf of Aden, shoot down an anti-ship ballistic missile that was fired in its direction from Houthi-controlled territory of Yemen"

When it comes to a relaxing city break, Reykjavik tops the list thanks to its high air quality, abundance of green space, low pollution levels, happy population and low traffic. Full of rich cultural heritage, the modestly sized settlement is home to a range of attractions bound to keep your blood pressure as low as possible, including stunning sights across the nearby Golden Circle, whale watching, and the regular displays of Northern Lights.
The city is one of the quietest capitals in the Continent thanks to the small population, the huge amount of space they can fit into and the relatively quiet road system. Icelandic people are also good at tidying up after themselves and rarely leave litter strewn around the place, according to the rankings.
While the whole population is Iceland is similar to that of Nottingham, there's plenty to see and do in the city. Hallgrimskirkja, the largest church in the country, is well worth visiting, if even just to stand outside and enjoy how it towers over the centre of Reykjavik.
Its 73-metre-high tower provides a wonderful 360° view over all the city, the mountains around and the ocean stretching west to Greenland.
Perlan the Nature Exploratorium is another of Reykjavik’s main landmarks and lets visitors learn all about Icelandic nature in a fun and interactive way that does not require leaving the city. Some highlights include a real indoor ice cave, hands-on exhibits, a life-size bird cliff and a show about volcanoes.
The Planetarium dome theatre bursts into a display of the northern lights which virtually dance all around.
If Perlan has whet you appetite enough that you want to experience the real thing first hand, then luckily the country's natural wonders are never too far away, given how abundant they are. Thingvellir National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site, is located in South Iceland, only about 45 minutes drive from Reykjavík city.
""The magical landscapes at Thingvellir are formed in the unique geographical setting of a rift valley in the divide between the North-American and Eurasian continental plates. The lava fields at Thingvellir are torn apart by tectonic forces, leaving admirable gorges and fissures,"" writes Visit Iceland.
""The most impressive of them, Almannagjá, is the focal point of the national park. A hiking path leads through the enormous cleft to the “law rock” and Öxará river, enveloped by stunning walls of basalt rocks.""
Once in the country, and when on the hunt for relaxation, it is highly advised to visit the thermal baths. Thermal hot springs are everywhere in Iceland and it is very much a way of life for the people living there.
In Reykjavik of course there is the iconic Blue Lagoon with its turquoise geothermal waters and beautiful mountain views. It also doubles up as a popular spa.
One of the best has to be Myvatn Nature Baths in North Iceland. The thermal pools here are at one end of a large and beautiful lake and are far less visited than the Blue Lagoon. This means you’ll have all the space and time in the world to wallow in its balmy waters.
The mesmerizing Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon in South Iceland is located a short drive from Iceland’s Ring Road route, not far from the town of Vik. The Glacier is connected to the open ocean by way of a lagoon, meaning you will see lots of icebergs floating in the water. It may not be the kind of place you want to take a dip in just to the water temperature, but the immersing yourself in the natural wonderment of the place is bound to be deeply relaxing.
The one thing that may make a trip to Iceland a little less relaxing is the cost. It is generally a little more expensive than London and a difficult place to spend a day exploring, eating and drinking and leaving with much left from £100.

Ahmed Fahmy is accused of using his senior position in hotels to rape or sexually assault five women over the past 15 years. According to the latest accusations, the 45-year-old raped and sexually assaulted two 18-year-old Norwegian tourists after they arrived back at their hotel in north London from a drunken night out.
Prosecutors alleged that the first offence, in 2008, happened when Fahmy was the manager of a Hilton Hotel in northwest London. Willesden Magistrates' Court also heard that several of the alleged offences also involved 'foot sucking'. The hotelier, who is now in custody but was living at a hotel in Golder's Green, North London, denies all the offences.
Prosecutor Jyothi Somavarapu told the court the earliest offence Fahmy is accused of relates back to 2008, whilst the latest is said to have occurred last weekend. Ms Somavarapu said: ""Setting out some context for this case, these matters started in 2008.
""There was a complainant staying in a flat opposite the Watford Hilton Hotel, where the defendant was working as a manager. He asked her to remove her boots - that proceeded to him massaging her feet and trying to kiss her.""
Ms Somavarapu explained that the complainant had reported this first offence at the time and that it was still in police systems, though he was never prosecuted. ""The next offence, in 2022, a lady was staying at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel,"" she continued.
""The defendant took her into a room at the hotel, where she was staying and he was working. It seems he sucked her toes. She had returned intoxicated and he sexually assaulted her. She provided a statement and this defendant denied the incident. In 2023, a complainant who agreed to support the investigation was working at the same hotel as him.
""He has slapped her bottom whilst she was on the stairs, and commented on her 'beautiful feet'. The next incident happened between January 19 and 20, involving two complainants. They were on holiday from Norway and were friends. Both were 18 years old. It seems they were raped and a similar pattern happened of sucking of toes whilst under the influence of alcohol.
""He has admitted intercourse with one of the females, but says it was consensual and denies sucking the complainants' feet."" Fahmy appeared in the dock dressed in a red hoodie and black tracksuit bottoms and spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address.
He denied one charge of rape and four counts of sexual assault. He told the court he was living at the Anchor Guest House in Golder's Green, where some of the offences are alleged to have taken place. He was denied bail and will next appear for a plea and trial preparation hearing at Harrow Crown Court next month.
Chris McGlinchey, representing the hotelier, said his client denied all the allegations, though admitted to having consensual sex with some of the complainants. Magistrates remanded Fahmy into custody before a hearing Crown Court next month."

Dylan Bragger, 15, was brutally murdered by Felipe Diglio Figueiredo in the row in which he confronted the youngster and another man over a dispute involving the bike. The 28-year-old killer, who was convicted of murder by a jury on Wednesday, had been seen on CCTV leaving his home in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, on the evening of June 29 last year.
He had just received a text claiming his motorbike which had been stolen the previous evening had been seen on the housing estate he was living on. Moments later, he subjected Dylan to the horrific attack, stabbing him multiple times in the head, chest, back, abdomen and arms.
He then went home, calling the police at 9.30pm to hand himself in. Armed officers stormed Figueiredo's home arresting him for murder.
He later denied murder at trial, claiming he stabbed Dylan ""a few times"" out of self-defence. But a jury at Preston Crown Court failed to believe his lies, finding him guilty after hearing distressing evidence about the sheer volume of Dylan's injuries.
Detectives described the crime as a ""heartbreaking tale of events"" in which a young life was ""abruptly snatched away"". Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fallows, of Lancashire Police, said: “This is an utterly tragic case in which a 15-year-old boy with his whole life ahead of him has had that abruptly snatched away.
“My thoughts are with Dylan’s family and friends at what must be an extremely difficult time. I know this is a heartbreaking tale of events that has also rocked the local community and though clearly nothing can bring Dylan back, I’m pleased that the guilty verdict will bring the family some much-needed closure.
“Knife crime has no place in Lancashire and we will do all we can to spread the message that one decision to carry a knife, like in the case of Felipe Figueiredo, can not only take a life in the most ruthless of ways, but it can also destroy your own”. Dylan's death was one of dozens of cases of children and young people losing their lives to knife crime in the UK last year.
It comes amidst mounting pressure on authorities to properly tackle the scourge of knife crime, which was described this week as an ""epidemic"" by the father of Nottingham stabbing victim, Grace O'Malley-Kumar. Felipe Figueiredo will be sentenced on Friday at Preston Crown Court where he is expected to receive a life sentence."

The 20-year-old said she had been planning her nuptials to her childhood sweetheart, 21, for three years and that her wedding was scheduled for October, but her sister got pregnant and decided to get married, with her wedding to take place first, in September.
The 'wronged' sibling was asked by her sister to see her dress, which she had bought a year in advance, she told Reddit users, and she sent a picture of it. But the next day her sister announced to the family she had got her dress, and it turned out to be an exact copy of the dress sent in the picture.
She said that once her family found out that her sister, whose 26-year-old fiancé only proposed in February, had copied the dress, they ""got mad"" at her and cut her off, while also vowing to not attend her wedding. She said: ""I have booked my venue, catering, dress, florists etc. way before my sister had announced her marriage/pregnancy. (Keep in mind she has only started her wedding planning at the start of August which meant it was kinda her own fault for not being prepared).
""When I asked her why it was the same dress as mine she replied with 'I just liked you dress so much I thought I’d reach out to the stylist I mean you looked nice but it fits my belly more than you', at this my whole family got mad. As of today, I have still planned to wear my dress and now my family has cut my sister off and I have told her that she is not welcome to my wedding – and she called me a selfish b**** who can’t handle that she looks better.""
She then said she didn’t mind that she stole the dress but hated how she tried to cover up and trick her into accepting it. She said that she tried to get her sister to change the dress but she refused and: ""So now no one in the family wants to attend her wedding and her husband's side of the family have been sending me messages calling me selfish, stupid and other words for 'ruining her wedding'. So am I the a***hole?""

However, fellow users of the site were split on whether the story was true or not because of the claimed speed at which the sister is said to have managed to get the same dress and others thought she was too young to be even getting married.
While one user backed her stance and said: ""Block them and focus on your wedding. Wear your dress and have fun on the day and make sure security does not let her in on the day. Just ignore her going forward, she has more drama to bring in future so better to stay away from her,"" another said: ""Yeah, this is made-up nonsense. She got an exact copy of your dress in a day? The entire family cut her off over said dress? Really?""
But another poster, while telling the original writer to wait to get married, also offered an explanation as to how the dress could have come so quickly, saying: ""You're way too young to get married. Wait at least five more years and use the time to look for a new dress. You can order a mass-produced dress a year in advance; it doesn’t necessarily mean that it took a year to procure/make it.
""Also if the poster just sent the image from their website, rather than a picture of her in the dress, a reverse image search would bring up the exact web page it’s from. You can walk out with a dress same-day if they have the stock and you aren’t asking for custom fit tailoring."""

The professional dancer has been taking some time off to focus on her health after being diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in May. The 33-year-old Welsh star has since had a full mastectomy and recently rang the bell spelling the end of her chemo treatment, but will still need treatment for the next five years.
In a new post shared with her 652,000 followers on her Instagram Stories, the star shared a short clip showcasing her growing hair. She said: ""Also so grateful for the hair growth so far. My eyelashes and brows are back and the hair is growing. This is for anyone going through treatment...
""Remember, like I keep telling myself 'This too shall pass.' This is 11 weeks since my last chemo.""
Amy also posted three photos showcasing the difference, with one taken on December 6, one taken on Christmas Day and one taken today (Jan 24). ""Can't believe it,"" she wrote. ""The regrowth felt so slow but looking back it's unreal and it's helping me feel more positive.""
Along with updates on her gruelling journey, Amy has been open about her heartache over the hair loss. In August, Amy posted a lengthy update on her health and shared her heartache as she noticed her hair was shedding, which can be a side effect of chemotherapy.
According to the NHS, ""some cancer treatments can make your hair fall out, but wigs, cold caps and other products are available to help you cope"". In the lengthy post, she wrote: ""Thanks for all the lovely messages, a little update on cycle 2
""Wanted to be open and honest with you all from the start. So this cycle, I started feeling sick as soon as a second lot of 'red devil' was going in. Got home very tired and started being sick ( even with all the anti-sickness) by Friday afternoon the sickness stopped and just waves of nausea.
""Still taking anti-sickness now,"" she wrote. ""Hardly any sleep due to steroids and the insomnia they bring with them. Didn't have any last cycle but some lovely mouth ulcer friends this time around. But I've managed some walks, lovely homemade soups and smoothies and feeling and feeling even better today! The little wins!""
Amy discovered the lump in her breast the day before she and her husband Benjamin Jones went on their belated Maldives honeymoon. Discussing her future plans she said: ""I just want to get myself back on that dance floor. It would be amazing to win Strictly, but winning will just be being back with the gang dancing, doing what I love in front of an audience with the people I love. I’ve just missed it so much.”

ITBU9Y5PPG_UER1H2XBD5EKRS1,Gary Glitter accused of 'total lack of remorse' towards victims ahead of parole hearing,Bradley JollyNews Reporter,"18:01, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gary-glitter-accused-total-lack-31941285,"Gary Glitter has been accused of a “total lack of remorse” towards his victims ahead of a parole hearing.
The parole hearing for the veteran performer, 79, will start later this week - but lawyers for a woman who was abused by the sex fiend when she was 12 years old have told the Parole Board he shows contempt for his victims.
The woman is suing Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, following his 2015 conviction for abusing her and two other young victims between 1975 and 1980. Richard Scorer, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon who represents her, said: “Our client has brought a claim for damages against Gadd for the appalling sexual assaults which he committed on her when she was 12 years old. This case is proceeding through the High Court.""
He continued: ""Throughout the case Gadd has refused to co-operate at all and has ignored court orders, deliberately making the process more stressful and traumatic for our client. This behaviour demonstrates Gadd’s total lack of remorse.
""We have made the Parole Board aware of his behaviour and they have confirmed that this information will be included in a report to the Parole Board panel ahead of the hearing. I hope the board take this matter very seriously as it is yet more evidence of Gadd’s lack of remorse, and contempt for his victims.""
Gadd was jailed for 16 years in 2015 for sexually abusing three schoolgirls between 1975 and 1980. His sentence expires in February 2031. He was automatically released from HMP The Verne, a low-security prison in Portland, Dorset, in February last year after serving half of his 16-year fixed-term determinate sentence.
But less than six weeks after walking free, he was taken back to prison for breaching his licence conditions by allegedly viewing downloaded images of children. In October, an application to have this month’s parole hearing in public was rejected, on the grounds that it was too difficult to contact all his victims.
The offences for which Gadd, born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, was jailed in 2015 came to light as part of Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police investigation launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Yewtree was credited for an increase in the reporting of sexual offences. Dubbed the ""Yewtree effect"", reports of sexual offences recorded by police rose 17 per cent by 2013."

King Charles today took time to visit his daughter-in-law Kate, who is on the 11th day of her own hospital stay after undergoing a successful major operation last week. They both received care at The London Clinic.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment. His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.”
And Queen Camilla looked in good spirits after visiting the King this afternoon. She declined to answer any questions from reporters as she entered a waiting car outside the hospital, near Regent's Park in the centre of the capital. The Queen had previously said her husband is “fine” and looking forward to getting back to work.
It is not known how long Charles, 75, will spend in hospital or the exact nature of his treatment. The King arrived back in London from Norfolk on Thursday afternoon ready for the procedure after squeezing in a couple of behind-the-scenes official duties.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has wished Charles the “very best” for his treatment and a “speedy recovery” afterwards, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.
He was diagnosed with the benign condition on January 17 while staying at Birkhall, Aberdeenshire, after going for a check-up because he was experiencing symptoms. The King is understood to have wanted to share the news to encourage other men to get themselves checked.
Charles, who only acceded to throne 16 months ago, cancelled engagements and was urged to rest by his doctors ahead of the corrective procedure.
The monarch has used his condition to raise awareness among men, which was partly why he has been so public about it. Searches about prostate conditions have spiked since he revealed he would need treatment. According to the NHS, signs include difficulty starting or stopping urinating, a weak flow of urine, straining while peeing or feeling like you are not able to fully empty your bladder."

Damning data also shows just 6% of all reported crimes resulted in a suspect being charged - including just one in 40 rape cases. The Government has been accused of ""failing"" victims, with around 6,000 crimes a day going unsolved.
It comes as ministers face intense pressure to deal with the knife crime epidemic, which claimed 247 lives last year. Latest data shows there were 48,716 knife offences reported to 41 of the 43 police forces in the 12 months to September - up 5% compared to the previous year. These included over 22,000 assaults using knives that resulted in injury.
Knife crime cases rose by more than a fifth in London, where 13,957 cases were reported to police - an average of 40 per day. The number of robberies which involved a blade went up by 19%, while 3,768 people were admitted to hospital with knife wounds. But knife crime overall is 5% lower than the level before Covid.

Chilling data also shows a rise in gun crime, with 6,233 offences recorded in the same timeframe. Overall there were 591 homicides recorded in 12 months, down from 651 the previous year.
Almost 200,000 sex offences, including nearly 68,000 rapes, were reported to police - up a massive 17% since 2020. There was also a 32% rise in shoplifting reports, fuelling a spike in theft cases overall, with 1.8million reports in 12 months. Robbery cases went up by 12%.
Separate data published by the Home Office revealed that just 5.9% of cases result in a suspect being prosecuted - with just 2.4% of rape cases resulting in a summons. Just over a quarter - 27.2% - of possession of weapons cases saw someone charged or summonsed, but 19 out of 20 violence cases went unsolved.
There were 8.5 million crimes overall. Experts said although this is similar to last year, it is a big drop from pre-Covid levels, with total crime reports down a massive 17%. Today's figures show a 13% year-on-year drop in fraud cases, while criminal damage is down 21%.
Addressing Home Office figures showing 2.18million cases were shut without a suspect being identified, Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservative Government has totally failed to get a handle on crime, and they have no one but themselves to blame.
Violence against the person - 5.3%
Sexual offences - 3.9%
Of which: Rape - 2.4%
Robbery - 6.3%
Theft offences - 4.9%
Of which: Residential burglary - 4.0%
Criminal damage and arson - 4.1%
Drug offences - 19.5%
Possession of weapons offences - 27.2%
Public order offences - 6.2%
Miscellaneous crimes against society - 9.9%
Total across all crimes - 5.9%
“For years, they have taken resources out of frontline policing at the expense of our communities. It’s no surprise that more and more criminals are getting away with it as victims are left without justice. This farce needs to end.""
It comes as new data showed the number of police officers in England and Wales has fallen - just months after the Government hailed a campaign to hire thousands of recruits. The headcount of officers stood at 149,164 at the end of September 2023, down 402 from the end of March.
Labour Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: “This disturbing further increase in knife crime in the last year shows how badly the Tories are failing on law and order and means that knife crime is now 77% higher than in 2015, with a devastating impact on young people, families and communities. Serious violence is rising with gun crime also increasing, yet the government just isn’t getting a grip.
""At the same time shoplifting has soared by 32 per cent in the last year alone, as criminals run rife in our town centres, and the number of cases dropped because no suspect was identified has reached record highs.""
Fraud - 3,24million cases, down 13%
Theft - 2.68million cases, up 2%
Violent crime - 894,000 cases, down 21%
Computer misuses - 898,000 cases, up 30%
Vehicle offences - 397,264 cases, up 2%
Burglary - 273,076 cases, down 2%
Robbery - 79,091 cases, up 12%
Knife and sharp instruments - 48,716 cases, up 5%
Homicide - 591 cases, down 9%
Earlier actor Idris Elba has called for a rethink in the way the knife crime problem is dealt with. The Luther star, who has campaigned to stop knife killings, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it is really important to remember that we have to figure out what happens next.
""There are young people who are carrying knives out of safety issues and different reasons, and we do not want to criminalise these people without offering them an opportunity to feel safe, to feel that their whole community is getting involved. I think that there is some critical thinking that needs to be done about how we actually implement this ban.
""I am still going to fight for youth services being bolstered, a lot more thinking between the services - the police, the hospitals and the education services having a real round-table coalition to figure out how we intervene - and how we protect."""

He said he had strangled a man in the basement of a block of flats in Johannesburg before setting his body on fire.
The man's apparent confession came while he was testifying at an ongoing inquiry into the cause of the blaze.
Police said later they had arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the fire after he had confessed to being involved in the fire at the inquiry. The man, who was not named, was facing 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder, and arson, police said in a statement.
The inquiry he was testifying at was established to look into the possible causes of the fire, and was not a criminal proceeding, making his confession completely unexpected. At least 88 people were injured in the incident in September, according to provincial health officials. At least 12 of the dead were children, and the youngest was thought to be just 18 months old.
Many of the dead were believed to be foreign nationals and possibly in South Africa illegally, making it more difficult to identify them. Non-governmental organizations stepped in to help survivors with temporary accommodation, while religious leaders also held prayer services outside the burnt-out building.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, said at the time that he believed the tragedy was partly caused by ""criminal elements"" who had taken over the building and charged people to live there. The building was believed to be home to around 200 families.
The tragedy increased public debate over the issue of ""hijacked buildings"" in Johannesburg. Herman Mashaba, a former city mayor who is now the leader of an opposition political party, criticised the government in the aftermath and said: ""We have seen the decay of this city over 25 years. It’s not something that just happened overnight.”"

The Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 had been due to land at Manchester after taking off from Singapore Changi Airport at around 2.30am this morning. However, after two attempts to touch down were missed it declared an emergency, believed to be over a lack of fuel, and instead flew south to East Midlands Airport where it landed safely.
It comes amid high winds caused by Storm Jocelyn in the area, sparking a yellow warning from the Met Office which remains in place until 3pm today. Public transport in many locations has been cancelled due to the severity of the storm. Train passengers were told there would be no journeys running north and drivers have been told to avoid the roads, and to not park near trees due to the risk of them toppling in the mighty gales.

Earlier this week air passengers described “flights from hell” as pilots struggled to land in Storm Isha's 80mph winds, as 83 planes were forced to divert to far flung places including Hungary, Germany and France as they could not land. One Ryanair plane from Manchester came within metres of touching down at Dublin Airport, only to abandon the landing and divert 500 miles to Paris, where the calmer weather made hitting the tarmac possible.
They spent more than two hours waiting on the runway in France before flying back to Ireland. One person on the flight wrote online: ""Flew from Manchester to Dublin today, only we didn't land in Dublin, or back to Manchester. Bonjour from Paris!""
A British Airways flight on its way from Ibiza to London City Airport was diverted in the winds, with nervous passengers erupting into applause when the gush-gattered plane eventually touched down. Scores of passengers were left stranded at Bristol Airport overnight as their flights were either delayed or cancelled.
A spokesman for Singapore Airlines said: ""Singapore Airlines flight SQ52, operating from Singapore to Manchester Airport on 24 January, diverted to East Midlands Airport due to high winds in the area. After refuelling, flight SQ52 subsequently departed East Midlands Airport at 11:44 and arrived safely at Manchester Airport at 12:24.
""We are sorry for the inconvenience caused. However, the safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority."
JB7CVRYKL9_XYOT8UVVWI3HO5W,Brianna Ghey's mother has no sympathy for killers as she backs them being named,Charlotte TuttonSenior TV Reporter,"08:43, 24 Jan 2024Updated09:20, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/brianna-gheys-mother-no-sympathy-31952778,"Murdered teenager Brianna Ghey's mother spoke to Good Morning Britain on Wednesday and revealed why she had no sympathy for her daughter's teen killers.
Esther Ghey remembered her beloved daughter weeks on from learning the teenaged murderers - both under the age of 18 - would be named as they both face years in prison for their crime. A court order has been in force since the two 16-year-olds appeared before a judge last February after they were charged with the crime.
The order, made under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, means that the media cannot publish any details which would lead to the two defendants being identified. Such details include their name, address, the school they attend or a picture of them.
This court order will be lifted after the sentencing due to the seriousness of the crime. Despite both teens denying details around the murder of Brianna and even pointing the finger at each other, both were convicted of her murder in December last year.
Brianna's grieving mother slammed the ""cowards"" for their lack of remorse and their behaviour in court, as she explained why she had no sympathy for the 16 year olds. She did express sympathy for their parents, as she urged others to do the same stating they too had lost their children.
Brianna was murdered in a park in Warrington, Cheshire, by the killers - currently known as Girl X and Boy Y - in a frenzied attack in broad daylight early last year. She was found with multiple stab wounds after being left to die by her attackers, who would later turn on each other and attempt to blame each other for the horrific crime they are both guilty of.
Following the killers being convicted with them awaiting sentencing, Esther spoke to GMB hosts Susanna Reid and Ed Balls about her daughter's senseless murder, and shared she had no sympathy for the killers who face years behind bars. She explained: ""I think the fact they both pointed the finger at each other shows they are cowards really, and it shows the character of each of them.
""Maybe if they had admitted it or shown a little remorse, I might have felt sympathy for them but both of them were pointing the finger and neither admitted anything. There was no emotion there. I don't feel guilty they’ve been sent to prison.""
As she backed the killers being imprisoned for ""as long as possible"", she also explained why she agreed with the decision that the teens would be named in court after their sentencing. She told the hosts: ""So my reasons for backing it is when they are 18, their names will be released anyway.
""It's inevitable, so they might as well get it all done in one go, the sentencing, revealing the names, and they can hopefully move forward and do something positive."" She also talked of it hopefully bringing some closure for her family after her daughter's death.
Esther also shared her relief over the verdict, telling the hosts: ""The only way I can describe how I am feeling is pure relief. I don't know whether justice will ever be done for Brianna."" She added she hoped her killers would ""have a backbone"" and admit what they had done. She went on: ""Knowing they are going to prison for a long time, forever in prison, is a massive relief.""
She also called for empathy for the families of the killers. She said: ""I always get emotional when I think about the parents. I saw how they were in court and how distraught they were when the verdict came through. I could see myself in them in the way I felt when I found out Brianna had been murdered.
""They’ve also lost a child, but not only have they lost a child but they have got to deal with what happened for the rest of their life now. When do we stop blaming the parents, at what age? Nobody wants their child to commit such a crime. I felt people needed to show empathy and compassion.""

JC94D5IJL6_65NJXBV999R1WYE,UK's measles surge continues as cases spike – check your area on interactive map,Zahra KhaliqNews Reporter,"09:28, 25 Jan 2024Updated15:05, 14 Mar 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/uks-measles-surge-continues-cases-31962518,"Health experts fear the measles outbreak won't resolve any time soon unless more people get their MMR jab - as one hotspot city has identified 70 cases so far this year.
Cases in the UK are almost nine times higher than the number of people infected this time last year - with 258 people infected during the first three weeks of 2024 compared to just 30 cases at the start of 2023. The UKHSA says the majority of those confirmed are in children aged under 10.
Last week, health authorities were notified of 113 suspected cases of measles in England and Wales, up from 71 the week before and 74 during the first week of January. Those are on top of 1,603 in 2023, more than double the 735 cases in 2022 and quadruple the 360 suspected in 2021.
The overwhelming majority of suspected cases identified by GPs in January have been in the West Midlands - with 70 cases in Birmingham alone, eight in Solihull, five each in Coventry and Walsall, and four in Dudley.
It comes as the UKHSA declared a ‘national health incident’ amid surging cases, with latest figures suggesting that numerous children may have missed at least one dose of their MMR jab*. Health experts have also warned of the risk of spread to other towns and cities unless urgent action is taken to increase Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination uptake in areas at greatest risk.
This week, a mum from Walsall in the West Midlands, one of the current hotspots, warned of the 'severe complications' of measles after her three-month-old son developed pneumonia and was given extra medication to avoid going blind when he tested positive for the virus.
Davina Barrett, 28, rushed baby Ezra to A&E when she noticed a red spotty rash develop all over his body on January 9th. She said the tot was initially experiencing cold and flu symptoms, which she mistook for a common winter cold.
His one-year-old brother Noah was unaffected as he had already received the MMR vaccine. Davina said: ""Noah already recieved his MMR jab, but Ezra was too young. You have to be 12 months old to get the jab.""
Urging parents across the country to vaccinate their children as soon as possible, Davina said: “I just want parents to be aware of the complications if their children were to get measles. I know a lot of people who don't vaccinate think that their child will get measles and then they'll just recover and be fine.
“But the complications are so serious. Ezra had to have a lumbar puncture, the needle that goes in the spine, to ensure he didn't have meningitis. Luckily he didn't, but he could have developed meningitis.
“The doctors also said measles can affect the eyes so he was given vitamin A to make sure that he didn't lose his eyesight. There's lots of different complications. He had diarrhoea the whole time, which was really concerning for such a little baby.
She continued: “The complications are too extreme to not take the vaccine. The reasons that some people give to avoid the vaccine, for example, they think that their child is going to get autism. They really need to research and see that those things aren't true.”
Ezra's week-long ordeal in hospital saw him receive oxygen to help him breathe due to respiratory distress brought on by the infection.
During a visit to see work to contain the spread in Birmingham last week, Professor Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “Colleagues across the West Midlands have worked tirelessly to try to control the outbreak, but with vaccine uptake in some communities so low, there is now a very real risk of seeing the virus spread in other towns and cities.
“Children who get measles can be very poorly and some will suffer life changing complications. The best way for parents to protect their children from measles is the MMR vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine give lifelong protection and it’s never too late to catch up.
“Immediate action is needed to boost MMR uptake across communities where vaccine uptake is low. We know from the pandemic that the communities themselves, and those providing services within them, will have the knowledge to best support local families to understand the risks of measles, to learn more about the vaccines that can protect them and to enable innovative vaccine delivery approaches. We need a long-term concerted effort to protect individuals and to prevent large measles outbreaks.""
Measles is known to be one of the most contagious viral diseases, belonging to the same family of viruses as mumps. For children, it is an unpleasant and potentially severe disease that starts with cold and flu-like symptoms, before developing into a rash. The NHS says receiving the MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent it.
Anyone can catch measles if they haven't been vaccinated or had it before. It can be more severe in immunosuppressed individuals, young infants, and pregnant people. In total, the illness typically lasts from seven to 10 days.
Uptake of the MMR vaccine - which is safe and protects against measles, as well as mumps and rubella - is currently below the 95.0% target in England.
Nationally, 92.5% of children had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine by the age of five in 2022-23, down from 93.4% the previous year and the lowest percentage uptake in the last decade.
But rates vary wildly across Britain. Only the North East had vaccination rates above the national target (95.5%) last year.
The latest local authority area figures show that in Birmingham, the area with the most suspected cases of measles, only 89.4% of children had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine by the age of five in 2021-22, well below the national average.
* This article was updated following a Full Fact investigation published on March 11 stating that NHS England had released an incorrect statement claiming that 3.4million children in England are “unprotected” against measles. It reported that the 3.4 million figure was actually a theoretical upper estimate for the number of children who might have missed at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. It included many children recorded as having had one MMR dose who are considered “not fully protected” as opposed to “unprotected”, and is likely also to have included some children who hadn’t missed a dose but whose records weren’t up to date. Analysis of other data provided by the Office for National Statistics and NHS England suggests the true number of children who are unprotected against measles may be much lower."
JFNW2Z8FM9_UI9J8JRTUPHZ8PR,Stephen Bear's ex-fiancee tries to erase memory of disgraced reality star as she has tattoo removed,Zoe DelaneyAssistant Showbiz Editor,"11:32, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/stephen-bears-ex-fiancee-tries-31954580,"Stephen Bear's former fiancée is continuing on her mission to wipe evidence of their relationship from her body following his early release from prison.
Before beginning his sentence inside HM Prison Chelmsford in March last year, Bear was an engaged man having proposed to his girlfriend just weeks before he was handed a 21-month sentence after being found guilty of sharing a sex tape with ex-girlfriend Georgia Harrison without her permission However, by September his fiancée Jessica Smith had dumped him over the phone as he served his time behind bars.
Jessica, 24, stood by her groom-to-be throughout his trial, promising to wait for his freedom. The Only Fans content creator even risked jail herself by seemingly filming during her frequent visits to Bear in prison. She even jokingly posted about wanting to be a prison cleaner just to stay near him during one of her visits last year.
However, Jessica is now seemingly keen to distance herself from the man she once planned to marry - with the 24-year-old continuing the painful process of removing tattoo tributes from her body. It's claimed in addition to undergoing laser removal to rid her body of two ink tributes to Bear, Jessica has also blocked the vile Celebrity Big Brother winner's phone number.
Jessica, who had an engagement-inspired tattoo inked on her ring finger following Bear's proposal, has been documenting her journey to remove the body art following her split from the convicted sex offender. After beginning the process last year, Bear's former fiancée took to social media this week to give her followers a further update on the laser procedure.
Jessica had a bandage wrapped around one of her hands as she appeared in a video shared to her Instagram page, with the OnlyFans content creator telling viewers: ""So I just had my second session of laser removal. I was putting it off because of the pain. I'm getting four tattoos removed in one session.""
She added: ""I don't even know why I was scared because it's not actually as bad a what I thought it was. Like yes, it does hurt a bit, it's just like hot oil being splattered on you. It's totally doable and I'm glad I've done it. I've got my next session booked in eight weeks time so they'll be gone soon.""
Jessica stood by Bear at the start of his prison sentence but things took a turn just a few months into his stretch behind bars as she apparently confessed to friends that she'd ""come to her senses"". According to The Sun, Jessica reportedly told her friends: ""It took me a while to realise, but it's all been fake and toxic with Stephen. I'm better off without him and I'm looking forward to moving on with my life."" She is said to have ended things with Bear over the phone and despite his attempts to call her back, she blocked his number. It's reported that she has moved on and is now in a relationship with a man called Josh.

JH06NLFM6X_VO58PDDT7KMKY9R,King Charles' family shows public support with sweet gesture after health scare,Jennifer NewtonRoyal Features Writer,"14:32, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/king-charles-family-shows-public-31964766,"A small band of royals have been showing its business as usual amid the unprecedented double health scare.
King Charles is taking a short break from public duties as he seeks treatment for an enlarged prostate while the Princess of Wales will also be out of action until at least Easter following abdominal surgery. In addition, her husband Prince William has cleared his diary to help care for his wife.
This means that it has been left to Queen Camilla, Princess Anne and Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, to be the current faces of the monarchy. And it seems that two of them, which many describe as 'secret weapons', have been secretly showing their support for the King.
In recent visits, both Anne and Sophie have been spotted wearing the same £115 chequered merino wool scarf, which is available from the King's Highgrove home shop in collaboration with the Prince's Foundation. Several other royals were spotted wearing the scarf on Christmas Day, including Lady Louise Windsor, with many believing it may have been a festive gift that the King handed out to all of his royal relatives.
And yesterday, during a visit to a school in London to discuss menstrual health, Sophie was seen wearing the scarf, while Anne sported it last week while visiting the University of Edinburgh - with many seeing it as a subtle show of support for the King. The scarf, named 'The Highgrove Heritage Scarf', is made from 100 per cent ultrafine RWS (Responsible Wool Standard) merino wool from Australia and features a design inspired by the iconic Prince of Wales check.
The dwindling number of royals carrying out engagements means that Charles’s slimmed-down monarchy has been put under pressure in a way not seen before during his reign. Joe Little, of Majesty magazine, said the health troubles have compounded the problem facing the small band of working royals.
He said: ""The working members of the royal family have been under pressure to maintain the level of engagements undertaken by a much larger team in years gone by. Suddenly removing three of the most senior players because of health issues compounds the problem considerably, but at least the King will be out of action for only a relatively short period.""
As well as Camilla, Anne, Edward and Sophie, other working royals are the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and Princess - with the latter two appearing increasingly frail in recent years. All are in their 70s and 80s except for Edward, who turns 60 in March, and Sophie, who celebrates her 59th birthday on Saturday. Prince Harry, whose controversial accusations have left the royals reeling, and disgraced Prince Andrew remain in the line of succession but both have stepped down as working royals."
JHOAG2NHKW_609AD6S0KG18AZQ,Decade-long mystery of unidentified crash victim still stumping detectives,Susie BeeverNews Reporter,"23:17, 22 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/decade-long-mystery-unidentified-crash-31943331,"Authorities are seeking answers in a case ""unlike any in history"" which has left detectives baffled for nearly a decade.
It's been nine years since an unidentified man was hit and killed in a tragic road accident in Walthamstow, London. The mystery man wasn't carrying any form of ID on him when he was found, and despite photos existing of him - his true identity has never been confirmed.
It's believed his name could be Brian Wallace, yet no family member has ever come forward. With Monday marking nine years since the man was knocked down, a charity helping families in cold case disappearances has issued a fresh plea for someone to come forward to shed new light.
The man was hit at 10.20pm on January 22, 2015, whilst walking near Walthamstow's The Bell pub. In the nine years since, volunteers for Locate International have tried ""tirelessly"" over the past six months to trace more than 400 potential Brian Wallaces, as well as people with similar names - but to no success.
The charity has his photo and knows his suspected name, what he's thought to have done for a living and even where his family is thought to be from, but are still drawing a blank. Dave Grimstead, the charity's founder and CEO, admitted they've made ""no progress"" despite ""extraordinary efforts"" to trace his identity.
""The reality remains; we have no news, no progress, and no resolution,"" he said. ""What sets this case apart is not just the tragic circumstances surrounding his death, but the extraordinary efforts of our volunteers.""
According to neighbours who knew the man as Brian Wallace, he had been working as a builder at the time and claimed to have family - and possibly children - in Sheffield and a possible sister in Neasden, London. Locate International believes he also sometimes drank at the William the Fourth pub in Leyton, and that he may have had a houseboat moored on the River Lea.
The charity said: ""Six months ago, we allocated a dedicated team of investigators to re-look at this case. Since his death, his next of kin have remained untraced, but volunteers believe there is hope yet as they have discovered the man likely had children.""
Dave added: ""The fact that we possess photographs of the man and potential first and second names makes this investigation unlike any other in our history, but we now need to look beyond these names. As we mark nine years since his death, we want to reiterate that he has not been forgotten, but we do need to look more broadly.""
The charity now wants to speak to anyone who may have met 'Brian', as well as those living in the North to come forward with details of any men they know born between 1945 and 1955 who have become estranged or unaccounted for over the years, or indeed anyone matching this man's description.
These men would now be in their 60s or 70s, the charity advises. Anyone with any information at all - no matter how small it's thought to be - is urged to come forward. Dave added: ""He deserves to be remembered and properly laid to rest, and we will not stop searching until we achieve that.""
The public is asked to reflect on family histories, neighbours, relatives, friends, ex-colleagues and contacts. If there's even the slightest chance that someone may be linked to this case, even if just to rule them out, Locate International invites the public to come forward. Information can be given by calling 0300 102 1011 or emailing appeals@locate.international. Calls can be taken anonymously."

The TV presenter, 61, has recalled the terrifying moment as she appeared on the ITV panel show a week on from the incident. She was joined alongside Kelly Holmes, Judi Love and Nadia Sawalha to discuss the day's topics. During the programme on Friday. Earlier this week Kaye revealed she suddenly lost all hearing in her right ear 'minutes' before she went live on on air.
During today's show, Kaye opened up on the scary moment as she told viewers: ""We showed you a clip of what happened to me last Friday just before we went on air. I just completely lost my hearing in my right ear."" A clip was then shown of Kaye struggling to hear the producers in her ear piece last week, where she said she could ""hear nothing"".
After the clip had finished, she told the panel: ""That's what you call a brave face because behind that I was seriously panicking. I wear hearing aids which is fine and I manage quiet well. I have got this television ear piece and then I can hear you lot with hearing aids."" She joked: ""I sometimes switch [them] off."" Kaye added: "" So to completely go deaf in this ear was terrifying.""
Kaye had taken to her social media earlier in the week where she informed her followers about the incident. She wrote: ""I was absolutely terrified, I thought, 'Oh my god, what has gone wrong? On Friday when I was doing Loose Women, minutes before we went in air, my right ear just went dead. I put my earpiece in, there was no sound I couldn't hear a thing.""
She decided to push through the show, and didn't mention her health scare to viewers. However, she became increasingly worried when she got home to Glasgow and her hearing still had not returned. The Loose Women star explained that as she became more concerned, she started to google her symptoms after losing all hearing in one ear so suddenly.
Kaye went to sleep but woke up the next morning and went straight to the hospital where she was looked after by the 'dedicated' nurses. S he was then sent for an audiogram at a nearby Boots hearing centre but was left utterly mortified when she discovered the reason behind her sudden hearing loss.
The TV star revealed that the audiologist pulled out a huge lump of wax, which was affecting her hearing. ""I mean I am embarrassed to say this because, honestly, my head was going to some terrible terrible tumour, I am very melodramatic,"" Kaye told her followers. ""Paula pulled out the biggest bit of wax you have ever seen.""

JSQUHZNH1M_TB0P1LY91WY9KAQ,ITV2 Love Island All Stars chaos as a furious Mitchel Taylor confronts Anton Danyluk,Sam Elliott-GibbsReporter,"21:43, 25 Jan 2024Updated22:29, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/itv2-love-island-stars-chaos-31970289,"The Love Island villa erupted when Mitchel Taylor confronted Anton Danyluk as a explosive 'bro code' row kicked off.
Tonight, Mitch had it out with Anton after he made some shady comments to Liberty Poole. Mitch - coupled up with the beauty - was furious after he accused him of ""clout chasing"" and claimed he is ""not to be trusted"". The guys had it out tonight and Anton was accused of taking a fool of him.
Mitch decides to speak with Anton and quickly confronted him “You are talking to Lib behind my back going against me and it’s not really bro code.” Anton then replies: “There is no bro code. There is right and wrong…I’m telling her my opinion.”
Mitch bit back saying: “Keep your nose out of my business.” Anton didn't let it go and told him: “If your girl comes crying to me asking for advice I will give her my advice. You’ve been together seven days and made her cry twice. Look at yourself, don’t look at me. Be a man, not a boy.”
Mitch wanted the last word and walked away saying: ""You're a bit of a d***. Anton, at your fine age you are very much a child."" Those others hovering around the kitchen were stunned into silence as Mitch walked away after things got very tense between them.
Viewers flooded twitter with some mixed responses. One said: ""Messy Mitch has got to be one of the best Love Island contestants ever. Nobody wants him, he wants everyone until they want him. He hates drama but he’s the pinnacle of it. He is shameless and irritating but hilarious doing it #loveisland""
Another said: ""Love the schooling Anton! Mitch needs to really check himself"" while a third put: ""Have to say, fair play to Anton telling Mitch there is no bro code, Anton is the man and Mitch is a child. Mitch thinks bro code lets him say anything, that's not how it works, you just treat people right, that's it! #loveislandallstars.""
Liberty was previously left fuming with Mitch after it was said that he'd been telling her and Demi Jones similar things. She complained: ""What has he actually done to prove to me that I am plan A? What has he done to prove to me that he’s grateful to me for picking him in the recoupling? Nothing.”

JTTAJJRO3H_PY37QIUFHSJB4EB,Vet shares horrifying reason why you should never flush your pet's poo down the toilet,Paul Donald,"12:40, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/vet-shares-horrifying-reason-you-31961494,"Some pet owners may think it's fine to put their dog and cat waste in their own toilet, but a vet has warned why this may be really dangerous to human health and why he advises against the practice. And the reason you shouldn't flush your pet's poo down the toilet is likely to leave many people feeling disgusted.
While animal lovers spend months trying to train their beloved pets where and when to go to the toilet, the UK-based veterinarian, who makes TikTok content as @Ben.the.Vet, described what happens when that poo is flushed in a recent video.
Ben's video is captioned: ""According to Anglian Water, you shouldn't flush your pet's poo down the toilet! Have you ever done this?"" Over the top of the video, he warned: ""Don't flush your cat or dog's poo down the toilet.""
The vet shows the information section for the water company and explains: ""This is the FAQ section of the website."" He says that they tell you ""no you cannot flush any type of animal faeces down the toilet."" And they say that this is due to the presence of ""toxocara"", which is a ""parasite in animal faeces which is tolerant to the high temperatures and harsh conditions found in the final stage of processing used water"".
Ben said: ""The reason toxicara is a worry is because it's zoonotic, so we can pick it up, and children, in particular, are susceptible. Humans are what is called an intermediate host for toxicara which means that we don't develop the adult worms in our intestines, but what happens is that we accidentally swallow the eggs (in poo particles) which hatch into larvae and these move around in our bodies.
""One form of this in humans is called visceral lava migrans where the larvae move around inside internal organs like the liver. Another form is ocular lava migrans, where the larvae move to the eye and cause damage to the retina, potentially leading to sight loss. There's also evidence that exposure to toxicara in childhood can reduce cognitive development and IQ.

""These conditions are thankfully rare, but worming your cat or dog regularly will reduce the chance of them shedding these eggs."" He then ended the video by saying he was interested in hearing if people do put pet poo down their toilet, and, after seeing how dangerous it can be, whether their mind has been changed and will they stop the practice.
In the comments, some people admitted that they did it, and would continue. One owner wrote: ""Yes I do, my puppy isn't house trained yet, I'm not putting it in the bin to stink out the house after I've picked it up with tissue."" Another said: ""Why is this not more advised? I've been doing it for a year or more since having one cat and then adding another and now a dog.""
Someone else commented: ""So great thanks for facts but where exactly do we put it? I can imagine throwing it in a bin it still has ways of getting into water system,"" while another used it as a chance to take a stab at the water companies themselves, saying: ""I take your point, but I believe it's a symptom of our outdated water infrastructure, tbh. I'd like to be confident my drinking water has no worms."""
K0EXOCUH85_NZEE1W0HNCLGACE,Kate Middleton's awkward conversation with mum Carole ahead of royal wedding,Emma MackenzieLifestyle Writer,"15:33, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/kate-middletons-awkward-conversation-mum-31976857,"The royal wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton back in 2011 drew in millions of viewers and global attention, but whilst the big day was still in the early stages of planning, Kate had to have a seriously awkward-sounding conversation with her mum, Carole.
The awkward moment came not long after William had proposed to Kate. He popped the question during a trip to Kenya, leaving Kate facing a tricky conversation with her mum when she got back, which she recalled during their engagement interview.
During the interview, William revealed he had gone back and forth about whether or not to ask Kate's father, Michael, for his permission before getting down on one knee and asking his longtime girlfriend to marry him.
Eventually, he opted not to, picking the forgiveness not permission route. He said: ""I was torn between asking Kate's dad first and then the realisation that he might actually say 'no' dawned upon me. So I thought if I ask Kate first then he can't really say no. So I did it that way round. I managed to speak to Mike soon after"".
When Kate was asked how her mother had taken the news, she revealed that there had been an awkward moment when she first saw her mother after the proposal, where she had no idea whether her father had already spilled the beans or not.
""We had quite an awkward situation because I knew and I knew that William had asked my father but I didn't know if my mother knew,"" Kate explained. ""So I came back from Scotland and my mother didn't make it clear to me whether she knew or not so both of us were there sort of looking at each other and feeling quite awkward about it.""
However, despite the initial uncomfortable silence, Kate said that her mother Carole was delighted when she found out Kate had got engaged. ""As any mother would be she was absolutely over the moon.""
She added that it was ""amazing to tell"" her mum the life-changing news, and added that ""obviously she was very happy for us."" Kate also spoke about how important it was to be close with her family, ""They've been great over the years - helping me with difficult times. We see a lot of each other and they are very, very dear to me.""

Kawsheen Gelzer, 39, who was also a registered sex offender with child molestation convictions, was reportedly killed and dismembered in September. His remains were then put into plastic bags and kept in a tenant's freezer.
One neighbour said ""everybody in the building knew"" about the murder. Dorothy Williams commented: ""Everybody knew he went in there and never came back out. We all talked about it."" Police records show that Gelzer had other arrests, including a two-year prison sentence for first-degree sexual abuse.

Neighbours identified Gelzer as the man found in a Nostrand Avenue apartment freezer, headless and in pieces. Heather Stines, 45, living in the flat, confessed to the police that her husband murdered Gelzer over drugs in September, then cut him up and put him in the fridge.
""It's like a terrible thing,"" Williams said. ""He didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that. You can see the ladies in the building, we're putting up pictures of him and writing stuff like, you know, 'rest in peace' and stuff like that."" A little memorial has been made for Gelzer in the building's lobby with candles and photos.
Stines, who had some small theft warrants out for her, was taken by the police and is now getting a mental health check-up after what happened. Her husband, 45-year-old Nicholas McGee, is locked up in Virginia for a fake ID case. They haven't been charged with anything about Gelzer's death yet, but Stines is someone the police are really looking at.
The police records show Gelzer was arrested five times before, including a two-year time in prison for a serious crime before he got out in 2012. After a tip-off about a body, the police went to the fourth-floor flat at 6:15am on Monday and found the body in a freezer all taped up, shared NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. On Wednesday, the crime team took nearly a dozen bags of clues from outside the flat.

K5EVFYTZ83_AVLM1NHE25A2XQ2,FRC waters down governance rules for company bosses in bid to safeguard competitiveness,Lawrence Matheson,"11:57, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/frc-waters-down-governance-rules-31937781,"The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has revealed a new set of governance rules for company directors, which are less stringent than initially proposed.
This move is aimed at maintaining UK competitiveness. The most significant change requires directors to annually confirm the effectiveness of their companies' internal controls. FRC chief executive Richard Moriarty explained that the decision was partly due to the need to balance ""supporting UK economic growth and competitiveness"" with increasing trust in governance.
The battle is on over the UK's company rules. Some people want better rules after big companies like Carillion and Patisserie Valerie failed, but others worry that too many rules will make the UK less successful. On Monday, Mr Moriarty said: ""A global reputation for high standards of corporate governance is a competitive advantage for UK plc and our revised code helps this by enhancing transparency on internal controls, but in a way that is proportionate and minimises reporting burdens on businesses.""
He added: ""The small, but important, change to the expectations on internal controls will better support boards asking the right questions at the right time to help them gain the level of the assurance they require and to be able to demonstrate good governance to investors to and other stakeholders"". Right now, bosses should check their company's controls every year.
But new rules mean they'll have to tell us how they've checked their systems and say if they're working well. Companies will also have to explain when controls don't work and what they're doing to fix it, plus any steps they've taken to sort out past problems. The new measures will kick in from January 2026, a year later than initially planned, to give firms more time to develop their approach to internal controls.
Other new requirements, set to start in 2025, include firms outlining malus and clawback provisions in directors' contracts covering renumeration. Companies will need to publish details of these clauses every year and explain how they have been used in the past year and why.
The FRC has decided against giving auditing committees new responsibility over environment, social and governance issues. It has also dropped plans to impose diversity and inclusion reporting and rules on how boards should engage with shareholders. The watchdog said the changes have been kept to a minimum to ensure expectations for effective governance are ""targeted and proportionate"".
The principle of boards having the flexibility to ""comply or explain"" will remain to ensure governance expectations are better tailored to the specific circumstances of each company, the FRC said. This means large listed companies can ignore the code requirements so long as they explain why they have done so. Mr Moriarty stated: ""It is important that the flexibility of the comply or explain principle is properly utilised.""
""The FRC is clear that compliance can mean either complying with the code provisions as set out, or providing a cogent and justified explanation for why a provision is not suitable in the specific circumstances for the company whilst demonstrating the principles of good governance.""
With plans to publish new guidance related to the rules on January 29, this change comes after Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch froze actions towards introducing legislation punctuated by governance reporting regulations. This pause is the newest in a string of hold-ups impacting reforms, relating to accounting regulation which have been anticipated since the Carillion collapse in 2018.
Julia Hoggett, Chair of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, has expressed her approval of the FRC's moderate approach. She said: ""Fundamentally, high standards of corporate governance are one of the UK's strengths, as are having principles-based regimes designed to be straightforward to implement to maximise compliance, efficacy and impact the FRC's changes to the code reflect these very principles.""
Dr Roger Barker from the Institute of Directors (IoD) also commented, saying: ""Overall, the FRC has sought to find a balance between upholding high standards of governance and ensuring the competitiveness of UK listed companies. Some of the more prescriptive proposals, which the IoD challenged in our consultation response last Summer, have been dropped.""
""Also, it made no sense to undertake a more wide-ranging revision at this time if broader reforms of corporate reporting were not being pursued by the Government.""

K5Q2U86LPR_NMJBI4GD4NIRO6U,Mum still missing a week after newborn baby girl found in Beckton shopping bag,Ryan MerrifieldNews Reporter,"11:19, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-still-missing-week-after-31963130,"The mum of a newborn baby girl abandoned in a plastic bag in East London remains missing a week later.
The tiny infant was ""less than an hour old"" when she was found in a shopping bag by a dog walker as temperatures plummeted below zero last Thursday night (January 18), investigators confirmed.
The tot was wrapped in a towel inside the bag when the member of the public found her in Beckton at 9pm. They quickly acted to keep the youngster warm and alerted authorities.
The Met Police said the child was unharmed and the person who came across her helped saved her life. Hospital staff named her Elsa. A force spokesperson confirmed to the Mirror today ""there are no updates at the moment"" as the force continues to appeal for the mum to come forward.
Speaking at a press conference in Newham on Friday (January 19), Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, said the child was not injured in any way and was now being cared for in hospital. He added she had been given the temporary name and was believed to be black or mixed race.
He said police were ""extremely concerned"" for the mum's welfare and said members of the public saved the baby's life after she was found at the junction of Greenway and High Street South. Making an appeal for the mother to come forward, Mr Crick said: “We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.
“Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station. If you are the baby’s mother, please know that your daughter is well. No matter what your circumstances please do seek help.”
At a previous police briefing he said: ""Last night we were called by a member of the public out walking their dog, who had discovered a newborn baby in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, E6. Thinking fast, that person kept the baby girl warm until London Ambulance Service paramedics arrived and checked her over before taking her to hospital. I am delighted to report that she wasn’t injured in any way and is safe and well in the care of hospital staff.
“I am grateful to the members of the public who stayed at the scene to speak with officers and medics – your actions contributed to saving the baby’s life. Our thoughts now turn to the baby mother; we are extremely concerned for her welfare as she will have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.""
Restaurant manager Tania Iurac, 25, who lives nearby, said: “My friend came home from work at around 11pm and she told me a lot of police officers were outside with a dog and the area was closed.
“I was worried. We went outside and asked the police for more information. I saw a white towel on the floor. It was clothing. It did not have blood on it or anything. The baby was not in there. There was… I would say six to eight police officers around. There were a lot of people asking questions. I am just shocked.” She said she did not know the identity of the mother."
KBHD9MOD9T_P2WL2GCHZ3EARVP,Duchess Sophie calls for tampons to be taken 'out of the closet' as she hits back at period-shaming,Russell MyersRoyal Editor,"16:05, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/duchess-sophie-calls-tampons-taken-31957387,"The Duchess of Edinburgh has said that tampons and sanitary pads should be kept ""out of the closet"" to encourage more conversations about periods in the home.
Sophie, a patron of Wellbeing of Women, today visited Harris Girls Academy in East Dulwich, London, to raise awareness of menstrual health issues. There she joined a workshop with pupils where they discussed the question ""what is a normal period?"" and learned how to get doctors to take you seriously when you ask for help.
Upon arrival, the Duchess was met by Mrs Lynn Cooper, Deputy Lieutenant for Greater London, who presented Professor Dame Lesley Regan, Chair of Wellbeing of Women and Women’s Health Ambassador. Dame Lesley accompanied the duchess during the visit and led a workshop for girls aged 15 to 18.
Tanya Simon-Hall, owner of the menstrual health education workshops Adeno Gang, held a ""myth-buster talk"", to break down the taboos. The duchess heard that some of the girls were aware of friends forced to stay at home during their periods because they couldn’t afford sanitary pads. When asked what comes to mind when talking about periods, the duchess said: ""When you have heavy periods worrying about when you stand up from a chair. That's the worst one.""
The Duchess, who had emergency surgery in 2001 after suffering an ectopic pregnancy, spoke to the girls about how period products and tampon size related to flow rather than body shape. She said: ""If you were going shopping and your friends are going for the mini and regular tampons are you going to feel self-conscious saying 'I need the big guns?' It’s not because of the size of what you are thinking 'Oh I must be really big down there'.""
She went on to say that period products should be on display at home rather than locked in a cupboard, saying: ""Let's get them out of the closet."" The duchess told three boys, who joined the group for the end of the workshop, that they were ""very brave"" for agreeing to talk about periods.
She said: ""I think bringing boys into the conversation is very important. I've been to many countries around the world and other countries seem to be more progressive."" One boy said his sister was ""very moody"" before her periods. Dame Lesley explained that this was caused by hormonal fluctuations, saying: ""Hopefully you’ll be more sympathetic now, but I’m sure you were anyway."" The duchess joked: ""Just lock the knives away.""
When asked about the period products she used, Dame Lesley said was ""happily menopausal"" to which the duchess replied: 'Ditto!' Dame Lesley, the government’s ambassador for the Women’s Health Strategy and chair of Wellbeing of Women, said that girls need to be told about menstruation at a younger age. ""Ten is now the average age that girls start to menstruate so they need to know about it earlier. Not masses of details but something to put over in a positive way.”
She added that she wanted every medical professional to ask about female patients' periods, even if they are presenting with seemingly unrelated symptoms, adding: ""The duchess was very helpful on our campaign on the menopause two years ago and now with our campaign Just a Period we hope to make it something that everybody talks about – over the dinner table, the breakfast table, in the petrol station, even. The duchess demonstrated that she is really open, receptive and, of course, she has a daughter, too."""
KD4PDI3YJL_V4LVO5KZORP8ULE,Shoplifting epidemic sees record number of thefts as ministers 'sit on hands',Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"16:32, 25 Jan 2024Updated16:40, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/shoplifting-epidemic-sees-record-number-31965989,"Shoplifting has reached record levels after soaring by more than a third in a year.
For the first time since records started there were more than 400,000 cases reported to police in England and Wales, bombshell figures show. Retail chiefs say this is ""no surprise"" as they demanded the Government tackles the epidemic.
In the year to September there were 402,482 cases, up by nearly 100,000. The Mirror is campaigning for tougher action to protect shop workers and increase police patrols on high streets.
Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed theft cases rose by 9% to 1.8million, largely the result of a 32% jump in shoplifting. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA) said: ""These figures will surprise nobody who work in retail or who owns a retail business, and alongside the increase in actual theft, we have seen significant increase also in the abuse of retail staff.""
He said he was glad the Government finally pledged to act after months of lobbying, but said: ""As always actions will speak louder than words and we hope that the new focus of the relevant authority is not too little too late as this crime epidemic remains a serious problem for many hard-working retailers.""
And Graham Wynn, of the British Retail Consortium, said: “The rise in shoplifting is alarming, especially as retailers are reporting that the nature of many thefts are becoming bolder, and more aggressive. Theft costs retailers, and ultimately customers, almost £1 billion a year, money that would be better used to reduce prices for everyone. More importantly, it is a major trigger for the abuse and assault of retail workers, of which there are over 850 incidents a day.""
Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael accused the Government of ""sitting on its hands"", adding: ""If the Conservatives were serious about stopping shoplifting, they would give up the gimmicks and commit to restoring proper community policing.”
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the 32% rise in shoplifting cases showed criminals are allowed to ""run rife"" in town centres. She said: ""Enough is enough. Britain cannot afford more of this damaging decline from the Conservatives.""
Following the release of the figures, Downing Street said ministers are looking at how to tackle shoplifting. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We'd always want to do more to combat shoplifting. I think there is work that has been done, particularly with private companies, about how we can go further to tackle this issue."""
KEH3ESGPTG_KSQ1T7D796K3I7A,Royal Mail privatisation 'a national disaster' as shareholders make £2bn while stamp prices soar,Graham HiscottHead of Business,"11:08, 26 Jan 2024Updated13:52, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/royal-mail-privatisation-a-national-31972974,"Royal Mail's privatisation was branded a “national disaster” as it emerged £2billion had been handed to shareholders while stamp prices have more than doubled.
A series of fat cat chief bosses have netted £12million between them since the controversial 2013 sell-off, during which the postal giant’s workforce plunged by 30,000. The analysis by the Communication Workers Union and the Daily Mirror comes as watchdogs this week opened the way for Royal Mail to halve letter deliveries from six days a week to as few as three.
The company has been lobbying to axe Saturday deliveries, arguing the number of letters handles has dropped significantly. Ofcom said Royal Mail could save up to £200million a year doing so, and as much as £650million for delivering letters just three days a week. Instead, those wanting important items - birthday cards, payments and forms - to arrive the next day would be forced to shell out for a revamped first class service. But it is likely to cost a lot more than the current £1.25 stamp price.
When the Tory-led coalition privatised Royal Mail in 2013 a first class stamp was 60p. Second class stamps have risen from 50p to 75p, and would likely be more but for a cap. Royal Mail’s share price initially jumped when it floated on the stock market. A highly critical report by the National Audit Office in 2014 concluded the shares were priced too cheaply, costing £750million in the first day alone.
So-called “priority investors” who had committed to stick around for the long term soon sold a big chunk of their share allocation at a substantial profit. Royal Mail staff were awarded 12% of shares. But many have sold them, reducing the employee share ownership to 5.4% of the total, Unite said.
The biggest single investor in Royal Mail parent company International Distributions Services is now billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, nicknamed the Czech Sphinx, with a 27% stake worth £700millon. Unite’s research shows Royal Mail had, as of the end of 2022, paid £1.85billion in dividends since privatisation. On top was a £200million share buyback programme that year. Between 2013 and last year, Royal Mail’s workforce had plunged from 160,000 to 130,000. Some came from workers leaving but the company has also been axing jobs.
The threat to staff, and a row over pay, led to a long industrial dispute which has reached agreement but contributed to heavy financial losses last year. Royal Mail also blamed strikes, plus the pandemic, for consistently missing delivery targets, for which was fined £5.6million by Ofcom last year. Yet Royal Mail’s fat cat bosses have continued coining it in.
The company’s different chief executives have collected almost £12million between them since privatisation. Moya Greene, who spearheaded the sell-off, got £8million alone between 2013 and 2018. The Post Office was still under her oversight as a subsidiary when she first started, during which time external auditors warned the infamous Horizon IT system could lead to “unauthorised or erroneous transactions.”
Royal Mail’s current CEO Martin Seidenberg, 50, is on a basic salary of £700,000 a year but can boost that through bonuses. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, told the Mirror: “The sad truth is that privatisation has not only been a bad political choice, but a national disaster.
It has been accepted for far too long that whole corporate figures rake in untold millions, the workers who create that wealth are treated terribly at work and the communities they serve are let down by crumbing services. The case has never been stronger to bring the postal service back into public hands and out of the hands of private equity firms who only know how to cut and wreck vital national infrastructure like the Royal Mail.”
Royal Mail declined to comment but said £4billion has been invested since privatisation, with £7.4billion in pay increases for staff in that time. Workers still represent its fifth largest shareholder group, it added. On the need to reform deliveries, Mr Seidenberg said: “Ofcom’s report demonstrates that reform is urgently needed to protect the future of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service. We are doing everything in our power to transform, but it is not sustainable to maintain a network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering seven billion.”"
KFC9D1BHPT_RNTP23VSPHTYUCK,Detective Mat Mustard's exact response to Netflix's American Nightmare exposed by director,Mia O'HareShowbiz Reporter,"12:42, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/detective-mat-mustards-exact-response-31946790,"The creators of hit Netflix series American Nightmare have shared what Detective Mat Mustard's response to the show was.
The streaming platform released its latest series last week that examines the gripping story known as the ""real life Gone Girl"". It explores the abduction of 29-year-old Denise Huskins in 2015. Yet police incorrectly felt Denise and her boyfriend Aaron's version of events sounded too farfetched and that the kidnapping was potentially a hoax thanks to its similarities to Gillian Flynn’s novel in which a woman fakes her own kidnapping.
Despite clear evidence of Denise's traumatic experience, both she and Aaron were labelled as hoaxers by the police and accused of wasting government time and resources. While Aaron was accused of being involved in the case by Detective Mat Mustard. Matthew Muller was finally caught for kidnapping and assaulting Denise and Dublin Police Department helped determine the couple weren’t lying.
The true story has been revisited in the Netflix series, however Mustard did not take part. American Nightmare directors Bernadette Higgins and Felicity Morris revealed to The Mirror how they approached the detective and Vallejo Police.
Bernadette said: ""We approached both the a Vallejo PD and the FBI and told them that we were making the series and asked them if they would be willing to give us interviews. But, we basically just got the standard formal response saying that they were declining the invitation to take part.""
She added: ""We think that's a real shame because it's kind of just turning their backs on the situation when it could have been an opportunity for them to be humble and to say 'we are fully aware of how mistakes were made and this is what we've changed since and this is how we now approach victims of crimes'.
""They could have said something which could have perhaps showed there's been an opportunity for learning here and maybe things are different now and that they've all grown from the experience. But that hasn't happened."" The director said it would have been ""great"" if the police and Mustard could have ""explained why they jumped to the conclusions that they did and helped us understand"".
Fortunately for the series, archive footage was available that showed exactly what happened in the interview rooms. Bernadette added: ""We didn't need them to give us interviews to tell us what was going on at the time. That's all very, very clear just from watching the tapes. I think it would have been really helpful for them and for us to have felt in present day that something might have been learned from that. We have to hope that's the case, but we haven't heard anything from them.""
Felicity admitted watching the interview tapes of how the police treated both Aaron and Denise was ""shocking"". She added: ""What was clear with Aaron was that they just wanted to get a confession. They weren't listening to him tell his story, which he told them over and over again. They weren't interrogating the facts very quickly. It turned into get a confession and get this guy to confess.""
Felicity admitted: ""Aaron nearly snapped under that pressure. He started to sort of disbelieve his own truth and then for us to then see that the same approach happened with Denise. You watch those tapes back and the Detective Matt Mustard, he's barely taking any notes as she's talking.
""She told him her story exactly the way that she told tells us in the series, and that's also what you know we wanted the audience to experience."" She added: ""Law enforcement came up with this theory that she was the real Gone Girl, and it was hard to watch the tapes back, especially with Denise and how they conducted those interviews. She was treated like a suspect from the moment that she walked in.""

A photo shared by US media shows Jacob and Rachel Sperber, both 75, sharing a quiet moment, sitting next to each other on a subway train, before being tragically killed over the weekend. The couple were stabbed in their Borough Park home at around 5.20pm local time on Saturday.
The 46-year-old son they cared for was taken into custody but his identity has not been confirmed by the police yet. The Sperbers were taken to Maimonides Medical Center and were pronounced dead.

Shmial Weiss, who lives in Borough Park, told CBS: ""A Jewish person killed his parents. This has nothing to do with us. Everyone is shaken. Every human person is shaken from such a story.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex looked delighted to attend the premiere of Bob Marley: One Love in in Kingston, Jamaica. Meghan stunned in a black strapless gown with her hair pulled neatly into her signature bun while Harry was wearing a black suit with an open white shirt.
The visit comes as the Royal Family has suffered a string of health emergencies. Both King Charles and the Princess of Wales are seeking hospital treatment. Princess Kate is currently in hospital while she recovers from abdominal surgery, while the monarch is set to undergo treatment for an enlarged prostate.
It's also been announced that Sarah Ferguson had been diagnosed with skin cancer, with the disease discovered after several moles were removed when she was treated for breast cancer in June. Amid the health struggles, a source has said Harry has been reminded about how short life is and plans to return to the UK.

Last night any thoughts of returning to the UK looked far from Harry's mind as he attended the premiere at the Carib Theatre and mingled with the president and CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, Brian Robbins, and his wife Tracy James. The movie is set to premiere in the UK on February 14 and ""celebrates the life and music of an icon who inspired generations through his message of love and unity,"" according to Rotten Tomatoes.
""On the big screen for the first time, discover Bob's powerful story of overcoming adversity and the journey behind his revolutionary music."" The movie stars Kingsley Ben-Adir as Bob Marley and Lashana Lynch as Rita Marley.
The last time the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were in Jamaica, they were celebrating Harry's friend Tom ""Skippy"" Inskip's wedding to Lara Hughes-Young in 2017. The couple appearing on the red carpet together comes as a shock since Meghan did not reunite with the Suits cast mates at the Golden Globes and Harry attended the Living Legends of Aviation Awards in Beverly Hills, alone. He was an honored inductee.
Reports of Harry considering a return to the UK come after Harry admitted to feeling ""homesick"" in Montecito, California. Speaking in his and Meghan's Netflix docuseries, he said: ""I miss the UK, I miss my friends."" The Sussexes left the UK after stepping back from the Royal Family in 2020 and haven't been on hand to help their family in their hour of need.
A source said Harry has been deeply affected by the recent news and said he and his wife have been in touch with the King's office to offer their support. In a statement from Kensington Palace, it was announced the Princess of Wales is ""unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter"". King Charles has also ""postponed public engagements for a short period of recuperation"".
The Duchess of York has also taken to Instagram to open up about her cancer diagnosis and thank well-wishers for their support. She wrote: ""I have been taking some time to myself as I have been diagnosed with malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer, my second cancer diagnosis within a year after I was diagnosed with breast cancer this summer and underwent a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. It was thanks to the great vigilance of my dermatologist that the melanoma was detected when it was.""
Sarah said she was ""shocked"" by the diagnosis, but ""in good spirits"". She added: ""I believe my experience underlines the importance of checking the size, shape, colour and texture and emergence of new moles that can be a sign of melanoma and urge anyone who is reading this to be diligent,"" before thanking her medical team."
KT14KRTB0W_X1YV63FDJYK2GR0,'I filmed cops clashing with miners at Orgreave - I can't believe no one died',Mark JefferiesShowbiz Editor,"19:19, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-filmed-cops-clashing-miners-31959763,"Two union officials who filmed the Battle of Orgreave during the 1984 Miners’ Strike have told how they feared someone would be killed.
National Union of Mineworkers officers Keith Brookes and Martin Harvey were tasked by boss Arthur ­Scargill with filming pickets and press conferences for a true record of events. A Channel 4 documentary series will use their footage of the confrontation on June 18 1984 at the coking works in Orgreave, South Yorkshire amidst ­allegations of heavy-handed policing.
Miners can be seen with blood pouring from their heads in the film which casts the day in a very different light from the way it was reported. TV media were all positioned behind police cordons which prevented them from being close to where batons were used on miners.
Keith said: “It was absolutely crazy. Pandemonium. And my honest view of the day, which I said at the time, is I was surprised no one got killed. “Most of the miners I saw on the day that were injured had blood on the back of their heads.
“It was hairy. Watching the film brought back very harsh memories and the brutality of the police comes out very clearly. I think the public will be stunned when they see it.”
Ahead of the three-part documentary The Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain, the pair revealed one of their camcorders was broken when the police charged the miners on horseback. Luckily they had a spare camera which they retrieved from a car.
Martin said: “You carry on filming to the point where you realise ‘we’re going to get hurt’. And you can see the [police] charge on and we end up going down the embankment. It was extremely frightening. But we didn’t run away, we got the other camera because we knew this had to be recorded.”
The series, which the Mirror ­exclusively revealed images from earlier this week, also features miners who were injured discussing what happened.
Miners were threatened with up to 25 years in prison but the cases collapsed and defence barrister Michael Mansfield called it “the biggest frame-up ever”.
Ernie Barber said he was reluctant to speak to the filmmakers because he “doesn’t trust anybody”. “Orgreave is the number one disaster in my brain,” he added. He was “cracked across the face” and insists the attack only stopped when an inspector told the policeman “pack it in or you’ll kill him”.
The film presents testimony that is sure to strengthen calls for a public inquiry. South Yorkshire Police told the programme: “It would not be ­appropriate for the South Yorkshire Police of today to seek to explain or defend the actions of the force in 1984.
“We believe the appropriate process to determine exactly what occurred, and why, would be an independent and objective assessment of materials and others available at the time.”
Asked about an inquiry, Keith said: “There is massive pressure but the Government rejected that in 2016 and my view is a Conservative government would reject it.”
Martin added: “My hope is as many people see this film as they can, it gives the miners some closure that their version is out there.”
The Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle for Britain starts on Channel 4 on Thursday at 9pm."
KVKA5NS9WD_1UKKGAVE8HM9YXX,'These tax millionaires show everything that's right - and wrong - about Britain',Fleet Street FoxColumnist,"13:54, 26 Jan 2024Updated13:59, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tax-millionaires-right-wrong-britain-31974521,"There's nothing more Scottish than taking a very English thing and making it more stupid. A lot of them still bang on about independence, for example, when their king LITERALLY took over England in 1603 and brought his bonkers witch trials with him.
But in Edinburgh this morning were a long line of pissed-off McPrats in SUVs, idling their engine at temporary traffic lights installed outside JK Rowling's home so workmen could trim her 100ft-high Leylandii hedge.
""Ah'm fewmin',"" spluttered one mum, unaware that she was indeed filling the air with benzenes, carbon monoxide, and utter guff. For JK Rowling pays more tax than anyone else in Scotland - £40million of it in the past year alone - and without that fine woman's stout refusal to engage in offshore jurisdictional shenanigans, there'd be no hospitals left to treat all the respiratory disease created by people who don't turn off their engine at traffic lights.
The Harry Potter creator needs an impenetrable hedge just as much as the King, and he didn't pay any tax last year. She can demand a military salute from the binmen, if she likes, because it's she who pays their wages. Edinburgh should be delighted she's theirs, and also take note of the fact the pruning was carefully-timed to coincide with council roadworks so as to limit the disruption.
Now let us consider one of England's richest sons, Formula 1's founding tycoon Bernie Ecclestone, who paid a whopping £652.6m in tax last year according to the Sunday Times tax list - 16 times what Rowling did.
He did so only after pleading guilty to a charge of fraud brought by the taxman after a complex global investigation which uncovered a £400m bank account in Singapore that he had denied existed.
And that case, which came to a head last year, followed another in 2008 when the taxman found he was still benefiting financially from Formula 1-linked family trusts transferred to his ex-wife when they divorced. Panorama claimed the overall tax liability was £1billion - but HMRC offered to settle with Bernie for just £10m.
Eccelstone has more than once engaged in the sort of tax avoidance which not only deprives the UK of resources, but has also been proved to be unlawful. He is well overdue a one-fingered salute from his binmen, who've had to go on strike before local authorities can scrape together the money to pay them properly. Yet he's still good ol' Bernie, the little chap with tall wives, to millions of Brits who watch Formula 1 without realising they've been stiffed.
The person who pays the most tax in Britain is a mathematician called Alex Gerko, who of course runs a City trading firm. His £664m is equivalent to paying £75,000 in tax every hour, every day and every night, for a year. Can you imagine? To this guy, it's not so much tax as a rounding error on a spreadsheet.
But there are others who really noticed what they're paying. Like boxer Anthony Joshua, born into a family of Nigerian and Irish immigrants, and raised on a Watford estate next to the M1. The former bricklayer and two-time world heavyweight champion now has a property and endorsement business turning over £129m a year, and paid £12m in tax. That's the sort of money that could fund every school in Watford. It's much less than Gerko, but strangely more impressive. Where's his parade?
The Coates family behind Bet365 paid £204m in tax, but think it through. It's money they took from mostly-poorer people with the intent of giving them nothing but disappointment and empty hope in return. The only reason their distasteful trade is allowed to breed on every High Street is because they give the government a slice of the take. It's not tax so much as bribery, and the fact it works - despite the billions it costs families, businesses, and the state in other ways - should sicken us far more than it does.
And then there's 'Sir' Tim Martin, the Wetherspoon's boss who campaigned to make Britain poorer with Brexit and has spawned a pub chain more icky, sticky, and charmless than the one that hangs from trap 3 in the gents' at Newport Pagnell services. Thanks for the £167m, Tim, but can't you sort out that smell?
Sports Direct fatso Mike Ashley paid £139.4m tax owed on the profits of selling sportswear to people who never do any sport. Ed Sheeran paid £62m for selling songs fit only for forgettable funerals. Other betting families, the owners of Primark and Specsavers are also on the list - making us appear, from the tax receipts at least, a nation of badly dressed, half-blind, gambling addicts.
John Timpson is on there, though, a man who runs 2,000 shoe repair shops and recruits 10% of his staff from prisons, the majority of whom are saved from reoffending. He's a Brexit-backing 'Sir' as well, but why aren't his views sought on government policy with the same or more frequency than the bloke who owns 'Shpoons?
The answer is that Britain has two types of people. One is rich, and tries to stay that way by paying as little tax as possible. The other sort, regardless of personal wealth, considers riches lie in people, not shiny bits of tin hoarded in a big ol' pile. People who see being a 'tax millionaire' as a loss, and those who consider it a win. It's about what you aspire to be, and who benefits if you manage it.
It is the first sort of people who form the majority of the Conservative Party, and who selected a Prime Minister whose family wealth is so vast that if the taxman ever asked him where the money is he might genuinely be able to say, as Ecclestone does, that he hasn't got a clue.
With people like that in charge of the taxman, of course they offer to settle a tax avoidance case for 1% of the tax avoided. Of course loudmouths who pushed us to Brexit get knighted. Of course we breed the sort of people who see someone cutting their hedge with a care for public safety, and consider it an imposition on their valuable time and another chance to poison the planet.
Without taxation, there is no state. No traffic lights, hospitals, binmen or cops. Just a long, awful, survival-of-the-worst, Darwinian bunfight to the bottom of the swamp, where Bernie Ecclestone is king and the only hand you get is a smack in the face. Next time they talk about tax cuts, remember this: it's a nation they're slashing to the bone."

Kate had to leave Downe House halfway through term due to severe bullying, with bullies allegedly calling her names and stealing from her.
She was said to be teased for being ""perfect, well turned out and a lovely person"", and she then reportedly moved to Marlborough College.
However, the headmistress of Downe House at the time has denied any knowledge of serious bullying. Kate, now 41, used to live at home instead of boarding, as her parent's house was nearby, which may have made it difficult for her to connect with the other girls who stayed there.
One of Kate's old school friends from Marlborough College remembered how the princess ""hated"" Downe House. They said: ""She hated it, absolutely hated it. Some of the girls there were horrible. She was picked on because she was perfect - well turned out and a lovely person. She was not the type to stick up for herself.
""She said that there was a group of girls that called her names and they stole her books and stuff – little things like that. They rounded up on her a bit because she was quite a soft and nice person...""
""When she used to go to lunch she would sit down with people and they all used to get up and sit on another table.""
Despite that, Downe House's former headmistress Susan Cameron denied knowing about severe bullying during the time Kate attended, according to the Express. In a conversation with Katie Nicholls for her book 'Kate: The Future Queen', she said: ""Certainly I have no knowledge of any serious bullying at all.
""But there's what everyone calls bullying, and there's actual, real, miserable bullying where someone had a dreadful time. That certainly didn't happen.""

KZY25O117J_J1UU9CIRMGZIRMX,Top Tory calls on MPs to oust Rishi Sunak in a brutal assault on his leadership,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"21:33, 23 Jan 2024Updated11:30, 24 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-top-tory-calls-mps-31951787,"A former Tory Cabinet minister has called on MPs to oust Rishi Sunak to avoid ""annihilation"" at the next election in a brutal assault on his leadership.
Sir Simon Clarke, who served in Liz Truss's short-lived government, called on his colleagues to give the party a ""fighting chance"" and change leader.
In a blistering attack on the PM's authority, Sir Simon described his leadership as ""uninspiring"", saying: ""Rishi Sunak has gone from asset to anchor"". ""The unvarnished truth is that Rishi Sunak is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred,"" he said.
He added: “I know many MPs are afraid another change of leader would look ridiculous. But what could be more ridiculous than meekly sleepwalking towards an avoidable annihilation because we were not willing to listen to what the public are telling us so clearly?” In response to Sir Simon's article in the Daily Telegraph, former Tory minister and peer Lord Zac Goldsmith said: ""He's obviously right"".
Sir Simon, who served as Mr Sunak’s deputy at the Treasury when he was Chancellor, last week voted against the PM's flagship Rwanda deportation Bill warning the Government's plan will fail. He said the Tories ""face an utter disaster when it becomes clear over the months ahead that it does not deliver"", adding: ""Many of us will not stand idly by and let that happen"".
Under the party's rules at least 15% of the parliamentary party - over 50 Tory MPs - must submit a letter of no confidence to start the firing gun on a possible leadership challenge. Former minister Dame Andrea Jenkyns is the only MP to have gone public so far with her call for Mr Sunak to be replaced with a ""real"" Conservative leader.
But on Tuesday evening another former Tory Cabinet Minister Sir David Davis said: ""This is getting silly. The Party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests."" He added: ""It is really about time that these people realise they have a duty to the country that is greater than their personal leadership ambitions"".
Will Rishi Sunak be replaced before the next election? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This is a failing, divided government incapable of gripping problems facing the country from the cost of living crisis to state of the NHS. More proof that after 14 years it’s time for change. Only Labour has a plan to turn the page & get our future back.""
The Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper added: “It is utterly ludicrous that the Conservative Party is even discussing installing a fourth Prime Minister without giving voters a say. The Conservatives are once again fighting like rats in a sack while families face soaring bills and an NHS crisis.
""People are sick and tired of this never-ending Conservative Party soap opera. It's time for Rishi Sunak to give voters the chance to put an end to this farce and call a general election.""
The brutal assault on Mr Sunak's leadership comes as the Tories continue to trail behind Keir Starmer's Labour in the national polls. Last week a major poll for YouGov found that the Conservatives are facing a 1997-style wipeout at the general election expected in the second half of 2024. The survey of 14,000 people indicated that Mr Sunak could hold on to as few as 169 seats with Mr Starmer entering Downing Street with a landslide majority."

Ewan Aaron Corbett, 25, fled the country before his court hearing in 2022. He was accused of being at the wheel when his friend Shane Finn, 21, died in a car crash back in 2020. After escaping the UK, he travelled to Asia and entered under a false identity. Since then, he has been photographed in Switzerland, Thailand and Vietnam.
Launching an urgent appeal for help tracking Corbett down, police were stunned to find he posted pictures of himself with a toy gun in Malaysia. Interpol has issued a red notice for his arrest - however, the suspected killer has not shied away from the limelight, making his escape public on social media with a series of topless holiday pictures.
One was titled: ""Body like Baywatch face like Crimewatch"" while another of him half naked on a boat was captioned: ""Before I disappear of [sic] the face of the earth."" Prosecutor Timothy Jacobs told a hearing at York Crown Court yesterday (Monday, January 22): ""[He] has been moving around south-east Asia, using a false name and paying bribes to get into countries. There is an Interpol red notice out on him and an EU arrest warrant.]
""However, the CPS are reluctant to commence full extradition proceedings until police can confirm an exact location for him. There is ongoing work, and intelligence officers have been looking at his social media accounts to identify a location. The Interpol warning is a step down from a warrant. If he enters any non-EU country regulated by Interpol then they have the option to arrest him, but it is not a requirement."" North Yorkshire Police also issued a plea for his arrest, saying: ""Extensive enquiries are ongoing to locate Corbett who is believed to be travelling abroad.""
Corbett, from Middlesbrough, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and driving without a licence or insurance following the death of Shane Finn who lost his life when the Audi A3 they were both in was involved in a collision on Knott Road, in the North York Moors National Park, in May 2020, reports The Star.
His posts have also included images in Vietnam and on the slopes of a snowy mountain, which he claimed was Switzerland. One of the pictures asked friends and family to send numbers so they could stay in touch.
His most recent snap claims to be taken on Penang Island, in Malaysia. Despite this, yesterday's court hearing deemed a three-day trial would take place in September of this year in his absence if needed. This case, and another allegation of dangerous driving, will both be tried at York Crown Court."
L6AKH3PPUU_A85DR6BQI246AZY,Palworld best Pals to get early guide – which Pals to catch and where to find them,Aaron PotterGaming Content Creator,"14:00, 23 Jan 2024Updated14:38, 24 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/best-pals-palworld-youre-just-31947584,"Find out which pals you should focus on catching first within 2024’s first breakout video game hit on Steam and Xbox Game Pass.
I’ll say it: you can’t hear the phrase ‘Pokemon with guns’ and not be intrigued. Palworld has been on people’s radars for a while, yes, but what nobody could have predicted was that this curious mix of sandbox survival and creature collecting would go on to become one of the biggest games on Steam ever; the Palworld Twitter account announced that in less than a week, it beat out the likes of Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy and more in terms of the highest concurrent player count of paid games in Steam history – with the exception of PUBG as the account acknowledged after it was pointed out. If you want to see what the fuss is about, you’ll surely want to know all about the best Pals in Palworld if you're just starting out and where to find them.
Catching pals in Palworld works similarly to other entries into the genre, whereby you must deplete a Pal’s health low enough to make them vulnerable to then capture them using a Pal Sphere. In a stark change to Pokemon, however, you don’t need to battle Pals using other Pals and can instead deplete their health using whatever weapon you have equipped, such as a bow. With that out of the way, here’s a brief list of the best Pals in Palworld we’d recommend catching early on.
Your enjoyment of Palworld can be incredibly reliant on which Pals you choose to put in your starter squad. After all, the traversal and combat abilities of each are all different, so it’s important not to double up on one that is already doing the job of the other. The following is a list of the best Pals in Palworld to find and catch during the opening hours.
Location: Hills northwest of the Plateau of Beginnings
When it comes to chopping the wood needed to build your first Palworld base, a grass element Pal like Tanzee is essential. Sure, you could fill this position with Lifmunk, but Tanzee is an equally great worker that gets extra points due to its ability to fire an assault rifle in battle. Its usefulness in combat, as well as in early crafting back at the Logging Site, makes Tanzee an easy recommendation for one of the best Pals to seek out and catch early on.
Location:Marsh Island, near water
Palworld is quite generous early on in that it gifts you with a glider to get around a la The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. If you want a new-and-improved glider that is far superior, however, it’s definitely worth seeking out a Celaray early on and catching it. This ability becomes available once you unlock its Partner Skill, but even before then it comes in handy back at base due to its use watering crops.
Location: The Plateau of Beginnings
If you want to be able to smash up rocks and mining early on, then Cattiva is one of the best Pals you can come across early on. These cat-like critters are much more versatile than Lamballs – the initial worker type Palworld pushes on you initially – as they are a great route to making stone an unlimited resource. Stone is needed to craft Pal Spheres so you can never have too much. This helps give Cattiva a clear edge when it comes to mining.
Location:Grassy Behemoth Hills
Finding a good mount is key to your enjoyment of Palworld early on, and you could do far worse than the awkwardly named Eikthrydeer. It’s a deer, of course, but one that is also ideal to chop down trees when you’re not saddling up to get around easier via simple riding and double jumping. Just bear in mind you’ll need to be around level 11 to complete a successful Eikthrydeer catch. Once in your party, it can be used to mow down tons of smaller Pals.
Location: Small Settlement, Grassy Behemoth Hills (most commonly at night)
The player base has already discovered that a Dark-type team is the best way to get ahead in combat early on. Daedream can be used for both transporting and crafting goods, sure, but more so than that you can use it as a turret to shoot down enemies quickly in the early game. This is Daedream’s partner skill, which is unlocked by crafting its necklace back at the Pal Gear Workbench. You’ll be demolishing wildlife without a worry in no time."

He and Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, met with leaders from Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Santander UK and the London Stock Exchange Group.
The meeting was part of a wider effort to improve competitiveness in the financial services industry. This comes after a lack of stock market listings and several listed companies leaving London markets.
The discussion took place at Downing Street, where they talked about the future of the country's economy and banking sector. Top bank bosses, including Barclays' chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan and Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn, shared their thoughts on opportunities for the banking sector and how to make the UK industry more competitive.
Last year, the Government introduced the Edinburgh Reforms, aiming to change rules in the City. These included new remits for watchdogs, repealing some EU rules to simplify listing on UK stock markets, and relaxing rules for banks. In an attempt to make the UK a more competitive financial hub post-Brexit, the Government also scrapped a cap on bonuses for bankers last year.
The new rules mean that there is no cap on the yearly bonuses given to bank and building society employees, which has led to criticisms from trade unions and the Labour Party. The Treasury stated: ""The Chancellor and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury set out that the Government would continue to engage with the industry to find new and better ways to unlock growth across the whole of the UK.""
Recently, a number of businesses listed on the top London stock markets have been bought by private investors, resulting in a quiet period for the City. The Restaurant Group was acquired by US company Apollo last year, making it a privately owned business.
Similar fates have occurred for ScS, a sofa chain, and logistics group Wincanton, both now in private hands after accepting bids. Transactions like these led to a record low of just 23 companies listing on the London stock market in 2023, the lowest since records began in 2010, according to audit company EY.
Jeremy Hunt's meeting participants, including all the banks and the London Stock Exchange Group, chose not to comment on the matter.

L8TGUZC85C_FCIX5QFIJ4UZBLO,BBC Doctor Who's new companion Varada Sethu spotted filming with Ncuti Gatwa after Millie Gibson exit,Nicola MethvenTV Editor,"09:00, 23 Jan 2024Updated16:37, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-doctor-whos-varada-sethu-31943517,"Holding hands and running full pelt at the cameras, this is the first glimpse of actress Varada Sethu as Ncuti Gatwa's new companion in next year’s series of Doctor Who.
The pair were yesterday spotted filming on Penarth Pier in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, which had been turned into a 1950s American cinema for the occasion. To make the action-packed scene seem authentic, the Palazzo theatre they created had American cars parked outside, including a ’54 Cadillac.
In the scene, the Doctor and his companion come running out of the building among smoke and rubble. Amid the chaos, the film being advertised, which is The Harvest Bringer starring Rock Hudson, loses some of its letters leaving it to spell out Harbinger - a term typically associated with doom.
The Doctor and Varada’s characters sprint through, past a sign advertising donuts. It’s thought that they have time-travelled to Miami, Florida - but filming took longer than expected thanks to the rain sweeping Wales. Locals who gathered to watch the action unfold said that earlier in the day the Tardis had been spotted on the pavement.
The cast and crew are expected to film on the Welsh pier again today, before moving on to Leominster, Herefordshire later this week. The Mirror revealed at the weekend that Varada, 32, has been cast as the 15th Doctor’s new sidekick, replacing former Coronation Street star Millie Gibson, who will exit earlier than expected during next year’s run after appearing in just a few episodes.
Now the show’s legions of loyal fans can see with their own eyes what a striking couple Varada and Ncuti make. He was wearing a smart blue suit, pink bow tie and brown spats while Varada rocked a bright yellow halter-neck prom dress with contrasting white belt, petticoat and kitten-heel shoes.
With her bright red lips and nails, and carefully curled hair, her character oozed glamour as she ran from whatever monster or alien was coming after them. In between filming, Indian-born Varada kept warm with a blanket and gloves over her dress as she shared a laugh with the make-up team.
One local fan posted: “Well, the Doctor has been to Penarth and taken the sea-front and pier back to the 1950s… I did ask if it was 1950s prices at the bar and they politely asked me to get off the road.” The filming of this series, due to air in spring next year, is likely to continue until May or June.
Filming of eight episodes plus a Christmas special typically takes seven months, with Millie’s series, which airs from May, filming last year from January until mid-July. The cast and crew then had a two-month break before Ncuti’s second season as the Doctor started shooting in September, initially without him because he was tied up with Sex Education.
Ncuti joined the crew for his first day’s filming on 23 October and series 15 is now expected to continue until the early summer. Since the action resumed after the Christmas break, Ncuti, 31, and Varada have been busy while Mille, 19, has been on holiday in Costa Rica. One insider said she had not yet left for good, but will return to “tie up loose ends” in the near future.
The decision to conclude the story arc for Millie’s character Ruby Sunday was made by showrunner Russell T Davies.

Her exit storyline is likely to answer the plot which kicked off in the recent Christmas special, in which she was abandoned by her mother. She will appear in all eight of this year's 14th series but in next year’s episodes her character is only expected to appear in three, with one of them a standalone story wrapping up Ruby Sunday’s journey with the Doctor.
A guest companion is set to star in this year’s Christmas special, and Varada’s character will burst onto the screen at the start of Ncuti’s second run in 2025. Varada is best known for her role as Cinta in Disney’s 2022 Star Wars spin-off Andor, and has also appeared in three series of Sky’s action drama Strike Back, based on the books by Chris Ryan.
In 2016 she also had a role in the second series of smash-hit drama Doctor Foster, while her film roles include Jurassic World Dominion and heist movie Now You See Me 2. The actress, who grew up in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne with her twin sister and parents who are both doctors, also played DS Mishal Ali in the BBC ’s 2017 apocalyptic drama Hard Sun.
Departing Millie has been posting pictures from her holiday in Costa Rica. After landing the role of Ruby in 2022, she said she was “beyond honoured”, describing it as “a dream come true” and calling Ncuti “fabulous”. At the time, she declared: “I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me.”

L8WC8RJW4A_REPBKQO3DYF710B,Christine McGuinness warns 'gloves are off' in Paddy divorce as she's 'had enough',Susan KnoxAssistant Showbiz Editor,"23:20, 23 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/christine-mcguinness-warns-gloves-off-31952367,"Earlier this week, it was reported that Paddy McGuinness is going up against a celebrity divorce lawyer branded a 'pitbull' in his split from Christine.
However, now it has been claimed that mum-of-three Christine, 35, has warned her ex-husband that the 'gloves are off' and that it will be an 'expensive divorce' for him following the announcement of their marriage split back in 2022.
The Top Gear presenter and model Christine, 35, went their separate ways almost two years ago, after 11 years of marriage. The former couple continue to live together and co-parent their children, who have all been diagnosed with autism, however, it has been said Paddy is likely to move out soon.
Almost two years after their shock split, it was reported that Christine is hoping to continue living in the former couple's £4million mansion. Lawyer Catherine Bedford, 52, who worked with Ant McPartlin's ex-wife Lisa Armstrong in their divorce settlement, is supposedly due to represent Christine next week.
""Christine really wanted to work with a woman during her divorce and Catherine is one of the best in the business,"" a source recently claimed. ""Christine wants to stay in the house she’s lived in as a family for many years. She’s poured many hours of love, care and attention into it,"" the insider said. They added it would be 'heartbreaking' for her to leave the home after spending years of her life there.
Ms Bedford was previously described as a 'Pitbull attorney' in American media. Her famous clients include Game Of Thrones icon Sophie Turner in her split from Joe Jonas and Dubai royalty Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in his case against Princess Haya bint Hussein.
After living a seemingly perfect life with Christine and their three young children, Paddy could now face a potentially a very expensive divorce battle with his ex. On Monday, proceedings began to formerly end their marriage, with Christine hiring lawyer Catherine Bedford.
Speaking to Mail Online ahead of the former couple's divorce proceedings, a close friend of Christine's claimed: ""The gloves are off, she was good to Paddy, she stayed at home and brought up his children while he was out earning money. It's going to be an expensive divorce for Paddy. Christine has had enough.""
It comes as Christine recently revealed she has been ""trying to carve out"" a career for her children following her split from Paddy. She said her main focus for this year will be her three kids as she adapts to being a single mum.
Speaking to The Mirror, Christine has shared how she is raising seven-year-old Felicity and twins Leo and Penelope, 10. She said: ""My main focus for 2024 is going to be on my children, they are always my main focus. Then work, work for myself and try to carve out a career so that I can always look after my children and give them the future that they want and support them and their needs for as long as possible. That's that's really where I'm at right now.""
Christine admitted that she wants to be ""more present"" and that it is something she is working on. The former Real Housewives of Cheshire star said: ""I want to try and be more present, which I'm very good at with my children. When I'm with the children, that's where I'm my most authentic self, and I'm just me. It's just me at home with the children. I'll put my phone away and I'm not on social media. I'm not even speaking to friends. I literally will spend that time with my children as I'm really seeing now that they're only little for a short time.""
The Mirror has approached Paddy and Christine's representatives for comment on this story.

Schools are desperately in need of repairs as many were built with a concrete that experts have described as a “ticking time bomb”. This has led to such a dire state in some schools, that children and their teachers are forced to work in makeshift buildings where the temperatures plunge well into single figures.
However, reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete is just the tip of school’s problems, as they face countless more issues plaguing the nation’s youth. These have left youngsters wearing their coats and gloves in a desperate effort to stay warm at school.
The Mirror was amongst the first to sound the alarm on the extent to which reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete would pose a multi-billion pound problem to the country. Reporting on how widespread it was at use in the NHS, we revealed how at first 34 separate NHS buildings were afflicted by the concrete which has a structure like “chocolate aero”.
Since then, ahead of the new academic start last year, it was shockingly revealed that a number of schools were also built with RAAC - leading to partial or full temporary evacuations. In light of this, BBC Panorama launched an investigation into the state of the RAAC-afflicted schools and how some are failing to keep children warm inside.
One primary school in Devon sees temperatures fall so low, that kids keep their gloves and hats on during lessons. The headteacher told the BBC that parts of the school were impossible to heat - but that they didn’t qualify for any extra money for repairs.
In secondary schools in Dumfries and Galloway, draughty, cold windows were taped together with sticky labels. And another school in North Yorkshire, has been forced to teach in a series of marquees held in their playground after the majority of their building became unstable after the discovery of RAAC.
Not all are RAAC however, other schools suffer from just poorly made buildings, or even asbestos ridden structures. Eight-year-old Sebastian told Panorama: ""I'm really cold. I have to wear gloves and it's really hard to use a pencil or a pen when you've got your gloves on,"".
Hettie, 10, said: ""When it's so, so cold, you start shivering, so your writing goes really wobbly when you're actually writing it because our hands are shaking so much."" One headteacher said: “This is supposed to be 21st century Britain … it’s the future of our students we’re talking about.”
Elsewhere in the chilling documentary it highlighted the dire state of the nation's schools, and how bad things had gotten for the next generation. Across the board it painted a terrifying picture of just how bad the condition of so many schools had gotten.
The Mirror, early last year, first revealed how widespread RAAC was across the NHS. At first it was known to be present in 34 buildings, but in October, amid semi-regular surveys, this figure rose to 42.
Seven of these hospitals are built almost entirely with RAAC - meaning the entire building needs replacing, landing the NHS, and government, with a vast, multi-billion pound bill.
Airedale General Hospital
Frimley Park Hospital
James Paget Hospital
Leighton Hospital
The Queen Elizabeth Hospital
West Suffolk Hospital
Hinchingbrooke Hospital
A Department of Education spokesperson said: ""The safety of pupils and staff is paramount. This Government compiled the largest and most comprehensive surveys of school building conditions in Europe– the first of its kind - to significantly improve the condition of the school estate, targeted to where it is most needed.
“We have allocated £15 billion of capital funding since 2015 for essential maintenance and improvements, including almost £470 million through the Condition Improvement Fund in 2023 to address school buildings in need of immediate support as quickly as possible. This comes on top of the School Rebuilding Programme which is transforming 500 schools over this decade."""

The Australian-born star, who became a household name after playing Wolverine in the X-Men series, retired from the role in 2017. But now, he's set to make a comeback. Despite previously saying he was done with the character, Hugh is now preparing to reprise his role in Deadpool 3, due out this July. He recently shared a video on Instagram of himself lifting weights in the gym.
In the clip, Hugh could be seen straining while doing bicep curls - his muscles bulging. He captioned the post: ""No days off - except for tomorrow. #becomingwolverineagain.""
However, fans noticed a significant flaw in Hugh's workout routine - his legs didn't seem to match his muscular arms. Fitness enthusiasts flooded the comments section, teasing Hugh for neglecting his leg workouts. ""Bro skipped legs day,"" one person commented. Another urged: ""Don't skip leg day"".
One fan wrote: ""Leg day is a thing.... right? Or CGI will fix that?"" While another joked about the actor's legs, saying: ""We all are commenting about the straws hanging from your shorts. Yes, I am referring to your legs.""
But not everyone was critical of Hugh's workout routine. Some fans were impressed, even dubbing him ""Huge Jacked Man"". One defender said: ""This LEGEND is 55 years old and people (most of them never worked out) have the audacity to tell Wolverine to work out more his legs? Come on.""
Another added: ""Wolverine is back! Great physique sir"". A third praised: ""Respect this man!!! Here he goes again!!! Building the muscles!!!"" Hugh is preparing for his 10th appearance as Wolverine in Deadpool 3. He's previously said it'll take him six months of dedicated training to get fit for the role.
During an interview on CNN and HBO Max's Who's Talking to Chris Wallace? earlier this month, Hugh, who recently finished starring in a Broadway show, explained: ""I've learned you can't rush it. I've learned that it takes time.""
""So, we have six months from when I finish [Broadway's The Music Man] to when I started filming. And I'm not doing any other work. I'm going to be with my family and train. That's going to be my job for six months."" But he revealed he's already got a head start as he added: ""I'm really fit right now. That's one thing about eight shows a week being on Broadway singing and dancing, is I'm fit. So, I'm healthy. I have a good place to start.""

Everyone has their own tea preference. Some like a proper builders brew, while others opt for something a little milkier, and there are lots of varieties - but one thing we're all in agreement with is no salt, right?
The quintessentially British drink has been around forever and we drink millions of cups of the stuff. But now American reasearchers are claiming you need to put salt in your brew for the perfect cuppa, and it's caused quite the transatlantic tension.
And if we Brits are not offended enough, the US Embassy then got involved and claimed microwaving the tea is the ""proper"" way to do it.
Thankfully expert tea makers at  Whittard of Chelsea, have mastered the art of a British cup of tea and they've curated a guide to tip-top brewing below. Americans should take note. The pros at Whittard's of Chelsea stated: ""While we encourage you to explore ways of enjoying your tea, no one brews quite like the British"".
Angela Pryce, Senior Tea Buyer, insisted that adding salt and said it ""shouldn't be necessary"". She revealed: ""While Tibetan butter tea has been drunk with 1/2 teaspoon salt in it for centuries, adding salt to reduce the bitterness of your regular cup shouldn't be necessary. If brewing methods are correct, then the tea will never taste bitter.""
Angela then added: ""It's key to always use water freshly drawn from the tap or a filter jug: the higher levels of oxygen in freshwater give your cup of tea a cleaner, brighter taste. Ensure you're brewing with water that's the correct temperature for your blend and for the correct time.""
After spending 135 years honing their technique, Whittards of Chelsea share their step-by-step below.

Kaylin Gillis, 20, was shot dead by Kevin Monahan in rural New York on April 15, 2023, after she and her friends mistook his address for the location of a party they were due to attend.
The group of friends were trying to find the party but had trouble due to poor mobile phone signal. When they realised their mistake, they tried to leave before Monahan came out of his house and fired at them twice with his shotgun. He claimed he felt threatened and that the second shot was accidental.
Sadly, the bullet hit Miss Gillis in the neck. The 66 year old man was found guilty of second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with evidence. The jury took just two hours to reach a verdict in Washington County, New York. Monahan could face life in prison when he is sentenced on March 1.

After the friends realised their mistake, he fired twice from his gun, killing the woman. His lawyers had argued the fatal shot was fired accidentally after he tripped on a nail on his porch and dropped the defective shotgun. The man had ""not shown any remorse"", following his arrest, police told the court.
The victim had been looking forward to starting college in Florida and wanted a career as a marine biologist. Assistant District Attorney Christian Morris told jurors that Monahan had ""acted out of anger"". He said: ""He grabbed his shotgun and intended to make them leave as fast as possible and he didn't care if they were hurt or killed.""
Monahan told the court that he saw a motorcycle come up the driveway and felt threatened by the presence of the two other vehicles. He told jurors that thought he was being blocked in. ""I'm nervous. Real nervous. Because cars have our driveway blocked and he's waving them up into our intimate area,"" Monahan said.
The man said he fired a warning shot but the second fatal bullet hit by accident, after he tripped over nails. ""I just feel like my soul is dead. There's just a hole in me. I took someone else's life. It's just horrible,"" he testified in court. ""I didn't mean to shoot the second shot. The gun went off.""
Speaking about the situation, Washington County District Attorney J. Anthony Jordan shared: ""This is a case where the facts really spoke for themselves. Today is certainly a difficult day. There's relief that the system works, that there's justice for Kaylin,"" he continued. ""So that's a good part of the day for them. The bad part of the day for them is they're going to walk out the door and they're still not going to have Kaylin.""

LS8L99HIIT_ZSL1SKDZT8APIVT,Israel-Gaza: 21 Israeli soldiers killed in 'deadliest attack on its forces' in Hamas war,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"07:10, 23 Jan 2024Updated07:22, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-israel-gaza-21-israeli-31943675,"More than 20 Israeli soldiers were killed in the Gaza strip in the deadliest attack on its forces of the three-month-old war against the militant Hamas group.
The reservists were preparing explosives to demolish two buildings in central Gaza on Monday when a militant fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a tank nearby, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesperson, said. The blast triggered the explosives, causing both two-story buildings to collapse on the soldiers inside.
The heavy death toll could add new momentum to calls for Israel to pause the offensive or even halt it altogether. Large numbers of Israeli casualties have put pressure on its government to halt past military operations.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead until Israel crushes the ruling Hamas militant group and wins the freedom of over 100 hostages held captive in Gaza. Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it's possible to do either.
Families of the hostages and many of their supporters have called for Israel to reach a cease-fire deal, saying that time is running out to bring the hostages home alive. On Monday, dozens of hostages' relatives stormed a parliamentary committee meeting, demanding a deal to win their loved ones' release.
Israel launched its offensive after Hamas' October 7 cross border attack that killed over 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. More than 100 were released in November in exchange for a weeklong cease-fire and the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
The offensive has caused widespread destruction, displaced an estimated 85% of Gaza's population and left over 25,000 Palestinians dead, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory. The United Nations and international aid agencies say the fighting has unleashed a humanitarian disaster, with a quarter of the area's 2.3 million people facing starvation.
The war has heightened regional tensions, with Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen attacking United States and Israeli targets in support of Palestinians. The US and Britain launched another wave of strikes Monday against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have targeted international shipping in the Red Sea in what they portray as a blockade of Israel.
The attack that killed the soldiers occurred some 600 meters from the border in Maghazi, one of three built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.
Ground operations have been focused on the camps, as well as the southern city of Khan Younis, after Israel claimed to have largely defeated Hamas in northern Gaza in operations that caused widespread destruction to that part of the territory, including Gaza City.
Dozens of Palestinians were killed Monday in heavy fighting in Khan Younis, where people dug graves in the courtyard of the city's Nasser Hospital as staff struggled to deal with the large number of wounded people, including children.
Gaza's internet and phone networks collapsed again Monday for the 10th time during the war, posing another challenge for first responders and making it impossible for people to reach loved ones in different parts of the territory.
Israel believes Hamas commanders may be hiding in vast tunnel complexes beneath Khan Younis, the hometown of the group's top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, whose location is unknown. Hamas leaders are also believed to be using hostages as human shields, further complicating any rescue efforts.
The growing death toll and dire humanitarian situation have led to increasing international pressure to scale back the offensive and agree to negotiate the creation of a Palestinian state after the war. Netanyahu has rebuffed both demands."

Indian-owned Tata Steel UK last week confirmed devastating plans to axe up to 2,800 British jobs. Most will go at its Port Talbot plant in South Wales with the closure of its two blast furnaces this year.
The Government is handing Tata £500million of taxpayers’ money to help pay for a new electric arc furnace at the site, but it is not due to be completed until 2027 and will need far fewer workers. Tata complained that it was losing nearly £1.5million a day in the UK. Yet accounts for its Mumbai-based parent company, Tata Steel Limited, show the global business is flying.
It made an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) profit of £3bn last year, analysis by union Unite shows.
Tata gave £1.4bn to shareholders from 2019 to 2023, and had reserves of £1.6bn at the end of the last financial year. Unite chief Sharon Graham said: “Tata’s pleas of poverty have been exposed as a sham. They are making money hand over fist and will only profit from bringing in more Indian and Dutch steel to the UK if we cut capacity.

“It is unbelievable the Government is going along with this. Rather than demanding the investment comes with jobs guarantees, they are giving Tata half a billion of taxpayers’ money to slash its workforce and flood the UK with foreign steel.” Tata Steel said: “As a listed company on the Mumbai stock exchange, our financial results are available on our website.”
Bosses pointed to losses of almost £135m at Tata Steel UK between July and September. That is on top of £162m of losses in the year to last March. Yet in the previous year the business made a £193m profit. Unite claims Tata has invested far less in its UK steel operations than in its European sites.
Tata is owned by Tata Sons, formerly led by Ratan Tata, 86. The empire includes Jaguar Land Rover. The closing of Port Talbot’s blast furnaces is partly to tackle pollution. Tata is pledging over £130m to help workers who will lose their jobs.

The University of Leicester NHS Trust Is asking people not attend A&E but to call 111 first. The trust posted on social media that it was currently experiencing a very high demand for services across its hospitals. By calling 111, people will be “directed more quickly and easily” to a “better place” for their needs, the trust said.
Are you at the the hospital? Are you waiting for treatment? If so, email webnews@mirror.co.uk
One local resident, speaking to the Leicester Mercury, claimed a nurse working at the LRI had informed them there were 200 people waiting in A&E at 10.30am this morning. The claims have not been verified by the trust.
NHS Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Integrated Care Board has just tweeted for people to only call 999 for ""life-threatening emergencies"". It said: ""Your local NHS is under pressure. If it’s urgent, visit http://111.nhs.uk or call NHS 111. For urgent mental health problems call 0808 800 3302 or visit a Neighbourhood Mental Health Café. For life-threatening emergencies only, call 999.""
Dr Nil Sanganee, Chief Medical Officer at the NHS in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland said in addition to hospitals currently seeing a high number of patients seeking care, there are also challenges with ambulance handovers and hospitals are struggling to discharge many patients either home or into other care settings.
However, the critical incident is not isolated to the hospitals alone - pressures are being experienced across the local health care network. Mr Sanganee apologised for the ""longer than usual"" waits for care people are currently experiencing.
He said: “This morning (Tuesday, January 23), the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Integrated Care Board declared a critical incident to help protect patient safety due to significant pressures on local services. There is currently significant demand for all services with hospitals seeing a high number of patients needing care, a challenging ambulance handover situation and limited ability to discharge patients to onward care or home.
“This means all local NHS services and particularly the Emergency Department at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and Clinical Decisions Unit at Glenfield Hospital are incredibly busy and people may have longer than usual waits for their care. We apologise to anyone affected by this.
“The safety of patients and the wellbeing of our colleagues remain our top priorities as we work together to care for the people who need us.""
He added: “We urge people to only attend the Emergency Department if they have a life-threatening injury or illness. If your condition is urgent but not life-threatening, please call 111 or use the NHS 111 online service to get advice and care in the best place for your needs.
“People can also help us is by supporting our NHS teams to get relatives home from hospital if they are medically fit to leave.”
Just last week the Mirror reported two hospitals declared critical incidents due to a ""major IT failure"" with two others also experiencing widespread technical issues. The Royal Sussex and Princess Royal Hospitals were hit last Sunday, with St Richard’s Hospital in Chichester and Worthing Hospital reporting similar difficulties.
And on Tuesday, January 9 hospitals in Nottinghamshire declared a critical incident for the second week in a row after a sudden rise in Covid and flu patients. Dr Dave Briggs, the medical director at NHS Nottingham and Nottinghamshire said at the time: ""Our acute hospitals remain under extreme pressure, so the critical incident status covering the whole Nottingham and Nottinghamshire NHS system remains in place. Although staffing levels have recovered, the increase in demand, particularly for patients presenting with seasonal and respiratory illnesses such as flu and Covid remains high."

Greater Manchester Police shared a picture of Sadiq Al-Lami, who was killed this week in East Didsbury, Manchester.. Sadiq, 30, sadly died a short time later of his injuries following the best attempts of emergency services at the scene and at hospital. An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning.
His family said: “Sadiq's warmth and love touched the hearts of everyone that he met. His love and laughter were contagious, and he was always full of life. Sadiq will be greatly missed and will never be forgotten.” Police said that his family is being supported by specially trained officers.
Police are appealing for information, including CCTV or dashcam footage, about the incident on the A34 Kingsway shortly before 1.40am on Tuesday. The victim and suspect are thought to have been travelling in separate vehicles leading up to the junction of Parrs Wood Lane to Queensway. An ""altercation"" took place at a traffic light, police added, and the suspect fled the scene in their vehicle.
Detective Inspector Alex Wilkinson, of Greater Manchester Police, said after the incident: ""We understand that an incident of such seriousness like this will cause shock to the local community and further afield. I want to provide reassurance that an investigation has been launched to understand what has happened fully and identify all those responsible swiftly. While the motive for this murder is not clear at this stage, we do believe the incident to be isolated.""
DI Wilkinson added: “I appreciate the road closures in place are impactful on people’s travel, particularly for those going to and from work or school on this route, but would ask the public for their patience and understanding as the closures are required to allow for extensive enquiries to take place safely. You may notice an increased visible presence in the area, and officers are there to listen to any concerns and assist people making travel journeys, particularly those travelling by the Bee Network at the East Didsbury tram stop.""

The motorist is seen in the CCTV footage from the stricken home in Belton, North Lincolnshire driving by through the wind and rain. Seconds later the huge roof comes clattering down and straight on to the road below, where the car had been moments before.
Security cameras on the house captured by Chris Woollas from Woollas Security, shows the incident on Sunday night as the village was battered by strong winds and fierce rain. The road has been now been closed while repairs are carried out by local workmen. The country is country being batted as Storm Isha passes across the country. You can get the latest updates here.
A rare red warning for wind was issued for Scotland until 5am while the country also has amber and yellow alerts in place by the Met Office across the country with the storm swooping in - though expected to tail off this afternoon - while agencies across Cumbria are on standby for a major incident.
A red wind warning has been issued for counties Donegal, Galway and Mayo in Ireland. A ""tornado watch"" zone has also been issued for Northern Ireland, as well as parts of Scotland and northern England by the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation. It means a ""strong tornado"" is possible in those regions.
The Met Office said: ""There will be plenty of blustery showers, these heaviest in the north and west. Remaining windy for all, although easing a little in the south later. Some sunny spells in the southeast, but still feeling chilly with northwesterly winds.""
Short bursts heavier rain were forecast in the Northwest of England and Scotland as we head into Monday evening, according to Ventusky weather maps. It could lead to powerful thunderstorms with up to 3mm of rainfall dropping within three hours. But, the sun should eventually push through the rainclouds - particularly in the south - bringing milder temperatures after last week's Arctic deep freeze.
Kent and Sussex were forecast to reach double-figures on the thermometer by mid-afternoon, whereas the north of Scotland still faces near-freezing temperatures. The Met Office added: ""Rain soon clearing from the southeast leaving a generally brighter day with sunny spells. However, the gales will only slowly ease, and blustery showers will affect the north and west."""

Davies 'hints' at Millie Gibson's possible return to Coronation Street,Zara WoodcockShowbiz Reporter,"18:40, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/doctor-whos-russell-t-davies-31959984,"Doctor Who star Millie Gibson could be returning to Coronation Street, according to Russel T. Davies and fans.
The soap actress, 19, starred as the 15th Doctor's companion Rubey Sunday in the BBC sci-fi series' Christmas Day episode last year. She's set to appear in eight episodes in the coming months but has reportedly been dropped from the show. Following the Mirror's exclusive confirming her upcoming departure, Millie was seen enjoying a holiday abroad.
It was revealed showrunner Russell wrote her out of the show. And now, she will not appear in the 2024 Christmas special and will make only a handful of appearances across Ncuti’s second series as the Doctor in 2025. Not all hope is lost as it was recently claimed she could return to the cobbles as Kelly Neelan.
She played the role from 2019 to 2022 She originally appeared in five episodes and returned as a regular in mid-2020.
In recent weeks, fans have been whispering about Millie's possible return to Corrie after hearing Russell's comments during a commentary of the Christmas Day 2023 episode. He sat alongside Millie and the episode's producer Chris May as he discussed her name being flashed across the screen in huge letters.
He went on to suggest that was what was missing from her time on the long-running soap. ""Should've had that cat and the cobbles and Millie Gibson,"" Russell explained before telling him he would talk to the ITV team about it. Meanwhile, one social media user believed Russell mumbled 'when you go back' at the end of the sentence.
The decision for her Doctor Who character to exit so soon will shock fans who expected her to stretch out her time-travelling across at least two full series. When she and the Doctor burst onto the screen last month they proved popular, with 7.3million viewers watching in the first week of release, making it one of the BBC’s biggest hits of the year.
Following Russell’s decision to write her character out, teen actress Millie filmed for three months before Christmas. She has now almost finished on the show and will only be back “to tie up loose ends” in the coming weeks, according to insiders. “Millie Gibson has all but left now and there’s a brand new companion, which is really exciting,” one said. “Russell is keeping things moving and isn’t letting the grass grow, that’s for sure.”
In next year’s series, her character is expected to appear in just three of the eight episodes, with one of them a standalone story wrapping up Ruby Sunday’s journey with the Doctor.

MAG8UCZJDB_6GP4C032TCJTIK2,Far-right activist ran downloadable library of reprehensible white supremacist stickers,James Sweetnam,"22:53, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/far-right-activist-ran-downloadable-31961142,"A far-right activist was caught running an online library of downloadable white supremacist stickers.
Samuel Melia, 34, who's been found guilty of stirring up racial hatred, spearheaded the Hundred Handers, an anonymous group that has taken responsibility for a plethora of anti-immigration 'stickering' incidents between 2019 and 2021.
The Yorkshire organiser for far-right group, Patriotic Alternative, went on trial, facing allegations of distributing controversial downloadable versions of stickers, which not only promoted 'racial hatred' but also actively encouraged those with similar views to commit racially aggravated criminal damage. The court heard, that the members of the Hundred Handers, who refer to themselves as 'hands' would use Melia's service, to print the stickers, which they proceeded to put up in public.
After taking into account all the evidence, the jury at Leeds Crown Court deliberated for three hours before finding the convicted criminal guilty on both counts.
Prosecutors confirmed that the stickers included lines such as “Labour loves Muslim rape gangs,"" “We will be a minority in our homeland by 2066,” “Mass immigration is white genocide” and “Second-generation? Third? Fourth? You have to go back.""
Melia tried to play down the idea of his stickers causing harm, claiming that he made sure they were not 'intimidatory' and were merely created as the catalyst to 'start a conversation'. Elaborating further, he added that 'stickering' is widespread, and it 'never occurred' to him that his actions could lead to criminal damage.
Speaking to the jurors, prosecutor, Tom Storey KC, alleged that the stickers, which have spread all the way from Cornwall to Northern Ireland, were used as a tool to gain the support of like-minded individuals with 'racist' views, and to “warn or intimidate members of non-Christian religions, or those from non-white races, that they were being targeted.""
Revealing the extent of the damage caused, Mr Storey explained that the stickers may have: ""Left people concerned about where it might lead, particularly given the rise in hate crimes in recent years."" Police arrested Melia in Leeds in April, 2021 under suspicion of publishing or distributing material which may stir up racial hatred.
Subsequently, they searched his property in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, and found a label printer and stickers with slogans such as “It’s ok to be white” and “Natives losing jobs; migrants pouring in."" In addition, prosecutors asserted that the man's posters of Adolf Hitler and a book written by the British Union of Fascists, Oswald Mosley, confirmed his ideology.
Melia's group amassed an astonishing 3,500 subscribers, with those committed to the group, printing off stickers and posting them on lamp posts, vending machines, public toilets, train stations, with one even stuck to the door of an MP’s constituency office.
Mr Storey said: “Also found within the defendant’s Telegram posts and chat were messages which make clear that he expected that Hundred Handers stickers would be displayed in public places, and also that he had placed stickers in such places himself. He noted that there was to be a BLM (Black Lives Matter) protest in his town, and that he was going to ‘plaster the surrounding area the night before’.”
Self-called 'pro-British, white advocate' Melia, informed the court he intended for people to put the stickers on 'places people are waiting' including lamp posts, benches and bus stops. He added: ""You go around Leeds, and there’s stickers on everything. There must be a reason people are putting them out there.""
Having been bailed until March 1 by Judge Tom Baylis, Melia will have to wait to discover his fate."

MI82SU3ZQS_KLJMZ5OO9WAIP69,'I refused to let entitled woman skip the queue – she called the police on me',Emma Rowbottom,"16:04, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/i-refused-entitled-woman-skip-31967859,"A psychiatric prison worker has told how a simple outing to collect her prescription medication at the pharmacy almost ended in a riot. After telling how her job meant she was used to 'dealing with a lot of crazy-a** people' she recounted the story of when she was waiting patiently in the pharmacy when an elderly woman asked if she could go ahead of her. With other people in front of her, she told her: ”You can go ahead of me, but you have to ask the others in line as well.”
Believing her comment to be fair and fully focusing on picking up her medication, she was ‘shocked and stunned’ when the woman started screaming at her: “I turned to her and said: ""You are harassing me. Do we need to get the police involved?"" (In my line of work I am trained to be direct about that sort of thing),” she said.
With her comments adding fuel to the pharmacy queue fire, the elderly lady said she’d happily call the police: “I said: ‘Okay, sure. Call them. I actively encourage you to do so. In fact, I will wait here after I get my medical to ensure the police get the story straight.”

The woman went on to say that the police turned up, clearly furious at the waste of their time: “‘Karen’ gets a long lecture from a very large man about the context of when she should call the police. She is informed that me not letting her budge in line and what she calls ‘bad customer service’ is not a reason to involve them,"" she revealed. She also said she felt guilty for the pharmacist: “I know he is an innocent victim in all this and that if I let ‘Karen' ahead of me, his problems might not exist.”
With the police officer choosing to abruptly remove the lady from the pharmacy, she continued: “She was audibly angry and asking the officer how she can get her medication if she's banned from the store. I don't know Karen! Maybe have them transferred to a different pharmacy and behave like an actual human being there?” she said, feeling relieved for getting the pharmaceutical predicament off her chest.
Many Reddit readers had worked in a pharmacy before, with some admitting the story had given them flashbacks: “Five years as a retail pharmacy tech, said one: ""Now I’m having some PTSD flashbacks,” while another agreed, commenting: “Pharmacy worker here. You have no idea.” “I worked in a pharmacy for four years. The stories I could tell,"" said another reader, while one said the woman was her hero: “It's very unlikely that Karen learned anything from this encounter though.”
“This is fabulous!” exclaimed one: “The trash easily took herself out!” One person commented that the reason they use an online pharmacy home delivery system now was because of people like her: “I used to hate having to pick up my prescription because of people like Karen. I'm assuming that this Karen is a serial offender, as this isn't something people only do once. Don’t f*** with people who dispense your meds.”"

Storm Jocelyn is expected to hit early on Tuesday just hours after the end of Storm Isha, which has brought 80mph winds and claimed the lives of five people in the UK and Ireland since the weekend.
Strong winds and rain are forecast for northern, central and western parts of the UK, with multiple yellow and amber warnings issued by the Met Office for the next 48 hours.
Wintry conditions are also likely to add to the trouble, and motorists in the far north are being warned of hazardous conditions on untreated icy roads on Tuesday morning.
Weather maps from WXCharts then show this being followed by another round of heavy rain, which will also fall as snow in a number of areas.
The new front from the Atlantic is forecast to arrive late on Thursday, bringing rain across the breadth of the nation, while an area stretching from northwest England to the Scottish Highlands is forecast to see 2cm of snow an hour early on Friday. Torrential rain and some snow will continue to sweep in Scotland into Sunday, according to the maps, before things clear up for the beginning of next week.
Giving the Met Office's latest forecast for Storm Jocelyn and into the rest of the week, Chief Meteorologist, Steve Willington, said: ""Although this system will be a step down relative to Storm Isha, with the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn. Outbreaks of heavy rain on Tuesday could bring rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20 mm quite widely with 40 to 50 mm over higher ground in southwest Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northwest England.
""Wind gusts are expected to reach 55 to 65 mph across northwestern Scotland while there is potential for winds to gust to 75 to 80 mph in a few places, in particular exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal northwest Scotland early on Wednesday morning.
""The winds will gradually ease through the Wednesday and as we head through the rest of the week the weather continues to look changeable, with the drier and most settled conditions towards the south and east, and the most unsettled (wettest and windiest) conditions expected in the northwest. Temperatures are expected to remain mild or close to average for the time of year.""

MOGSH99Q63_5S1XCGFRESNF6YB,Woman asks 'how people are surviving' after seeing price of her Aldi food shop,Danielle Kate WroeLifestyle Writer,"15:32, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/woman-asks-how-people-surviving-31944232,"There's no denying that supermarket shop prices have gone up rather significantly in the past few years, but one woman was left horrified at just how little she got for the amount she spent.
After popping into Aldi for some bits, Leah Nicole, 32, who makes content on her account @whodareswins_ was gobsmacked at the total she had to pay, claiming that ""something has to change"". In the caption of her video, she wrote: ""This cost of living and prices going up is mad. I need to try and make some cuts somewhere"", and explained she'd come to this realisation after her total was £78.
""£78 I've just spent in Aldi, on basically naff all"", Leah fumed. At the top of her video, she wrote: ""I can't keep spending this much, how are we surviving?!""
She said she was ""really p**sed off"" with how much money she spent on so little. ""All I have got is dinner, which is a roast dinner, packed lunch bits that will last two, maybe three, days"", she shared. ""Granted, I did get top-up bits like milk, bread, cheese, a bottle of Pepsi Max and some fabric conditioner - but like, nothing crazy, I stuck to exactly what I needed, and what the f**k.""
Leah said that she couldn't ""carry on spending this much money on food shopping"", explaining that for the money she spent she didn't even get cleaning products, deodorant, or essentials like that. ""It's literally like a day's dinner and packed lunch bits"", she fumed.
Leah then realised that she was ""not the only one"" suffering like this and offered to make some videos about budget meal plans. ""I cannot have another month like this"", she raged. She even said that she was meant to be going to London soon, but was struggling to justify £20 on train fare and £20 on food and drink because ""that money could be food shopping money.""
Leah told The Mirror that she was ""taken aback"" when she was told how much her shop would cost. She said: ""I was quite taken aback as I didn't think it would come to that much, hence the car rant. I've had a few comments saying 'Where have I been for the past 18 months?' but I have been feeling the cost of living crisis just like everyone else.
""I too have felt like every time I've gone shopping the prices are rising it's something we've all had to just suck up. It was more thinking of others that got me. I'm lucky to be able to afford my food shop, others aren't. It just made me step back and think that for nearly £80 I've got what feels like barely anything so how on earth is everyone surviving. It wasn't a rant at Aldi it was a frustration that we aren't getting much for our money these days and that's just basic living.""
Leah said that she's glad to get a ""conversation going"" surrounding the cost of living issue, and she thinks that people have found comfort in the fact that they're ""not alone"" in finding things more expensive. ""I've shopped in Aldi for years, it has always been my go-to for a big full shop"", Leah shared. ""I noticed things double in price since the cost of living if not triple. I used to be able to get a big full trolley-worth for around £100 and that lasted ages. I'd barely get a week's worth for that now.""
The mum of two said that her weekly shop costs around £200 now, and that's ""without luxury food items."" She said she ""could make cuts"", and that's why she's keen to do budget content and cheap meal ideas on her TikTok channel. ""I've almost been stubborn in keeping to my usual items"", she admitted, sharing: ""My usual shopping has doubled and I can't keep up with that so I must make some changes where possible.""
Speaking about making your money go further, Leah said: ""When I've needed to budget in the past meal planning was the way forward and I will be implementing that now again. Bulking meals out with veg is always a good one as it stretches it out for more portions. My mum used to make an amazing chicken soup using the leftover meat and bones from a roast, that is a great shout for really getting your money's worth.
""It feels like nothing really is good for value anymore. Bulk buying is a good option but how many people these days have extra cash to do a huge bulk buy shop? People have such a small amount for food shopping now due to the price increase.""
In the comments of her video, others agreed that food shopping prices had gone through the roof, with one woman raging: ""All our wages seem to go on bills and food!"" Leah responded: ""It's the same here! The only thing I get myself is my lashes and even that I'm like do I need to stop that too at this rate!""
Another person commented: ""I very rarely go into Aldi anymore as I feel it's the supermarket that has increased its prices the most! M&S/Sainsburys is the way forward for me."" Someone else disagreed, however, saying they were still managing to get bargains, sharing: ""I must be doing something different, I get five meals for a week, all the ingredients, stuff for packed lunches etc for 50-60 quid."" Leah replied: ""How?! Honestly, my shopping has tripled!""
Aldi beat rival Lidl to be named the cheapest supermarket of 2023, according to consumer group Which?
It was the cheapest supermarket for 11 months of the year, with Lidl beating the rival discounter for one month in October, the consumer group said. December’s results show a basket of 43 groceries was £74.83 at Aldi, narrowly cheaper than at Lidl where it cost £76.74.

MR2D93USQH_25HD9NCYUHEQ4LL,Tories urged to introduce council tax 'super bands' for properties worth over £2million,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"12:58, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-urged-introduce-council-tax-31974483,"Jeremy Hunt has been urged to introduce new council tax ""super bands"" for foreign-owned properties worth more than £2million.
It comes amid warnings the existing local levy in England - based on the value of a property in 1991 - is ""broken"" and needs major reform.
In a letter to the Chancellor, the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) calls on the government to kick-start the process of re-evaluating all properties before the next election. The group said under the current system a Hartlepool resident with a house worth £150,000 is paying over £200 a year more in council tax than the owner of a £8million Westminster property.
The group's submission to the Chancellor ahead of the Budget in March also calls on him to introduce three new council tax ""super bands"" for properties worth over £2million. It says the money could be ""shared across the country"" and help ""less prosperous areas pay for key services such as children's social care"" facing massive cost pressures.
It adds: ""These super bands could initially apply exclusively to foreign-owen properties; so excluding those owned by UK nationals or those with settled EU status. This would have the added benefit of cooling overheated markets, particularly in inner London, whereby a high proportion of properties are punchased as an investment by foreign owners, rather than as a principal residence.
""The income raised through this levy would come largely from a small number of London councils and be transferred to areas with a lower tax base and higher need.""
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership Henri Murison said council tax was ""actively regressive"".
With warnings that one in five cash-strapped councils in England face bankruptcy, he said: ""We're very clear we need a better settlement for our local authorities. Whatever the next government chooses to do about council tax - it can't stay as it is. There is a long piece of work to re-value everybody in England's home.""
But the Tory peer Lord Eric Pickles also told the BBC reforming council tax would be ""profoundly unpopular"". He said: ""It should be reformed. It's long overdue being reformed. There should be a revaluation, business rates should be reformed because you can't reform one without the other. And governments for many generations have avoided doing that because it will be profoundly unpopular. As communities secretary I avoided doing it, but I think I had a reasonable excuse, given the economic circumstances.""
A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: ""We have no plans to conduct a nationwide re-evaluation."""
MRSMGKIW9P_O65PR7J93KMMYG1,BBC Doctor Who's Christopher Eccleston ‘betrayed’ by A-lister who accused him of ‘copping a feel’,Mia O'HareShowbiz Reporter,"10:30, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bbc-doctor-whos-christopher-eccleston-31945488,"A Doctor Who star has claimed an A-list actress accused him of touching her inappropriately on set.
Christopher Eccleston, 59, played the ninth Doctor in the hit BBC series. He is currently starring alongside his ""childhood crush"" Jodie Foster in thriller True Detective, which is inspired by a horrifying mystery. The pair play ""friends with benefits"" and Christopher has praised True Detective's intimacy coordinator.
The actor has said he felt protected during the sex scenes, unlike in a previous job. ""I did a sex scene with an A-list actress – not Nicole Kidman, who was brilliant – and she implied, in front of the crew, that I was copping a feel because she didn’t like me,"" he said.
Speaking to The Independent, Christopher admitted he was thankful the incident happened before the Harvey Weinstein ""stuff came to light"". He felt the accusation could have caused the end of his career. Christopher added: ""I’ve never felt more betrayed by a fellow actor than I did that day. I have to say to you that I would sooner have put my hands in a food blender than copped a feel of that person.""
He believes it would not have happened if there was an intimacy coordinator on set, and claims it was an ""abuse of power"". Christopher took on the role as the Doctor back in 2005 when the show made its much anticipated comeback. He was the first actor to take on the character who was not born when the series first began.
Due to his successful comeback, there was a shock when it was announced he was leaving at the end of the series after just two months in the role. His exit was shrouded in mystery and controversy, with the BBC admitting they had falsely attributed a leaving statement to him without his consent.
They also confessed to breaking the agreement made to not publicly disclose he was only doing one series. Christopher claimed his relationship with showrunner Russel T. Davies and some of his producers had broken down ""irreparably"" during the first block of filming and never recovered.
""They lost trust in me, and I lost faith and trust and belief in them,"" he said. He went on to appear on stage at the Old Vic theatre and star in TV dramas, The Leftovers, Blackout and The A World. The actor also played villain Malekith in Thor sequel The Dark World.
Christopher recently opened up about his mental health, admitting he almost ""lost everything"". He was hospitalised with severe clinical depression and has candidly discussed the moments he reached his lowest point. Speaking with Plymouth-based Big Issue magazine vendor Clive - a publication the actor is an ambassador for - Christopher said: ""There was one night I thought I was going to die.
""I was running down Euston Road with a suitcase. Now, if anybody has seen me they'd have gone, 'Oh, there's Doctor Who'. My point is, I don't think people understand how quickly it can happen. Particularly in times of economic recession."" He admitted he ""broke down"" and experienced a mental health episode while he was filming for the first series of The A Word on BBC, which aired in 2016.

Her co-host Susanna Reid brought up that the guest in question had helped Ranvir with her presenting, after a ""trance CD"" gave her the confidence to present a BBC news programme. Hypnotist Paul McKenna was on the ITV series on Tuesday, speaking to Susanna and co-host Ed Balls.
He offered his guidance and help to kick off 2024, with tips on how to achieve success in life. Susanna and Ed took part in an exercise, as Paul had them close their eyes and follow his steps to happiness and confidence.
Just before the interview though, Paul was thrilled as he was told by a GMB star that he had helped her many years ago. Ranvir explained that years earlier she had listened to his CD about gaining confidence, and it helped her to present a BBC news programme.
Susanna had told Paul: ""We know that our Ranvir would not be here presenting if it was for you, Paul McKenna. What was it? A hypnotism trance CD?""
Ranvir then told the guest: ""Yes it was back in the day when you had the CD in the back of your album to make you confident. And there was a rota mix up at BBC North West tonight because I was in regional TV, I was a reporter.
""And there was three presenters all off and I thought, 'This is my moment' because I really wanted to present the programme. And I listened to it for a month, every night your voice was counting backwards and all of that.
""And as I walked into the studio that day I just thought, 'I can do this, I can nail it'. And I just waltzed in and I got a round of applause from the crew and everyone. It was really weird but it really worked and I do thank you for that, I really do.""
Paul was pleased with this and that his guidance and helped her. Applauding her, he said: ""Thank you for telling me. I mean you are the person I wrote the book for.""

Poor Things was the second most nominated with 11, including a fourth nomination for one of the favourites for Best Actress, Emma Stone (27/20 on BetVictor).
Meanwhile, there were 10 nominations for Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon and eight for Barbie, despite Margot Robbie (Best Actress) and Greta Gerwig (Best Director) missing out on nominations in their categories.
Barbie did receive a nomination for the ‘big one’ in Best Picture, but comes in at a huge 50/1 to win it. Oppenheimer is considered almost 90% likely to win that award according to latest odds.
Oppenheimer received 13 nominations for the 2024 Oscars, including for Best Picture and Best Director. The film is about the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, following J. Robert Oppenheimer - the man responsible for making the Manhattan Project a success.
The omission of Margot Robbie in the best actress nominations is the biggest surprise given that her co-stars Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera were each acknowledged in supporting categories. Leonardo DiCaprio was also snubbed in the Best Actor category for his part in Killers of the Flower Moon despite the Scorsese film taking 10 nominations.
Cillian Murphy is the big favourite with the bookmakers to win Best Actor (2/5 on William Hill) for his portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the hit film for Christopher Nolan.
UK bookmakers have Emma Stone (Poor Things) as the marginal favourite to pick up Best Actress at the 96th Academy Awards in March (10/11 on Unibet).
With nearly all of the awards at the 2024 Oscars having an overwhelming betting favourite, the race to win Best Actress is unique. Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) is even money with some bookmakers but a best 11/8 on BetVictor.
Best Picture at the 2024 Oscars is considered a no contest with Oppenheimer as short as 1/10 with some bookmakers (best price 1/7 on Paddy Power). Poor Things is the only other film with a price shorter than 10/1 on any bookmaker, but can still be backed at 14/1 on bet365.
An even more one-sided affair in the Best Director category, with Christopher Nolan considered 94% likely to win the award even at best price on William Hill. Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos is the second favourite at 16/1 on Paddy Power.

NAJN85NCSG_VY8SU86JJMI6VP6,How nitrogen hypoxia execution kills as Alabama inmate faces death by nitrogen gas,Fiona LeishmanUS News Reporter,"18:11, 24 Jan 2024Updated07:49, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/harrowing-way-nitrogen-gas-kills-31960027,"Death row prisoner Kenneth Eugene Smith is set to be the first person in the US executed using nitrogen gas, sparking a heated debate on its ethics.
The 58-year-old man is scheduled for execution over a 30-hour window beginning January 25 for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot that left a pastor's wife dead. This new controversial method of nitrogen hypoxia has drawn backlash and scrutiny from critics everywhere, especially as it remains untested.
Previously, Smith survived a botched attempt at lethal injection execution back in November 2022 where he spent four hours believing his death was only moments away. Now, 14 months later, if everything goes to plan, Smith will be the first ever person to be executed using this method in the US.
READ MORE: Death Row killer left haunted by nightmares after surviving first execution
Nitrogen hypoxia is essentially suffocation with nitrogen gas. Either pure nitrogen gas, or gas at a high enough concentration to be lethal, is inhaled to the point of causing asphyxiation.
While nitrogen makes up around 80 per cent of the air we breathe, it isn't deadly to inhale until it is separated from oxygen. The state has maintained that nitrogen gas will cause Smith to fall unconscious quickly, but critics have likened the never-used method of execution to human experimentation.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US
The theory behind nitrogen hypoxia is that by changing the composition of the air to 100 per cent nitrogen, Smith will lose consciousness then die from a lack of oxygen. Much of what we know about nitrogen hypoxia comes from medical journal records related to industrial accidents, where nitrogen leaks or mix-ups have killed workers, and suicide attempts.
Officials have said that during his execution, Smith will be strapped to a gurney, similar to those being executed by lethal injection. He will then be forced to breathe nitrogen through a mask until his body is completely depleted of oxygen and his organs shut down.
The state will fit a 'NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator', a type of mask usually used by industrial workers, over Smith's face during the execution. After this, a warden will read out the death warrant and ask Smith for any final words before triggering the ""nitrogen hypoxia system"" from another room.
According to Alabama's guidelines for execution by nitrogen hypoxia: ""After the nitrogen gas is introduced, it will be administered for (1) fifteen minutes or (2) five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer."" However, parts of the protocol for this new execution method have been redacted from public view.
Many blacked-out sections cover details such as how the gas system is stored, tested and set up. Some parts still left visible do warn about the dangers associated with having nitrogen tanks in the workplace, and make it clear that staff dealing with the system will receive training.
Unlike other execution methods, any non-essential participants will be asked to depart from the execution chamber after the mask is fixed to the inmate condemned to die. Alabama's protocol doesn't permit spiritual advisors inside the chamber ""unless they review and sign the spiritual adviser nitrogen hypoxia acknowledgement form"" beforehand.
Smith's spiritual advisor, Reverend Jeff Hood, expressed his worries about Smith's potential suffering and resistance to the execution. He stated: ""This is not going to be a peaceful experiment."" Adding: ""I think it's important for people to realise, when you strap someone down like that, you can't expect someone who's choking to death - suffocating to death - to not resist.""
After the decision was made to execute Smith using nitrogen hypoxia, the United Nations issued a statement from experts expressing their ""alarm"" at the prospect of the first-of-its-kind execution. They raised concerns about the possibility of ""grave suffering which execution by pure nitrogen inhalation may cause"" and noted that there was no scientific evidence to prove otherwise.
Smith's own lawyers have claimed the state is looking to make him the ""test subject"" for a new execution method. At present, Alabama is just one of three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that authorises the use of nitrogen gas in executions.
They have argued the mask the state plans to use is not airtight and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, potentially even leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leading Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Research shows that when the air has only about 12.5 per cent oxygen, people can experience ""impaired respiration that may cause permanent heart damage"", feel sick, throw up, and have ""very poor judgement and coordination"". So, if Smith breathed in just a little bit of oxygen, he could stay half-awake but suffer.
In 2020, the American Veterinary Medical Association said in their guidelines for putting animals to sleep that nitrogen hypoxia might be okay for pigs in some cases, but not for other mammals because it makes an ""anoxic environment that is distressing for some species.""

NBXFO4DWKU_QBEEBAG6BJ57ZPF,Rishi Sunak suffers major defeat in House of Lords over 'reckless' Rwanda plan,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"19:48, 22 Jan 2024Updated10:11, 23 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-rishi-sunak-suffers-major-31942139,"Rishi Sunak has suffered a major blow as peers inflicted the first defeat against his flagship Rwanda deportation plan.
Peers defied the Government and voted by 214 to 171 to delay ratifying a treaty with the east African nation - a key plank of the PM's controversial policy. The setback comes just days after the under-fire PM begged the upper chamber not to scupper his plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda before the general election.
The Labour peer Lord Goldsmith proposed a motion recommending that Parliament should not ratify the Rwanda treaty until ministers can show the country is safe.
The Government agreed to the legally-binding treaty in December, saying it addressed concerns raised by the Supreme Court about the possibility of asylum seekers deported to Rwanda then being transferred to a country where they could be at risk. But the Lords International Agreements Committee, chaired by Lord Goldsmith, said the promised safeguards were ""incomplete"".
The former Attorney General said during the debate:""In total our report identifies at least 10 sets of issues where on the basis of the Government's evidence significant additional legal and practical steps are needed in order to implement the protections the treaty is designed to provide. The difficulty is that the Government has already presented a Bill to Parliament asking it to make a judgment that Rwanda is safe now.""
He added: ""We are not saying the treaty should never be ratified but we are saying that Parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise the treaty and its implementing measures in full before it makes a judgment about whether Rwanda is safe.""
Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, Dick Newby, said: “Tonight has delivered yet another blow to Rishi Sunak and his failing Rwanda scheme.
""From day one, this policy has been a totally unworkable waste of time and money. Yet the Conservatives are obsessed with pushing it forward, no matter what evidence arises to the contrary. The Government should now accept reality and move on from this white elephant of a policy.”
Responding during the debate, Home Office minister Lord Sharpe of Epsom said: ""The Rwanda partnership was created to enhance the UK's efforts to tackle illegal migration which is costly to the British taxpayer and imperils the lives of those making highly dangerous journeys.""
He faced jeers as he said: ""This begs the question is Labour using the House of Lords to try to frustrate our plan to stop the boats?"" The vote on Monday evening was the first test of Mr Sunak's plan in the House of Lords before a key debate kicks off next week on the Rwanda Bill itself."

The 53-year-old journalist hosts a podcast on Spotify and enticed 27-year-old Irish actor Paul to be his latest guest. TV fans will of course know that Paul rose to prominence in 2020 when he starred as Connell Waldron in the hit BBC miniseries Normal People - and he has gone on to appear in the critically acclaimed films Aftersun and All of Us Strangers.
But before his starring role in Normal People, Paul became recognisable in Ireland for featuring in an advert for sausage brand Denny. The actor was shown munching on a sausage in the advert that preceded Normal People by two years.
Now, appearing on The Louis Theroux Podcast, Paul has been reminded of his humble career origins - with Louis confessing he mentioned the advert in order to bring him back down to earth. In a preview of their chat, Louis is seen grilling Paul, asking: “You got your big break on a sausage advert. How old were you?”
Paul replies: “I was too old to have said yes to a sausage advert, but I was desperate… It was around [the time of Normal People], it was probably… let’s say 2018… I remember not knowing how the spit bucket works on set.”
Louis then cut in to state: “Well I don’t think I know how that works. Because you do have to eat sausage.” Paul explains that he was expected to spit out the sausages after taking a bite, and said: “I just remember feeling it was so rude to spit out your food. A guy would come up with a bucket and I was like ‘No no no, it’s fine’.”
Alarmed, Louis asked: “How much sausage did you have to [eat]?” And Paul revealed: “Probably in excess of about ten I’d say. Too many sausages to be eating at 8am in the morning.”
As the pair start laughing, Louis presses on and asked: “Did you get some fame off of that?” Paul confirmed: “It’s something that people in Ireland reference a lot. To kind of bring me right back down.” And then revealing his ploy, Louis then teased: “That’s more or less why I did it.”
After appearing on Normal People, Paul won a slew of awards - gaining a Best Actor award from the TV BAFTAs and stands to win a Best Actor in a Supporting Role BAFTA for his role in All of Us Strangers. He is also expected to be catapulted to superstardom levels later this year when he plays the lead role in the long awaited Gladiator sequel.
However, Paul recently confessed he is scared of becoming famous - despite chasing a career in the spotlight.
He told The Times last week: “I don’t know what the difference will be. Maybe that’s naive? Is it just that more people will stop you in the street? I’d get profoundly depressed if that’s so and hope it isn’t true. I’ll have an answer next year, but if [the film] impacts my life in that way, I’ll be in a bad spot. I’d have to move on and do an obtuse play nobody wants to see.”

Labour plans to force a vote on the future of the steel industry to strong-arm the Government into delivering a plan to ensure Britain keeps its capacity to make steel rather than relying on foreign imports. It comes after Tata Steel UK confirmed plans to axe up to 2,800 British jobs last week in a devastating blow to the industry.
Most of the jobs will be at the Indian-owned firms's Port Talbot plant in South Wales, where two blast furnaces will be closed this year. Unions have warned the decision risks turning the area into a ghost town and accused the Government and Tata of throwing ""workers on the scrapheap"".
Tata is spending £1.25billion - including a £500million of taxpayers' cash - to replace the blast furnaces with greener electric arc furnaces, which need fewer workers to operate. Labour accused the Government of pushing through the deal that will result in thousands of steelworkers losing their jobs and risk leaving the UK's capacity to produce primary steel

Shadow Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""This is a bad deal, leaving thousands of workers out of a job, handing over millions of taxpayer’s money and risking the UK’s national security. While the Conservatives want to offshore emissions, jobs and opportunities and call that progress, Labour will stand with our steelworkers.
“Labour has a plan to bolster our national security and deliver good jobs for decades to come. The steel sector can have a bright future under a Labour Government.” Labour will use an opposition day debate to force a vote on the issue, meaning Tory MPs will have to nail their colours to the mast.
Announcing the move last week, Tata said in a statement: ""Tata Steel today announced it will commence statutory consultation as part of its plan to transform and restructure its UK business. This plan is intended to reverse more than a decade of losses and transition from the legacy blast furnaces to a more sustainable, green steel business."""

Baroness Stedman-Scott and Sir David Evennett received generous severance packages when they left their Government roles. But neither were entitled to the money as they were over the age of 65.
The blunders have emerged after we revealed yesterday that flasher ex-MP Peter Bone had wrongly been paid almost £5,600.
Baroness Stedman-Scott got £17,442 when she stood down as a Department of Work and Pensions minister in 2022. The Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 states that departing ministers are only entitled to the cash if they are under the age of 65. Baroness Stedman-Scott was 67 at the time.
Sir David got £4,479 when he left his post as a Government whip in October 2022 even though he was 73.
Labour’s Emily Thornberry, who uncovered the severance pay blunder, said: ""To make one of these payments by mistake might be regarded as unfortunate; but to make three is rank incompetence. This is £27,514 of taxpayers' money and for it to be handed out to Tory ministers who weren't even eligible is an insult to every family in our country struggling with the cost of living crisis.""
The Mirror reported yesterday that Mr Bone received a severance payment of £5,593 when he mysteriously was removed from his post as Deputy Commons Leader at the end of September 2022. He was 69 at the time.
Mr Bone was booted out of the Commons in December by his constituents in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, after he was given a six-week ban from Parliament for bullying and sexual misconduct against a member of staff. A Commons sleaze watchdog found he repeatedly asked his researcher to give him massages, thrown pens at him and exposed himself when they were away on a work trip.
In one shocking incident, Mr Bone is alleged to have struck the aide on the back of his head and told him: “You’re having a thick day and I thought that would help”. Parliament's Independent Expert (IEP) Panel ruled that Mr Bone had engaged in “a wilful pattern of bullying”, which “also included an unwanted incident of sexual misconduct, when the complainant was trapped in a room with the respondent in a hotel in Madrid”."

Kanticha Noon, 36, had arrived in the UK on December 27 and was staying at the family home of her sibling, her two daughters - seven-year-old Downreuang and Jasmin, 12 - and her sibling's husband Bartlomiej Jakub Kuczynski, 46.
Detectives are investigating after the four bodies were found at a property in Costessey, near Norwich, Norfolk, on Friday (January 19).
Kanticha's best friend Naty Wathanakul told the Mirror she was due to fly home some point next month. The girls' mum was at work as a caretaker when the deaths were discovered, she said.
Describing her friend, she said: ""She was very nice and caring to all friends of her, a really big supportive person, she helped everyone. We have been shocked and depressed since we knew about her death.
""I wasn't expecting that my friend wouldn't be able to come back alive. She was just a petite woman, i cant believe this happened to her. It was too cruel to handle, I was crying.""
Naty said Kanticha had previously visited the UK last June and had originally been hesitant about coming over this month for ""no reason"". She said: ""She didn't want to go to the UK this time for no reason because she went there once or twice a year normally.""
She went on to say: ""She loved her nieces, I always saw their pictures together. She is a single woman, no boyfriend, no husband, that's why she spent most of her time with those lovely girls."" Kanticha and her sister ran UK-based children's clothing store Malishop together.
Asked about the last time she spoke to her friend, Naty said: ""We discussed Nando’s chicken and beef cooking method. There were no signs at all before she would be killed."" She said this was just a few days before her death. She added that her boyfriend is a chef and knowing how much Kanticha loved to cook she said: ""I told her to get my boyfriend to teach her to do it perfectly."" Noiy Narkvatchara said in a tribute on social media: ""My deepest condolences.""
Police said the 36-year-old woman died as a result of stab wounds to the neck and the 45-year-old man died as a result of a stab wound to the neck. Post-mortem examinations for the two girls will be carried out on Wednesday (January 24).
On Saturday night, following extensive enquiries, detectives confirmed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Formal identification is yet to take place and the next of kin is being kept informed of developments and supported by specialist officers.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said: “Following this latest development we remain satisfied no one else was involved in this incident. This latest information will only add to the distress and shock felt by members of the local community and it’s why, from the outset, we’ve been determined to carry out detailed and methodical enquiries to make sure we fully understand how this incident has happened.
“I would like to thank the community for their support and for the many people who have called offering information. We continue to work through this and will get back to everyone who has been in touch. The police cordon remains in place at the scene and we will continue to have a presence in the area tomorrow.”
The incident has been referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) due to police contact at the address on 14 December, relating to a missing person enquiry, and in relation to a 999 call made from a man at the address prior to the incident, which didn’t result in the deployment of officers.
The IOPC will assess the circumstances of the call and determine the appropriate level of investigation required. As a result, no further information relating to the circumstances of this call will be released at this time."

The teenager is at the centre of a bullying storyline, involving fellow teens Mason Radcliffe and Dylan Wilson. Spoilers have teased things are about to get much worse for the character as the dark plot continues.
From name calling and mockery, things got worse as Mason and others began to taunt Liam online with cruel messages. Mason then stole Liam's phone and threatened him after his actions recently came to light.
But with Liam now facing trouble with the police after being accused of bullying himself, and with residents not realising the truth behind the heartbreaking scenes, what does the future hold for the teenager? Here's all you need to know about Liam, including who plays him and who Liam's onscreen father is...
Liam Connor is a teen on the ITV soap, and the son of Maria Connor. He is the stepson of Gary Windass, and was born on the show in 2009.
He is currently played by actor Charlie Wrenshall, who has portrayed the role since 2012 with him taking on the role at three years old. Prior to this, four other actors played the character as a baby and toddler.
Viewers have seen Liam caught out by a teacher after he attacked Dylan for calling him a loser. Liam was sick of the bullying at the hands of Mason and his friends, and when goaded by the character he lost his temper.
Liam ended up being questioned by the police after Dylan's dad reported him over the assault. Liam's mother Maria Connor is trying to support her son, urging him to tell the truth about what has been going on after realising he was covering for someone.
More spoilers are yet to be revealed, but bosses recently teased there would be a happy conclusion for the sad storyline. Iain MacLeod recently told press: ""We want it to have some positive messaging as well. So the outcomes for the people in the worst of it will be good – and when they seek help, they will receive it and they will then be on a positive trajectory going forward.
""But before that, it's an in-depth exploration of teenage mental health and bullying. If we get it as right as it looks like we're going to, I'm really proud of it.""
While Maria is currently with Gary Windass, Gary is not Liam's biological father. Liam is actually named after his real dad, who was tragically killed off on the ITV soap before he was born.
When Maria was pregnant, her partner Liam Connor was run over and killed deliberately on the orders of love rival Tony Gordon. Liam was the brother of Michelle Connor and the secret lover, and brother-in-law, of Carla Connor who was with Tony at the time of Liam's death.

And it's why her husband Prince William has cleared his diary of official visits and meetings so he can be there for his wife in the early days of her recuperation in hospital and then at home. The heir to throne is temporarily stepping back from his royal role to care for Kate and look after their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.
Kate is not expected to return to royal duties following her operation until after Easter, while William's will be curtailed as he supports his wife and juggles looking after their children. It comes less than two years after the couple both received new upgraded titles following the death of the late Queen.
King Charles declared he would follow royal tradition by naming his heir William as Prince of Wales - meaning Kate took the female version of it. However, it was long believed Kate would get the title upon her father-in-law's accession to the throne - and just months ago, she made a rare nine-word comment about it after being asked by a group of royal fans that demonstrated William's unwavering support for her.
It came during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee weekend in June 2022 when William and Kate visited Cardiff alongside their two older children George and Charlotte. In a clip shared by Twitter user @hellen3030, Kate was seen meeting and greeting a crowd that turned out to see her as well as her family at Cardiff Castle.
As she shook hands, one lady told her that one day she would make a great Princess of Wales. And Kate replied saying: ""That's very kind of you. I'm in good hands"" as she gestured towards William.
Kensington Palace announced news of the princess's surgery over a week ago, with Buckingham Palace sparking a double royal health scare just 90 minutes later by revealing the King was preparing for treatment for an enlarged prostate. The King has also cancelled engagements ready for his corrective procedure in hospital this week.
Meanwhile, Kate was last week said to be ""doing well"", with William spending time at her bedside. She is not expected to return to official duties until after Easter. A royal source told The Sunday Times the Waleses have switched to ""100 per cent family first, day job second"".
Aides insist the princess will be out of sight over the next few months but is likely to be working behind the scenes. ""Her passion for the early years is clear – there will be a huge continuation of that campaign and she will be keen to be out continuing that conversation with the nation as soon as possible,"" the source told the newspaper.
Kensington Palace has not revealed further details of the princess’s condition, but confirmed it was non-cancerous. A spokesman said: ""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible, and her wish that her personal medical information remains private."""

Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, from south-east London, suffered a fatal asthma attack in 2013 after being exposed to excessive air pollution. And in a landmark coroner’s case in 2020, she became first person to have air pollution listed as a cause of death at an inquest in the UK. It marked the culmination of a long battle by Ella’s mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, to have the role of air pollution in her daughter’s death recognised. Her late daughter’s estate, over which Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah acts as administrator, is now suing three Government departments for compensation over Ella’s “illness and premature death”.
Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah’s lawyers said the personal injury case – “the first claim of its kind”- is “not about money”, but focused on “seeking vindication for the death of Ella”. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Department for Transport (DfT), and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) are disputing the claim.
The Government doesn't accept its actions “amount to a breach of human rights” and denies that any such alleged breach, if proven, would be “causative of Ella’s injuries and death”. Ravi Mehta, representing Ella’s mother, said in written arguments prepared for a preliminary hearing in London on Thursday that the case was “no ordinary personal injury claim”.
He added: “The wider significance of the claim is obvious. If successful, it will be the first claim to establish what Rosamund has described as the ‘right to clean air’ under the Human Rights Act. There was huge public interest in the inquest into Ella’s death and Rosamund’s campaigning in respect of air quality has been recognised at the highest level, including by her recent appointment Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to public health.”
The barrister said the case was “legally complex because it is the first claim of its kind”. He added: ""It is factually complex because it concerns the acts and omissions of three Government departments over a period of many years. The extent of the expert evidence and disclosure is likely to resemble that which would be seen in the context of a piece of group litigation.”
Ella lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London – one of the capital’s busiest roads. She died after having endured numerous seizures and made almost 30 hospital visits over the previous three years. Mr Mehta said: “None of the medical professionals that treated Ella had explained that air pollution could make Ella’s asthma worse or that steps could be taken to mitigate the impact or reduce Ella’s exposure to the air pollution. There were also no large-scale public awareness campaigns about the effects of air pollution prior to Ella’s death.”
Colin Thomann, representing the Government, said in written arguments that the claim was disputed in its “entirety”. He said the claim “significantly overestimated” any potential damages that might be awarded. Mr Thomann said Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah’s lawyers had estimated the claim to be worth £293,156, but that the Government considered the maximum the claim could be worth is £30,000 if successful. Judge David Cook made orders over the future of the early-stage legal action and said a further hearing should be held on July 15."

The victims' bodies were found in their Noorvik home after the blaze was doused - and have now been sent to the State Medical Examiner's Office in Anchorage. ""It is believed that one adult female and five children were in the residence at the time of the fire,"" officers said.
Chris Hatch, the public safety director for the Northwest Arctic Borough, told local media that despite their quick response, firefighters couldn't save the house from damage. Authorities suspect that the blaze started near a stove which was reportedly not in good shape before the fire.

However, this hasn't been determined as the official cause, and the investigation is still ongoing. The victims' names won't be disclosed until their families are informed about the tragic event. Reports suggest that the property was completely destroyed in the severe blaze.
Alaska's US Rep Mary Peltola said on X: ""My heart goes out to the whole community of Noorvik, who lost 6 friends, neighbors, and loved ones yesterday. Tragedies like this one hurt so deeply but also remind us why supportive communities are so important. All Alaskans are sending love to Noorvik."" Noorvik is a small Inupiat city with less than 700 people living there.
Earlier in the month, a sad fire in Indiana took the lives of five kids. An 11-year-old got burns but survived. Firefighters fought the large fire on North LaPorte Avenue for three hours after it started just after 6pm. Officials went into the burning house and got six kids out from the second floor. Sadly, five of them later died in hospital because of their injuries.
Fire Chief Carl Buchanon said the youngest child was only 17 months old. One adult got out of the fire with hardly any hurt. A firefighter from South Bend got hurt when he fell through the floor but he's out of hospital now and will be okay.
In a heartbreaking incident last month in Indiana, a neighbour shared her final chat with mum Naomi Briner, 35, who tragically died along with her three children, Adelia, 12, Leland, 8, and Iyla, 6, in a house fire. ""It just makes my heart break,"" a tearful Lori Brinson told NBC affiliate WAVE. ""It's really, really sad.""
Brinson's husband saw a relative of the victims trying to break down the door of the burning house, but the heat was too intense. The family member broke down in tears when it became clear that nothing could be done until the fire crews arrived.

On August 29, 1984, he placed a cloth over his 18-year-old's nose and mouth and dragged her down into the cellar of Ybbsstrasse 40, where she became his prisoner, secured with a chain around her stomach so that she could not escape. From the next day on and for the next 24 years, she endured almost daily rapes and became a mother to seven of his incestuous children - three of whom he raised upstairs in the family home with his wife Rosemarie, who was oblivious to his depravity. He told his wife their daughter had run away to join a cult.
Without sunlight, fresh air, or other human interaction, Elisabeth, now believed to be 57, lived a horrendous solitude where she was used as a 'toy' in her father's 'playground'. It wasn't until age 42 that she was finally able to escape the living nightmare, with the world stunned in horror to learn of her twisted father's crimes.
He was exposed after their daughter Kristen became severely unwell and was permitted to go to the hospital, where Elisabeth slipped a note into her pocket, asking for help. The monster was put behind bars for life in a prison for the mentally unstable - but as of late, is one step closer to freedom again.
Now aged 88 nearing 15 years of his sentence, he has been granted conditional release from Stein Prison, where he will be moved to a regular prison before he is eligible to apply for parole in March. The serial rapist was ruled no longer a threat to public safety, according to the latest psychiatric report.
Heidi Kastner, one of Austria's leading forensic psychiatric experts from Linz University, spent a year preparing her study of Fritzl, who has dementia, and argued he should be transferred through the normal prison system, meaning he could soon be able to walk free in a matter of months.
Of their seven children, the eldest, Kerstin, was born on August 30, 1988. Stefan followed on February 1, 1990, Lisa on August 29, 1992, and Monika arrived on February 26, 1994. On April 28, 1996, Elisabeth gave birth to twins, Alexander and Michael, however Michael died just three days old.
He developed breathing difficulties after being born in the cellar and Fritzl later admitted to burning the newborn's body in an incinerator in his back yard, but denied he was responsible for the death. During Fritzl's trial, where he was found guilty of rape, incest and murdering his child through neglect, he was asked by the judge: ""Did you not realise he was gravely ill?""
Fritzl responded: ""I just overlooked it. I thought the baby was going to survive. I should have realised. It was only yesterday I realised for the first time how cruel I was to Elisabeth. I had never realised it before.""
The surviving twin Alexander was raised as one of the children to live above ground, alongside Lisa and Monika, raised by Fritzl and Rosemarie. Then on December 16, 2002, Elisabeth gave birth to her youngest son, Felix.
The first child to be taken out of the cellar was Lisa at eight months old, who had become ill. Elisabeth persuaded her father to take the baby upstairs and he told Rosemarie that he had found her on their doorstep.
He even forced Elisabeth to write notes to her mother, insisting she couldn't care for her children. This pattern continued with two others. Rosemarie claimed she had no idea about Elisabeth's whereabouts, despite her daughter being right under her floorboards. She reportedly saw the basement for the first time after her husband's arrest and wept uncontrollably.
Ahead of his trial back in 2009, the evil dad told a psychiatrist his family - Elisabeth and three of the children sired through his incest - enjoyed being locked in a cellar. He said he bought them a budgie and fish and that their life was 'normal'.
""They didn't miss anything as I really tried to make their life in captivity as pleasant as possible,"" he told Dr Adelhed Kastner. ""We played, we chatted, we laughed in the cellar. We actually led a completely normal family life.""
After spending the majority of her adult life locked away, raped in front of her children, Elisabeth finally found freedom as her father Joseph lost his. Most people watching the awful story unfold wondered how she would ever manage to put the pieces of her life back together.
But just as she managed to survive against the odds - keeping her sanity and caring for her children in horrific circumstances - she also surprised many by overcoming her ordeal and finding happiness. Elisabeth was given a new name following the trial, with strict laws to prevent her identity from being revealed.
After she was finally rescued in April 2008, she was placed with her three ""cellar children"" under the care of a team of social workers, therapists and psychiatrists at a clinic outside Amstetten where she lived in hospital rooms, overlooking trees and a wide lawn. Her youngest son Felix was reported to have spent much of his time stroking the grass on the lawn in sheer wonderment.
Berthold Kepplinger, the clinic's chief physician at the time, remarked: ""For them a passing cloud is a phenomenon."" Soon after her release, Elisabeth started to develop an obsession with cleanliness, showering up to 10 times a day, according to reports.
The mother was gradually reunited with her three teenage ""upstairs"" children - Lisa, Monika and Alexander, the brothers and sisters her three cellar children had never met. She now lives with her six surviving kids in a brightly-painted house in a tiny hamlet in the Austrian countryside, which also cannot be identified and only referred to by the country's media as ‘Village X’.
The children, now aged between 21 and 35, slept in rooms with doors permanently open after undergoing weekly therapy sessions to eliminate the traumas they suffered inside the cellar. Their two-storey family home is kept under constant CCTV surveillance and patrolled by security guards, while any stranger caught lurking nearby can expect to be picked up by police within minutes.
The close-knit village's residents also help protect the family, according to reports. One photographer sent to Village X recalled: ""There are only a few villagers and they are all in with the police. I was quickly surrounded by people who told me: 'They don't want to talk to you, they don't want to see you - please get out of here.""
But a local restaurant owner revealed: ""The family is doing more than fine. They come often to my venue and we treat them like any other guests. Everybody in the village knows them."" Another resident said: ""Given what they have been through, they are very polite, happy and smile a lot.""
As for Rosemarie, she fled the home she shared with Fritzl soon after the scandal broke, and moved to a small flat in Linz where she tried to supplement her meagre pension by selling homemade bags and paintings of flowers. All of the money from their property empire was seized by the state. She was never charged with any crime. In 2009 Fritzl tried to get his family back on side and reportedly begged her not to divorce him.
Her sister Christine once opened up about Rosemarie's treatment at the hands of her husband - who bragged about getting mistresses pregnant while away on business trips - telling how she was ""dominated and constantly belittled in public"" by him, claiming he took ""sadistic pleasure"" in humiliating her.
Christine added: ""He used to tell her off in front of the others. The worst things were his crude, dirty jokes, which he used to laugh loudly about. This was embarrassing for everyone because we all knew they hadn’t had sex with each other for years.""
Rosemarie has been described as a 'weak' character, although she resolutely refused to visit her ex in jail, and instead focused on rebuilding her relationship with Elisabeth. In the book Monster, a carer said: ""Rosemarie is a weak character who was as much a victim of Fritzl as everyone else.""
Meanwhile, in 2009 it was revealed that, just a year after Elisabeth escaped captivity, she found love with Thomas Wagner, a bodyguard with the Austrian firm A&T securities who had been assigned to protect her. Thomas, who is 23 years younger than Elisabeth, moved to live with her and her family.
One of the team of psychiatric carers revealed that the romance has helped her overcome the traumas of her past, leading her to radically scale back the therapy she was undergoing for post-traumatic stress disorders. The psychiatrist said: ""This is vivid proof of love being the strongest force in the world.
""With the approval of her doctors she has ceased psychiatric therapies while she gets on with her life – learning to drive, helping her children with their homework, making friends with people in her locality. She lost the best years of her life in that cellar; she is determined that every day remaining to her will be filled with activity.""
Another source close to the medical team that still monitors the family recently added: ""It may seem remarkable but they are still together. Thomas has become a big brother to the children."" In 2011, Josef Fritzl’s sister-in-law, Christine, broke the news blackout on Elisabeth by giving a fascinating insight into how she has returned to normality following her nightmare.
She said: ""Elisabeth likes to go shopping a lot. She couldn't do that while she was locked in the cellar for those 24 years. She loves jeans with glitter pockets and she passed her driving test without difficulty. Now she's looking for a car. The kids are all going to school and working hard. Felix, the smallest one, has got a PlayStation.""
She added that Elisabeth had no financial worries after Austrian authorities provided her with £54,000 in child allowance that she was denied during her time in the cellar. Her relationship with her mother, Rosemarie - who is now 85 - was harder to repair, with Elisabeth finding it difficult to believe she had no idea she had been imprisoned underneath her feet.
However, Christine said she now visits Elisabeth and her family at least once a week, claiming ""whatever suspicion there was has gone"".
Over the past 15 years, Fritzl has languished at Austria's Stein prison. He also changed his name, to Josef Mayrhoff, perhaps in a pitiful attempt to escape his own infamy or paint himself as a victim, and he is now believed to have dementia.
Mark Perry, a British journalist who interviewed Fritzl in his prison cell, says he has shown no remorse for his crimes. He recalls: ""He kept saying, ‘Just look into the cellars of other people, you might find other families and other girls down there.’ He doesn’t believe he’s done anything wrong at all. He thinks it’s a failure of justice and that he’s been wrongly locked up."""

The Sussexes went to the country to attend the premiere of a new film honouring Bob Marley and while there were pictured with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. Mr Holness is pushing ahead with plans for his country to ditch the monarch and become a republic. And the photo of Harry and Meghan with the politician and his wife raised eyebrows among some - especially amid health scares for King Charles and the Princess of Wales.
But royal historian and expert Dr Tessa Dunlop believes the response to the photo has been 'disproportionate'. She told the Mirror: ""Harry and Meghan's 'surprise' appearance at the premiere of a Bob Marley biopic in Jamaica has upset royal fans. What exactly did they do wrong during this seemingly innocuous visit?
""Invited by the Chief Executive of Paramount Pictures, Briain Robbins, they didn't gatecrash, nor release another 'truth bomb' against the royal family. No. According to naysayers the Duke and Duchess of Sussex 'posed' with 'anti-monarchist' Jamaican Prime Minister, Andrew Holness. A photo-op that is apparently proof of their hubris. How dare Harry and Meghan have acquaintances that don’t kowtow to royalty?
""Much of Britain's response to their visit has been disproportionate. Jamaica's Prime Minister merely talked about his country 'moving on' from the monarchical system when he met William, then Duke of Cambridge. Barbados shelved the late Queen in 2021, and the then Prince Charles rocked up to a goodbye ceremony. Royals have long stood shoulder to shoulder with Republicans.""
And Tessa believes the reaction to Harry and Meghan attending the premiere in Kingston may be down to the fact their departure from royal life more than four years ago is still being keenly felt. She explained: ""The real reason (some) Brits have taken umbrage with Harry and Meghan's Jamaican jaunt is tied to the ongoing loss we feel over their departure from our Royal Family. Love them or loathe them, together Harry and Meghan were a huge boon for royalty; their easy pose alongside Jamaica’s luminaries was a reminder of just how much cultural stock they still enjoy.
""Young(ish), undeniably diverse and still courting the world’s media, their presence at the One Love premiere felt like another Great British snub. Proof, if any were needed, that we still haven’t got over their decision to decamp to America and criticise our most beloved institution of state. How dare they.
""Grief manifests itself in many different forms; our response to their Jamaican trip suggests some are stuck in the anger stage. Harry and Meghan simply turned up to a red carpet-event. They neither did nor said, anything untoward. But many are still smarting.
""In that context and with the Royal Family’s star player, Kate, the Princess of Wales, vulnerable in hospital, and the King also a recipient of medical treatment this week, their effortless headline-grabbing felt hurtful and unfair. ""And perhaps a teeny bit hypocritical. After all, during his 2012 royal visit, it was Harry who beseeched Jamaican athletes 'don't go running off to America if you’ve got a clear talent your country needs'. """

In September 2017, Jaime Donnelly tragically died from a condition called Kawasaki Disease, which is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in under-fives. Mum Heather Hinshelwood took the six-month-old child to see medics before the pair were sent home with a viral infection diagnosis. While Jaime seemed to ""perk up"", he died days later after an aneurysm burst in his heart.
She said: ""You just think it’s a virus and he will get better. When he came home from hospital, he was quite tired but seemed to perk up a wee bit but the damage was already done to his heart.
""Nothing can compare to losing a child, it was the worst time. You never get over the pain of losing a child. It was a horrendous time and so unexpected. Jaime was a great baby and his big brothers loved him. He was really happy and there were never any issues. He was lovely and beautiful, he was perfect.""
Symptoms of the condition include red bloodshot eyes, red cracked lips and tongue, red swollen hands and feet, high fever and a rash involving much of the body. It can also cause blood vessels to become inflamed, with around one in four children affected developing heart complications.
Heather added: ""It was nice having my three boys before my world was turned upside down. It’s been hard for Jack and Josh as well, it’s a big thing to happen at their age.
She told GlasgowLive: ""I was grieving but also worried for them. I’ve been denied the chance of seeing him grow up into a lovely boy and man like my other boys have grown into, I just feel cheated.""
Friday January 26 marked International Kawasaki Awareness Day and Heather organised for Hamilton Town House to be lit up in red - the colour of support charity Societi - in memory of her baby boy.
""It’s quite rare but it still exists and it needs more awareness. Children can have heart problems for the rest of their life"", the mum added."

Nearby flats were evacuated following the explosion, which happened shortly after 4pm on Wednesday. Police and members of the fire service remained at the scene in Beaumont Leys, Leicester late into the evening while enquiries continue.
Officers from the gas supplier Cadent are also said to be in attendance, while the street and a number of adjoining roads are closed. Leicestershire Police said an investigation had been launched and a 32-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.
An earlier statement from the force said: ""A man has been injured following a report of an explosion at a flat in Kelbrook Close. The road and a number of surrounding roads remain closed, and some nearby flats have been evacuated as a precaution. Police and LFRS are at the scene while enquiries continue.""
It was also heard how an Amazon delivery driver kicked down the front door of the flat to rescue a man just moments after the explosion. Eyewitness Diogo, who is from Braunstone, Leicestershire, told LeicestershireLIve: ""I had been sitting in my van about to make a delivery when the explosion happened. The windows were all blown out of the house - it was very loud.
""I went to help and there was a guy screaming from inside. The outer front door was hanging off its hinges but there was a second door that was still shut and there was a small fire inside the house as well. I kicked that door open and went and found the man sitting on his sofa. I asked him if it was just him in there, and he said it was.""
Diogo believes the man hurt in the explosion was ""clearly in shock"" following the ordeal. The delivery driver added: ""I dragged him out. He was clearly in shock. He had a lot of burns over his body.
""He in pain and I could see burns to his belly, chest and arms, and also on his face, near to his hairline. I walked him out to the street and sat him down and someone brought him water."""

Families with children in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, are struggling just to put food on the table due to the cost of living crisis.
Tanisha Bramwell, a community hero, said: ""It's heartbreaking, people aren't living anymore, they're in survival mode and most of the time, their children are their only motivation"". Tanisha and her team are helping more families in West Yorkshire who are in serious financial difficulty each day.
This week, a single 18 year old mum from Huddersfield had to reach out to Tanisha because she didn't have enough money to buy baby food or nappies for her daughter. The young mother is without a partner and her only support, her terminally ill mother, is unable to help.
But thankfully, Tanisha and her team were able to provide two weeks' worth of baby food and nappies for the mum. The grateful mum said she didn't want anything for herself, she just wanted to be able to provide for her daughter and that she would ""live on toast"" until pay day. Tanisha ensured she also had two weeks' worth of food.
Tanisha revealed: ""We had a young mother reach out in despair, she explained her situation. Her mother is her entire support system. Unfortunately she is now terminally ill. She only asked for support from our food bank to ensure her child could eat. She asked for nappies, milk, wipes, baby food, snacks, children's yogurts.""
""I asked her what food she wanted for herself and she said 'oh no, just my daughter please, I can just eat toast until payday'. Me and my team decided to buy her usual shop. We completed her shop and delivered two weeks' worth of food. She had tears when we arrived."" The mum sent Tanisha a heartfelt message: ""Tanisha thank you from the bottom of my heart, things have been hard with my mum, I didn't want to stress her out. I have to do this on my own soon. You're a god send, when I am paid i will pay it all back.""
Tanisha added poignantly: ""Every person we meet, the circumstances are becoming increasingly harder to hear. People deserve better. Every door and house call we attend, is becoming harder and harder right now. Her message was hard to read, especially when she mentions that she will have to power through alone, eventually. People are really struggling.""

But one woman couldn't help but laugh after discovering her new rescue dog wasn't ignoring her commands, he just couldn't understand what she was saying.
Days after welcoming her new dog home, the woman started using basic commands on him - such as sit and stay - but he'd ""completely ignore"" her and continue whatever he was doing. Speaking to Reddit, the woman said: ""He's a rescue from Houston, Texas, that has been relocated from Minnesota.""
""I figured out he only understands Spanish this morning after looking up how to say 'come here' on Google translate. He was down the hall from the living room. I said 'ven a qui' in a regular speaking voice and boom he was at my feet.""
""I was elated! But now I need to learn the slang Spanish for 'outside', 'go potty', 'sit', 'stay'."" Explaining how she is trying to learn Spanish while her dog learns English, she said her two-year-old dog is quickly picking up a second language.

""I say the Spanish word and then the English word. I think he's still got lots of tricks up his sleeve,"" she added. He is just so smart and eager to please. Once we figured out how to break the ice so to say, it was smooth sailing.""
It hasn't taken long for the crossbreed to settle into his new home and show his cheeky personality to his English-speaking owner. While most users shared tips on how to train her dog in English, others made lighthearted jokes about the bilingual pup.
One user said: ""This is adorable. You'll have to sign him up for a Duolingo account so he can learn English."" Another added: ""Be aware, when he's ready for college, many require knowledge of two foreign languages for entrance.""
A third said: ""All dogs understand love. Plus, there are lots of soft words I use when I get a new rescue - such as cookie, sugar, pillow, love, cloud - that are by their sounds universally soothing. ""That's probably the only thing humans got right - the sound of the word gives clues as to its meaning - compare spike, pain, sad, hard. You two will develop your very own language soon enough.""

OHFFQUR9E1_3XKK0FO44NWVTB5,Police board Ryanair flight and arrest passenger after his 'disgusting' behaviour,Amy WalkerNews Reporter,"07:39, 26 Jan 2024Updated07:40, 26 Jan 2024",20230126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-board-ryanair-flight-arrest-31971399,"An abusive drunk who spent two hours verbally attacking fellow passengers and crew on a flight from Morocco to Manchester has been jailed.
Benjamin Gallon started drinking before his Ryanair flight on December 1 last year, and was told he would only be allowed to board if he stopped drinking booze. But Gallon continued, secretly swigging vodka from a plastic bottle until he became volatile and aggressive.
Prosecutor Tom Challinor said there had been tensions in the airport even before he boarded the aircraft. His female companion was pulled up for smoking inside the airport before boarding. Gallon was said to have smelt strongly of booze and the alcohol he purchased at duty free was confiscated.
At the start of the issues, he was singing loudly on the plane, leading irked passengers to ask him to stop, to which he replied: ""F*** the police."" He then asked a woman of her male friend: ""He's gay, isn't he?"" Mr Challinor said. added: ""The defendant began to abuse the complainant's sexuality and gender. He stated 'there are only two genders', before claiming that the LGBTQ+ movement 'sexualised children'.""
He became increasingly aggressive towards the man, and said: ""It's all your fault, you f*****."" ""The likes of you would rape my kids,"" he added. After reporting Gallon to the cabin crew, the man and woman were moved. When an attended confronted him, Gallon said: ""You're a Jamaican, you like n***es."" The abuse continued, despite other passengers telling him to stay quiet. Gallon also tried to go into the storage area of the plane to retrieve his friend's cigarettes, staff said.
Towards the end of the four-hour flight, Gallon was asked to move to the front of the plane to make it easier for the police to get him off the flight. He refused. ""Come on mate, just move so we can leave,"" a passenger said. Gallon replied: ""Shut the f*** up or I'll headbutt you."" He eventually moved, before telling the man he earlier insulted: ""It's your fault I'm getting arrested, you p***.""
Gallon was removed by police once the flight had landed in Manchester Airport. He said he was 'disgusted' with himself when later confronted with mobile phone footage. He has 14 previous convictions for 22 offences - including drunk and disorderly, violence and breach of court orders.
Mitigating, Stuart Neale read out a letter from Gallon. It read: ""I have nothing but remorse. There is no place in our society for this behaviour and it's filled me with the utmost shame. Nobody has the right to make anybody feel the way I made those good folk feel that day. I am disgusted with myself - there is no excuse for behaviour of this sort.""
He apologised 'deeply' to Ryanair staff for his 'drunken babble'. Mr Neale said Gallon had suffered a spinal injury. He was on strong painkillers, but they didn't work, so he turned to heroin. He said his client treated the holiday as a 'detox', but struggled to sleep. He drank to much at the airport in Morocco, the court heard.
Describing his behaviour as ""disgraceful, volatile and completely unacceptable"", Recorder Katie Jones jailed Gallon, of Haslam Close, Bradford, for four months. He previously pleaded guilty to entering an aircraft when drunk; and using racially abusive behaviour. ""This was a sustained period of dreadful behaviour,"" she told him."

And it was exactly six years ago today in 2018 that Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank announced some happy news to the world - their engagement. The couple gave a TV interview where they revealed they were to marry after Jack got down on one knee and popped the question with a £100,000 pink padparadscha sapphire engagement ring.
The pair had been dating for several years after meeting in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, and they became engaged during a trip to Nicaragua. During interview, Eugenie, who's 11th in line to the throne revealed her late grandmother the Queen had ""wished us well"" and added that her parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were thrilled.
But one family member who had more of an unusual response when asked about their upcoming nuptials three years ago was Jack's nan Joanna Newton. Speaking to the Daily Mail at the time, the then 91-year-old spoke of her happiness for the couple - but in a cutting remark called Jack ""not the most intelligent"" and ""ordinary"". She said: ""I never thought he would get married to a Royal. He's a charming boy and all that but not the most intelligent and I would never have thought this would happen. I would call him ordinary, I wouldn't say there is anything special about him, he's a good-looking, nice chap and I think it says a lot about Eugenie that it's him she wants and it's lovely.""
Jack was educated at Stowe private school in Buckinghamshire and went straight into a career in hospitality. He worked at London nightspots Mahiki and Peyote, before landing a job at Chelsea?s Tonteria with the help of Guy Pelly - businessman and close personal friend of Princes William and Harry. He's also been the European brand director of Casamigos Tequila, which is owned by Hollywood actor George Clooney - but now splits his time between the UK and Portugal.
Following his engagement to Eugenie, the couple got married in October 2018 at St George's Chapel in Windsor with guests including the late Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales and celebrities including Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding. In 2021, the pair welcomed their first child - a son called August Philip Brooksbank - whose middle name pays tribute to his late great grandfather Prince Philip.
And last year in May, their second child, Ernest George Ronnie Brooksbank, was born. Eugenie explained: """"He is named after his great great great Grandfather George, his Grandpa George and my Grandpa Ronald. Augie is loving being a big brother already."" The new arrival is 13th in line to the throne moving the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Edward down to 14th place. He is a third grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.
The newborn is also a 13th great-grandchild of the late Queen - and is the first one to be born since her death in September 2022. He di not receive a title or HRH status as he is not a grandchild of the current monarch King Charles, who is his great uncle."

The latest series of the BBC show concludes on Friday after having launched three weeks ago. There's hope among some viewers that Ross, 28, will be able to ""avenge"" his mother Diane, 63, who was 'murdered' by the Traitors.
Ross hinted that the possibility after being recruited into the Traitors by Harry Clark, 22, and Andrew Jenkins, 45. After being told that Diane had to be ""put in her place"" because she was ""too brave,"" Ross said in a confessional: ""I could feel myself going to boiling point. My mum was murdered so I will take revenge. If I've got an opportunity, they're getting it.""
Ahead of the final three episodes airing, the Mirror spoke to Ross' former co-star Charlotte, 32, to get her thoughts. The recruitment manager - who was banished in the ninth episode - teased she's ""torn"" about who she wants to win.
Asked who she's rooting for, Charlotte said: ""There's part of me that really, really wants Harry to win."" She suggested that his gameplay was ""really good"" and shared in the interview this week that she hadn't suspected Harry was a Traitor.
Further sharing her thoughts, she said: ""So for gameplay wise, Harry, I would love to win, but then because Diane is the queen of all queens, and I loved her, and I got on so so well with her, I desperately want Ross to avenge her.""
Charlotte added about the video director: ""And he was a really good Faithful and he looked so disappointed he got recruited [to be a Traitor], bless him. So with that in mind ... oh I'm so torn. Harry or Ross, that's where I keep going.""
When asked who she thinks is most likely to win, Charlotte recalled the Traitors teasing that Ross was a ""scapegoat"" and a ""dead man walking"" ahead of his recruitment. She added that he may not have ""enough time"" to ""avenge"" Diane.
She said: ""I think based on the fact they were making jokes about [banishing Ross] straight away, like he was a dead man walking or something, [...] Harry could see him out because he's in control of this game now and that is incredible.""
""Andrew's already seen what he's capable of [so] I don't think [he's] gonna try and go against him. Whereas if there was somebody else that was more confident in the Traitor role, I think that [Harry] would be in trouble,"" she continued.
Charlotte then said: ""I think Andrew is also another person that doesn't wanna really be [a Traitor], but knows he has to be there because it's that or be murdered. So Harry has recruited quite cleverly people he knows he can manipulate, and I don't mean that horribly to Andrew, because I love him, [but] he's just not comfortable being a Traitor.""
She added: ""More importantly, even though Ross is enraged, he's on the back foot and I don't think there's enough time now for him to maybe necessarily do it - but I'd love him to do it, because that would be an even better twist.""

OOLWS11CFC_80QGUQUIOD2KLQU,Mum's agony after losing part of leg from fishing line - and faces more surgery,Neil ShawNetwork Content Editor,"23:28, 22 Jan 2024Updated09:53, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mums-agony-after-losing-part-31943451,"A woman was rendered devastated after losing half her leg when a scratch from a fishing line became severely infected.
Michelle Milton, 36, has had to go through a whopping 55 surgeries on a wound that oozes with pus. Her physical pain has become so difficult to manage, that she is pleading with medical experts to amputate her infected limb altogether.
On August 18, 2019, the adventurer headed out on a fishing trip for what should've been a lovely outing. However, in a freak accident, she fell on a rock, and the fishing line stabbed through her pocket and dug into her thigh.
Initially, Michelle did not realise any cause for concern. But over the next four days, her leg began to swell, and her temperature started to rise. As time rolled by, her situation worsened, and within four days, Michelle was rushed to hospital.
Upon reviewing Michelle's leg, doctors realised they had to act immediately. However, the infection had progressed past the point of return, becoming resistant to antibiotics. Consequently, medical experts had to cut into her thigh, leaving the mum of two with a gaping hole in her inner leg, resulting in 55 surgeries, including skin grafts, washouts and tissue removal.
Over the last five years, Michelle has been given endless amounts of hope, all amounting to nothing, leaving her in a state of mental exhaustion. She told WalesOnline: ""I never thought a fishing line could cause so much damage. I just want my leg off. Every day is filled with agony, and I've begged them to take it off. They just keep cutting away at my leg. I can barely walk or sit down. There's going to be nothing left of me.""
When she first arrived in hospital, the doctors were left stunned, not quite knowing how to deal with the terrifying extent of their patient's infection.
Michelle explained: ""They had no idea what was going on. The pain grew, and the infection kept spreading across my leg. I was in a lot of pain, but I thought some antibiotics could fix the issue.
""I'm in agony, every second of every day. I miss my family and my kids. The doctors have no idea what's going on. They just keep discharging me, and prescribing me antibiotics. I'm constantly in and out of hospital.
On October 24, surgeons made another effort to suck out the pus. But sadly, the infection has now spread to her right leg, leaving Michelle heartbroken.
She said: ""I'm mentally and physically drained. I have pus constantly leaking from my body. Everything is ticking down. I'm scared I'm going to die; I'm so poorly. I'm sick of spending my life in hospital. I can't believe a simple scratch has left me like this.''"
OOQ00MSMKH_AZ24EAYBXME1SR2,Magic Vinted button that can 'boost' yourself to top of people's feeds,Liam GilliverOpinion Writer,"13:30, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/magic-vinted-button-can-boost-31956302,"Vinted is a godsend for those wanting to have a clear out while earning a bit of cash.
The site, which has propelled into the mainstream over recent years, allows users to sell their unwanted items (mainly clothes and accessories) for free. Unlike other online marketplaces, there are no selling fees so you get to keep all of your earnings as soon as the buyer confirms they've received the goods.
However, if you've noticed your sales have recently been falling stagnant, one savvy seller has discovered a magic button that can 'boost' your items to the top of people's feeds. This means other users are more likely to come across your wardrobe, increasing the chances of you making a sale.
TikTok user Lisa recently shared her Vinted hack, which she claims has helped her make £123.48 in just 15 days. She advises using the technique sparingly, but says it avoids having to pay for items to be 'showcased'.
""Now do not overuse this hack, because it works really, really well and we don't want Vinted to get wind of the fact that we have realised what it does!"" the content creator said. ""If you put yourself onto holiday mode, when you take yourself off holiday mode, it boosts your whole wardrobe... It pushes you back out and you are shown again to people.""
Lisa recommends putting yourself on holiday mode for at least a 'few days' rather than flicking back after a few minutes or hours. At the time of writing, the post has garnered a whopping 594,000 views and hundreds of comments - with one user branding the advice as 'genius'.
""This explains why my sales boosted a LOT after I came off holiday mode,"" one user wrote. Another commented: ""I’ve only ever used it when I’m actually going on holiday but I always get sales when I come back."" While a third added: ""I didn’t realise this was a thing, thought it was a coincidence every time it happened to me.""

Earlier this year, selling platforms such as Vinted, Depop, and eBay hit the headlines after the government said it was clamping down on tax dodgers. Whilst HMRC was already able to request transaction information from UK-based operators, the companies are now obliged to send details to the tax authorities.
The current threshold for earnings on 'side hustles' such as selling items online is £1,000. Therefore, anyone who earns above that in a tax year must legally register themselves as self-employed and file a self-assessment tax return at the end of the financial year.
""These new rules will support our work to help online sellers get their tax right first time,"" HMRC said. ""They will also help us detect any deliberate non-compliance, ensuring a level playing field for all taxpayers."" It also recommended people should keep track of how much money they have earned from sites like Vinted, even if they are below the tax threshold.
Vinted users should read the terms and conditions as well as catalogue rules before signing up - as breaching them can result in your account being locked. You can learn more here.

OQKAKUQ292_BZF3B7F4KJFPXJR,'Police targeted miners just as the Post Office went for postmasters - now time for justice',Kevin Maguire DNU,"19:11, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/police-targeted-miners-just-post-31969361,"Baton-wielding police targeted striking miners, just as the Post Office and Fujitsu went for postmasters, says the TUC President.
Matt Wrack said the policing of the 1984 Miners’ Strike, with the arrests, convictions, sackings and jailings, had similarities to the Post Office scandal. And today Mr Wrack is calling on Parliament to overturn the miners’ convictions and offer compensation.
Fire Brigades Union leader Mr Wrack, who was young London firefighter during the year-long dispute, said: “The police under Margaret Thatcher behaved like Fujitsu and the Post Office with batons.”
He is discussing with Labour MPs how leader Keir Starmer could be persuaded to hold an official inquiry should, as expected, Labour win this year’s election. Scores of miners were imprisoned during the strike, close on 1,000 were dismissed and 11,000 arrested. Mr Wrack explained: “In every mining community people were stopped for things like just driving along roads. Hence these figures of 11,000 miners arrested.”
Last night Channel 4 screened the first of three documentaries entitled The Miners’ Strike 1984: The Battle of Britain, which included accounts of police violence and how arrested miners were fitted up. In March it will be the 40th anniversary of the start of the confrontation that changed Britain.
Mr Wrack said: “Thatcher used the state to crush the miners and didn’t care how they did it. There are clear echoes of the Post Office cases.”
The Scottish Parliament has already pardoned miners and Mr Wrack wants the UK Parliament to do the same after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a Bill to clear hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses. Some prosecutions of miners were eventually thrown out by magistrates or overturned by judges, after police evidence was challenged, but the National Coal Board refused to ­re-employ those it dismissed.
Mr Wrack said: “Again, like the Post Office cases, a public body behaved irresponsibly and working people paid the price.”
In 1991, South Yorkshire had to pay £425,000 to 39 miners for “assault, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution” after their prosecutions collapsed. But eight years ago the Independent Police Complaints Commission decided not to hold a formal investigation into allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the police.
This is despite uncovering evidence suggesting that officers assaulted miners at the mass picket of the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire, then perverted the course of justice and committed perjury.
Mr Wrack said: “People’s whole lives were ruined by this. Almost 1,000 people were sacked. Many of them will have struggled to get work again – they’re all elderly and some have died. There’s a case for compensation for those people and their families.”"

But despite the Sussexes' long feud with her and Prince William, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are said to have reached out to her to send their best wishes. It was revealed last week that Kate was in hospital following her operation and won't be resuming public duties until at least Easter. Both William and Kate were barely on speaking terms with the Sussexes - especially after Harry revealed private details about a falling out between her and Meghan in his bombshell memoir Spare.
He claimed Kate 'grimaced' when Meghan borrowed her lipgloss and that the women had a disagreement after the Duchess of Sussex accused William's wife of having ""baby brain"" after Prince Louis was born. At the time the book hit shelves at the beginning of last year, Harry sat down for a hard-hitting interview with ITV's Tom Bradby, where he was quizzed about the relationship he had with his brother and sister-in-law. And according to body language expert Judi James, Harry's gestures when talking about Kate appeared to hint at his true feelings towards her.
In the interview, Mr Bradby said the impression was that William and Kate did not get on ""almost from the get-go"" with his wife Meghan, to which Harry replied: ""Yeah, fair."" Speaking about his wife, Harry suggested there was a lot of ""stereotyping"" that even he was ""guilty of"" at the beginning of his relationship.
And picking up on his body language as he spoke, Judi explained: ""There was an air of tragedy about Harry's body language during this long and deeply revealing interview. He ended with verbal assurances that he was 'the happiest I have been', and that he had 'made peace with a lot of what's happened'. In true US style, he claimed to be in a 'good head space' and that any discussions with his family now wouldn't leave any 'lingering' thoughts.
""But the man we watched up to this point used conflicting body language signals that made many of his emotions still look rather raw. There was a rather robotic recitation of 'I love my father, I love my brother, I love my family' but when he spoke of his father he appeared close to tears. His account of growing up with his brother regurgitated signals of fun and loyalty and when Kate's name was mentioned his features softened and his eyes wrinkled into an affectionate-looking eye-smile.""
Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan's move to send Kate their wishes will be considered an olive branch, as the Princess of Wales continues to recover in hospital. The Sussexes are also said to have sent a similar message to King Charles, who is set to have hospital treatment this week for an enlarged prostate.
A source said: ""The King and the Princess of Wales have received support from Prince Harry and Meghan regarding their health. The Duke and Duchess contacted both parties in different ways to pass on their concern and best wishes.""
Reports have claimed Harry may have only found out about his father's prostate diagnosis through news sources. Buckingham Palace is said to have tried to privately inform all senior members of the Royal Family, including Harry, 39, and Meghan, 42, before it was made public on Wednesday. But it is understood courtiers had to put out a public statement ""relatively quickly"" as the King was forced to cancel imminent public engagements.
The announcement was therefore made at 7.25am California time, fuelling reports the Duke may have seen news alerts before any private message. The Princess of Wales was said to be ""doing well"" but she is expected to remain in The London Clinic for up to 10 more days. Her illness has not been revealed but Kensington Palace confirmed it was not cancer."

Emergency services found him unresponsive and tried to save his life through CPR and defibrillation, a family representative told multiple media outlets. However, nothing seemed to work and the actor was put on life support for several days before being pronounced dead on January 16.
The news of the actor's death was shared on Instagram by his sister Katie Colmenares on Friday. She posted a picture of them hugging each other and described him as her ""best friend"", writing: ""I will hold you so tight every day in my heart you gorgeous loving amazing fierce human being missing you every second of every day forever there will never be another.""

A family rep explained David died due to heart failure and said in a release shared with E! News: ""The family has no reason to suspect the cause of his death was anything but heart failure. David will be remembered for his love of acting and his absolute passion and dedication to his friends and family. He possessed a unique quality that made everyone feel special in his presence.""
Gail's mum added in a separate statement: ""We are extremely touched by the outpouring of love from David's dedicated fans and colleagues. We are grateful for all the support received during this very difficult time.""
Pete Ferriero, host and producer of the Beverly Hills 90210 Show podcast, also shared the news of David's death, uploading clips from the actor's appearances on the show. The podcast's official Instagram account wrote on Saturday: ""In memory of David Gail. Here are a few stories he shared when he joined the podcast.""
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
Mr Ferreiro remembered Gail as a ""kind human"" who was ""filled of life and incredible stories"". He added: ""I am grateful I got to know. I am so saddened for your loss, and the world’s loss. He was a gift to us all.""
After the actor's death was announced by his sister, fans were heartbroken and rushed to Katie's comment section to grieve. One wrote: ""Beautiful words about David. Sorry for your loss. You had a great brother. He was always full of fun, laughs & love. Will cherish my friendship with him. Sending Love to your family.""
David, from Tampa, Florida, was born in 1965. He made his on-screen debut on a 1990 episode of 'Growing Pains' before going on to appear on 'Doogie Howser M.D.' and 'Murder, She Wrote' before he was cast on 'Beverly Hills, 90210'. He also starred in the 'General Hospital'."

According to Mrs Jones, patients were crying out in pain while others collapsed and some struggling to get food and drink at the Accident & Emergency department waiting room in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd.
The relative said her stepfather was sent in by his GP as an urgent referral due to a heart problem. She said: ""He came in at about 11.45am on Wednesday, was seen briefly by a doctor, but was still waiting in a plastic chair in the A&E waiting room hours later.""
At 6pm on Thursday, she added: ""We've just been given an update on my stepdad - there's another two-day wait for a bed. That's in addition to the almost 30 hours we've already now spent in the waiting room.""
She later updated that on Thursday night they moved him to an armchair in the corridor. Later on, the charge nurse managed to free a temporary bed in the A&E observation bay. ""So whilst there's no ward bed for him at least he managed to sleep last night."" But the wait for a ward bed goes on - making it more than 48 hours since arriving at A&E on Wednesday lunchtime.
""No food or drinks given to patients other than a sandwich and a little cup of tea twice a day, no pillows, just a few old blankets.""
NorthWales Live reported that she also branded the conditions ""inhumane"". She said: ""To have people sitting in blue plastic chairs, with no backs, under bright lights without food or drink is inhumane. It's like a third world country.""
She said the canteen was closed at night and the cups on the water and coffee machines in the waiting room ran out. The relative said she has even had to inform busy staff that two patients collapsed at reception and in the toilets during their long waits. She branded the problems as ""carnage"".
She said: ""People have paid their National Insurance for decades and this is what they get when they are at their most frail.""
Health chiefs say hospitals are under ""significant and sustained pressure"" and apologised; Adele Gittoes, Interim Executive Director of Operations at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said: “The health and social care system across Wales is experiencing significant and sustained pressure.
""This is having an impact on patient flow within our hospitals and waiting times across all three of our Emergency Departments. We are continuing to work closely with colleagues across the health and social care system, Welsh Government and the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust to identify ways to alleviate these pressures and improve the experience of our patients.
“It has been particularly challenging for urgent and emergency care across North Wales in recent days, with many patients presenting at our Emergency Departments requiring more complex care and treatment. We apologise to those patients who have experienced longer than usual waiting times, despite the best efforts of our hard working staff."""
P9OTT5WB2E_ZC8SZSY808YSG9X,Kenneth Eugene Smith SURVIVED failed execution - but is haunted by nightmares,Fiona LeishmanUS News Reporter,"17:52, 24 Jan 2024Updated09:31, 26 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/death-rows-kenneth-eugene-smith-31959786,"Kenneth Eugene Smith, a man who survived his first execution attempt, is set to face the death penalty again, but this time, things will be different.
On November 17, 2022, Smith spent four hours strapped to an execution gurney while prosecutors tried to lift a stay of execution issued by a federal appeals court. Just over a year later, Alabama is preparing to execute Death Row inmate Smith once more.
This time, they plan to use a controversial method of execution by nitrogen gas, which has never been used before. The details of how this method, known as nitrogen hypoxia, will be carried out are unclear due to security reasons.

Smith was sentenced to death for his role in the 1988 murder-for-hire of Elizabeth Sennet. Her husband, minister Charles Sennet, had hired someone who then hired two more people, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary. Smith was arrested after investigators found the Sennets' VCR in his home.
In November 2022, Smith was put in the 'death cell' at the Holman Correctional Facility in Alabama, where prisoners wait to be executed. He said his final goodbyes to his mum and grandson and had his last meal before being taken to the death chamber.
Smith was supposed to be executed by lethal injection, but things didn't go as planned. At 7.57pm on November 17, guards ended Smith's phone call with his wife and put him in handcuffs and leg irons to lead him to the death chamber.
They took him to the execution chamber and strapped him to the gurney. Just two minutes later, according to Smith's Second Amendment Complaint that challenged his execution by lethal injection, the Eleventh Circuit issued a stay of execution. Smith's lawyers gave this information to the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) at 8.02pm.
While ADOC replied saying they had received the orders to stay the execution, Smith remained strapped to the gurney until midnight - four hours after he believed he had said his final goodbye to his wife. During that time, Smith's complaint alleges ADOC never informed him of the stay or the status of any of the other legal proceedings going on and that he was not allowed to talk to his counsel.
Smith thought his execution was about to happen any minute. After lying on the gurney for two hours, the IV team came in and tried to insert an IV line. At the same time, the US Supreme Court lifted a stay, but it's not clear if the IV team started before or after this.
As the IV team kept poking Smith with needles, he told them they were hurting him by inserting the needle into his muscle. According to the complaint, one of the team members simply said ""No I'm not.""
Smith was then put into an upside-down crucifixion position by the team who left the room for a few minutes. When they returned, Smith says he was injected with something unknown, which his lawyer thinks might have been a sedative or anaesthetic.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US
Then, someone with ""unknown medical credentials"" came up to Smith and ""started repeatedly stabbing [his] collarbone area with a large needle"" in an attempt to secure a central IV line. According to Smith's complaint, a prison official ""grabbed and held [Smith's] head away from the area where the needle was being inserted"".
Smith felt a sharp pain, ""as though he were being 'stabbed in the chest',"" when someone ""repeatedly jabbed him... underneath his collarbone."" ADOC Commissioner John Hamm announced to the press on site ""at about 11.21[pm], we decided we would not be able to finish that protocol before the midnight hour when the death warrant expired.""
But Smith didn't know he wasn't going to die that night. Around 11.20pm, rumours started that the execution might be off, and Smith's lawyers emailed officials to find out but got no reply. Sometime before midnight, the execution team simply told Smith ""it's over with"".
After four hours on the gurney, upside down, drugged, and poked with needles, Smith was a mess. He was shaking, sweating, struggling to breathe, dizzy, and couldn't even lift his arms or walk without help.
Because of the messed-up execution attempt, Smith now has PTSD and is on a whole host of meds. His prison doctor says he suffers from insomnia, anxiety and depression.
Smith, who is facing his second execution attempt, told The Guardian that he's been having trouble sleeping due to constant nightmares and the ""what-if games you play in the middle of the night"". He shared a recurring nightmare where he's led back into the death chamber.
""All I had to do was walk into the room in the dream for it to be overwhelming,"" he said. ""I was absolutely terrified. It kept coming up.""
The news of a second execution attempt has triggered a new wave of nightmares for Smith. He said: ""I dream that they're coming to get me.""
As his return to the execution chamber nears, Smith says his physical and mental health are deteriorating, and he spends most days feeling sick. He added: ""They haven't given me a chance to heal.
""I'm still suffering from the first execution and now we're doing this again. They won't let me even have post-traumatic stress disorder - you know, this is ongoing stress disorder.""
He likened his situation to an abuse victim being forced back into the hospital environment that initially traumatised them. Saying: ""A person who did that would probably be seen as a monster. But when the government does it, you know, that's something else.""

Fans went wild for the saucy skirt, with the khaki number selling out the same day - and this week, she’s styled an incredibly similar piece  that’s sure to get hearts racing ahead of Valentine’s Day.
The 52-year-old Britain’s Got Talent judge regularly shares her outfits and a behind-the-scenes peek at her Heart radio show, and stunned in an all-black ensemble, including a  leather skirt from celebrity-loved brand Karen Millen.
Amanda wowed in the  figure-hugging skirt,  which she teamed with a black feathery jumper from Michael Kors, and matching black heels.
""Everybody said I look like a baddie today,"" she told her 2.1 million followers. ""I feel like a baddie. This jumper is from Michael Kors. It's absolutely gorgeous. And the  skirt is from Karen Millen. I felt like I needed to wear black today. Very big weekend as you've probably seen on Instagram.”
For those who missed it, the mum-of-one had been spotted dancing to Sophie Ellis-Bextor's hit Murder on the Dancefloor over the weekend at her daughter’s 18th birthday party before returning to work on Monday.
Her  Karen Millen skirt  is described by the brand as ‘the epitome of an everlasting investment’. Made from real leather, it ‘fits the form with bespoke ease’, with a front zip that gives it a modern edge. Originally £229, the skirt has hit the January sales and is now available for £183.20, saving you over £45.
And while that may still sound expensive to some, it’s still far cheaper than other brands like  COS who’s similar looking skirt comes in at £300. However, if you’re happy to go for a leather alternative,  ASOS has a longer Simmi zip detail leather look maxi skirt for £30, with the  Black Faux Leather Tailored Midi Skirt from River Island coming in at £40  - though it doesn’t have the same zip detailing.
But as the brand suggests, the Karen Millen skirt is one that will last, being pulled out of your wardrobe time and time again. You can wear it for work with a fancy knit like Amanda, dress it up with a glamorous top for a night out, or even pair it with trainers for a more relaxed look. It really is a do-all piece. And if you want to get your hands on Amanda’s sultry skirt, you can  pick it up in the January sales here."

Donald Trump has scooped a win in the New Hampshire Republican primary, setting the stage for a potential rematch with Democrat Joe Biden. His main competitor, Nikki Haley, came in second with 43.1% of the votes compared to Trump's 54.6%. Joe Biden won on the Democratic side as a write-in candidate, despite not being on the ballot.
This was a night full of drama, marking the first time a presidential candidate has won the first two contests on the primary nomination calendar and failed to become the party's general election nominee. Trump is now expected to clinch the Republican nomination, grabbing the 22 delegates available from New Hampshire.

Usually, the winner of both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire Primary is always able to get the nomination. This comes just days after the couple were spotted travelling in separate cars. Despite being married for 19 years, neither Donald nor Melania publicly acknowledged their anniversary this year.
Speculation about a possible rift between them has been fuelled by footage showing Melania leaving her mother's funeral in a different car to Donald. Some people think it was done for safety, with one person saying: ""Standard protection detail. You do not have two primaries in the same vehicle. A better chance that one of two might survive...""
A body language expert, Judi James, told The Mirror that Donald and Melania Trump putting their son Barron between them seemed like a way to keep some space. Judi explained to The Mirror: ""Donald and Melania have positioned their son between them rather than standing together here and Trump himself is standing rigidly to attention with his chin raised as though wanting to perform a mark of formal respect for his mother-in-law.""
He thinks Melania might be avoiding getting too close to keep her feelings under control while everyone is watching. He mentioned: ""The lack of touch here could be deliberate. When someone has to mourn in public it is common to worry that acts or comfort, support and affection can make them lose their composure completely and that might be Melania's concern that she needs to stay in control of her emotions at this very public moment for the ex-FLOTUS.""

Many icons from the ITV2 programme returned to the series in hopes of finding love, with Liberty and Mitch Taylor finding a connection when the show started this month. However, things became rocky between the two as Liberty felt like Messy Mitch didn't put any effort into getting to know her.
She even cried when she found out she wasn't his first choice. Last night, fans watched as the Scotsman chatted to Liberty and Kaz Kamwi about Mitch, going as far as to call him a clout chaser as he claimed he wasn't in the show for the right reasons. ""I don't get good vibes off that kid,"" he said on Wednesday.
""It's very rare I don't like someone but I can't stand him. He talks too much about clout and Instagram following all the time. That's only my opinion."" On Thursday's episode, Mitch found out about Anton's comment and blew up in his face about 'bro code'. Liberty told Mitch about Anton's comments, which angered him.
""You are talking to Lib behind my back going against me and it’s not really bro code,"" Mitch told Anton, to which the Scottish hunk responded: ""There is no bro code. There is right and wrong…I’m telling her my opinion.” Mitch then told Anton to 'keep his nose out of his business.'
Anton added: “If your girl comes crying to me asking for advice I will give her my advice. You’ve been together seven days and made her cry twice. Look at yourself, don’t look at me. Be a man, not a boy.” Viewers were in shock watching the exchange and rushed to social media to praise the star for defending Liberty.
One user said: ""Oh Anton is one of the GIRLIES and I’m here for it tbh,"" while one person posted: ""Anton is here for the girlies bro code has seemingly been broken between him and Mitch tonight."" Another impressed viewer commented: ""Oh Anton ate him f**king UUUUUPPPPP.""
Another posted: """"Be a man, not a boy"" Anton I didn't know you could cook like this."" Love Island fans might remember a different side to him in his series of the show. At the time, he was coupled up with Belle Hassan and viewers watched in horror as he jokingly gave his number to a shop cashier.
The 'joke' ended up in a huge row between the two. He also pecked Anna Vakili during a challenge instead of Belle and said Anna was the best kisser in the villa.

The firm said that despite having its best Christmas in four years, customers are still feeling the pinch from the cost of living crisis. Chief executive Rob Pitcher stated: ""Revolution's younger guests are ... still feeling the disproportionate effect of the cost-of-living crisis.""
However, the company also noted that it ""cannot assume"" that rises in minimum wages will lead to increased spending by its customers. The firm added: ""It is however a material increase in cost in each of our businesses.""
From April, the minimum wage for 18 to 20 year olds will rise by 14.8%, and for those over 21, it will increase by 9.8%. As a result, the company has had to rethink its expectations for growth in the second half of the financial year.
Shares in the company dropped by 17.7% on Wednesday morning. Mr Pitcher added: ""The 2023 festive trading period is our best for four years.""
He also expressed his delight at the strong growth in Peach, Revolucion de Cuba and Founders over the festive period. ""It was pleasing to see our Revolution guests experience their first uninterrupted Christmas since 2019, driving growth for the brand.""
The business shared that they opened their 22nd Peach pub last November and celebrated weekly sales of over £1 million for the first time during Christmas. Meanwhile, bookings for Christmas parties at Revolucion de Cuba jumped by 26% compared to last year.
However, the company's own Revolution brand didn't do as well because the young people who usually go there are feeling the pinch.

PN7RG5I7J8_0SY75BAJ3HLU6S0,E4 Hollyoaks confirms abrupt exit for iconic character - but there's a huge twist ahead,Charlotte TuttonSenior TV Reporter,"19:30, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/e4-hollyoaks-confirms-abrupt-exit-31953611,"Hollyoaks viewers saw another character exit the Channel 4 soap on Wednesday, a week on from a devastating triple death.
Soap icon Hannah Ashworth made a rather abrupt exit from the village in scenes that first dropped on Channel 4's streaming service on Tuesday night. After a shocking attack at the hands of Carter Shepherd, Hannah appeared to be missing before a dramatic plot unfolded.
In Wednesday's E4 episode her fate was revealed, as it was confirmed Carter had left her in the boot of his van only for her to escape. Soon Hannah was spotted once more, and Carter pretty much blackmailed her to leave the village.
He had discovered she owed a lot of money to someone, and offered her a way out after getting his hands on a load of cash being stashed at the McQueens' home. Carter knew that Hannah was on to him over recent goings on, and told her to take the cash and run.
Desperately needing to pay off her debts, Hannah agreed but dropped a chilling warning to Carter. She told him he would get what is coming to him, before hopping into the back of a taxi and fleeing the village.
Viewers were stunned to see Hannah leave again so soon after her epic comeback last week, 14 years on from her last stint in the village. But there's a twist ahead for sure given some news about the character.
It's been revealed that actress Emma Rigby is filming a longer stint on the show, with her thought to have signed a year-long contract. This, as well as pictures from filming, confirms Hannah will be back on the soap some point soon.
So Hannah may have left for now, but she's definitely not gone for good - amid the arrival of her mother Suzanne Ashworth, after her twins headed to the village. So Carter may need to watch his back, as Hannah could expose him over the money theft but also what she found out about him and Gareth.
While we do not know what is ahead for Hannah yet, she will no doubt be in all kinds of drama when she heads back to the show once more!
Hollyoaks is available to stream on Channel 4's streaming service now, while it also airs Mondays to Fridays on E4 at 7PM.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."

Khalid Khalid was shot six times when four men dressed in burkhas burst into the house in Ilford, east London, and shot and stabbed Saydi Abu Sheikh, 23, and Zakariya Jeilani Mohamed, 31. Saydi had been stabbed 28 times and shot four times while Zakariya was stabbed five times and shot at least seven times.
Khalid Khalid was shot six times with one bullet entering the side of his face, passing through his head and exiting beside his mouth, causing damage to parts of the skull, his brain and his teeth. Two other victims managed to escape during the attack the Met Police said was an ""unspeakable act of extreme violence"".
Saydi, who rapped under the name Giddy, and Zakariya, who used the name Shifty, were said to be part of the group known as Drillford. Today their killers were sentenced to a minimum of 38 years behind bars.
During the trial prosecutor John Price KC told how a resident had called 999 just after midnight after hearing a bang and seeing a car on fire. Police and paramedics found a ""scene of bloody carnage"" when they arrived at the address a few minutes later, Mr Price said.
""In an upstairs room were two young men, both dead or dying. They had each been shot and stabbed many times. A third young man, gravely wounded, had been left for dead. Though he sustained a gunshot wound which had passed through his head, he was to survive. It was later discovered that a fourth man had run from the back of the house when a group of attackers armed with guns had forced their way in.
""A fifth man was even more fortunate. Before the gunmen were able to force their way into the room, he had concealed himself between a bed and the wall. Almost miraculously, his presence there went undetected by the gunmen.""
The attackers were caught on CCTV cameras outside the property, jurors at the Old Bailey heard. They had donned burkas to hide their identities when they set off for the attack from a “mission control” flat a couple of miles away. Another defendant, Zain Mirza, had “procured” the murders in revenge for the killing of his brother in 2019. He was in prison for a drugs offence but set about putting a plan into action after being released while being careful to remain at “arm’s length”, jurors were told.
Prosecutor John Price KC had said: “He [Mirza] was the one who most wanted it done. His motive was revenge.” In November 2019, Mirza’s 19-year-old brother Mohammed Usman Mirza was murdered and one of those convicted over the killing was “closely associated” with Mr Sheikh, jurors were told.
Chibuike Ohanweh, 21, of Romford; Ayaanle Adan, 20, from Barking; Mahad Gouled, 22, from Enfield; and Mirza, 21, of Newham, had denied double murder, two charges of attempted murder and perverting the course of justice. Mirza claimed he was in Manor Park dealing drugs and celebrating a friend’s birthday at the time of the killings while Ohanweh, Adan and Gouled also denied involvement.
A jury deliberated for more than 40 hours to find the four men guilty of all the charges. Today, Judge Mark Lucraft KC sentenced them to life with a minimum term of 38 years. He told them: “I’m entirely satisfied that the events were the culmination of a carefully planned retaliation attack for the killing of Mohammed Usman Mirza. You were each involved in planning and carrying out this horrific attack.”
A fifth defendant, Zakarie Mohamad, 19, of Kensington, had admitted perverting the course of justice by destroying the car. He was cleared of the murder and attempted murder charges. Today he was sentenced to four years in a young offenders institute."

Only recently, the ITV soap was full of heartbreak on New Year's Day as teenager Heath died after joyriding in a car with his twin sister Cathy and Angelica. The teenagers had been desperate to go to a New Year's Eve party out of the village but couldn't get a lift and their dad Bob Hope refused to pay for a taxi. The trio were left bored at the B&B's party so decided to take matters into their own hands, stealing Wendy's car to joyride to the party.
Since the crash, both Cathy and Angelica have claimed the other person was driving with the village left torn over who to believe, especially Bob who has been refusing to see Cathy in order to protect her from himself. On Thursday, it was the day of Heath’s funeral, and a guilty Angelica decided to tell the truth.
Angelica confessed to her gobsmacked mother, Nicola King, that she was the one driving the car when Heath died as she worried about being sent to prison. On Friday night, it aired the aftermath as Nicola struggled with the bombshell and upon telling husband Jimmy King, he stormed out the house unable to cope.
In upcoming scenes, Nicola urges Jimmy to discuss what's next for them and with the funeral over, the Hope family's focus shifts to the police investigation, which leaves Cathy lashing out when Bob suggests waiting for the forensic results. What's more, Jimmy - who doesn't know the truth - continues to blame Cathy for the crash.
Later, Nicola is uneasy when Jimmy tells Angel to lie to the police. The next day, they try to act normally, but Jimmy is guilt-ridden to witness Bob's suffering. Meanwhile, Angelica overhears her parents talking about Bob's struggles and wanting to end all the lies so runs over to the B&B where she publicly confesses to a shell-shocked Liam, Brenda, Cathy and April.
Soon, at the police station, Angelica officially confesses to having been the driver and is terrified when she is arrested for causing death by dangerous driving. What's next for her and is this an exit for the young character?

Q0EXNI4011_P1OQJVVVGP01CAS,Allergic mum rushed to hospital with baby after cafe serves cow's milk with vegan tea,Kelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter,"10:07, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/allergic-mum-rushed-hospital-baby-31972283,"A mum was rushed to hospital with her baby in her arms as she had an anaphylactic reaction from being served cow's milk in a cafe after ordering a vegan tea.
Fleur Wiltshire said she asked an employee about vegan cakes and mentioned her milk allergy before ordering a tea with oat milk at She Sells in Mevagissey in November, but another member of staff misheard her and served her a jug of cow's milk on the side. Shortly after, she went in to anaphylactic shock, had to administer an EpiPen and an ambulance was called to take her to hospital.
She was with her seven-month-old baby at the time and said it was the first time she had to leave her child, describing the experience as ""very traumatic"". A few days later she met with the café owners who profusely apologised for the incident and explained they would do more to make sure nothing like that ever happened again.
But now the café have said 32-year-old Fleur is banned after they implemented a policy that it does not serve people with severe allergies to in order to protect the small business, its customers and the staff. When Fleur, from St Austell, tried to revisit this week and said she left humiliated and in tears when she was refused service, Cornwall Live reports.
""The first time was just horribly traumatic, having to go to hospital and having the experience of having anaphylaxis. And I only went back because the Teacup Tearoom where I usually go and feel really safe wasn't open yet. It was just a convenient place to go and the owner had apologised to me after the first incident during which they gave me the wrong milk,"" she added that she felt that meant she was welcome and wanted to give the place a second chance.
""The woman recognised me and stepped in from the girl who was serving me before I could even say I had an allergy and she was so rude in her tone and blaming of me for their situation. I asked if I could have a cup of tea and she said the jugs aren't clean enough and might have milk residue on them. By that standard I wouldn't be able to eat anything ever. I don't think anyone in the world is that allergic to anything.""
She said the café staff then refused to serve her and explained it was now its policy to not serve anyone with severe allergies. ""I was humiliated and left in tears. Everyone was just appalled at the situation and it was humiliating. I felt so powerless. All I want to do is be able to go out and enjoy a cup of tea like anybody else would and with a 10-month old baby it is hard to get out the house anyway and having the courage to go back to there after they literally hospitalised me was a big deal.
""It was so embarrassing and it was like I'd done something wrong and like I'd made the mistake. I remained so polite until the end and it was just awful. I wouldn't ever treat anybody like that.""
Rose and Mikou, joint owners of She Sells, claims the customer in question did not at any point mention to staff that she had a severe allergy to dairy during either visit. They said this was despite the café having signs stating to let the team know about any allergies.
""Five days after the event both the lady in question and ourselves met up and had a chat about the traumatic event that occurred,"" they said. ""We gave our sincere apologies and explained we will do even more to make sure nothing on this scale ever happens again. We honestly felt terrible and sick to the stomach of what could have occurred, but we wholeheartedly feel it could have been avoided if she had simply told us of her severe allergy to dairy. She has a responsibility just as much as us to protect herself and to have avoided this event.""
They explained that as a result of what happened with Fleur, they decided to change their policy ""dramatically to protect our customers, our staff and our small family business"". They said they were only made aware of just how serious the customer's allergies were in the days following the incident and had they known sooner it could have been prevented.
""We believe the real issue is communication and understanding one another. All hospitality businesses have in place an allergen book that the customer can check, as well as an action plan on how to deal with queries.
""We have many returning customers with intolerances and allergies coming through the door and they will be able to witness how serious we are taking this matter. But it is difficult to deal with customers who do not speak up or ensure we are fully aware. The matter needs to be taken seriously from both parts.
""We are sorry that the customer in question feels the need to report this, but we now feel this incident has been a catalyst for us in making a firm decision that severe allergies are not worth the risk for the customers or us as a small business where we just don’t have the capacity or space to cover all corners for every customer and to ensure the safety of everyone."""
Q0KW5I7UNN_CJZFKCG8335KUGB,Infuriating restaurant habit that all staff wish you'd stop - are you guilty of it?,Lucy MarshallLifestyle Reporter,"09:17, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/infuriating-restaurant-habit-staff-wish-31941540,"A waitress says that there is one annoying customer habit that she sees every time she is on shift - which is technically ""trespassing"".
Working in the food service industry means you will see and talk to a lot of people most days. While it can often be rewarding, it's no secret that people can also be incredibly difficult to deal with, especially when they carry out ""crazy"" habits at the table.
Restaurant worker Syd has opened up about the reality of being a waitress and shares her ""server horror stories"" online - which have left people stunned.
Taking to her TikTok page @poorandhungry, which has raked in over 31.6 million viewers, Syd recent claimed that every time she works a brunch shift, a customer comes in and sits down but does not order anything; they bring their ""own coffees"".
Syd reenacted the scenario, playing both herself and customers, to demonstrate the infuriating habit. The worker shows how she asks customers if they would like to order anything - such as a coffee or a mimosa - but, often finds they do not want to order anything but simply want to sit in the restaurant with their own drinks.
Syd says she replies to the customers and says: ""We are a restaurant so we really can't allow outside food and beverages. Looks like you're almost done with your coffees, so maybe we could get started with some things on our menu.""
But her politeness gets her nowhere; the customer again replies that they don't want anything. They claim they've got a granola bar in their pocket and only plan to sit in the eatery for a short while.
Although Syd tries to ask again, she is met with the customer saying: ""Wow, servers really have turned into sales people nowadays. We'll just keep our money in our pockets.""
She proceeds to explain that if they don't order ""it's just trespassing"". The waitress always allows them a 15-minute grace period but informs them that they then have to leave.
The TikTok raked in over 500,000 views, and 70,000 likes with hundreds of people commenting on restaurant etiquette. ""That is absolutely crazy that people do this,"" said one individual.
Relating to Syd's scenario, another wrote: ""I work at a restaurant in an airport and have this conversation five times a day.""
Another said: ""This happens all the time at the restaurant I work at. people have given us bad reviews because we ask them to leave for the exact same thing.""
""The audacity of some people, I just can't,"" added another TikTok user. Someone else admitted: ""The only time I did this was when I needed a Redbull but I still got my crispy coke. I didn't want them thinking I was cheap I just needed energy.""
Another individual said: ""I went out to breakfast with my old boss and he brought his own tea bags and just ordered a cup of hot water. I was so embarrassed.""

Q1PG1FLG5A_I98LGLPICDKXHPG,Kate Middleton will 'bounce back' after recovering from surgery and is in 'great hands' - source,Jennifer NewtonRoyal Features Writer,"11:20, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/kate-middleton-bounce-back-after-31963745,"The Princess of Wales will ""bounce back"" from ""serious sounding"" surgery and is in ""great hands"", according to a source.
It's been more than a week since Kate's abdominal operation at the London Clinic, where she has remained as she recovers from the procedure. The 42-year-old princess is expected to remain there for between 10 and 14 days in total. Kensington Palace has not revealed further details of the princess's condition but confirmed it was non-cancerous and that she would probably not resume royal duties until after Easter.
Now, a source close to the Royal Household has told PEOPLE magazine they expect she will recover well. They explained: ""It does sound serious with the length of time [she’s taking]. But she is in great hands and will have lots of care and support at home and is a fit young woman. I am sure she will bounce back.""
They added: ""It is sensible to take the time. That is a great example to the rest of us, as you’re often told to get back to work as soon as possible, which can be damaging. It is good for all of us to see her taking the time, recovering properly and then coming back. We can all learn from that.""
Kate's last public appearance came on Christmas Day when she accompanied the rest of the Royal Family for the traditional walk to church in Sandringham - and there was no indication of any impending health issues. And the magazine understands that within Kate's broader circle of family friends and even those who work closely with the royals, the news of her hospitalisation came as a surprise.
Her husband Prince William has cleared his diary of official visits and meetings, with no mentions of William in the Court Circular – the daily record of royal engagements – since his wife was admitted to hospital. The heir to the throne is temporarily stepping back from his royal role to care for Kate and look after their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.
Kensington Palace announced news of the princess’s surgery eight days ago, with Buckingham Palace sparking a double royal health scare just 90 minutes later by revealing King Charles was preparing for treatment for an enlarged prostate. The King has also cancelled engagements ready for his corrective procedure in hospital this week.
Kate was last week said to be ""doing well"", with William spending time at her bedside. A royal source told The Sunday Times the Waleses have switched to ""100 per cent family first, day job second"".
Aides insist the princess will be out of sight over the next few months but is likely to be working behind the scenes. ""Her passion for the early years is clear – there will be a huge continuation of that campaign and she will be keen to be out continuing that conversation with the nation as soon as possible,"" the source told the newspaper."
Q1YSRU8CRK_HLP7PGZG3SLLTRM,Doctor names three phone habits that are 'killing your brain',Zahna EklundAudience Writer,"10:26, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/doctor-names-three-phone-habits-31962638,"Your phone habits could be the reason you have a ""stressful life"", a doctor has warned.
These days we use our mobile phones for almost everything. From making calls and sending texts to keeping up with the latest news, watching videos, listening to music, and even playing games, there's next to nothing that the pocket-sized devices can't do. But with many of us glued to our phones for several hours a day can have negative effects on our health, as one doctor has warned that some habits could be ""killing"" our brains.
Doctor Aditi Nerurkar explained that using your phone with its brightness turned up can make us feel stressed, especially when paired with viewing ""graphic content"" that is often visible on social media and news platforms that many of us scroll through before bed.
Speaking to Steven Bartlett on an episode of his Diary of a CEO podcast, Dr Nerurkar said that if you want to live a stressful and anxious life, the best thing to do is to ""get on your phone, make sure it's on high brightness and scroll through every social media platform, every news platform, watch graphic content, videos of horrible things happening in the world at midnight. And keep doing that off and on until 4 or 5 am.""
The doctor also shared three phone habits many of us have that are negatively impacting our daily lives and making us feel worse - including how often we check our phones and how bright the screen is.
Dr Nerurkar urged people to stop scrolling on their phones late at night as this can make it difficult for us to disengage and get a good night's sleep. She claimed that our desire to scroll on our phones is a ""primal urge"" to scan for danger which comes from a feeling of being stressed, so putting your phone down and doing something else to relax before bed can stop you from spending hours reading unpleasant news.
She explained: ""In recent times there's been a lot of bad news in fact it feels like the onslaught of bad news one thing after another, whether it's a climate disaster or a conflict in a certain part of the world or something or the other is always happening now. The information stream is rapid and unprecedented, and so we are constantly scrolling and scanning for danger.""
Many of us are guilty of checking our phones far too often throughout the day, especially when we don't have any messages to answer and are unlocking the screen for no reason in particular. Dr Nerurkar said that checking your phone as soon as you wake up and before you go to bed can create ""mobile phone dependency"" and make you feel more stressed.
She claimed that on average, we check our phones 2,600 times a day, with 62% of us checking them within 15 minutes of waking up, and 50% checking them in the middle of the night. To stop this, the expert recommended limiting your phone usage to 20 minutes a day, and to ""set a timer if you have to for engaging and consuming"".
Social media platforms are often full of distressing content from conflicts, climate disasters, or simply people sharing videos of arguments they've had with people on the street. Watching these videos can lead to emotional distress, PTSD, and indirect trauma - and because it leaves you feeling stressed, your urge to keep scrolling is increased.
Dr Nerurkar explained: ""Graphic images and videos on your phone can increase your risk of PTSD and mental health conditions, as it triggers the fight or flight response and can lead to indirect trauma. Studies that your risk of PTSD increases when you consume graphic images, even if that thing that you're consuming is happening thousands of miles away, like any conflict, any climate disaster, anything.
""It's a cycle. The more videos you consume or the more graphic content you consume, your amygdala gets fired up, your Primal urge to scroll starts going haywire, and then you scroll some more, and then you scroll some more because you don't feel safe. This is a common occurrence.""

Q4G9D9W0D0_PIAICSVOAX3GMVQ,Fury as Tory students organise boozy debate on sinking migrant boats and Yemen invasion,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"10:04, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/fury-tory-students-organise-boozy-31944111,"Tory students have been accused of reaching a ""disgraceful new low"" after advertising a boozy event where guests could discuss sinking migrant boats.
The young Conservatives at University College London and King's College London also planned to discuss whether the UK should invade Yemen. They were blasted over the 'port and policy' evening, scheduled for next week.
Labour called on Rishi Sunak to ""come clean"" on whether the event was sanctioned. Tory HQ later said it has ordered the students to cancel the events. It comes less than a fortnight after five people made the dangerous crossing across the Channel.
Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth told The Sun: “While Tory students quaff port and laugh at weak Rishi Sunak’s failure to stop the boats, the British people are looking on in despair.
“Suggestions of sinking boats, after the tragic loss of life in the Channel last weekend, is a disgraceful new low. Rishi Sunak and his colleagues should come clean immediately over whether this event is sanctioned by the Conservative Party.”
An advertisement for the event said there would be debates over whether ""this house would invade Yemen"", and ""this house would sink the boats"". It featured a picture of a group of people in a small boat.
A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""This is obviously not acceptable and we will be asking the student groups to remove this and cancel the event.""
It comes as the Prime Minister ordered air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen for the second time this month. And his efforts to send asylum seekers to Rwanda - which he claims will deter people from crossing the Channel by small boat - suffered an embarrassing defeat in the House of Lords.
Peers defied the Government and voted by 214 to 171 to delay ratifying a treaty with the east African nation - a key plank of the PM's controversial policy. The setback comes just days after the under-fire PM begged the upper chamber not to scupper his plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda before the general election."
Q6MHNK7OYW_11L80GWKFFO3GV4,New Hampshire Primary results: Trump secures victory in tight race with Nikki Haley,Yelena MandenbergNews Reporter,"02:11, 24 Jan 2024Updated10:52, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/new-hampshire-primary-results-donald-31952460,"The Associated Press called the New Hampshire primary in favor of Donald Trump, who beat out Hayley despite tight margins.
Haley has finished second in New Hampshire to Trump, a setback in her effort to reset the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Both CNN and the AP are reporting that Trump got between 51-51 percent of the votes, with Nikki Haley trailing just slightly behind at 46.6%.
Trump is now a shoo-in to cinch the Republican nomination, grabbing the 22 delegates available from New Hampshire. Usually, the winner of both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire Primary is always able to get the nomination. The former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor, who invested significant time and financial resources in the state, ramped up her criticism of Trump after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race and she became the sole GOP alternative to him.

But the appeal ultimately failed to resonate with enough voters, and she's in a weakened position heading into a primary in her home state. President Joe Biden has won New Hampshire's Democratic primary as a write-in candidate.
Biden didn't campaign in the state or have his name placed on the ballot after New Hampshire defied new party rules by holding its primary before South Carolina's. ""What a great night, thank you so much! God is so good,"" said Nikki Haley on the eve that she ALMOST won New Hampshire.
Despite losing the 22 Republican delegates from New Hampshire after a tough primary race, Haley smiled and glowed from the podium as she made a speech acknowledging her loss in the state. ""The second we got an endorsement from Chris Sununu.. he shows up, he loved the people of New Hampshire, he has been with me every single day at every event. A true governor that doesn't just stand at a podium,"" announced Haley.
""I have news for all of them, New Hampshire is first in the nation and not the last,"" said Haley to cheers. ""This race is far from over, there are dozens of state left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.""
""Well, I'm a fighter. And i'm a scrapper. And now we're the last ones standing next to Donald Trump. And today we got close to half of the vote. We still have a ways to go but we keep moving up.""
""You can't fix Joe Biden chaos with Republican chaos,"" she continued as she dragged Trump for losing control of the senate and house during his presidency. ""Donald Trump should have been on the debate stage with me,"" she said to incredible cheers from the room.
""The first party that retires its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins the elections. And I think it should be Repiublicans that win the election,"" she said, even as she lost by several points."

Tom Clare and Sophie Piper are both heading back to the South African villa in the hope to find love. Tom found fame on the ninth series of the show, where he was with Samie Elishi, whilst Sophie was on the sixth series of the show.
Sophie is probably best known for being the sister of The Saturdays and This Morning star Rochelle Humes, and in 2020, she split from fellow show star Connor Durman when their romance ended during lockdown. The pair had been coupled up in the show, but soon things ended for them and the coronavirus pandemic only made them grow apart.
Speaking about her return to the show, Sophie revealed she was hoping to find true love this time around. She said: ""I had a fun experience the first time around but I didn’t go the full way and find love, so I'd love to find someone this time. I’m quite chilled and don’t want drama, so I think I will approach this time round in a similar way. I’m a one guy kind of girl.
""It’s a once in a lifetime experience and not something that comes up every day. You get the chance to really get to know someone without social media and the intense environment of going on a date.""
And it looks like there could be trouble ahead with Callum and Chris, as Tom revealed two of the current Islanders are his ideal woman. He said: ""I really liked Molly Smith, she’s stunning. Joanna Chimonides and Arabella Chi are both very attractive.""
Luckily for Tom, his ex Samie isn't in the villa but he admitted it would be ""hard"" if she was.
""I think it’s hard because I was obviously in love with Samie so I don’t know how I would react. We haven’t seen each other in a long time and things have been said. It would be difficult seeing her. Although we might have argued a bit, she’s got a good heart and I haven’t got a bad way to say about her,"" he explained if he was reunited with his ex on the show.
Discussing whether the show might help him find love once more, he said: ""When you’re with someone 24/7 you really get to know them. It can be such an alien environment, so you really get to know someone in a short space of time. It’s the best place!""
During her time on the show, Sophie was described by fans as the ""snake of the series"" when she lied to Connagh about kissing Connor, leading to a backlash from fans, whilst Tom also divided fans after being nicknamed 'Terrace Tom' due to his head being turned multiple times during his short time in the villa.

QC5PVMYRAW_15QJ5WW3OVE6NBG,Prince Harry's relationship with 'dangerous' stepmother Camilla exposed in documentary,Chiara FiorilloNews Reporter,"14:25, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/prince-harrys-relationship-dangerous-stepmother-31965230,"Prince Harry's turbulent relationship with Queen Camilla is set to be explored in a new documentary, it has been claimed.
In his autobiography Spare, the Duke of Sussex described his stepmother as ""dangerous"" and a ""villain"" while also accusing her of leaving ""bodies in the street"" while trying to change the public's perception of her. He also claimed Camilla ""sacrificed him"" so she would improve her standing, and blamed her for leaking stories to the press about his wife Meghan Markle.
A new Channel 4 production focusing ""various elements of Camilla as our new Queen"" is also going to tackle ""her dynamic with Harry"", according to an insider. This topic could gain ""the greatest attention"", they added.

The insider told The Sun: ""Although this documentary will focus on various elements of Camilla as our new Queen, her dynamic with Harry is tackled in the new show. That is likely to be one of the subject areas gaining the greatest attention and these Channel 4 documentaries on the royals aren’t afraid to go where other profiles often fear to tread.
""These shows have proved in the past they can spark a chain reaction that lead to further revelations and create major controversy."" A new royal book by Robert Hardman has claimed that despite Harry's comments in Space, for Camilla it was ""business as usual - with a smile and without a word"".
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
Released on January 18, the groundbreaking new book by Robert Hardman, titled Charles III: New King. New Court. The Inside Story has been dubbed ""an insightful and authoritative account of the first year of King Charles’s reign"" in the description on Google Books. While it largely details the King's first year since ascending to the throne, it also includes lots of juicy details about Queen Camilla, including bits on her relationship with her stepson, Prince Harry.
Hardman writes that the Queen ""was content to let it pass"", referring to the remarks Prince Harry made on 60 Minutes about her. He went on to detail her strength and the way she had changed as she prepared to take on the role in the past years, knowing that the late Queen's health was declining.
He wrote that she would not allow her friends to comment on Prince Harry's ""hurtful"" remarks. The history of the Duke of Sussex's relationship with his stepmother is a complex one, with both him and his brother, Prince William, begging their father not to marry her back in 2005. It had been a mere eight years since their actual mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a car crash while fleeing the paparazzi in Paris.
In his tell-all memoir Spare, Prince Harry talked of the hurt he felt when he accused the Queen of ""sacrificing"" him for her own public relations interests. He wrote: ""I have complex feelings about gaining a step-parent who I thought had recently sacrificed me on her personal PR altar."""
QDJY1Y15CX_DSB2YOE32166ICF,9 most vicious insults as Tory MPs turn on each other after call for Rishi Sunak to quit,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"07:54, 24 Jan 2024Updated09:30, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/9-most-vicious-insults-tory-31952576,"Rishi Sunak has woken up to a fresh leadership crisis after his deeply-divided rabble of MPs spent the night tearing chunks out of each other.
The PM faces an avalanche of calls to put the country out of its misery and just call a general election, with top Tories very publicly trading blows. Mr Sunak will head to Prime Minister's Questions today with a brutal monstering by former ally Sir Simon Clarke ringing in his ears.
Sir Simon warned the Conservatives must get rid of the PM or face a ""massacre"" at this year's general election. But it sparked a fresh wave of insults and arguments overnight, which saw the backbench rebel labelled ""self-indulgent"", ""selfish"" and ""divisive"" by his own colleagues. Ironically the public call for the PM to be ousted came just days after election guru Isaac Levido warned backbenchers they face a mauling if the civil war continues.
SIr David Davis: “The party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests.”
Tim Loughton: ""With colleagues like this who needs enemies?""
Andrew Bowie: ""Get a f***ing grip"".
Tobias Ellwood: ""I suspect there will be very little support for Simon Clarke.""
Sir Conor Burns: ""Voters won’t forgive self-indulgent infighting.""
Dame Priti Patel: ""Engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence only serves our opponents.""
Damian Green: ""Simon Clarke is wrong and unwise to try to start another internal fight.""
Kevin Hollinrake: ""Of course, some people panic at a difficult time.""
Sir SImon Clarke: ""Personal insults don't change the facts.""
Following Sir Simon's blistering broadside at the ""uninspiring"" PM, fellow Conservatives piled in accusing him of making a bad situation worse. Former Brexit Secretary SIr David Davis admitted: “This is getting silly.”
He continued: “The party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests.” Meanwhile backbencher Tim Loughton ruefully wrote: ""With colleagues like this who needs enemies?""
In a leaked WhatsApp message, minister Andrew Bowie reportedly urged rebels to ""get a f***ing grip"". He went on: “Can we, for more than five minutes, dispense with the civil war and leadership speculation.”
It got worse for Sir Simon, as others refused to stick their neck out with him - highlighting the deep divisions within Tory ranks. Tobias Ellwood hit out, branding it ""dangerous"" and ""selfish"". And he said: ""I suspect there will be very little support for Simon Clarke.""
And former minister Sir Conor Burns posted on Twitter: ""Voters won’t forgive self-indulgent infighting. We have a job to do and we should get on with it. Politics isn’t a game - we serve people and it is trust. Those who can’t accept that should shut up or shove off.""
Dame Priti Patel wrote: ""At this critical time for our country, with challenges at home and abroad, our party must focus on the people we serve and deliver for the country. Engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence only serves our opponents, it’s time to unite and get on with the job.""
And Damian Green, who chairs the influential One Nation group of centrist Tories, posted: ""Simon Clarke is wrong and unwise to try to start another internal fight. Let’s start attacking our opponents, not each other.""
Business minister Kevin Hollinrake that there was some ""panic"" behind Sir Simon's call for a new Tory leader. He told Times Radio: ""Of course, some people panic at a difficult time. This is not the overwhelming view of the party.""
A prickly Sir Simon later hit back at his angry colleagues, defiantly posting: ""Personal insults don't change the facts."" He wrote: ""Every Conservative MP will need to live with the decision they make in the coming days for the rest of their lives. Failing to act would itself represent a decision. Look at the polls. Personal insults don’t change the facts. I have no further comment to make.""
The public falling out has added pressure on the PM to call a general election. He is understood to favour limping through until November, but the latest psychodrama raises fresh questions over whether he can survive until then.
He was spared a potentially fatal rebellion over his Rwanda last week when just 11 Tories followed through on their threats to vote it down. The number would have been 12 but Lee Anderson - who quit as a Tory deputy chairman in protest - wimped out after other MPs laughed at him.
Labour's Sarah Owen said: ""Neither Rishi Sunak or Simon Clarke are doing any of this for the good of the country. This binfire of a Tory melodrama is all about power, not about the people they are supposed to serve. We need a General Election now!""
Labour’s campaign chief Pat McFadden said: “There are many good reasons for getting rid of this clapped out Conservative government and liberating the British people from endless bouts of Tory infighting is certainly one of them.
""Whilst the Conservatives fight among themselves, Labour will fight for a better future for the country, where economic growth is felt in every part of Britain, where we generate the wealth we need for the NHS, good schools and safety on our streets and where we renew the country after 14 years of Tory failure."""
QGF85X3Z3S_QWJQK8H3VMY48ZI,Man 'allergic to everything' spends 11-hour flight in toilet after smelling fish meal,James Sweetnam,"18:14, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/man-allergic-everything-spends-11-31959741,"A man described how he had an appalling experience flying over the Atlantic after the scent of a fish meal triggered his allergies.
Lucas Gonçalves Dias, 32, who says he is allergic to ""almost everything"", boarded his flight from Brazil to Portugal, with a layover in Paris, with a spring in his step. After informing the staff of his condition, he settled down for what he expected to be a comfortable journey.
His optimism was reinforced, when an announcement was read out over the tannoy, letting his fellow passengers know about the circumstances. However, staff then served a fish dish to passengers.
Upon smelling the meal, a panicked Lucas lept out of his seat, sprinting towards the bathroom, locking the door behind him in a bid to escape his worst fears coming to fruition.
The university professor told local media that as soon as the stench of the fish reached his nostrils, he began to sweat profusely, turned red and developed an itch. Luckily, the bathroom had a filter changing the air, which allowed Lucas to escape what had essentially become a dangerous area for him.
Due to the extent of his allergies, the academic had to stay in the bathroom for the entire flight, having nothing to do other than read the instructions on the wall.
Unfortunately, Lucas has a host of allergies, including nuts, coconut, cinnamon, pineapple, seafood, dairy, greens, latex, food colouring and preservatives, chemicals with strong odours, dust mites, mould, some types of pollen, and fur. His worst scare occurred when the scent of his neighbour's cooked mussel and prawn stew hit his house in Victoria, Brazil, sending him into an anaphylactic crisis.
The situation soon turned terrifying, with Lucas suffering a reaction that turned him purple. Luckily, his friends were on hand to help, calling the medics, who desperately fought to save his life. And it's thanks to their heroics that Lucas, who was declared dead after suffering a cardiac arrest, managed to survive.
Born in Colatina, he has had to go to hospital a whopping 20 times in just eight years. However, his allergies haven't prevented the Brazilian from finding love, with the intellectual, tying the knot with the love of his life three years ago."

Rescue teams said that while they didn't get the result they wanted, they are still proud of the crews who ""made every effort to find the casualty"".
Posting to Facebook, the RNLI said: ""At 18:40 last night the volunteer crew of our all weather lifeboat were tasked by UK Coastguard to assist with the search for a person in the water off Porthcawl. The force 10 onshore wind and heavy sea made launching of Porthcawi lifeboat impossible and so The Mumbles lifeboat joined the search already underway from Coastguard teams from Port Talbot, Lantwit and a Coastguard helicopter from St Athan. A search at sea continued for over 5 hours.
""Meanwhile Barry Dock lifeboat also battled through heavy seas to join the search as the tide turned in the Bristol Channel. Our All weather lifeboat returned to station at 00.50 as the search was halted due to deteriorating conditions. Lifeboat coxswain Josh Stewart said ""I'm immensely proud of our crews enthusiasm and professionalism last night.
""The conditions were some of the worst they'll ever have to launch into. The swell was well over 5 metres high and beam on which made visual search pretty tricky but it's what we train for and while we didn't get the result we wanted I'm still proud of our crew who made every effort to find the casualty. Our thoughts are with the casualties friends and family at this time.""
Rescue teams from Barry Island had resumed their search this morning. A HM Coastguard spokesperson said: ""HM Coastguard has resumed a shoreline search this morning in Porthcawl, at the request of South Wales Police.
""Coastguard rescue teams sent from Porthcawl, Port Talbot, Oxwich and Barry Island. For further details, please contact the police""
An alarm was raised just before 6pm on Tuesday, following reports of a person in the water off the coast of Porthcawl, south Wales. Rescue teams headed out on a search into the evening. A helicopter from St Athan was used to support the search along with the RNLI's all-weather lifeboats from Mumbles and Barry Dock. South Wales Police were alerted of the incident.
The Met Office's Yellow weather warning for wind - which means conditions can result in fallen debris, road and bridge blockages and damage to buildings, remains in place in the area until 3 pm as coastguards continue with their search.
In thier latest statement released today, South Wales Police said: ""South Wales Police was called just before 6.05pm last night, Wednesday 23rd January, with a report of a woman having been seen by the water’s edge just off the Esplanade in Porthcawl.
""Emergency services responded including HM Coastguard, the RNLI, and the National Police Air Service (NPAS).
""HM Coastguard is continuing the maritime search effort with assistance from our specialist search team and other agencies.""
Rescue teams, who travelled in extreme conditions last night were praised for their bravery and dedication. One Facebook user said: ""Total respect for your crew last night listening from the boat house while the wind was howling rain lashing down brilliant job."" Another added: ""So many lifeboats crew risking your lives to help others. You do amazing work in terrifying conditions.""
One person said: ""Well done to all involved in the search and thoughts go out to the friends and family of the person who they were looking for."""
QHNV63A3WH_WKENAIE9KW5CCDV,Griselda: The real life story of female cartel boss played by Sofia Vergara,Emily RetterChief Feature Writer,"18:28, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/tv-film-news/griselda-real-life-story-female-31949370,"Griselda, Netflix's new show, stars Sofia Vergara and is based on the life of Griselda Blanco, was said to order death in the way others might order a pizza. Dubbed the Cocaine Godmother, she may have had a cute dimple in her chin and once borne a passing resemblance to Betty Boop. But make no mistake. She was a monster. The five-foot widow was the queenpin among kingpins in the Colombian Medellin drug cartel of the 70s and 80s. Heading a near-unrivalled campaign of violence, she was a trailblazer for women entrepreneurs the world over for all the worst reasons. A forerunner and rival to Pablo Escobar, the three-times married mother-of-four boasted a Malibu mansion, a bronze sculpture of herself, a tea-set once owned by the Queen and a gold-plated sub-machine gun embedded with emeralds. She had killer style and is said to have raked in £60million a month at her peak. This landed her a £1.5billion fortune, surely making her the first female billionaire drug boss. A lust for murder, the bloodier the better, was key to her success. She is believed to have invented the point-blank motorcycle drive-by killings for which she became notorious.
Some say she had 200 deaths to her name. Others estimate up to 2,000. Among killings definitely ordered by her was the shooting of a boy of two. Indeed all three of her husbands met brutal ends, too ? with none other than Griselda under suspicion. They were to earn her another name... the black widow. Full of such horror and drama, it?s no surprise Griselda?s story is coming to our screens in more than one version.
Griselda, starring Sofia Vergara, began streaming on Netflix 25 January. Former Miami homicide detective Nelson Abreu said Griselda was worse than any of the men involved in the drug trade. He added: ""People were so afraid of her that her reputation preceded her wherever she went."" Another drugs expert cut to the heart of her cold-bloodedness when he remarked: ""Other criminals killed with intent. They would check before they killed. Blanco would kill first and then say 'Well, he was innocent. That's too bad but he's dead now'.""
There's no denying the chilling story of this heinous femme fatale is fascinating and seductive by turns. But the reality is sickening in the very extreme. Arguably, Griselda didn't have the best start in life. Born in Cartagena, Colombia, in 1943, she was abandoned by her father and moved to the drugs capital of Medellin when she was young. Her mother, said to be an alcoholic and a prostitute, is reported to have beaten her.
Unsurprisingly, the youngster turned to crime. It is believed she picked pockets. Some claim that at 11 she was involved in the kidnap of a 10-year-old boy and helped kill him when a ransom demanded wasn't met. She encountered her first husband on the grim streets as a teen. Carlos Trujillo was a small-time forger of documents and a boozer. They went to New York together in the 1960s, using their own false passports, and once there a business faking IDs migrated to dabbling in marijuana.
Their three sons, Osvaldo, Dixon and Uber, were eventually to follow their mum into the drugs trade and ultimately lose their lives to it. Griselda and Carlos divorced, although he was later murdered, reportedly because of a business dispute with his ex-wife. One down. Amid the 1970s cocaine boom Griselda sniffed out real business opportunity with the help of her second husband. Alberto Bravo was a trafficker for the Medellin cartel and it was he who introduced her to the world she was to take by storm. Perhaps this is where women's intuition came in.
In a unique move, she bought an underwear business in Colombia and began making bras and girdles with secret compartments. Then she recruited female couriers to smuggle cocaine in them. In 1971, before Escobar came along, she and her husband became the first cartel to import from Colombia into the United States. Bravo returned home to Colombia to run the operation there. Griselda remained in New York, always managing to elude capture, most notably during Operation Banshee in 1974, one of the first major stings by the Drug Enforcement Agency. She managed to flee before the authorities even laid eyes on her. Griselda went back to Colombia, still the chameleon queen of the image change, and with wigs galore she continued to evade investigators.
It was here in 1975 her second husband met his grisly end, leaving her free to take the reins. Griselda is believed to have confronted him in a Bogota nightclub car park over millions missing from profits of the cartel. She drew a pistol, he a sub-machine gun, but in the end it was he and his bodyguards who lay dead. Griselda walked away with a stomach wound and a seemingly renewed gusto for trade. Before long she was flooding Miami and California with cocaine as well as New York.
Her distribution network across the US brought in tens of millions of dollars a month as she trafficked more than a ton and a half at a time. Business boomed and Griselda made her name through violence and utter fear. As rivals increased and feuds gathered pace, bodies racked up. She was at the centre of the 'Cocaine Cowboys' in Miami where she kept a luxury penthouse. The lawlessness included a particularly bloody mall shoot-out in 1979.
A refrigerated truck had to be rented from Burger King to cope with all the bodies. But it was her attitude to the killings which elevated her from even her most monstrous peers. Not least her preferred means of murder ? using henchmen to shoot at point-blank range from motorcycles.
A Drugs Enforcement Agency officer said: ""Griselda loved killings. Bodies lined the streets of Miami as a result of her feuds. She gathered around her a group of henchmen known as the Pistoleros. Initiation into the group was earned by killing someone and cutting off a body part as proof of the deed. And the killings were personal, too. She not only killed rivals and wayward lovers but also used murder as a means of cancelling debts she didn't want to pay.""
She found time to marry her third husband, drug trafficker Dario Sepulveda and had a fourth son, Michael Corleone Blanco. But Dario was also later killed. Perhaps he should have known what was coming. This time a car ambush was the method. Griselda, meanwhile, dodged capture for years. Rumours every so often that she had been shot proved unfounded. Finally she was tracked down in California and arrested in 1985.
Reportedly she was visibly shaking - a rare glimpse of the woman behind the monstrosity and the legend. Her youngest son, just six at the time, was brought up by his grandmother and guardians, dodging various assassination attempts himself and needing armed bodyguards.
Somehow, today, he is still alive. ""I lived the life of a teenage capo,"" Michael explained. ""I wasn't allowed to be a kid. I had to risk my life every single day I left the house for being a Blanco."" Griselda, meanwhile, was sentenced to 13 years, initially for drugs offences. It was only in 1994 she was finally convicted for three first-degree murders, including that of the two-year-old son of a rival shot in the head travelling in his dad's car.
But the case, which depended on the evidence of one of her former hitmen, collapsed and she ultimately pleaded guilty and received just 20 years. In June 2004, having dodged the electric chair, she was freed and returned home. She is said to have discovered Christianity but no amount of Bible reading was to save her in the end. In 2012, aged 69, she was shot dead in a motorcycle drive-by killing of the kind she had once eagerly engineered. She was leaving a butcher's shop carrying a bag of meat. The assassin sped away.
Griselda is currently streaming on Netflix"

As the winter weather rages on and the UK is gripped by storms, Brits across the country are trying to stay cosy at home.

From the age of 18 to 42, his daughter, now 57, endured almost daily rapes by her father Josef Fritzl in the purpose-built lair below the family home in Austria where she lived with the three children sired through his incest.
Without sunlight, fresh air, and other human interaction, Elisabeth lived a horrendous solitude for nearly a quarter of a century until she was finally able to escape, with her ordeal stunning people across the globe in horror. Monster Fritzl, who fathered seven of Elisabeth's children, was finally exposed when one of their children had to go to hospital and the alarm was raised.
He was put behind bars for life in a high-security prison for mentally disturbed offenders, Stein Prison, in 2009 after he was found guilty of enslaving his daughter. But now aged 88 and nearing 15 years of his sentence, he is soon eligible to apply for parole and has been granted conditional release.
The serial rapist has been ruled as no longer posing a threat to public safety, according to the latest psychiatric report. Heidi Kastner, one of Austria's leading forensic psychiatric experts from Linz University, spent a year preparing her study of Fritzl and argued he should be transferred through the normal prison system at the Krems-Stein jail, as part of a first step towards freedom.
Today, the incest monster was snapped in a car as he arrived at Landesgericht District Court at 7.20am UK time for a hearing. It comes after he was allegedly seen visiting local cafes near Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau, Austria. He is set to be moved to a regular prison before he is eligible for release in March.
His attorney, Astrid Wagner, said after the hearing: ""We were successful. It was a long hearing. He told again how he regrets what he did. He was actually close to tears.
""'In summary, the court came to the conclusion that my client is actually no longer dangerous."" Most people watching the awful story unfold wondered how Elisabeth would ever manage to put the pieces of her life back together. But just as she managed to survive against the odds - keeping her sanity and caring for her children in horrific circumstances - she also surprised many by overcoming her ordeal and finding happiness.
Elisabeth was given a new name following the trial, with strict laws to prevent her identity from being revealed. She now lives with her six surviving children in a brightly-painted house in a tiny hamlet in the Austrian countryside, which also cannot be identified and only referred to by the country’s media as ‘Village X’.
The children, now aged between 21 and 35, sleep in rooms with doors permanently open after undergoing weekly therapy sessions to eliminate the traumas they suffered inside the cellar. Their two-storey family home is kept under constant CCTV surveillance and patrolled by security guards, while any stranger caught lurking nearby can expect to be picked up by police within minutes.
The close-knit village's residents also help protect the family, according to reports. One photographer sent to Village X recalled: ""There are only a few villagers and they are all in with the police. I was quickly surrounded by people who told me: 'They don't want to talk to you, they don't want to see you - please get out of here.""
But a local restaurant owner revealed: ""The family is doing more than fine. They come often to my venue and we treat them like any other guests. Everybody in the village knows them."" Another resident said: ""Given what they have been through, they are very polite, happy and smile a lot.""
And in 2009 it was revealed that, just a year after she escaped captivity, Elisabeth found love with Thomas Wagner, a bodyguard with the Austrian firm A&T securities who had been assigned to protect her. Thomas, who is 23 years younger than Elisabeth, moved to live with her and her family.
One of the team of psychiatric carers revealed that the romance has helped her overcome the traumas of her past, leading her to radically scale back the therapy she was undergoing for post-traumatic stress disorders. The psychiatrist said: ""This is vivid proof of love being the strongest force in the world.
""With the approval of her doctors she has ceased psychiatric therapies while she gets on with her life – learning to drive, helping her children with their homework, making friends with people in her locality. She lost the best years of her life in that cellar; she is determined that every day remaining to her will be filled with activity.""
Another source close to the medical team that still monitors the family recently added: ""It may seem remarkable but they are still together. Thomas has become a big brother to the children.""
In 2011, Josef Fritzl’s sister-in-law, who calls herself Christine R, broke the news blackout on Elisabeth by giving a fascinating insight into how she has returned to normality following her nightmare. She said: ""Elisabeth likes to go shopping a lot. She couldn't do that while she was locked in the cellar for those 24 years.
""She loves jeans with glitter pockets and she passed her driving test without difficulty. Now she's looking for a car. The kids are all going to school and working hard. Felix, the smallest one, has got a PlayStation.""
She added that Elisabeth had no financial worries after Austrian authorities provided her with £54,000 in child allowance that she was denied during her time in the cellar. After she was finally rescued in April 2008, Elisabeth needed as much resilience to face her life in freedom as she did to survive her decades of captivity.
She was placed with her three ""cellar children"" under the care of a team of social workers, therapists and psychiatrists at a clinic outside Amstetten where she lived in hospital rooms, overlooking trees and a wide lawn. Felix was reported to have spent much of his time stroking the grass on the lawn in sheer wonderment.
Berthold Kepplinger, the clinic's chief physician at the time, remarked: ""For them a passing cloud is a phenomenon."" Soon after her release Elisabeth started to develop an obsession with cleanliness, showering up to 10 times a day, according to reports.
Elisabeth was gradually reunited with her three teenage ""upstairs"" children, Lisa, Monika and Alexander, the brothers and sisters her three cellar children had never met. Her relationship with her mother, Rosemarie, was harder to repair, with Elisabeth finding it difficult to believe she had no idea she had been imprisoned underneath her feet.
Rosemarie reportedly fled the home she shared with Fritzl soon after the scandal broke, and now tries to supplement her meagre pension by selling homemade bags and paintings of flowers. Christine R said she now visits Elisabeth and her family at least once a week, claiming “whatever suspicion there was has gone"".
Over the past 15 years, Fritzl has languished at Austria's Stein prison. He also changed his name, to Josef Mayrhoff, perhaps in a pitiful attempt to escape his own infamy or paint himself as a victim, and he is now believed to have dementia.
Mark Perry, a British journalist who interviewed Fritzl in his prison cell, says he has shown no remorse for his crimes. He recalls: ""He kept saying, ‘Just look into the cellars of other people, you might find other families and other girls down there.’ He doesn’t believe he’s done anything wrong at all. He thinks it’s a failure of justice and that he’s been wrongly locked up."""

QVE01QCVXB_TGY0GXO8ELT4EQK,Christine McGuinness' divorce agony as she 'fears letting go of Paddy' and being vulnerable,Zoe DelaneyAssistant Showbiz Editor,"08:40, 25 Jan 2024Updated09:55, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/christine-mcguinness-divorce-agony-fears-31962475,"Christine McGuinness is reportedly worried about letting Paddy McGuinness as they prepare to officially divorce and set up new seperate homes.
The Real Housewives of Cheshire star, 35, split from the Top Gear presenter, 50, in 2022 after 15 years together as a couple and 11 years of marriage. Both stars have seemingly remained on good terms - with Christine even celebrating Paddy's 50th birthday last year - and currently still live together with their three children.
But that could all be set to change this year, with Christine hinting earlier this month that her estranged husband is preparing to move out and finally leave the family home. ""I am worried about when it comes to that time of us living in separate houses,"" she admitted. ""It will happen one day.""
It's now claimed that the idea of not cohabiting with Paddy is playing on Christine's mind - with the prospect of living alone ""scaring"" the mum-of-three as she ""worries about letting Paddy go"" once their divorce is finalised.
""Christine is worried about the inevitable time when Paddy will move out. Even though they're not romantically in a relationship, they've been together so long that not living together any more scares her,"" a source has claimed to OK! magazine. ""They've built a life together and she knows she will feel vulnerable when he does go. She also sees it as the final step for them. There are times she is worried about letting Paddy go, but she is a strong independent woman who is a great mother and will thrive on her own.""
Paddy and Christine, who co-parent twins, Penelope and Leo, 10 and Felicity, 7, together, announced the end of their 11-year marriage via a joint statement in July 2022, telling their fans they planned to still live together in their family home alongside their three children. ""We'll always be a loving family, we still have a great relationship and still live happily in our family home together,"" an extract from the lengthy joint statement read.
Earlier this month, Christine reportedly warned Paddy that ""the gloves are off"" when it comes to their divorce, with the reality TV star hiring a top lawyer to handle proceedings. Christine is said to want to continue living in their £4million mansion as part of their potential settlement.
Lawyer Catherine Bedford, who represented Ant McPartlin's ex-wife Lisa Armstrong, is expected to represent Christine. A source claimed: ""Christine really wanted to work with a woman during her divorce and Catherine is one of the best in the business,"" The insider also revealed Christine's desire to stay in the family home, saying it would be ""heartbreaking"" for her to leave.
Ms Bedford, known as a ""Pitbull attorney"" in the US, has represented big names like Sophie Turner and Dubai royalty Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Now, she is representing Christine and Paddy faces a potentially costly divorce. On Monday, the process to formally end their marriage began, with Christine hiring lawyer Catherine Bedford.
A close friend of Christine told Mail Online: ""The gloves are off, she was good to Paddy, she stayed at home and brought up his children while he was out earning money. It's going to be an expensive divorce for Paddy. Christine has had enough.""

QXDWK7GFX7_ER69KSM6LWR53VE,Tories blasted for 'scapegoating' immigrants with 'British homes for British workers' plan,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"16:25, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-blasted-scapegoating-immigrants-british-31968164,"A Tory proposal to give UK families higher priority for social housing has been branded ""divisive and depressing"" by campaigners.
Officials are reportedly considering a “British homes for British workers” scheme in a desperate effort to boost Rishi Sunak’s attempts to sound tough on immigration.
It comes as the Tories continue to trail Labour in the national polls and amid panic over losing votes to the right-wing Reform UK party - launched by Nigel Farage. According to The Guardian the government is planning to launch a consultation on the new proposals next month.
The plan may also be an attempt to shift blame for the housing emergency from the Conservatives' dire record with around 1.2million on the social housing waiting list.
The chief executive of housing charity Shelter, Polly Neate, described the scheme as ""scapegoating at its worst"", saying: ""It's divisive and depressing - and I dread to think what's coming as the election gets closer"". She added: ""Not only does it ignore the fact that there are already stringent rules so only UK citizens or those with settled status can access homes for social rent, but it blames a group of people for a housing emergency that they did not create.""
According to Shelter 21,600 social homes were either sold or demolished in 2021-22 while just 7,500 new homes were built - leading to a loss of 14,100 homes. Government figures from the same year also show 9 in 10 of the lead tenants in social homes are UK citizens.
The charity Crisis also hit out at the policy for ""scapegoating"" immigrants, saying: ""To end the housing crisis we need proper solutions - not policies that exclude people from support when they need it most.""
Campaign group the National Housing Federation added: ""Everyone deserves a safe, secure place to live. The housing crisis isn't caused by immigration - it's caused by years of underfunding and short-term policies for social housing. The way to solve this is a long-term plan for housing which addresses the severe shortage of social homes.""
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: “I’ve seen the speculation on this. I wouldn’t comment on the policy speculation. All I can point to is the 659,000 affordable homes built over recent years including 166,000 for affordable rent.”"

Fans had become concerned over Hannah Elizabeth's whereabouts in the villa after she'd rarely been spotted on screens. The model first appeared on the ITV2 show eight years ago but has returned to the South African villa for a second chance at love. So far in the series, Hannah has yet to find a true connection.
Her lack of airtime left viewers wondering if she is still in the villa. However, in scenes set to air on Wednesday night., Hannah gets up close with a fellow Islander. She had made an impression on Tyler Cruickshank during a game of It's Popping Off and it appears he wants to return the favour.
Tyler invites Hannah to the terrace where he says: “I think we get on on another level, which you might not have with the other guys.” Hannah replies: “I really like your chilled aura you bring to the Villa. It’s very nice among all this drama… I’d like to keep getting to know you babe, give me a cuddle.” As the two share a cheeky kiss or two, the news quickly circulates around the Villa causing trouble.
Fans have been missing following Hannah's journey in the villa as they took to social media to share their concerns. One wrote: ""What’s hannah doing here still?!? #LoveIsland #LoveIslandAllStars girlie just came here for the free holiday and i don’t blame her,"" whilst a second added: ""Is Hannah still here? #LoveIsland."" A third shared: ""I wanna see more of Hannah #LoveIsland.""
""Wait hello where is my girl hannah???? #LoveIsland,"" a fourth wrote, with a fifth sharing: ""Hannah is just on holiday in South Africa #LoveIsland."" A sixth added: ""Omg i forgot hannah was still in there #LoveIsland."" Before heading into the villa for a second time Hannah admitted she wasn't good at finding love.
She said: ""I’m returning to the Love Island Villa because I did it eight years ago and what an opportunity I never thought I’d get again. I’m not very good at finding love but I had a ball the first time, so I’m going to have a ball again. I don’t think I’ll do anything differently, I’m just going to go in there like I did in the first series , be myself and do my thing. It’s a great place to find love because it takes you out of your comfort zone. I'm looking forward to meeting people that I might not necessarily meet day to day.""
Hannah first appeared on Love Island season one and dramatically got engaged on the show. ""I only dated one person the whole way through and I got bloody engaged to him but I’m sound with him. If I saw him it would be totally fine,"" she shared of her time in the villa.

The fashion brand has sparked backlash for the ad which included an image of two girls in panafore dresses with the slogan: ""Make those heads turn in H&M's Back to School fashion.""
Social media users have branded the commercial as ""sickening"" and questioned the reasoning behind the ad. The fashion giant has since pulled the advert and issued an apology.
The retailer confirmed the removal and said: ""We have removed this ad. We are deeply sorry for the offence this has caused and will look into how we present campaigns going forward.""
Mumsnet founder and chief executive Justine Roberts said: ""Mumsnet users have long been concerned about a sexualised culture creeping into the lives of children - which is why we launched our Let Girls Be Girls campaign in 2010. It's disappointing to see that, 14 years later, retailers are still creating inappropriate adverts that prematurely sexualise young girls.
""While we're pleased that H&M have accepted their mistake and removed the advert, it really should never have been created in the first place. Our users would love to be reassured that they're taking steps to ensure everyone at H&M is crystal clear about the issue so it doesn't happen again.""
Social media users expressed their concern about the ad, with one describing it as ""H&M sexualising children"" and another labelling it ""inappropriate"". One wrote: ""What the hell is going on? This is sickening, sexualising kids."" Another questioned: ""what were they thinking?"" whilst a third wrote: ""Why are H&M suggesting schoolgirls in uniform ""'turn heads""?"

Buckingham Palace announced last week that His Majesty would be receiving 'corrective procedure' for the benign condition, which affects thousands of men every year. In a statement published today, the palace wrote: ""The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment.
""His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.""
Charles was diagnosed with an enlarged prostate on January 17, after going for a check-up because he was experiencing symptoms. It is understood that Charles wanted to share details of his diagnosis to encourage other men to get their warning signs checked.
The King was advised by doctors to rest ahead of the treatment, and his public engagements have been postponed for a short period while he recuperates. This comes one week after the Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic for planned abdominal surgery.
According to reports, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have given their support to the King and Kate following their health scares. A source said: ""The King and the Princess of Wales have received support from Prince Harry and Meghan regarding their health.
""The Duke and Duchess contacted both parties in different ways to pass on their concern and best wishes."" The olive branch comes after months of claims of a severely strained relationship between the Sussexes and the rest of the Royal Family.
This week, it was revealed the King has quietly made provision to stop Harry acting as a substitute for him if he falls ill or is abroad. In November, the King and Kate were named as the two senior royals who reportedly made comments about the colour of Prince Archie's skin, before his birth.
Brand expert Denise Palmer Davies claimed that Harry could be contemplating his return to the UK following the Firm’s latest health update. Speaking to Fabulous, she said: ""I would imagine Harry would be feeling a huge amount of guilt and be sick with worry.
""I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him make an unexpected trip to the UK within the next couple of months to check on both his father and Kate."" She added: ""I really do think the news will have shaken some sense into Harry - it would have given him some perspective and realisation that away from all the mud-slinging, it’s family and good health that really matters.""

Morgan Ribeiro travelled to Turkey to have gastric band fitted after being bullied about her weight for years, But she died in a Serbian hospital after a flight to the UK had to land in Belgrade when she became seriously Ill. Her devastated mother Erin Gibson, however, insisted she should not have had the operation and the companies carrying out such operations needed to be stopped.
Mrs Gibson, a mother-of-five, added: ""She was a beautiful girl, both inside and out. She booked this surgery without my knowledge. I would never had had let her go ahead with it if I had known.""
Erin became estranged from her 'head-strong' daughter just before the the operation in January this year. She said: ""She was interested in the bargain price. The clinic only highlights the successes, not the failures. If I had had known I would have shown her risks. I only found out she was having the operation on the day she flew out and by then it was too late.""
She paid tribute to the Serbian doctors and authorities, but revealed it was the third time a British patient who had a cosmetic procedure had needed to make an emergency landing in Belgrade because of medical complications.
Surgeons removed over 10cm of Morgan's small intestine but the 20-year-old had a heart attack on January 9 and was put in in an induced coma before she died four days later in Belgrade.
Her mum Erin Gibson, 44, says she had no idea Morgan had booked surgery in Turkey
Erin told The Mirror: “By the time I found out it was too late, she was already on the plane. I had that sinking feeling because I’d heard horror stories about Turkey. She’s always been a bigger girl and had a really rough time with it. I told her she was beautiful inside and out – she really was a beautiful girl. She was an artist, outgoing, silly, friendly and loving. I don’t want her life to be in vain.”
The young woman travelled from her home in South London with her boyfiend Jamie,19, for the £2,500 procedure, and did not want o spend years on an NHS waiting list. It was the doctors in Serbia who told Jamie that Morgan’s small intestine had been cut. They removed 10cm of her small intestine and hoped she would pull through.
But on January 9, Morgan suffered a heart attack and died four days later at 4am. It was the first time she had ever travelled abroad. Gastric sleeve surgery involves removing part of the stomach to leave a sleeve, reducing appetite."
R3M5HB05Z6_5T9S412QWW1C0U6,Prince William and Kate Middleton 'divided' over Prince George's future school,Lucy SkouldingFreelance writer,"23:00, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/prince-william-kate-middleton-divided-31951899,"Prince William and Kate are reportedly 'divided' over sending their eldest son George to boarding school.
Following in the footsteps of his father, Prince William, and Prince Harry, George is expected to enrol at Eton College. But the choice of which school to send their firstborn son to has reportedly been a point of contention between the Prince and Princess of Wales.
Despite her reservations, Kate has apparently accepted it is George's 'destiny' to follow in the footsteps of the royal boys and go to Eton. But she also fears that sending Prince George to the prestigious school goes against recent efforts to modernise the monarchy, it's been previously reported.
The Princess of Wales also reportedly worries about her son's well-being after her own traumatic experiences when she went to boarding school. Plus the Princess of Wales, according to the source, feels 'heartbroken' at the thought of her son going away, concerned that she will miss him desperately.
A source told the Express: ""Kate long disagreed with her husband about sending him away, even though it's tradition. Kate thinks sending him to such a stuffy, upper-class institution goes against all of their efforts to modernise the monarchy.
""Plus she'll miss George desperately. She and William argued about it for years, but he has finally won."" Reports suggest William and Kate have argued ""for years"" about where to send George for secondary school, but their visit to Eton last June sparked rumours that the young prince will indeed attend the college.
These days the prestigious school in Berkshire costs an average of £46,000 a year for a child to attend. Prince William started at Eton in 1995, where he paid £15,432 a term to attend. The school is only around a ten-minute drive from Windsor Castle, so Prince George would easily be able to make visits just like his father did.
A source told Touch Weekly: ""But (Kate’s) still heartbroken. She was horribly bullied at her first boarding school, and can't bear the thought of George suffering through that. And it still seems as if her family is being torn apart."""
R3O3BFMADZ_MH1WD5D3S6J31DH,Incest monster Josef Fritzl spotted having coffee in 'multiple' cafes by worried locals,Benedict Tetzlaff-DeasNews Reporter,"23:57, 23 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/incest-monster-josef-fritzl-spotted-31952407,"Infamous incest monster Josef Fritzl has been spotted drinking coffee in public by worried locals, it has been reported.
Fritzl was jailed in 2009 after he admitted fathering seven children with his daughter Elisabeth in an underground dungeon, where he held her prisoner for 24 years.
His horrifying crimes made headlines around the world. Now, local media in Austria has reported sightings of him at coffee shops near his prison in Krems an der Donau, Austria, apparently as part of preparation for his release.
Regional weekly newspaper Bezirksblatt claimed that Fritzl ""has been seen in different cafes of Krems.""
One staff member at the newspaper who has been covering the Fritzl case for many years told Newsflash that she had been ""told by several people I fully trust that they have seen him"", with ""several trusted acquaintances"" reporting sightings independently from each other.
Judicial officials have refused to comment on the report. The sightings follow the now 88-year-old Fritzl's attempts to secure release from the secure psychiatric wing of Stein Prison. After 15 years behind bars, the pensioner will become eligible for parole in March of this year under Austria's lenient sentencing laws. Inmates who are judged ready for parole can be freed, depending on their conduct and mental and physical condition.
Fritzl, who has repeatedly asked to be released, is set to have his case reviewed by justice and prison officials. As well as suffering from Alzheimer's disease, he is also said to be so frail that he now needs a walking frame to get around.
Adelheid Kastner, one of Austria's most renowned psychiatrists, said Fritzl was no longer a threat to society and would be incapable of carrying out any crimes. Psychiatrists and medics continue to monitor his condition.
Fritzl, who changed his name to Mayrhoff in an alleged attempt to evade physical attacks by other inmates, has reportedly applied for an early release several times in the past two years. His lawyer Astrid Wagner, who last year published a book based on a series of his letters, suggested that a new life in a care home is ""within the bounds of possibility"".
She said: ""I personally see a chance for a release. He fulfils all the criteria. This man is almost 90 years old and his mental condition is deteriorating. He needs support and care.""
She explained that she is able to communicate normally with him most of the time apart from the ""odd lapses"", including a delusion that his daughter had married Boris Becker. ""The next time I saw him, he told me they had broken up"", she said.
Josef Fritzl repeatedly raped and abused his daughter Elisabeth, who gave birth to seven children. One, who died at birth with breathing difficulties, was heartlessly tossed in a furnace by Fritzl. Three were brought up in the basement with their mother, and three others were brought up as foundlings by sick Fritzl and his wife.
In his trial in 2009, Fritzl pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment, manslaughter by negligence and incest. She has since changed her name and has received support from the authorities in protecting her identity and the well-being of her children."

The pair sparked romance rumours last year after they jetted off to Paris on a romantic break in November. Both Arabella and Rúben shared almost identical snaps in front of the famous Eiffel Tower, instantly sparking romance rumours. In their uploads, the same people could be seen in front of the iconic landmark which sees millions of tourists flock to the Parisian streets every year.
But just after Christmas, their relationship appeared to have been confirmed as they were spotted at the airport together heading abroad to welcome in the New Year. Sadly, their romance was short-lived and they split shortly after returning to the UK.
Arabella, 32, kept the ending of her relationship rather quiet and shocked viewers and her fellow Islanders when she turned up in South Africa. But the bombshell hinted that Dias was far from the man of her dreams after revealing that 2023 was her ""unluckiest year"" when it came to finding love.
The individual who is running Arabella's Instagram account has now shed light on her relationship after some questioned why she was in the villa. One fan asked: ""Is she still with her bf [boyfriend]?"" to which her social media manager responded: ""No it just didn't work out. She's back in the villa because she really wants to find the one,"" alongside a red heart emoji.
Meanwhile, before entering the villa, Arabella told The Sun: ""Last year was probably my unluckiest when it came to finding the one. I've been so unlucky in love."" She went on to tell the outlet: ""What I've learnt from dating last year is that you think you know someone but you don’t really know them at all.
""I dated people that perhaps, looking back, weren't best suited to me."" Elsewhere, Arabella addressed her high-profile romances when she returned to the dating programme, saying: ""I've been fortunate enough to be able to hang out in Hollywood circles but I still have not found love. I might have recently of come out of a relationship but I'm ready to meet the man of my dreams so get me back in that villa!""
She was previously spotted hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio's pal Richie Akiva while enjoying a lavish trip to Ibiza and partying on a private yacht. The couple reportedly dated before calling it quits in September.

Only recently, the ITV soap was full of heartbreak on New Year's Day as teenager Heath died after joyriding in a car with his twin sister Cathy and Angelica King. The teenagers had been desperate to go to a New Year's Eve party out of the village but couldn't get a lift and their dad Bob Hope refused to pay for a taxi. The trio were left bored at the B&B's party so decided to take matters into their own hands, stealing Wendy's car to joyride to the party.
Since the crash, both Cathy and Angelica have claimed the other person was driving with the village left torn over who to believe, especially Bob who has been refusing to see Cathy in order to protect her from himself. On Thursday, it was the day of Heath’s funeral, and a guilty Angelica decided to tell the truth.
Angelica confessed to her gobsmacked mother, Nicola King, that she was the one driving the car when Heath died as she worried about being sent to prison. On Friday night, it aired the aftermath as Nicola struggled with the bombshell and upon telling husband Jimmy King, he stormed out the house unable to cope.
In scenes this week, despite being urged to lie from Jimmy, Angelica runs over to the B&B where she publicly confesses to a shell-shocked Liam, Brenda, Cathy and April. Later, at the police station, she is arrested for causing death by dangerous driving. In upcoming scenes next week, Nicola is gloomy as she returns from resigning her post at the council.
Meanwhile, Jimmy and Nicola are both apprehensive as they tell Angelica there is a date for her hearing, leaving the family worried. Later, lawyer Ethan Anderson delivers Nicola the bad news that Angelica will likely face a custodial sentence. Yet there's more drama ahead as Bob is left shaking with anger when Jimmy admits he was the one who told Angelica to lie.
The next day, the King family prepare for Angelica's hearing and protective mother, Nicola, urges Jimmy not to tell Angelica about her potential custodial sentence. However, Jimmy is unsure if it’s the best strategy for their little girl and is later left shocked when a distressed Nicola desperately seeks a way out of Angelica's situation by lying by saying Angelica should claim ""not guilty"".
After an argument breaks out, the worried parents agree that they can help their daughter without making her lie. Later, Nicola and Jimmy head off with Angelica, where they spot Brenda and Bob, who are delighted the charges against Cathy have now been dropped.

RIUTKRP85N_PYZ1FMV4KMHSXFJ,Norwich deaths: Norfolk Police confirm IDs of all four family members found dead in house,Antony Clements-ThrowerNews Reporter,"15:37, 23 Jan 2024Updated15:46, 23 Jan 2024",20240116,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/norwich-deaths-norfolk-police-confirm-31931546,"Norfolk Police have provisionally identified all four family members found dead in a house in Costessey last week.
The bodies of two young girls, a 36-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, were found in a house on Allan Bedford Crescent on Friday morning. Norfolk Police have now confirmed that they are able to publicly name all four victims, subject to formal identification taking place.
The victims have been named as Bartolmiej Kuczynski, aged 45; Kanticha Sukpengpanao, aged 36; Jasmin Kuczynska , aged 12; and Natasha Kuczynska, aged nine.
Police received a call shortly before 7am from a member of the public who raised concerns for the welfare of people inside. Officers arrived at around 7.15am and forced entry to the address and found the quartet dead inside.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said: “We’ve spoken to witnesses and neighbours, carried out house-to-house enquiries, examined local CCTV and completed initial scene investigations. As a result of this, we’re not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
“This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved and it is clear from the reaction it’s caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community. We’ve had uniformed officers patrolling the area today and these will continue.”
The incident was initially referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) yesterday due to police contact at the address on 14 December, relating to a missing person enquiry. Later, the constabulary made a second referral to the IOPC concerning a 999 call made at 6am on Friday by the man at the address, prior to the incident, which didn't result in the deployment of officers.
The IOPC is set to assess the circumstances of the call and determine the appropriate level of investigation required. A friend of Kanticha - who was the girls' aunt - previously told the Mirror she was due to fly home some point next month. The girls' mum was at work as a caretaker when the deaths were discovered, friend Naty Wathanakul said.
Describing her friend, Ms Wathanakul said: ""She was very nice and caring to all friends of her, a really big supportive person, she helped everyone. We have been shocked and depressed since we knew about her death.
""I wasn't expecting that my friend wouldn't be able to come back alive. She was just a petite woman, I cant believe this happened to her. It was too cruel to handle, I was crying.""
Naty said Kanticha had previously visited the UK last June and had originally been hesitant about coming over this month for ""no reason"". She said: ""She didn't want to go to the UK this time for no reason because she went there once or twice a year normally.""
She went on to say: ""She loved her nieces, I always saw their pictures together. She is a single woman, no boyfriend, no husband, that's why she spent most of her time with those lovely girls."" Kanticha and her sister ran UK-based children's clothing store Malishop together.
Well-wishers including some crying girls left flowers in their memory beside the police cordon outside their home. Mother-of-two Jocelyn Atienza, 50, who lives nearby said: “It is just awful. The two girls were lovely sisters and beautiful girls. They were nice girls who were a little shy. We used to see them walking around together. They would look really happy when they were out with friends. The older one would catch the bus to school, and her little sister would walk to the primary school by herself.
“Their mother was friendly and we always used to say hi hello to each other in the street, but I have not seen her around for some time. She always used to put up decorations for Halloween and Christmas outside their home, but her husband was putting up decorations instead of her last December.”"
RJF57VKRG9_DH9LGERUWK34X3T,Rishi Sunak looks on furiously as Keir Starmer mocks Tories 'slagging him off behind back',Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"12:48, 24 Jan 2024Updated13:24, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-looks-furiously-keir-31955515,"Rishi Sunak looked on furiously at PMQs as Keir Starmer ruthlessly mocked Tory MPs ""slagging him off behind his back"" while cheering him in the chamber.
With the Tories tearing chunks out of each other as they argued over whether Mr Sunak should be ousted, the Labour leader hit out at the endless chaos.
Facing jeers from Tory MPs, Mr Starmer said: ""I love this quaint tradition where the more they [Tory MPs] slag him off behind his back the louder they cheer in here."" The PM also attempted to criticise the Labour leader's former legal career as Director of Public Prosecutions before being elected to the Commons.
But in a brutal swipe, Mr Starmer replied: ""In 2008 I was the Director of Public Prosecutions putting terrorists and murderers in jail. He was making millions betting the misery of working people during the financial crisis.""
He added: ""We have seen this story time and time again with this lot, party first, country second. Safely ensconced in Westminster they get down to the real business of fighting each other to death. The country is forced to endure their division and chaos, the longest episode of Eastenders ever put to film.""
The latest bout of Tory infighting came after former Cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke called on his colleagues to oust “uninspiring” Mr Sunak. In a blistering attack on the PM's authority, Sir Simon said Mr Sunak had ""gone from asset to anchor"". He added: ""The unvarnished truth is that Rishi Sunak is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred.
“I know many MPs are afraid another change of leader would look ridiculous. But what could be more ridiculous than meekly sleepwalking towards an avoidable annihilation because we were not willing to listen to what the public are telling us so clearly?”
In response to the comments, Tory MPs began trading insults as supporters of the PM labelled him “self-indulgent”, “facile”, “divisive” and “unwise”. But Sir Simon hit back: “Personal insults don’t change the facts.” He added: “Every Conservative MP will need to live with the decision they make in the coming days for the rest of their lives… Look at the polls.”
David Davis, the former Cabinet minister, admitted: “This is getting silly.” He went on: “The party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests.” Another Tory MP Conor Burns suggested the rebels “should shut up or shove off”.
In a message to Tory MPs calling for the PM's resignation, Mr Sunak's press secretary said on Wednesday: ""I think they are both known critics, lots of Tory MPs disagree with them. The PM is focused on the job” They added Sir Simon was ""entitled to his view"", but said: ""That won't distract us from getting on with what matters to people""."
RQH9U117CA_DR3JI6ER8W3VTKM,'Dragons' Den scandal has caused untold damage to vulnerable viewers - pulling episode is not enough',Ellie FryDeputy Online Features Editor,"11:19, 26 Jan 2024Updated14:39, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/dragons-den-scandal-caused-untold-31972890,"If a budding entrepreneur waltzed through the doors of Dragons' Den and brazenly pitched a 'DIY' cure to cancer, investors would be rightfully horrified. Yet that's exactly what happened on the show last week, only for a different debilitating, life-altering illness that leaves many of its sufferers bedbound, and in severe cases, threatens their lives.
Giselle Boxer appeared on the show to ask the Dragons for £50,000 for a 10% stake in her business, which sells ""DIY needle-free acupuncture for anxiety, migraines, hormonal issues, insomnia, weight loss and more"". In the episode aired last week, she claimed a similar product to the £30 gold-plated ear seeds she now sells helped 'cure' her ME, which has no known cure. Since the show aired, the BBC has been hit with a swathe of complaints from experts and charities who insist there's zero evidence to back up these 'snake oil' claims.
Her controversial Acu Seeds product made history on the show when all six investors put in an offer, but experts have since pointed out that none of the Dragons pressed Giselle on whether her business idea was at all backed by medical evidence. As outrage grew, the BBC doubled down with an abysmal response, claiming that ""Dragons' Den features products from entrepreneurs and is not an endorsement of them."" The Mirror then revealed that Giselle was approached by BBC researchers to take part, embroiling the show in further controversy and leaving charities questioning what due diligence took place to protect vulnerable consumers from misleading medical claims.
Myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME, is a long-term, multi-system illness that impacts a person's functional ability and quality of life. There is currently no cure, and the path towards finding one has been blocked for years thanks to chronic underfunding and a reluctance to give up bad science that harms patients. This isn't some casual cock-up from the BBC - Giselle's claims have entrenched the very stereotypes that charities, patients and experts have been desperately warning against for years.
Campaigners fought for decades to break free from the long-held misconception that ME is a psychiatric illness rather than a physical disease. Thankfully it is now widely recognised that ME is far from purely psychological, but the consequences of these views are sometimes fatal. Take Sophia Mirza, who died of complications due to severe ME and faced abusive treatment just before her death. She was forced under the Mental Health Act to undergo psychiatric treatment at a mental hospital after doctors dismissed her physical symptoms. Sophia deteriorated significantly and died shortly after being released. An autopsy found that her spine contained a massive infection. Merryn Crofts also tragically died just 10 days after her 21st birthday, after suffering from severe ME for six years and weighing less than six stone. Charities say she was only 'vindicated' in death after doctors dismissed her symptoms for years.
The battle against psychologization isn't the only fight that the ME community has had to endure. For years doctors clung to the notion that graded exercise would help ease symptoms, and it's caused irrevocable damage. One government-funded 2011 trial reported that all patients needed to do to overcome the disease was ""think positively"" and exercise. However, an untold number of patients who experienced mild ME symptoms became completely bedridden as a result. One MP, Carol Monaghan, called it ""one of the biggest medical scandals of the 21st century"". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) finally changed its guidance in 2021 after years of research and working closely with patients, but even they faced backlash from doctors who still insisted exercise should be prescribed.
Last night, the BBC finally pulled the episode after an open letter organised by Action for ME to the chairs of two House of Commons select committees said they were ""very concerned” by Giselle's pitch. The BBC claims to be taking these complaints seriously, but it took them a whole week - and a nationwide scandal - to act. The Dragons' Den episode may well have been watched by desperate patients looking for anything to ease their pain, exhausted by constant dismissal from doctors and society as a whole. The very least they deserve from their public broadcaster is responsible, medical-backed coverage.
The pain that comes with trying to explain the merciless reality of ME to those unfamiliar with the illness, particularly when faced with so much misconception, is acute. My mum has been battling the condition for over a decade. On her good days, she wades through unsettling brain fog, and chronic muscle pains and can't bear bright light or sharp sounds. The pain robs her of her freedom to walk much further than down the road. Her bad days see her bedbound, comatosed by pain.
I know how much my mum longs for the small, mundane joys that we all take for granted every day. To run and play with my younger siblings, to soak up the fresh air with the sun beaming down on her face, to go out for a meal without suffering for weeks afterwards. To have one day without pain. Yet so many people still believe ME is ""just being tired"".
Giselle's claims feed into a wider picture of dangerous perceptions about ME and should not be taken lightly. To suggest unfounded, holistic remedies to vulnerable disabled people is not only completely irresponsible, it works to further undermine the seriousness of the condition - and threatens to reverse the progress made in investment and understanding of the disease. The irony that six Dragons offered to invest in a business with no medical backing when ME charities have fought for decades for the appropriate funding to find a cure is maddening. Advocating for yourself at the doctors is hard enough as an able-bodied person, but ME sufferers are grappling with chronic pain and brain fog all while trying to simply convince doctors of the gravity of their plight.
The decision to pull and review the episode is welcome, but it shouldn't stop there. The BBC doubling down when experts challenged Giselle's claims is unacceptable, and shows exactly how far we have to go to unburden the ME community from this cruel culture of misinformation. The broadcaster should use this moment as a springboard for action and invest in responsible, in-depth reporting on the disease. A formal apology and a commitment to educating the public on the serious reality of chronic illness is the very least they could do.

The fast-fashion powerhouse stunned people when they launched a new beach collection last year as people began ordering swimming costumes, bikinis, and beach accessories ahead of their warm breaks. While many of us will want to look modest in the summer breeze, the fast-fashion brand evidently thought otherwise.
The retailer left people divided after launched a new bikini that was seriously skimpy. While the 'Butterfly Babe' two-piece thong bikini - which was priced at £11 - covers all the essentials on top, the bottom half tells a different story, with some claiming it looks ""bottomless"".
On the company's website, the model could be seen baring all in the tiny number. ""Well, this will leave an interesting tan mark,"" the brand joked on Instagram at the time.
Alongside this they shared a snap of the bikini, showing thin material and a jewelled butterfly on the bottoms that leave very little to the imagination. While the piece has brought in thousands of likes, users expressed their concern over the swimwear - with some questioning whether the outfit is a joke.
""Now y'all know damn well we can’t fit that,"" one person commented. Another user added: ""Ain't no way this is real."" ""Just swim bottomless at this point,"" a third penned..
Others showed their bravery, with many claiming the item is one for their wish list. ""Definitely adding to my wish list,"" one person said. ""I need this,"" someone else wrote.

Whitney Dean was seen leaving Walford this evening alongside her partner Zack Hudson as they planned to visit Bianca in Milton Keynes after learning she had split from her partner Terry. We know Whitney star Shona McGarty is departing the Square very soon as she bids farewell to the show, but with her and Zack so happy with their impending arrival, why will her character leave?
Tonight, Whitney and Zack decided they needed to visit Bianca in Milton Keynes, after bosses confirmed Patsy Palmer would be making a brief return to the show to coincide with Whitney's exit.
The pair handed over the market stall to Penny and Lauren Branning as they decided to head off to be with Bianca, but how will their meet up with Bianca go and what about it will make Whitney, at least, decide to leave Walford for good?
Speaking about her return, she said: ""I'm so excited to be reprising the role of Bianca. EastEnders holds such a special place in my heart so it’s always a pleasure to be back,"" whilst Chris Clenshaw, Executive Producer added: ""I’m thrilled to welcome the fabulous Patsy back to the iconic role of Bianca Jackson.

We know our audiences will be thrilled at her return as she is thrust into the heart of the drama alongside step-daughter Whitney.""
Whitney actress Shona has also confirmed she is departing the soap, but insisted it wasn't an easy decision.
""It wasn’t an easy decision because I've made so many friends. I’ve seen people come and go, and meanwhile, Whitney has been one of the longest-standing characters. I've had so much fun and done so many storylines, some of which have been sensitive, and I've been honoured to be trusted with such heavy stuff year after year. So I'm going to be sad to say goodbye to my friends and family, but it was the right decision for me as I want to do other things. After 15 years, I’ve had a pretty good run!"" she said.
Speaking about leaving the show, she added: ""I have decided to spread my wings and will be leaving EastEnders. I have loved my years in the show. I have been trusted with some incredible storylines and have made amazing friendships which will endure.""

The Islanders had returned to the South African villa for a second chance at love, however their time was brutally cut short on Monday night. Demi and Luis were booted off the show after the recent arrivals of Arabella Chi and Tyler Cruickshank. Arabella was asked to choose who she wanted to couple up with and she picked Chris Taylor, whilst newbie Tyler chose to recouple up with his ex-girlfriend Kaz Kamwi.
It left Demi and Luis getting dumped from the villa, yet things didn't seem over for the pair during their exit chat. Host Maya Jama spoke to the reality TV stars after the recoupling where they teased they could end up together. Demi has since taken their budding romance one step further and arranged a first date.
In her exit interview, Demi revealed: ""Although it’s extremely early days, Luis and I get on so well. We are not putting any pressure on anything but we have already arranged our first date; we’re going to go out for dinner in London, go out for drinks and go out clubbing with our friends after.""
Luis added: ""I want to take her out this weekend. We've spoken about going to a restaurant in London and then meeting up with our mates for a night out."" He has already gushed over Demi, as he admitted he is ""so happy"" to be leaving with her. Luis said: ""Even though we weren’t coupled up, I wish we could’ve stayed longer as I thought we were a solid couple. I loved the time we shared together and overall I’ve had the best experience, it was even better than my time on series 1.""
As he headed into the villa for a second time, Luis was convinced he would find love. He said: ""I’m a lot older and wiser, so I know what I am getting myself into. I don’t have a game plan at all - I am an open book so I will go with the flow and see what happens. I feel like theLove IslandVilla is the place best place to find different connections. I am confident I will find a connection again.""
Demi was also hopeful of finding the one, as she added: ""I am returning to the Love Island Villa because I am ready again to find love. I lost a lot of confidence with my health issues over the last couple of years but I’ve been smashing the gym this year, finding my confidence again and I’ve got it back. So, let’s find a man! It’s hard to find someone genuine or someone in the same industry as you who understands everything, it’s hard. I’m hoping to find someone in the same shoes as me and we can vibe.""

They've written to Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, stating that losing the ability to make steel from scratch will ""significantly impact"" the security of the country's essential defence supply chains. This warning comes after news that the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, the country's largest steel plant in South Wales, are set to close.
This could result in the loss of up to 2,800 jobs as the company moves towards a greener method of producing steel. Tata plans to replace the blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace, which can produce recycled steel.
However, the GMB has expressed concerns that British Steel intends to shut its blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, leaving the UK without a way to produce ""virgin"" steel. Matt Roberts, GMB national officer, said: ""We live in a turbulent global environment.""
He added: ""Both Nato's defence chief and Mr Shapps himself have warned that war in the next two decades is a possibility. Yet we are on the brink of losing our full ability to make our own steel, vital to our defence industry, not least in building warships.""
He concluded: ""It's utter folly."" and ""GMB is very clear, we must retain sovereign capability to make virgin steel.""

S7KDSLT9JX_CUUQ3D4TQ86GNV4,What is the Doomsday Clock and what is the current time?,Julia BanimAudience Writer,"15:17, 23 Jan 2024Updated15:20, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-doomsday-clock-what-current-31947817,"Last year, the Doomsday Clock ticked closer to the end times than it ever has done before - striking at a worrying 90 seconds to midnight.
Today (January 23), at 3pm, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, announced that it has stayed at 90 seconds to midnight, and many are understandably worried by the frightening update.
Designed by painter Martyl Langsdorf, the Doomsday Clock has been used to measure the likelihood of man-made disaster since 1947, with the 'midnight' point serving as a stark metaphor for the complete collapse of civilisation.
The clock is maintained by members of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board, with the aim of conveying 'just how close humanity is to destroying itself'. Every year, the group, which includes 10 Nobel laureates, determine how close we are to midnight, bearing in mind factors such as climate change, articial intelligence, and the looming threat of nuclear weapons.
First established two years after the end of World War II, the intention behind the clock was to warn people of the potential for manmade destruction, thus sparking action before it's too late. The time was initially set to seven minutes to midnight. In the decades since, the furthest we've been from global catastrophe was in 1991, when the time was set at a relatively 'safe' 17 minutes to midnight.
In a recent BBC documentary, Nuclear Armageddon: How Close Are We?, which was aired ahead of the yearly reset, reporter Jane Corbin looked into how close humanity really is to global catastrophe, and a number of viewers were left rather disturbed by the 'very uneasy' watch.
In the doc, three-times Royal Television Society Award winner Corbin, led viewers through the disquieting history of nuclear weapons as subsequent disarmament, including the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis.
Corbin visited the New Mexico site of Robert Oppenheimer's Manhattan Project, a US-led research and development programme which produced the very first nuclear weapons during the dark days of World War II.
As dramatised in the acclaimed 2023 biopic, theoretical physicist Oppenheimer did express some concerns about the use of the atomic bomb once it was out of his hands. In reality however, he did believe it was crucial in ending the war, and so did not go as far as to regret it.
Current affairs specialist Corbin also addressed the strategy behind Trident, Britain's nuclear deterrent based on the west coast of Scotland, which has sparked much debate over the years. In another part of the show, she spoke with a group of Suffolk-based activists who are currently campaigning against a new generation of US weapons potentially being deployed on UK soil.
The doc has made many viewers feel more than a little on edge. Taking to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, one person wrote: ""Well this is a mildly terrifying watch, very uneasy."" Another remarked: ""Ahh, I miss the 70s. The Cold War, growing up in the paranoia of a decadent Western government, an impending sense of doom with the threat of nuclear Armageddon. Happy days. I might have to cheer myself up with a nice film. Threads anyone?""

S7WRXNZYRB_IEPLH3P2JNSKH6X,'I built myself a canoe to paddle down the Amazon and got kidnapped by pirates',Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"13:51, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/central-south-america/i-built-myself-canoe-paddle-31904371,"When Michael Golodok is at home, he is a warehouse worker in Siberia. He enjoys the physical nature of the work as it allows him to focus his thoughts on his true passion - adventuring.
In a world in which communities compete to see who can go to the most countries, find the most cut off spot and tread on previous untrod ground, the 29-year-old's intrepid feats manage to stand out.
He recently completed a solo trip down the largest river in the world by himself, in a canoe he helped build. Along the way Michael encountered deadly snakes and spiders as he slept alone in his boat at night, nearly drowned when his vessel sank and narrowly survived a run-in with river pirates.
""I couldn't take anyone else on the trip as I knew how dangerous it could be. Also, I am used to relying only on myself and understanding how to behave in emergency situations,"" Michael told the Mirror, explaining that the presence of a guide would ""destroy the spirit of the trip"".
""For me, travelling is first and foremost about exploration, and what better way to do this than to be alone with yourself and nature on a canoe in the middle of the most incredible river in the world?""
Michael's journey began in 2022 when he flew from his home in Krasnoyarsk to South America where he made his way round the east, south and west coasts over six months, learning Spanish along the way, before arriving at the Ucayali River - where the Amazon begins.
There, in the eastern Peruvian city of Pucallpa, he employed a team of people for $120 (approx £94) to help him build a 3.5m long canoe big enough to hold all of his gear. A gas burner, water filter, first aid kit, power bank, emergency pack-raft and ukulele were among the essentials he packed in the craft before launching himself into the water.
Once he took the initial plunge and cast off from Pucallpa, Michael had no real means of turning back. It was just him, water that was powering his canoe along at 7.5mph, and 700 miles of river in front of him before the nearest city.
""I was scared because I couldn't know what to expect from the Amazon,"" the explorer said of the moment he first saw the river. ""I felt an inexplicable feeling of inner freedom. Once on the river, you lose some control over what is happening, but gain the opportunity to experience every moment. Time flows differently.""
Michael had to scrap his plans to sleep in a hammock covered by a mosquito net as the wet season dragged on, flooding the banks. Instead he adjusted his canoe so it could be slept in, hacking down reeds with a machete to build an awning for the vessel.
On his 39th night in the Amazon at 2am the Russian was fast asleep in his canoe when a ""huge private yacht the likes of which (he) had never seen before"" passed by. ""A huge wave arose that tore my canoe from the shore, the tree to which it was tied broke from the jerk, and as a result of the impact of the wave on the side, it sank,"" Michael said.
""The taste of the Amazonian water and sand on your teeth. Unforgettable."" After three and a half hours of bailing water and retrieving those sunken possessions which hadn't already floated down the river, the intrepid rower set off, full of enthusiasm at having been momentarily shipwrecked and having a new anecdote to tell.
Even the vast numbers of creepy crawlies, ferocious fish, constricting snakes hanging in the trees, veracious mosquitos, 5m crocodiles and spiders bigger than your hand were not enough to put Michael off his 2,800 mile journey. Nor did the electric eels he met along the way, which wary locals warned had a habit of zapping people into unconscious states until they slipped under the water.
The one thing that almost did, and the thing whose possibility had hung over him threateningly for a journey filled with countless warnings from people he'd met along the way, was a pirate attack.
Michael was immediately scared when he heard a motor start in the jungle. A moment later a boat holding four men appeared, speeding towards him. The men came close and asked what he was doing, to which the adventurer described his journey, explaining how he was living hand to mouth on the river, fishing for his dinner and exploring the forest. They wished him well and went on their way.
Five minutes later, they returned. ""I noticed one of the guys in the bow. Then I understood. These guys are pirates. The guy took out a submachine gun and pointed it at me, two more behind him took out smoothbore guns.""
Michael was taken to the shore and bundled out, his jacket thrown over his head. At gunpoint he helped the pirates strip his canoe, reassuring them the $30 (£23) they found was all he had, despite their disbelief that he would have so little. He was eventually tossed back in the boat and told to go.
Not only did the surprisingly generous pirates leave Michael with a machete, a boat and some food, they called him back as he paddled away to return some of the money they'd stolen in case he needed it down river. ""I cannot express in words the emotions that I felt then, something terribly scary but at the same time incredible,"" he said.
One sadness Michael felt at the end of his trip, 400 miles down the river from his pirate encounter, was towards the future of the rainforest. Many times he saw crews of men stacking logs onto ships while the sound of buzzing chainsaws accompanied him during much of his time on the water. The river bank was devoid of old trees in many places, their place by the water taken up by stumps or new monoculture crops.
In the future he hopes to travel to Melanesia to explore the Pacific Ocean and islands there. In the meantime, Michael is back working in the warehouse, working out how to write a book about his epic adventure. You can follow his trips including the Amazon journey on his Youtube channel, Got1Try.

S8JTBDN57O_HD9CHAWN1UEI2Z4,David Cameron to be summoned to Commons chamber - but he'll have to stand by doorway,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"00:01, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-summoned-commons-chamber-31950331,"David Cameron must be forced to come to the House of Commons chamber to answer questions from an obscure spot, MPs have demanded.
The Procedure Committee, which has a majority of Tory MPs, said in a report the Foreign Secretary should be summoned to the chamber. The ex-PM's political career was resurrected last year after Rishi Sunak appointed him Foreign Secretary in a shock reshuffle.
Lord Cameron, who is no longer an MP, was also handed a life peerage in the House of Lords in order to do the £104,360-a-year job. But in their report, the group of MPs said it was ""unusual"" for a peer to be serving in such a high-profile role in the Cabinet.
The MPs said inviting Lords to appear at the despatch box, from where MPs address the Commons, would ""risk blurring the boundaries between the two Houses"". Instead, they said Lord Cameron should appear at the ""bar"" - the white line boundary on the Commons floor where visitors must not pass while Parliament is sitting. It comes at a time with huge tensions in global affairs with the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and the recent UK-US air strikes in Yemen.
Tory chairwoman of the Committee Dame Karen Bradley said: “As elected representatives, Members of the House of Commons have a duty to question the Foreign Secretary. This is especially pressing in light of the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine."" The former Cabinet minister added: ""The committee has considered various mechanisms of scrutiny and taken the views of Members, while bearing in mind the practicalities of each proposal.
""We have ultimately concluded that all MPs should be afforded the opportunity to question Secretaries of State who sit in the House of Lords, with the Commons Chamber providing the best forum to do so. We hope the Government implements our proposals as quickly as possible, so that MPs can best scrutinise all Secretaries of States on behalf of their constituents.”
Labour's shadow Commons leader Lucy Powell said: ""This weak and chaotic Government is running scared of Parliament failing to allow MPs to scrutinise the Foreign Secretary. This welcome report from the Procedure Committee must be enacted quickly. The Tories have given up on governing, tainting politics with chaos and sleaze."" A Government spokesman said: ""We will carefully consider the committee's report and will respond in due course.""
Since being appointed Foreign Secretary last year Lord Cameron has faced questions on China after hailing a ""golden era"" of relations while he was PM. His work lobbying ministers for the collapsed firm Greensill Capital during the pandemic has also come under the spotlight. Earlier this month he repeatedly refused to say how much he earned at the bank because he was a ""private citizen"" before rejoining the government."

The reality star rose to fame in the 2018 series of the ITV2 show. She was last coupled up with Frankie Foster but walked out of the villa on day 40 when he was dumped in hopes of reuniting with him. However, their relationship didn't last long as the pair decided to part ways in August of the same year.
Last year, it was rumoured that Samira would be one of the stars flying to South Africa for the new series. The new version currently has the likes of Kaz Kamwi, Liberty Poole, Mitch Taylor, Anton Danyluk and more returning to screens in hopes of having better luck finding love the second time around.
In a recent chat, Samira explained she was too busy focusing on her career to appear on the show. The star is a woman of many talents and released her debut solo single Like This, Like That last year.
She also recently released her debut EP Dancefloors & Drama Vol.1. Samira told how she's also working on shooting a horror movie. ""It’s still a never-say-never thing, but I’ve got my EP out and I’m also shooting a horror film,"" she explained when asked about returning to the show.
Speaking to The Sun, she added: ""It’s called Bambi: The Reckoning. The director has done horror movies in the past about Winnie the Pooh and stuff like that."" The star went on to say she's 'booked and busy right now'. The TV personality previously discussed going from reality TV to music.
""I kind of always knew when I came out that I wanted to keep going with that kind of creative aspect,"" she explained while referring to her past career in the West End - which involved skills in dancing, singing and more. ""But it’s kind of difficult for people to take you seriously because they think maybe you are like a joke or you’re trying to do like a one-hit wonder.""
""Hopefully people don’t see that in me,"" Samira said to Metro.co.uk. Meanwhile, Love Island: All Stars viewers witnessed Demi Jones and Luis Morrison getting dumped from the villa. Demi and Luis were booted off the show after the recent arrivals of Arabella Chi and Tyler Cruickshank. Arabella was asked to choose who she wanted to couple up with and she picked Chris Taylor, whilst newbie Tyler chose to recouple up with his ex-girlfriend Kaz Kamwi.
It left Demi and Luis getting dumped from the villa, yet things didn't seem over for the pair during their exit chat. Host Maya Jama spoke to the reality TV stars after the recoupling where they teased they could end up together.

The flatulent tale was told to social media users by a fellow passenger who said he was seated in the same row as the man, who seemed as though he was ""maybe hungover or having a rough day"".
Before most people had boarded the offending man sat down while grumbling something under his breath and was ""audibly disgruntled"". Several minutes passed and by then the majority of people were seated. The fellow passenger, who recounted the story on Reddit, said he overheard him say loudly: ""You thought that was rude? Well how about this smell,"" whereby he farted. The social media user said he did not know what had provoked the comment.
The poster described how the incident got progressively worse from then on, saying: ""While kinda funny to overhear, it was uncalled for, especially coming from a grown man on an airplane nonetheless."" He went on to say that the people seated close to him on the American Airlines flight from Phoenix, Arizona to Austin, Texas, were women who were trying to mind their own business.

He added: ""It’s early evening and several people are having snacks or eating food. The man who just purposefully farted moments ago decides to loudly and condescendingly say 'yeah, everybody let’s just eat the smelliest food possible all at the same time'. A guy in the row over replied, ‘If you don’t like it you can fly private' to which fart man says 'that’s so f***** rude', and another person nearby chimes in with 'I think we’d all agree you’re the rude one here'.
He said the gassy man then said something along the lines of ""that’s just so low-class"", to which the man talking to him answers ""Well you’re back here in economy with the rest of us."" It was at that point that the flight attendants stepped in to tell the man ""that’s enough"". The poster said that the plane was finally taxiing towards the runway but then halted.
There was then an in-flight announcement that apologised for ""the interruption"" and the passengers were then informed that the plane was returning to the departure gate and that there would be further information soon. The witness then told other users that a flight attendant came to the man who was causing the problems and informed him he would have to leave the flight.
The poster said: ""He simply replies, 'I don’t understand' and she tells him they’ll talk about it off the plane. He gets up, grabs his bag and quietly exits the plane. We all breathed a sigh of relief when he was removed, I think most people were on edge about what he may say or do next. The trip was only delayed by 15-30 minutes, so all in all I think American handled it swiftly."""

A first look at the next episode of the ITV2 show teases a confrontation between Toby, 24, and Callum, 27. It comes after the latter told Georgia, 25, about a conversation that he had recently with the former about their relationship.
Georgia had been developing a romance with Toby, whom she knew before entering the villa, and they are coupled up - but she was left upset when he began pursuing Molly Smith recently. She has since been seen getting closer to Callum, who used to be with Molly.
Monday's episode saw Toby tell co-stars Callum and Luis Morrison about a relationship with Georgia: ""I could have done it on the outside."" Callum went on to reference the conversation during a discussion with Georgia in the villa. He told her: ""I've got a feeling [Toby] kinda is regretting his decision a little bit [...] He's [giving] it like 'I could have done that on the outside' [...] It doesn't make any sense. How you can say it's not done but you've said it's done kinda thing.""
Georgia will bring up the situation to Toby on Tuesday's episode, telling him: ""You said 'I could have had her on the outside so what's the point'?"" He responds: ""It was never like that."" Georgia then adds: ""Callum told me it was like that.""
A first look shows a confrontation between Toby and Callum over the remarks. It's been teased that Toby ""accuses Callum of snakey behaviour to win over"" Georgia. Toby says: ""You said to Georgia that I could have had her on the outside."" Callum responds: ""Yeah, ya did."" Toby adds: ""I didn't say that though"".
Callum is then heard saying: ""You said 'I could have done it on the outside but I didn't.'"" Toby however responds: ""I said 'we could have been a thing on the outside but we weren't a thing'. So I didn't say 'I could have had her on the outside'.""
Replying, Callum says: ""What's the difference? 'You could have done it on the outside'."" Toby comments: ""But I didn't say it was down to me though, did I?"" Callum says back to him during their exchange: ""You still meant the same thing.""
Toby says: ""That's way off it, bro. And that's proper sh** [...] You're gonna relay that to a girl as well and make think a kind of way just so you can get in there."" He further comments in the new teaser clip: ""That's a bit snakey, bro.""
Fans were quick to react to the first look on Instagram after it was shared on the platform this afternoon. Several people referred to Toby as a ""red flag,"" with one person writing in the comments section: ""Toby is a huge red flag.""
Another said: ""Biggest red flag ever."" Someone else wrote: ""Toby is the biggest walking [red flag emoji]."" One viewer said: ""Toby go home lad."" Sharing their thoughts, another viewer said: ""Toby did say that, so idk why he's getting annoyed.""
Someone wrote: ""Sorry Toby but you're just mad that you messed up."" Another said: ""Toby back tracking now because he realises she's his only option."" Whilst one fan commented: ""Toby getting all stressed cos he knows he's messed up.""

SHS02K3856_0HSVWNX1X7C4I0Q,Village campaigners forced to change name after locals mock unfortunate acronym,Benedict Tetzlaff-DeasNews Reporter,"20:35, 23 Jan 2024Updated20:41, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/village-campaigners-forced-change-name-31950905,"A local campaign group has been forced to rebrand itself after confused members objected to its rude name.
Committee members threatened to quit the 'Save Happisburgh Action Group' after an unfortunate acronym - 'SHAG' - led to ridicule and mockery among locals in Norfolk.
Bryony Nierop-Reading, who started the group and lives in the village, said: ""I thought it was catchy and attracted attention."" She added: ""I don't care what it's called as long as we get on with it, which is what we're doing now."" Miss Nierop-Reading, who lives in Happisburgh, Norfolk said she chose the name because a shag is a breed of seabird which fights for survival.
The group will now go by the name 'Save Happisburgh' instead. They are campaigning to protect the village's famous lighthouse, as well as the church, pub and people's homes after 10m of cliff eroded since last year.
North Norfolk District Council said investing in new sea defences is ""not realistically feasible"" due to affordability. More than 1,000 homes will be lost to coastal erosion in north Norfolk over the next 100 years, according to current estimates.
Last month, a disabled man living 15 miles along the coast in Hemsby told the Mirror he was suing the Government after his seaside home had to be demolished because of coastal erosion. Kevin Jordan was told his bungalow would be safe for a century when he paid £85,000 for it in 2009. But in December, 50mph winds and a 3.7m tide forced his home and four others to be pulled down. The 70-year-old had to pack up his belongings and move into emergency accommodation.
The Government will cover the cost of the demolition, but Kevin will not get any compensation. Speaking of his concerns for those still living in Hemsby, which is the fastest eroding coastline in Europe, he said: “They are all living on the edge down there. This whole community will soon be lost. I’m now living in a one-bedroom flat in a village of social housing. My battle is lost. But I’m carrying on with the fight for others.”

SLAHO8RGL6_7CL6KH0H11FG9MN,Post Office investigator feared challenging Horizon experts wouldn't 'go well',Lizzy BuchanDeputy Political Editor,"15:12, 26 Jan 2024Updated15:16, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/post-office-investigator-feared-challenging-31976700,"A former Post Office investigator has said she was afraid to challenge experts behind the flawed IT system as ""if you started to challenge too much, it didn't go well.""
Suzanne Winter, who worked on criminal probes in Northern Ireland from 2001 to 2014, said she was not taught to look for errors and her training college told her the Horizon programme ""was 100% reliable"".
Ms Winter told the Post Office inquiry that staff were under pressure to recover cash from postmasters accused of false accounting and theft. Investigators were ranked from one to five based on how much money they were able to claw back, she said.
Ms Winter was involved in the probe into subpostmaster Alan McLaughlin, who was wrongfully convicted of false accounting in 2005 after £10,000 went missing from his Belfast branch. His conviction was overturned in 2022. Ms Winter also worked on the case of Maureen McKelvey, from Omagh, who reported £30,000 shortfalls at her branch. Despite eventually being found not guilty, the stress of her five-year wait for the acquittal caused her thyroid to rupture - resulting in major surgery.
Ms Winter told the probe: ""You were not told how to get any information from Fujitsu (the firm that developed the Horizon programme), because we were told that the system was 100% reliable."" Asked when she was told that, she said: ""Whenever you were at the training college.""
She admitted finding statements submitted by Fujitsu staff to help her investigations ""hard to follow"" and said she didn't have access to anyone in the Japanese firm. ""I had to put my request through casework if I wanted anything from Fujitsu, and as far as I am aware, casework then dealt with that,"" she said.
""About nine years in, our casework team then got a Fujitsu liaison person, and that is the person that we would deal with then if we wanted anything from Fujitsu."" Counsel to the inquiry Emma Price asked why she didn't seek clarification.
The Horizon IT system is accounting software, owned by Japanese company Fujitsu, which saw accounts automated after subpostmasters entered their sales figures via a touchscreen.
Subpostmasters started experiencing unexplained shortfalls in their accounts and were liable for losses under their contract with the Post Office.
The Post Office ordered subpostmasters to pay back the money that was lost and were told they could face prosecution if they did not comply.
More than 700 subpostmasters were handed criminal convictions for allegations such as theft and false accounting - with many sent to prison or bankrupted.
In December 2019, a High Court judge ruled that Horizon contained a number of ""bugs, errors and defects"" and there was a ""material risk"" that shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts were caused by the system.
A total of 93 subpostmasters have had their convictions overturned to date but hundreds more have not yet come forward.
The Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been put in the spotlight again following the release of ITV's drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, starring actor Toby Jones.
Alan Bates was a subpostmaster who was accused of theft when his money stock counts did not match those of the digital accounting system.He was contractually obliged to pay back the ""losses"" from his own pocket, and, despite first reporting issues with Horizon in 2000, he had his contract terminated in 2003 when he refused to comply with Post Office policy.Mr Bates led the campaign group Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance to its High Court victory in 2019.
More than a million people have signed a petition calling for the former Post Office boss to lose her CBE after the ITV drama was released.People have called for her to be stripped of her honour after overseeing the Post Office throughout the time subpostmasters were wrongly convicted.
The Metropolitan Police said they are looking at ""potential fraud offences arising out of these prosecutions""; for example, ""monies recovered from subpostmasters as a result of prosecutions or civil actions"".Two Fujitsu experts, who were witnesses in the trials, are being investigated for perjury and perverting the course of justice - but nobody has been arrested since the inquiry was launched in January 2020.
Around £138 million has been paid out to around 2,700 subpostmasters across three compensation schemes, the Post Office recently said.Hundreds of others are still waiting for compensation.
A public inquiry looking into the failings of the Horizon system and the wrongful convictions of subpostmasters is due to finish this year.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed Justice Secretary Alex Chalk is considering ways of helping to clear the names of wrongfully convicted subpostmasters.
She replied: ""Because it seemed to be the technical side - they were being reported as the expert of the computer and you were more or less, in the Post Office where we were, if you challenged anything... you didn't feel you could challenge anything.""
Asked if any individual made that case, she said: ""No, I wouldn't say any particular individuals, but you just got the impression that if you started to challenge too much, it didn't go well.""
Ms Winter was set a target of 65% for the recovery of money from those who were under investigation. The ex-investigator also described the performance ranking system she and others were judged on, saying: ""We could see everybody else's, but... I didn't go looking to see what is everybody else doing. I was just concerned with what I had been targeted to."""

The dangerous animal bit the two-year-old child while he was out for a walk with his mum in Vishwas Nagar Neighbourhood, East Delhi, India. The pair fell to the floor as the woman wrestled to free her child - while the dog refused to let go.
The dog was eventually dragged away from the young boy who was pulled into a nearby home to safety, on January 24. A local source said: ""Although onlookers tried to pull the dog away from the area and stop more damage, the animal was uncooperative.
""The event has rekindled conversations about ethical pet ownership and the need to raise awareness of the risks that uncontrolled animals in public places may pose. There is a fresh focus on the significance of upholding pet control laws and encouraging a safer environment for all inhabitants as the community struggles to recover from this horrific occurrence.""
In the UK, a string of dog attacks led the government to ban XL Bully dogs. A dog owner was triggered into action when an XL Bully-type hound savaged his miniature pooch in horrific scenes also captured on video.
The dog, which is thought to be a recently-banned XL Bully, is seen darting out of an opening in the house not visible on the video before going straight for little Ralph. At first, Josh appears to be allowing the two pets to meet as he holds the Bully on its back, while maintaining as much distance with it from Ralph as possible.
But suddenly, the beast jerks its body and continues with its aggression, appearing to latch its powerful jaws on to the pup's back. Josh picks Ralph up and starts spinning on the stop as the Bully continues to gnash and jump up, hellbent on hurting the little pooch.
Josh spoke of the terrifying moment when he was pulled to the floor. Thinking his dog was fatally mauled, he lay on the pup hoping he'd stop the monster from tearing him apart. He said Ralph, who is the best friend of his one-year-old son Hugo, is just a year and two months old.
Even the owner, who has not yet been identified, was reportedly telling people to ""kill the dog"" after it broke free by hopping a six-foot fence, Josh explained."

This horrifying chain of events spanned across three states and several decades. Steven's mother alerted the police in North Carolina after he confessed to her that he had committed the murders.
His victims, his daughter and wife, Katie Pladl, and her adoptive father, Anthony Fusco, were later found dead. The bodies of 20-year-old Katie and 56-year-old Mr. Fusco, riddled with bullets, were discovered in a truck in New Milford, Connecticut.

The couple's baby was found dead in their home in Knightdale, North Carolina, on the same day. Steven Pladl was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a minivan in Dover, New York, as reported by WTVR-TV.
The father and daughter had been arrested for incest in Virginia the previous year. This followed Katie's decision to reconnect with her biological parents via social media when she turned 18 - Katie had been adopted by the Fusco family in Wingdale, New York. Her mother, Alyssa Pladl, gave Katie up for adoption after realising that her husband Steven was abusive towards the child and had reportedly sexually abused her. Alyssa met Steven online when she was just 15 years old.
The couple went on to have a baby girl, Denise. However, Steven's violent behaviour led to Alyssa losing custody and eventually giving up Denise for adoption. The adopted child, renamed Katie by her new family, grew up under their care until 18 when she set out to find her birth parents. She moved in with Pladl and her mum, fell pregnant, leading Alyssa to move out as rumours spread that Pladl was planning to marry his own daughter.
Despite facing charges, Pladl was released from jail under one condition - to avoid contact with Katie. But he had different plans. The day before the horrifying incidents unfolded, he took his son for a supposed visit to his mum in New York.
The next communication from him would be a shocking confession of murder. His mother, audibly distressed, relayed his chilling 911 confession: ""My son just called me. He told me... he killed his baby and he's in the house,"" she said sobbing. ""He killed his wife. He killed her father. I can't even believe this is happening.""

She disclosed that ""his wife broke up with him yesterday over the phone."" Pladl's mum had been given the care of his seven-month-old son, Bennett, as a condition of his bail.
In Knightdale, North Carolina, police found the baby boy's body. The town's Police Chief Lawrence Capps shared: ""We are heartbroken, and saddened over the death of this child and like you, we are trying to make sense of all the factors that led up to this senseless taking of life.""
Chief Capps also revealed that Pladl had driven to New York ""for the specific purpose of making some confrontations."" Pladl's legal representative, Rick Friedman, informed WNCN-TV in North Carolina that Mr. Fusco and Ms. Pladl were shot, and ""then Steven took his own life. This is a terrible tragedy that nobody foresaw,"" Mr. Friedman commented.

SS1CZDI566_E0O5IK1XYW1T813,"Brit woman, 20, who died after botched Turkey weight-loss surgery was bullied about size",Matthew YoungNews Reporter,"21:58, 22 Jan 2024Updated09:15, 23 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brit-woman-20-who-died-31943140,"A young woman who was bullied for years about her size has died after botched weight loss surgery in Turkey.
Morgan Ribeiro, 20, fell ill on the plane as she flew home with partner Jamie Brewster. Her small intestine had been cut accidentally during the £2,500 gastric sleeve operation, and Morgan died on January 13. Days before having her gastric sleeve operation, she posted a heartbreaking message on social media: “My last post before weight-loss surgery – see you on the other side.”
After the operation on January 5 she fell ill with septic shock on the plane home and the flight had to be diverted to Belgrade in Serbia, where she died. Her mum Erin Gibson, 44, had no idea 20-year-old Morgan was going to Turkey for surgery.
Erin told the Mirror: “By the time I found out it was too late, she was already on the plane. I had that sinking feeling because I’d heard horror stories about Turkey. She’s always been a bigger girl and had a really rough time with it. I told her she was beautiful inside and out – she really was a beautiful girl. She was an artist, outgoing, silly, friendly and loving. I don’t want her life to be in vain.”
Morgan had travelled from her home in South London with Jamie, 19, for the £2,500 procedure, not wanting to spend years on an NHS waiting list. It was the doctors in Serbia who told Jamie that Morgan’s small intestine had been cut. They removed 10cm of her small intestine and hoped she would pull through.
But on January 9, Morgan suffered a heart attack and she died four days later at 4am. It was the first time she had ever travelled abroad. Gastric sleeve surgery involves removing part of the stomach to leave a sleeve, reducing appetite.
In September, Morgan had a virtual consultation with a company that connects prospective weight-loss patients with surgeries abroad. Jamie recalled hospital staff speaking to her about the procedure, but not about the dangers.
He said Morgan took doctors’ advice to keep mobile after the operation, but the medical company reportedly said she did not follow advice to walk and stay hydrated. Morgan’s dad Richard said Morgan’s body was back in the UK and a second autopsy may take place on top of the one in Serbia.
At least 25 Britons are known to have died following medical procedures in Turkey since January 2019. A government spokesman said: “We urge anyone considering a medical procedure abroad to review our travel advice.”"
STRQ884SES_Q40RGPOM2SOMTU5,Mum's heartbreaking measles warning as 3-month-old's 'cold' was actually horror disease,Zahra KhaliqNews Reporter,"17:39, 24 Jan 2024Updated06:36, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mums-heartbreaking-measles-warning-3-31940578,"A mum has told of the harrowing moment her three-month-old baby was hospitalised with measles - and has urged parents across the country to vaccinate their children as the ‘complications are severe’.
Davina Barrett, 28, rushed baby Ezra to A&E when she noticed a red spotty rash develop all over his body on January 9th.
The mental health therapist from Walsall in the West Midlands - where cases are currently at their highest level since the mid-1990s - said the tot was initially experiencing cold and flu symptoms, which she mistook for a common winter cold.
But the family were horrified to learn that Ezra had tested positive for the measles virus, and developed complications - including pneumonia and diarrhoea. It comes as the The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) declared a ‘national health incident’ amid surging cases, with latest figures suggesting that more than 3.4 million children have not had their MMR jab.
Mum Davina, who lives with husband Karl, 30, and Ezra's one-year-old brother Noah, said: “We'd all been unwell with cold and flu symptoms for about two weeks prior, so we just thought he was dealing with the usual winter cough and cold.
“The day before the rash appeared he'd started to make a little noise, like a little moan. We thought it was a developmental thing and that he was starting to make a new sound. When we went to the hospital the next day, doctors said the noise was maybe to signify that he was a bit lethargic and unwell"", she added.
Ezra's one-year-old brother Noah was unaffected as he had already received the MMR vaccine. Mum Davina said: ""Noah already recieved his MMR jab, but Ezra was too young. You have to be 12 months old to get the jab.""
Urging parents across the country to vaccinate their children as soon as possible, Davina said: “I just want parents to be aware of the complications if their children were to get measles. I know a lot of people who don't vaccinate think that their child will get measles and then they'll just recover and be fine.
“But the complications are so serious. Ezra had to have a lumbar puncture, the needle that goes in the spine, to ensure he didn't have meningitis. Luckily he didn't, but he could have developed meningitis.
“The doctors also said measles can affect the eyes so he was given vitamin A to make sure that he didn't lose his eyesight. There's lots of different complications. He had diarrhoea the whole time, which was really concerning for such a little baby.
She continued: “The complications are too extreme to not take the vaccine. The reasons that some people give to avoid the vaccine, for example, they think that their child is going to get autism. They really need to research and see that those things aren't true.”
Speaking of Ezra's week-long ordeal in hosptial, the mum told how he had to be put on oxygen to help him breathe due to respiratory distress brought on by the infection.
She said: “He was on breathing support called nasal high flow, which was giving him oxygen and air pressure into his lungs to stop him from using too much energy to breathe.
“He was put on oxygen as his breathing was rapid and his chest was sucking in under his ribs when he took a breath, indicating respiratory distress. Initially, when he was put on oxygen his stats weren’t low, but they did fall when they tried to take him off oxygen closer to his discharge. He was on oxygen from Thursday night until Sunday so around four days"", she added.
Despite news of the measles disease spreading across the UK, with higher rates seen in the West Midlands, Davina says the diagnosis stll came as a massive shock to her. Ezra's condition worsened even further, as the tot also tested positive for Covid-19 halfway through his hospital treatment.
She said: “I had no idea it was measles because Ezra had started a new milk the day before the rash appeared, so we thought it might have been linked to that, and that maybe he was having an allergic reaction. Ezra was really unlucky because while he was in hospital, he also tested positive for Covid 19.""
The three-month-old spent a total of seven days in hospital, and was discharged after making a full recovery last week on January 15.
While the family are thankful that Ezra was able to recover by the second week, they've been left feeling paranoid about their little ones falling ill again as they get back out into the community. Mum Davina says she will need to 'build back her confidence' after the tarumatic ordeal, and is unsure if she can even send the boys to nursery or not.
She says: “He's completely fine now, and we're thankful that he has fully recovered but I am very worried about the measles outbreak. It's going to affect the way I go out with the kids, and whether I choose to send them to nursery.
""Previously, I used to feel a lot of guilt about keeping the children indoors while on my maternity leave because I've always felt that they should enjoy every day that I have with them. I'll be going back to work eventually, later this year, and now I just feel like are they safer at home. I definitely have to build back that confidence around taking the boys out again."""

Shona, 32, has played Whitney Dean on the hit BBC One soap since 2008 and she is set to leave Albert Square later this year after more than 15 years in Walford. Soap fans will recall that when Whitney first joined Albert Square, she was joined by her siblings, including Tiffany Butcher-Baker, played by Maisie, 22.
Maisie left EastEnders in 2022 and with Shona also set to leave Albert Square soon, it appears the actress was feeling sentimental on Wednesday night as she shared a collection of throwback snaps with Maisie and Devon Higgs, who played Morgan Butcher. Shona reshared snaps from Maisie's mum and talent agent, Julia Smith, who had originally posted the photos in 2020.
Julia wrote at the time: ""12 years ago today these amazing kids burst onto our screens as the Butcher family in @bbceastenders this is them mucking about in their dressing room. It was like this most days #goodtimes #eastenders #maisiesmith #shonamcgarty #jamesforde #devonhiggs.""
Earlier this week, Whitney was seen leaving Walford alongside her partner Zack Hudson as they planned to visit Bianca in Milton Keynes after learning she had split from her partner Terry. Whitney and Zack decided they needed to visit Bianca after bosses confirmed Patsy Palmer would be making a brief return to the show to coincide with Whitney's exit.
The pair handed over the market stall to Penny and Lauren Branning as they decided to head off to be with Bianca, but how will their meet-up with Bianca go and what about it will make Whitney, at least, decide to leave Walford for good? Whitney actress Shona previously discussed her soap exit, but insisted it wasn't an easy decision.
""It wasn’t an easy decision because I've made so many friends. I’ve seen people come and go, and meanwhile, Whitney has been one of the longest-standing characters. I've had so much fun and done so many storylines, some of which have been sensitive, and I've been honoured to be trusted with such heavy stuff year after year. So I'm going to be sad to say goodbye to my friends and family, but it was the right decision for me as I want to do other things. After 15 years, I’ve had a pretty good run!"" she said.
Speaking about leaving the show, she added: ""I have decided to spread my wings and will be leaving EastEnders. I have loved my years in the show. I have been trusted with some incredible storylines and have made amazing friendships which will endure.""

She won plenty of new fans when she hosted last year, with the This Morning presenter taking control of the annual awards show, held at the Royal Festival Hall, alongside Richard E. Grant. She dressed up to the nines for the special event as she rocked a long-sleeved black sparkly dress but bosses have decided go in another direction this February.
Former Dr Who actor David Tennant will take over hosting duties this time and an insider claims Alison’s nose has been put out of joint by the news. They say she is ""gutted"" over the snub and is becoming more and more aware of how cut-throat the industry is after ""loving every minute"" of the experience 11 months ago.
“Alison had really hoped that she could do the BAFTAs for another year and even become a main host,"" a source told Closer Magazine. ""She’s gutted not to be asked back – especially as she has built up such a great rapport with all the A-listers in Hollywood who seem to love her too.
“Alison often suffers from imposter syndrome and thinks that everything could get taken away from her at a moment’s notice, despite all her success. She’s really grateful for everything she has going on right now, but she’s aware how cut-throat the TV world can be.” David 52, who has appeared in TV series including Broadchurch and Good Omens, can't wait for the opportunity.
He said: ""I am delighted to have been asked to host the EE Bafta Film Awards and help celebrate the very best of this year's films and the many brilliant people who bring them to life."" Jane Millichip, the chief executive of Bafta, said the organisation was ""over the moon"" he said yes and added: ""He is deservedly beloved by British and international audiences alike. His warmth, charm and mischievous wit will make it a must-watch show.""
Alison opened the ceremony last year, saying: “I’m so excited to be hosting this year’s EE Bafta Film Awards with THE Richard E Grant. We’re going to have a lot of fun bringing the glitz and glam of backstage to everyone watching at home around the world. From hanging out with the stars to celebrating the biggest night for cinema, and joining the discussions with film fans, get ready for good vibes only.”
The talented star host took to her Instagram this week where she let her fans know that it's the last week of her pantomime stint. She has been performing at the Birmingham Hippodrome for the Christmas show but it is coming to an end. Alison has portrayed the Spirit of the Beans in the Jack and the Beanstalk production.
Sian Welby has been filling in for her on This Morning while she has been away. Alison said: ""Hi everyone, I'm just giving you a heads up that there's only seven days left until the end of Jack and the Beanstalk at the Birmingham Hippodrome. I hope you can come and see it. I am going to be gutted when it is over.""
Alison, who lives nearby to the theatre, added: ""But make sure you come and experience such a lovely, happy, funny panto at the Hippodrome in Birmingham. See you there!"" The TV star has been joined by Samantha Womack, Matt Slack, Doreen Tipton and Andrew Ryan in the performance.
Mirror Online has reached out to Alison's reps for comment.

SX7VYWICVT_T2QCCLLAH5OKAZG,US Embassy in London steps in after American professor says add SALT to cup of tea,Mataeo Smith,"17:19, 24 Jan 2024Updated07:06, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/embassy-london-steps-after-american-31958642,"The US Embassy in London has issued a hilarious apology on behalf of an American scientist who suggested adding a bit of salt to a cup of tea —a seemingly small piece of advice that has outraged Brits.
Michelle Francl, who is a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College, said she drew her conclusion after analysing dozens of research papers and 1,000-year-old texts. However, the residents of Great Britain were having none of it, including officials of the US Embassy in London who said Michelle's radical idea would ""threaten the very foundation of our special relationship"" with Britain in a statement.
The US Embassy swiftly distanced itself from Michelle through a post on X, formerly Twitter. ""Today’s media reports of an American professor’s recipe for the perfect cup of tea has landed our special bond with the United Kingdom in hot water,” officials said. Michelle's other idea, which is considered crazy but hasn't received as much backlash, was to steep your teabag quickly by dunking and squeezing it.

The new theory was publicised online as the scientist released her new book on the topic. She claims sodium helps block a chemical reaction that gives tea a bitter taste and that her teabag suggestions helps reduce ""sour-tasting tannins.""
Despite the harsh criticism, Michelle hasn't backed down on her research-based suggestion. The professor said she's always been a tea drinker, even though she hails from the Midwest, which is ""deep coffee-drinking country,"" according to her. Her interest in the topic stemmed from her frustration with trying to find a good cup of tea in the US, outright calling the experience ""horrific.""
She cited her extensive background in chemistry as evidence her theory is credible. ""After all these years of drinking tea and researching chemistry, I learned new things about what is in my cup and how to make the very best cup of tea,"" she asserted. Brits still swatted her suggestions, personal anecdotes, scientific merits and research, essentially writing the entire idea off as a joke.

Officials of the US Embassy maintained their position on the matter, sandbagging Michelle's work along the way. “Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, a sacred bond that unites our nations. We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our special relationship,"" it said. ""Therefore we want to assure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain’s national drink is not official United States policy. And never will be.”
The Embassy appeared to have some fun with the matter as well, appearing to troll angry Brits by saying the ""proper"" way to make a cup of tea is to microwave it."
SYW6K8W47K_TAEKM99NR150N1K,Boris Johnson's furious question after awkward grilling from the Queen,Gemma StrongLifestyle Writer,"16:16, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/boris-johnsons-furious-question-after-31938287,"Over the course of her 70-year reign, the Queen worked with a total of 15 Prime Ministers. Fans of The Crown will know she became accustomed to the monarch-Prime Minister relationship with her first government counterpart, Winston Churchill.
She went on to establish partnerships with over a dozen more, including Margaret Thatcher, John Major in the 90s, Tony Blair, and her last PM, Liz Truss, whom she appointed just days before she passed away at Balmoral.
From July 2019 until he tendered his resignation on 6 September 2022, Boris Johnson served as the country's Prime Minister. As such, he had to make his own connection with the Queen.
And there was vital one lesson that Boris had to quickly learn; time spent on homework before an audience with the Queen was vital.
In his book, Hardman states: ""At around the time that his government was embroiled in a lobbying scandal involving a healthcare company, Johnson came storming out of an audience with the Queen, demanding, 'Why the hell did no one tell me that Randox sponsors the Grand National?'""
The scandal at the time concerned Owen Paterson. It was revealed that he had started work as a paid consultant for Randox in August 2015, seven months before he was given the job of finding a new sponsor for the Grand National.
The search ended in March 2016, when Randox – a company that had previously had a very low profile, both inside and outside racing – signed a five-year sponsorship deal.
Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, described it as an 'egregious' breach of the rules on paid advocacy. And, as a result, Paterson resigned as an MP.
As a horse lover, the Queen was no doubt familiar with all things related to the Grand National. But her knowledge of current affairs was formidable.
Former PM Gordon Brown previously admitted he could be left 'embarrassed' during meetings with the Queen, revealing the former monarch was often better informed about current affairs than he was.
He recalled how the Queen questioned, ""Why have these bankers got it all wrong?"" in 2008, when the financial crash led to the UK entering recession.
Mr Brown, who was Prime Minister between 2007 and 2010, told how Elizabeth II ""actually knew better about what was happening to the country"" than he did during his time in Number 10.
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, the former Labour leader said: ""She would listen, she would ask questions. She would be endlessly knowledgeable about everything happening in the Commonwealth.
""I was very embarrassed one day because I went in to see her at six o'clock, I didn't know that one of the Commonwealth leaders had been ousted and a new government had been formed. She was telling me what was happening when I was supposed to report to her.""

Storm gusts which hit 90mph last night and this morning have had a destructive impact on flight schedules, with planes having to divert hundreds of miles after being unable to land at certain airports due to the power of the wind.
Hundreds of flights were delayed or cancelled due to the impact of the storms, stranding people at airports overnight. Many people were forced to sleep on benches in terminals overnight as they waited for their planes to be rescheduled.
Now the travel experts at FlightsFinder.com have advised passengers on what they should do if their flight is disrupted because of the bad weather.
Have you been impacted by the storm? Email webtravel@reachplc.com
Shahab Siddiqui, founder of FlightsFinder.com said: ""During the winter, bad weather and freezing conditions can severely impact airport operations. Last year, millions of flights were cancelled or delayed which caused stress for holidaymakers hoping to enjoy a getaway.
""When it comes to weather-related delays and cancellations it can cause more problems for travellers as airlines can refuse compensation claiming it is out of their control. It is well worth disputing this as airlines can be held responsible if they had poor de-icing procedures, for example. It is also important to keep in touch with airlines for updates and make use of complimentary food and drinks at the airport.""
Check out the team's top tips below.
If a flight is cancelled because of bad weather, guidelines say that the airline must prove there were extraordinary circumstances and that they took all reasonable steps to avoid them. It is important to know your rights, as you may find airlines push back when you make compensation claims.
Airlines can classify severe weather conditions as an extraordinary circumstance meaning they can legally refuse pay-outs. However, it is possible to argue the toss when it comes to what is and isn't ""extraordinary"".
It is always worth claiming compensation. If the weather is not “wholly exceptional”, or if other flights are taking off at the same time, this may be an indication that your flight could have gone ahead. Airlines failing to take technical measures like de-icing the aircraft will leave grounds for compensation.
Airlines must prove that they took all possible measures to re-route affected passengers at the earliest opportunity and prove it was not possible to rebook passengers onto another connection. They must also show they looked at the possibility of rebooking passengers on flights with other airlines and even considered alternative transportation.
Some providers offer cover for extreme weather, for which airlines aren't required to offer compensation. If left stranded by disruption, they can also cover emergency accommodation and even repatriation. It is well worth checking the terms of your insurance if you find yourself caught up in travel chaos, as you may discover you are more comprehensively covered than you thought.
Depending on how long the flight is delayed, the airline has to offer things like food and drink, access to phone calls and email and accommodation. If you are not given anything at the airport, keep receipts for expenses and try to claim from the airline later on. Record keeping is key, as airlines are likely to try and minimise their losses."

The Duke of Sussex and William, Prince of Wales, have endured a fractious relationship in recent years after a string of major public fall-outs. Now, a royal commentator has offered an apparent behind-the-scenes glance at the state of play with the brothers' relationship - and has even compared the two of them to the late Princess Diana.
Robert Jobson, author of Diana: Closely Guarded Secret, wrote in a recent article for the Daily Mail that a courtier had told him: “They both have quite extreme mood swings, just as Diana did. She could be your best friend one minute and the next your worst enemy.”
It is also claimed William has a ""notably short fuse"". A close royal aide was also said to have revealed to Jobson: “He can be a bit of a shouter when he loses it.” However, the aide added: “It’s fair to say the Duke and the Duchess give as good as they get if their disagreement results in raised voices. But they know each other so well, it usually blows over quickly – and she is, on the whole, a major calming influence on him.”
Wlliam's wife Kate was admitted last Tuesday for successful abdominal procedure and is expected to stay in the private London Clinic in Marylebone for 10 to 14 days before returning to her Adelaide Cottage home in Windsor. William is to take time off, stepping back from all official duties for several weeks and will look after their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis while caring for his wife.
Royal author and editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine Ingrid Seward told the Mirror that William is ""brilliant with the children and always has been"", and highlighted ""the moment he confessed he had already changed Prince George's nappy when he came to fetch his wife and child from St Mary’s hospital back in 2013."" She added: William may not always be around but I defy any woman not to agree he is an ideal husband, especially in a situation such as this.""

The annual event which takes place in Sheffield's Hillsborough Park is back for another year and is bigger than ever before. This year, bosses at the event haven't held back and have gone all out to ensure that everybody is catered for.
While music lovers have previously seen the likes of Sam Fender, Kasabian, Lewis Capaldi and Becky Hill take to the stage, this year proves to be one of the most exciting. Back for its 16th year, there are still many more names to come as Sheffield's biggest music event celebrates its Sweet Sixteen. This year, the event will take part from Friday, July 26 – July 28.
But who's playing? Here, we take a look at some of the biggest names in music who will be playing. This year, the event will be headlined by none other than Paulo Nutini, Jamie T and Snow Patrol. But they will be joined by Bombay Bicycle Club, Tom Grennan, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, The Human League, Holly Humberstone and Yard Act.
Elsewhere across the weekend, the likes of Annie Mac, The Mysterines, Example, Soft Play and Miles Kane will be taking to The Sara Nulty main stage, T'Other Stage and The Leadmill Stage. The three headlines will be making their debut performance at the event which sees 40,000 music lovers flocking to South Yorkshire.
The Human League are set to delight fans on home turf with their first UK show of 2024. Last week, bosses sent out a handful of miniature Henderson's Relish bottles, teasing the line-up with various artists names on the bottles.
Although there's a string of huge names on the bill, bosses behind the festival are keen to showcase homegrown talent, for which they've previously won Best Festival For Emerging Talent at the 2023 UK Festival Awards.
If you want to take a break from music, why not check out the comedy stage as well as the library which will see several people deliver poetry and readings over the course of the weekend? You can also head to the on-site pub The Open Arms, as well as check out the various stalls dotted around the site.
Tramlines Operations Director, Timm Cleasby said: ""I'm delighted to release the first wave of acts for Tramlines 2024. There are some great bands on the lineup! Securing headliners like Paolo Nutini, Jamie T and Snow Patrol is a fantastic testament to the reputation of Tramlines - and the hard work of our booking team - and, as always, they’re joined by top Sheffield talent including The Human League, Everly Pregnant Bros, Coco, and Otis Mensah, with many more to follow.
""As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the support of the people of Sheffield following the challenges of 2023. We were blown away by the Sheffield spirit over the event weekend and have been overwhelmed by the amount of sign-ups we've had for our ticket presale, launching on Thursday 25th at 12pm.
""We're very happy to have reached a new 5-year deal with Sheffield City Council, preserving the future of the festival. We are working hard with SCC on improvements to Hillsborough Park to ensure it remains an excellent public space throughout the year.

TBIIWWSYUD_4D65KWN82GDI5B0,Donald Trump ordered to pay $83.3million to E Jean Carroll after defaming rape accuser,Christopher BucktinUnited States Editor,"21:49, 26 Jan 2024Updated22:40, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-donald-trump-ordered-pay-31979852,"A jury has ordered that former President Donald Trump pay as much as $83.3million (£69,287,240) to E Jean Carroll, the columnist who accused him of rape.
Before being found liable over his comments against writer E Jean Carroll, the former president threw a tantrum as jurors heard her lawyer's closing argument in the civil case.
Although he later returned to hear his attorney Alina Habba defend him over the June 2019 statements he made while president, he fled the court again and was not present to hear the amount he now must pay Carroll.

When he found out, he took to Truth Social, his personal social media platform, and wrote: ""Absolutely ridiculous! I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!""
Earlier, they had heard the writer's lawyer ask jurors to award her $24million (£18.9million) in compensatory damages and much more in punitive damages.
""Donald Trump acts as if these rules or law just don't apply to him,"" the lawyer said. ""This case is about punishing Donald Trump for what he's done and what he continues to do,"" Kaplan continued. ""This trial is about getting him to stop.""
In addition to compensation, Kaplan asked how much money it would take in punitive damages to make Trump stop his attacks, which he has continued to make.
The jury felt that total amount should be $83.3million (£65.6million).

They awarded Carroll $7.3million in emotional harm, $11million for reputation harm and $65million in punitive damages in the hope of deterring him from making such comments again.
Defending the former US leader, Habba said earlier that Trump told the truth when he refuted her claims.
She said Carroll's association with the businessman had given her the fame she craved and that the death threats she received could not be blamed on his remarks about her.
The jury, anonymous, consisting of seven men and two women, was only deciding damages because it had been told to accept the findings of another jury as true.
In May last year, they awarded Carroll almost £4million after concluding Trump sexually abused Carroll in the changing room of a luxury Manhattan department store.
It also found that he defamed her in 2022 by claiming she made up the allegation to sell a memoir.
Yesterday's a second jury decided what damages Trump owed for two statements he made in June 2019 while he was president after Carroll made her accusation.
The unexpected departure of Trump had prompted Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is unrelated to Carroll's attorney, to speak up, briefly interrupting the closing argument to note: ""The record will reflect that Mr Trump just rose and walked out of the courtroom.""
The walkout came only minutes after the judge, without the jury present, threatened to send Habba to jail for continuing to talk when he told her to stop.
""You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,"" the judge told Habba, who immediately complied.
Trump, who was not required to attend the civil lawsuit proceedings, had appeared agitated all morning, vigorously shaking his head as Carroll's attorney branded him a liar who had incited a ""social media mob"" to attack her client.
Habba had argued that he should not be made to pay Carroll for comments that set off hate messages from strangers.
She showed the jury a video in which Trump said the jury's verdict last year was ""a disgrace"" and ""a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.""
""You know why he has not wavered?"" Habba asked the jury. ""Because it's the truth.""
The statement prompted an objection the judge sustained with a warning that ""if you violate my instructions again, Ms Habba, you may have consequences."""
TFUSZ2YXZV_L47U2BKWNQZJEF3,"Mum, 24, called 999 'screaming' days before partner murdered her, inquest hears",Joseph GampAssistant News Editor,"16:09, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-24-called-999-screaming-31948858,"A mum-of-three who was brutally stabbed to death by her partner had called 999 ""screaming"" just days before her murder, an inquest has heard.
Danielle Richardson, 24, died after she was knifed by her boyfriend Michael Marler, then aged 37, multiple times in a drug-fuelled rage at an apartment in Ancoats, Manchester, in February 2018. Marler - who admitted stabbing Danielle but denied her murder - was later found guilty of murder at trial and sentenced to 21 years behind bars at Manchester Crown Court in August 2018.
Now, almost six years after her death, an inquest launched at Manchester Coroner's Court has now heard evidence surrounding Danielle's previous contact with Greater Manchester Police - including the days leading up to her horrific death. A jury heard evidence from Danielle's family members, who submitted statements revealing more about the nature of her relationship with Marler. The family labelled the relationship ""abusive"" and ""controlling"" - and told the court how, while she was in his presence, would ""go quiet"" and ""become a recluse"".
Danielle - who suffered multiple stab wounds in the vicious attack including to her face, neck and also 11 times to her back - was found dead in the Shush apartments, Swan Street, on the morning of February 13. The pair had booked two nights there while renovation work was ongoing at Danielle's house. And cops later recovered her body after Marler had jumped from the window of the flat and went on a violent rampage across Ancoats - damaging cars and attacking more people.
During the inquest hearing, the jury was played a 999 call that Danielle made on February 8, five days before she was murdered. In the audio footage, she was heard ""screaming"" and pleading ""Let me out"" and ""why are you punching me?"" to her attacker.
After the call was cut off, a handler then rang Danielle back - but Danielle denied calling the police, instead claiming she was ""getting ready for work"". Once the call had been reviewed, Alan Hayes, a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) with Greater Manchester Police at the time, was tasked with visiting the address the call was made from, on Mortar Street in Oldham, and performing a welfare check.
The inquest was told that Mr Hayes had ""no training in attending domestic abuse calls"" as he was a PCSO not a police officer. However, he told jurors that, at the time, he had not been given the full details on the log and was only told he was following up an ""abandoned 999 call"".
The inquest heard he called at the address shortly after 4pm that day but nobody answered the door. At around 9.30am the following day, February 9, Mr Hayes returned but there was no answer again. At 11.26am, when visiting the address once more, Mr Hayes eventually spoke to Danielle. She apologised and told him her children had been playing with her phone when the 999 call was made.
“I asked if I could come in but she said she was getting ready to go out. She said it was children playing on her phone, and she apologised sincerely. There were children's toys on the stairs behind her, so I had no reason to believe there were not any children there,"" he told jurors. “Danielle was calm; not stressed in any way; no signs she had been crying. I could see her arms and her neck and there were no bruises or marks on her.”
After the 999 call was reviewed again, officers decided the log should be reopened and decided a further welfare check was required as it was ""not the voice of a child"" - but rather a ""woman in distress"", raising suspicions it could be related to a potential domestic violence incident. The court heard how police constable Anthony Johnson and his colleague Daniel Knight, who was training at the time, attended later in the evening of February 9. The officers spent two minutes and 20 seconds at the address, with bodycam footage played out to court.
While at the property, the officers spoke to Danielle in the living room at the flat, with Marler also present in the room. The footage showed her informing them she had already been spoken to earlier that day by PCSO Hayes. PC Johnson, who had received domestic abuse training, said there were no concerns for Danielle's welfare following the visit. He said he knew the log had been reopened but he ""could not recall"" whether he had received information on the logs about the nature of the 999 call prior to the welfare check.
He also said in evidence that it was not always common practice to read the logs when carrying out a welfare check, but that he could have done or radioed for further details. He continued: ""There was nothing at the scene that indicated there was a domestic assault incident or that there was any requirement to follow up after the visit.""
On Monday, jurors hearing the inquest were also told of a number of other instances in which Marler had been violent and abusive towards Danielle. Reading evidence from the previous criminal trial, senior coroner Andrew Bridgman detailed one episode in August 2016 in which Marler kept Danielle prisoner in her flat for three days. Marler prevented her from leaving, ripped up her clothes and urinated on them, and also poured hot tea on the bed and made her lie on it. There were a number of other incidents where she was left with black eyes and bruising at the hands of Marler since over a period of 3 years since they met in 2015.
Danielle had previous contact with police regarding her relationship - which also took place in 2016 - and the jury heard she reported Marler's violence towards her. In a statement at the time, she said she felt ""worthless"", had ""become a prisoner in her own home"" and wanted to end her own life.
""I can't cope anymore,"" she said. ""I have hidden my injuries and lied to my family and the police - not anymore, it's time for the truth. I will end up dead if I go back to him this time."" However, she later retracted her statement after Marler persuaded her to do so. After Danielle's death, the case was referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) due to the contact she had with Greater Manchester Police prior to her death.
A post mortem noted Danielle's cause of death as multiple stab wounds. She was found with 'major stab wounds' that were ‘severe’ and required a ‘high level of force’, the inquest was told. She was also found with incised wounds to her hands and forearms that were 'consistent with defence injuries', showing she had tried to fight off the knife attack. She also had 'significant bruising' including to her nose, eyes and forehead.
A statement released by Danielle's sister Nicole Richardson and read out in court, said: ""Danielle was a bubbly and caring person to everyone. She would make friends with everyone. She was never a quiet child, and there was never a quite moment with her around. She will always be a bright light in our lives.
""Dannii met Michael in 2015. Their relationship was not pleasant, and she made a police report in 2016 about the abuse she endured at the hands of Michael. Over the time they were a couple, she was always withdrawn, lost her bubbliness and become more and more secretive. She loved him whether he hurt her or not.""
And her mum, Jeanine Cowie, said in a statement: “He was very controlling and abusive. He controlled her movements. He started hitting her and she would become a recluse. She would go quiet for long periods of time by not answering texts or calls or the flat door. One time I went around to the flat and heard her coughing but she didn’t answer the door.""

THE5SNBF3Z_UFIOMZYJ1U3ZSGU,Rishi Sunak says UK 'won't hesitate' to launch more strikes against Houthis in Yemen,Ashley CowburnPolitical Correspondent,"12:57, 23 Jan 2024Updated09:19, 24 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-says-uk-wont-31947165,"Rishi Sunak has warned the UK will not ""hesitate to act again"" with air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen if Red Sea shipping attacks continue.
His comments in the Commons came hours after the UK and US conducted a second round of joint strikes on the rebels' missile-launching capabilities.
The Prime Minister told MPs on Tuesday the Government is ""not seeking a confrontation"" as he urged the Houthis to ""stop these illegal and unacceptable attacks"". But he added: ""The UK will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence. We cannot stand by and allow these attacks to go unchallenged. Inaction is also a choice.""
He said an ""initial assessment"" showed there were no civilian deaths as a result of the British warplanes' fresh attacks on missile sites around the capital Sana'a. The PM said the second wave of RAF strikes were authorised on Monday evening because of an ""ongoing and imminent threat"" against ships in the Red Sea.
Is the UK right to join the US in more strikes against Houthis? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
Unlike the first round of strikes, the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and the Labour leader Keir Starmer were not alerted of the strikes in advance. Mr Starmer told MPs on Tuesday the Labour Party backed the military action, saying the attacks in the Red Sea were bringing ""danger to ordinary citizens"".
The Labour leader said it is right MPs hear more about the effectiveness of the strikes and urged the Government to publish fresh legal advice. In response, Mr Sunak said he expected a summary of the legal advice would be published, adding the basis for action ""remains the same as last time"".
Earlier No10 said further strikes by the RAF against the Houthis could be carried out if the Red Sea attacks continue. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""Clearly, the indiscriminate action has continued so it's right that we take this action in self-defence and we don't rule out further action should it be necessary.""
They added: ""We believe the initial strikes were effective in degrading the capability of the Houthi rebels. I don't think at any point we said that one strike would be sufficient to completely stop these indiscriminate attacks. But the evidence we've accrued since the first strike makes us believe it was effective in destroying the targets and degrading their capabilities.""
The PM also told the Commons there would be a ""general debate"" for MPs on the military action on Wednesday. But the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who backed the strikes, also called for MPs to be given a vote. ""It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives are being bypassed on an issue as important as military action,"" he said."
TIDWFCBFXD_SXAV9M7EIZ1F9IP,Princess Andre warned over Katie Price's mistakes as she's set to 'be millionaire by 18',Mia O'HareShowbiz Reporter,"16:18, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/princess-andre-warned-over-katie-31958014,"Princess Andre is already following in her famous mum's footsteps, but has been warned not to make the same mistakes.
The 16-year-old is tipped to become a millionaire by the time she is 18. She has reportedly signed a four-figure deal with fashion brand PrettyLittleThing. Princess is, of course, the eldest daughter of former married couple Peter Andre, 50, and Katie Price, 45. The duo were married from 2005 until 2009 and also share 18-year-old son Junior together.
The teenager has become an influencer in her own right and has dipped her toe into the world of modelling. She has posed for a glamourous PLT fashion shoot and shared the photos on her own Instagram. Princess is said to be ""so excited"" about the deal, having looked up to her famous mum.
""She has aspired to model for a brand like PrettyLittleThing since she can remember,"" a source told Mail Online. ""She knows she's still young at 16 but Pete is going to oversee her work with PLT to ensure she's protected and well looked after. The partnership was born organically after Princess posted on Instagram about wearing the brand, it's naturally a great fit for both parties.""
While a brand and culture expert has predicted Princess could be on her way to securing a huge bank balance. Nick Ede told The Sun: ""She's grounded and caring, and with her family's backing she will be a millionaire before she's 18, potentially."" He predicted that other brands will be ""clambering to work with her"" for fashion, makeup and hair lines.
Yet the expert has warned Princess can learn from mum Katie. He added: ""Princess has seen how fame can be cruel and also how fickle it is. Her downfall was how public she was, and I think Princess knows to keep elements of her life private, like her brother."" Princess has been working with PrettyLittleThing since last year and launched a competition for the brand in November.
Princess has been focusing on her influencer career and recently took to her social media to thank fans for supporting her. The teen expressed her delight at reaching 700,000 followers on TikTok as she bids to emulate her mum's success. She also has 686,00 followers on Instagram.
Back in October mum-of-five Katie revealed her plans to turn Princess into a ""mini-me"" and establish a Kardashian-like empire in which she could adopt a 'Momager' style role similar to that of Kris Jenner. Katie, who began her modelling career in 1996, said she intends to use her knowledge and experience to protect Princess from the mistakes she made herself and guide her through the ""media circus"".
Princess has already been compared to her mum as the pair make red carpet appearances together and post selfies on social media. Many fans can't get over how much the teen looks like Katie when she was younger and starting out in her modelling career. On her recent holiday snaps, one fan wrote: ""Beautiful girl so much like your mummy when she was younger and congratulations on you going to be a big sister again congratulations to your daddy and Emily.
While another echoed: ""Wow you look just like your mum when she was younger. Absolutely beautiful. Never change because you are perfect how you are."" Someone else gushed: ""Gorgeous young lady with such class. Both outfits are wonderful on you Princess,"" A fourth added: ""You could easily be mistaken for your mum back in the day. So beautiful.""
The Mirror has contacted Princess Andre's representative for comment.

TNCZRAM7V3_NR7O1ER3U8KOKJJ,Inside Josef Fritzl's incest dungeon: House of horrors where daughter was kept captive,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"13:25, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-josef-fritzls-incest-dungeon-31963478,"A normal home from the outside, something is hiding behind its walls, as the chilling crimes of Josef Fritzl who kept his daughter as a sex captive in a dungeon.
The cellar in the 'house of horrors' sends a shiver down the spine as it was here, beneath 40 Ybbsstrasse in Austria that Fritzl dragged his terrified daughter Elisabeth, then 18, into the dungeon lair that would be her prison for 24 years.
He would drug and beat her into submission so she did not try to escape and she gave birth to seven of his children during 8,642 days in captivity. He had told his wife and police that Elisabeth had run away to join a cult.
The case finally emerged in 2008 when Elisabeth told police during a trip to hospital, in the town of Amstetten, that she had been held captive by her father. The woman, along with three of the seven children she had with Fritzl, were finally freed from their brutal life of captivity.
Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix were aged 19, 18 and five when they were freed in April 2008. Their fellow incest siblings Lisa, Monika, and Alexander, then 16, 14, and 12, had been granted freedom by Fritzl to live ""upstairs"" with his wife Rosemarie.
To the citizens of Amstetten, 70 miles from the Austrian capital of Vienna, Fritzl was a dedicated, hard-working grandfather. He covered his tracks by telling police Elisabeth had run away to a sect on August 29, 1984 – the day he drugged her and dragged her to his dungeon prison – and only returned to drop the three children as babies on his doorstep.
The ""horror house"" is in a town that is home to 23,000 residents. It was bought by landlord couple Herbert and Ingrid Houska from Fritzl's bankruptcy estate and the couple renovated it. They said: ""All nine apartments are rented out. There are young people among them who have no connection to the Fritzl case.""
They bought the property in 2016 to provide a new start for the local community. The basement dungeon where Fritzl held his daughter captive and raped her for 24 years has been filled with concrete, but the stairs and a single room remain. The landlord couple had the garage entrance, through which the Austrian discreetly provided for his captives, bricked up.
Of the seven children born from the repeated abuse of his daughter, three remained in captivity with their mother and one died shortly after birth.
The remainder were brought up by Fritzl and his wife Rosemarie after he claimed they had appeared on his doorstep. The identities of the victim and her children are now protected.
Fritzl was sentenced to life imprisonment after pleading guilty to rape, false imprisonment, manslaughter by negligence, and incest in March 2009.
Fritzl has now been granted conditional release from a prison for the mentally ill today following appeal. The 88-year-old was snapped in a car as he arrived at Landesgericht District Court at 7.20am UK time for a hearing - the first time he's been seen outside prison for 15 years.
It comes after he was allegedly seen visiting local cafes near Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau, Austria. He is set to be moved to a regular prison before he is eligible for release in March - though the decision is not yet legally binding."
TO9TP954YB_YDGI6RV5DW4QJW2,"Israel may have committed some acts of genocide in Gaza, International Court of Justice rules",Chris HughesDefence and Security Editor,"12:51, 26 Jan 2024Updated13:24, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-israel-committed-acts-genocide-31974182,"The International Court of Justice has declared that Israel may have committed some acts covered by the legal definition of genocide in Gaza – and cannot throw out a landmark legal case against it.
Delivering a preliminary decision , the ICJ's president Joan Donoghue said that at this stage the court does not need to decide if Israel has violated the genocide convention. Instead, it has to rule whether current acts appear to have fallen within realms of the violations. The court has confirmed that Israel has committed such acts.
Donoghue continued to say the court agrees that South Africa's claims of human rights violations are justified and that the case is urgent enough that provisional measures should be issued against Israel. These measures would force Israel to take some ""effective measures: to prevent further genocidal acts taking place within Gaza. The ruling also orders Israel to take ""effective measures"" against the destruction of evidence of potential acts of genocide.
It must compile a report on its offensive against Hamas - which is thought to have killed more than 26,000 so far - within a month as the alleged “genocide” case continues. But the International Court of Justice fell short of ordering Israel to cease its assault on Hamas in Gaza, whilst saying it must take care in its actions.
Israel was ordered to take measures to avoid acts of “genocide” by the military within Gaza and to preserve any evidence that may be used in a genocide court case. In a humiliating ruling for Israel the International Court of Justice decided not to throw out South Africa’s legal claims it has committed “genocide” in Gaza.
But it stressed that whilst there may be a “genocide” case to answer Israel has not provably done it, although it must ensure measures are taken to avoid it. The legal case is likely to take many years to conclude but it can call for an investigation into the claims to stop to avoid further deaths and suffering among civilians.
Over a one hour ruling ICJ President Joan E. Donoghue, in the Hague, quoted Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant saying as war got underway, saying Gallant had said: “We have removed all restraints. We will eliminate everything.”Judge Donoghue continued that Gallant went on to describe Hamas as comparable to Islamic State. After proceedings concluded today, the South African Government said that it welcomed the ICJ's decision.
Israel launched its massive air and ground assault on Gaza after Hamas militants stormed through Israeli communities on Oct. 7 killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting another 250. The offensive has decimated vast swaths of the territory and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.
More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run enclave said on Friday. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll, but has said about two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
The Israeli military claims at least 9,000 of those killed in the nearly four-month conflict are Hamas militants. UN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Marieke de Hoon, an associate professor of international law at the University of Amsterdam, said she thinks the court is unlikely to throw the case out Friday since the legal bar South Africa has to clear at this early stage is lower than the one that would be applied for ruling on the merits of the accusation. ""The standard... is not, has there been genocide? But a lower standard,"" she said. ""Is it plausible that there could have been a risk of genocide that would invoke Israel's responsibility to prevent genocide?""
But De Hoon also does not expect the world court to order an end to Israel's military operation. ""I think that they will shy away from actually calling for a full cease-fire, because I think they will find that beyond their abilities right now,"" she said in a telephone interview.
Provisional measures by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel would comply with any order.Top Hamas official Osama Hamdan, meanwhile, said his group would abide by a cease-fire if ordered and would be ready to release the hostages it is holding if Israel releases Palestinian prisoners.
How the US - Israel's top ally - responds to any order will be key, since it wields veto power at the U.N. Security Council and thus could block measures there aimed at forcing Israel's compliance. The US has said Israel has the right to defend itself, but also spoken about the need for the country to protect civilians in Gaza and allow more aid in.
The genocide case strikes at the national identity of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II. South Africa's own identity is key to it bringing the case. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to ""homelands"" before ending in 1994."
TRDNQWOMQ7_UKQKQ1P2ILFYPJY,Amy Dowden’s secret heartbreak - 'I found breast lump on honeymoon but didn’t tell Ben - I thought it might be my last ever holiday’,Tom BryantHead of Showbiz,"19:00, 24 Jan 2024Updated20:55, 25 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/amy-dowden-jets-second-honeymoon-31960235,"Sipping the juice of a coconut as the waves gently lap at her feet, no one deserves a slice of paradise more than Amy Dowden.
Just nine months ago, the Strictly star’s life was turned upside down after being diagnosed with breast cancer sparking endless rounds of chemo. But as she walks along a Caribbean beach hand in hand with husband Ben, this trip means much more to her than any lavish holiday away.
Instead, it’s the chance to have the proper honeymoon she was cruelly robbed of the first time around. “Just before I went on my honeymoon last year with my husband I found a lump on my breast and it just overshadowed the whole honeymoon,” she says.
“I didn’t want to tell Ben as I didn’t want to worry him. But everyday when I was putting suntan lotion on or I was moisturising I could feel it and I was just worrying more and more.
“Unfortunately now when I think of that honeymoon, I think of the start of my breast cancer journey. I just knew the entire holiday. I just had this gut feeling. I just knew.
“Honestly, there were moments when I was thinking ‘is this going to be my last holiday ever’, so I am grateful to be going away again.” Now she is thrilled, if understandably a little apprehensive, about this trip to Grenada, which is being laid on by hit ITV Daytime show Lorraine, and which viewers will see next Tuesday.
Amy, who underwent a mastectomy last July, says: “It’s the first time I have gone away. And what with the blood clots and wearing a bikini for the first time and everything. But, these are all steps that I need to take.”
Physically, Amy is slowly getting stronger but admits she is still “very much in the recovery process”. In December she was taken to hospital with a blood clot on her lung, and has since had to have blood-thinning injections. She also battled sepsis at one point during her chemo treatment.
She says: “I am still obviously getting over chemo. I’m still struggling a bit, I’m still very tired. I broke my foot last year so I am still recovering from that and I have a few shoulder issues.
“I still have my blood clots and still have to inject myself. I went through so much and I think I was a bit deluded to think that once chemo has finished, that would be it, but it really isn’t. I’ve only just begun the recovery journey really.”
But there is no doubt that the stint in the sun will lift her spirits and also have other positive consequences too.
“I am just looking forward to a bit of Vitamin D,” she says. “ I have heard that it helps with hair growth so I am also hoping it will help my hair grow after losing it all to chemo.”
Amy, whose eye lashes and brows have since grown back, had her last round of chemo 11 weeks ago. It marked an end to a gruelling summer of treatment.
“Since May when I was diagnosed, I feel like I kind of got robbed of a summer because I had surgery and then I had chemo,"" she says. ""So I didn’t get to enjoy any of the British summer that we got or do anything really like celebrate my birthday or my anniversary.”
Amy says she is under no illusion just how lucky she was for the cancer to be picked up.
“Had I waited any longer, you dread to think what the outcome would have been,” she says. “So, I just want to try to help people to realise, both men and women that cancer doesn’t discriminate, you can get it at any age and if you are not checking, who is? Early detection can save lives.”
The experience, she says, has changed her whole outlook on life for the better.
“You look at life completely differently. You see what really matters and materialistic things really don’t. Even like, I’ve lost all my hair, my eyelashes, my eyebrows - and from being a dancer which is such an aesthetic sport - you just kind of learn the real values.
""The real beauty’s in life. I would say I am a totally different person. I have so much gratitude now. I always used to have gratitude but I just see things differently now.”
And she has nothing but praise for the nurses and doctors who treated her.
“You learn to really appreciate everything. You have to take every opportunity that comes your way and I am just grateful for everything, for the NHS - I am just grateful to be still here,” she says.
Since Amy went public on her cancer battle, she has been inundated with support, as well as messages from people going through similar ordeals.
“Do you know, I’ve had hundreds of messages from people that have found a lump because of me and that’s the only positive I can think of from this,” she says.
“I try and raise as much awareness. I never thought at 32 that I would be diagnosed with breast cancer. So my message is ‘If you’re not checking then who is?’ because you don’t get a mammogram until you’re in your 50’s and early detection can save lives.”
As well as being “delighted” to be working with Lorraine again, she is also excited about getting back on the dance floor again after missing this year’s Strictly series.
“I have a few projects, but my priority, just for myself and what I miss most, is my dancing. Getting back on the dance floor, getting back with the Strictly gang - I just know that is going to make my dancing head happy,” she says. Asked if she will be back on Strictly this year, she is adamant. “Absolutely, there will be no stopping me,” she says.
Watch how Amy gets on on her second honeymoon from Tuesday, 9am on Lorraine on ITV1 and ITVX. Lorraine airs weekdays from 9am."
TSE6ILD1M6_LYA5NKS99SI900U,UK weather: Storm compensation explained for power and water outages - are you due £80?,Ruby FlanaganMoney Reporter,"13:51, 23 Jan 2024Updated13:54, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/uk-weather-storm-compensation-explained-31945668,"It is estimated that around 7,000 homes were without electricity earlier this week, in the wake of Storm Isha.
And now, Storm Jocelyn is set to cause more chaos in the UK today - but what are your rights when it comes to compensation payments? The Met Office has issued amber and yellow weather warnings for wind covering much of the UK.
Alongside this, yellow warnings for rain have been issued for parts of western and southern Scotland and northwest England. Thankfully, you can claim money back if you've experienced a power outage or disruption to water supplies.
Here is a round up of compensation payments you may be able to claim if you are impacted by a storm.
Storm Isha saw thousands of UK residents lose power and it could potentially happen again with Storm Jocelyn today. If your power is knocked out by a storm you can claim money under National Grid and Ofgem rules.
If you live in England, Wales or Scotland and your power outage is down to a Category One storm, you're entitled to £80 if the supply isn't restored after 24 hours. For a Category Two storm, you are entitled to a compensation payment of £80 if you have no power after 48 hours. After that, you should receive £40 for every six hours you don't have electricity, up to a maximum of £2,000.
If the power was cut off due to bad weather, Citizens Advice says an electricity network operator should pay you in a reasonable amount of time. If you haven't been paid within four weeks of the power being back on, you should contact them to make a claim. You must claim within three months for an unplanned cut - unless you are on the Priority Services Register where there is no time limit
Water companies can also pay compensation if your water supply is out due to bad weather. However, it is not that simple.
If you're left without water and it isn't restored by the time the company says it will be, you're usually entitled to compensation of £20 for the first 24 hours. You should then get an extra £10 for each further 24-hour period you're left without running water. If you don’t get sent this compensation within 20 working days, you can claim a further £20.
However, there are some circumstances when your water company doesn't have to pay compensation and includes severe weather which prevented them from meeting their standards or their staff are striking.
However, it is still worth having a look at as water company Anglian Water compensated more than 3,000 residents in Ipswitch after their water supply was cut off by Storm Babet back in October. Compensation was being paid as water pressure had dropped in homes in the area for ""a long period of time"" after one of its water treatment works was flooded by the heavy rain.
Broadband and landline customers can also get money back from their provider following outages through the Automatic Compensation Scheme. If your broadband stops working then you simply need to report it to your provider to receive compensation as it is automatic. Your broadband provider should be in touch with you directly if you are entitled to compensation and it should be issued as a credit on your bill no later than 30 days after the issue occurred.
You should receive £9.33 if the service is still down two full working days after you report it, and then £9.33 for each day afterwards.
The scheme applies to the following providers:
Again, some exceptions do apply to the automatic compensation scheme and this is when the problem is caused by an event beyond a customer’s or the provider’s control and this includes ""extreme weather"". However, if your connection broadband or landline connection continues to remain disrupted after the storm, you could potentially claim compensation payments."

They're going to add British Gas services to Samsung's SmartThings app, which tells you the best times to use your appliances to save money. The SmartThings app lets you control all your internet-connected devices from one place.
By adding British Gas to the app, it will help users set their appliances to use energy when it's cheaper and demand is lower. Also, British Gas will start offering Samsung heat pumps to UK homes to help reach net zero targets by 2050. Specially trained British Gas workers will explain the benefits of heat pumps and install them.
Deborah Honig, chief customer officer at Samsung UK, said: ""This collaboration will help educate consumers on the benefits of moving to heat pumps as well as how to manage their overall energy use through our leading home management app, SmartThings. It is an exciting moment for the technology and energy sectors to offer innovative ways for customers to manage their energy with less effort.""
""Through SmartThings, we are putting the power directly into the customer's hands so they can take greater control of how they manage their homes and energy use more efficiently. There are also many more exciting possibilities for us to help customers reap the multiple benefits of a connected home, moving forwards.""
Catherine O'Kelly, managing director of British Gas Energy at British Gas, said: ""This venture is a big milestone in providing British customers with simple and affordable ways to help save money on their energy bills and cut carbon. This is the first step in our collaboration with Samsung, which will see us combine our strengths and bring more innovative solutions to the market.""
""At the core of this venture is a shared commitment to helping customers manage their energy usage and carbon emissions through new technologies which will play an integral role in supporting the UK's net zero drive."" Lord Callanan, the energy efficiency and green finance minister, said: ""We want more households to benefit from switching to greener energy and I am pleased to see Samsung and British Gas teaming up to help consumers on this journey.""
He also mentioned, ""Since we increased our Boiler Upgrade Scheme grant to £7,500 applications tripled in the first week, helping more hardworking families to install a heat pump in their homes.""

TU1NTGGLYN_WWQICS3969V7Z2T,Should Under 16s be banned from using smartphones and social media? Take our poll and have your say,Paul SpeedOnline Reporter,"11:00, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/should-under-16s-banned-using-31963254,"Most children in the UK have their own smartphone by the time they turn 12.
But almost half of parents aren't happy about it, and say their offspring only need a basic phone - devoid of any social media - to keep safe. As many as 44 per cent of parents say they would support a ban on children under 16 having smartphones, according to Priory Group's new research.
And this week a Tory MP called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to bring in such legislation. Miriam Cates raised the case of 14-year-old Mia Janin, who is believed to have taken her own life, after claims she was cyber-bullied emerged. An inquest heard that schoolboys allegedly used a group chat to make fun of her on Snapchat.
If you can't see the poll, click here
Speaking to Mr Sunak at Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Cates said: ""The press reported the tragic case of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life following horrific social media bullying, including on TikTok and Snapchat. Since 2010, across the English speaking world, there's been a marked increase in poor teen mental health, teen suicide attempts and children addicted to pornography.
""The United Kingdom has a strong tradition of legislating to protect children from serious threats to their safety and welfare. So does my Right Honourable Friend agree with me that it's time to consider banning social media and perhaps even smartphones for under 16s?""
The PM responded: ""My Honourable Friend is absolutely right to highlight the impact of what happens online on our children and that's why our Online Safety Act tackles both criminal activity online and protects children from harmful or inappropriate content such as bullying, or the promotion of self-harm, accessing pornography and also exposure to eating disorders.
""Ofcom are now rightly developing and consulting on the guidance in the codes and practices for how those platforms will meet their duties. And if they don't clean up their act, then Ofcom will be able to impose fines of up to 10% of global turnover on the social media firms.""
Other findings in Priory Group's research found that 92 per cent of parents think that social media/the internet is having a negative impact on the mental health of young people, with cyber-bullying (50 per cent), lowering self-esteem (41 per cent), anxiety over getting enough likes/followers (40 per cent), loss of face-to-face interaction (47 per cent), loss of quality sleep (43 per cent), and its encouragement of early sexualisation (39 per cent) being the main reasons.

TU9TJTR4KT_4VQKV5IUY1JYCZY,UK set for record breaking worst ever year as Storm Jocelyn named during Isha chaos,Kieren WilliamsNews Reporter,"11:48, 22 Jan 2024Updated09:42, 23 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-uk-set-record-breaking-31937547,"The UK is on track for its record breaking worst ever year for storms since records began.
Storm Isha battered the country overnight, bringing 99mph winds to the country amid an amber weather warning that covered most of the country. This season has seen nine storms already, and is well on track to break the record, the Mirror can reveal.
Set in 2015/16, when naming storms began, the furthest along the alphabet of names the UK has seen was when Storm Katie hit. This year, the country has already suffered through nine successive storms, with the possibility of a tenth just around the corner.
This has set us well on track to have a record breaking bad year for storms. In 2015/16, the storm beginning with the letter I struck in February, where Isha is already fading away this morning - around a month ahead of the record.
Alongside that, Storm Jocelyn, the next storm, has already been named by Met Eireann with it set to hit as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday, with the Met having already issued weather warnings for the coming low pressure system. This leaves the country with just two storms from now until August, when the storm season ends, to break the record.
Have you been affected by Storm Jocelyn? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
It isn’t guaranteed of course that the record will tumble as storms can be immensely variable within seasons, as well as between them. But the current trend this season has most definitely set the country up to blast through the record, with more wet and windy conditions likely ahead.
Stephen Dixon, a spokesperson for the Met Office, told the Mirror: ""Since we’ve been naming storms the furthest we’ve got through the alphabet of names is Katie - which happened in March 2016. In the first storm naming year we got to Storm Katie. And obviously we’ve just had Isha, the next storm would be Jocelyn, then Kathleen after that.
""We got to Katie in the 2015/16 storm season, and in that year, the storm for I which was Imogen hit in February, so we’re ahead of that. The thing to note is that it’s quite variable, in terms of storms we named last year we only had two named storms ourselves, there were a couple of other storms that glanced the UK, including Otto and Noah, that were named by other agencies. Storms are variable by nature, we get peaks of troughs of storm activity.
""One of the factors particularly of storms in the UK is the position of the jetstream and how it influences low pressure systems that move in off the Atlantic … that’s one of the principle factors of how many of these deep areas of low pressure we get in the UK across a storm naming year.
""There’s some wet and windy weather on the way, on Tuesday, particularly windy in the north of the UK on Tuesday into Wednesday. It’s not a system we’re naming at the moment, but we name storms with the Irish Met Service and KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) and there’s a chance that one of those might want to name that system. That’s one we’re keeping an eye on in the more immediate term, so we have already got a yellow wind warning out for that low pressure zone."""

Complaints have been made about HMP Forest Bank in Salford, Greater Manchester which people in the neighbourhood described as being like the 'Wild West' with cars being set of fire and gangsters arriving in expensive vehicles. Inmates have made escape attempts while drugs are flown over walls and guards and prisoners are said to have been in relationships. A female guard is reported to have been moved off one of the wings after an alleged 'inappropriate' fling with a former police officer who was serving a prison sentence.
Prisoner escape attempts have also been reported including one prisoner dressing up as a teacher to get past prison guards. In another jailbreak in 2019 four armed men tried to free a drug dealer. Officers' cars have been set fire to in a series of arson attacks in 2022 when six vehicles were targeted by vandals. Aaron Mills, 46 a dog walker, who lives nearby said: ""That prison is like the Wild West - there's always something going on. People have used drones to drop stuff over the walls or even thrown it over in socks. And you see all the women visiting - they park up in fancy cars.""
Susan Hill, 59, added: ""There's always something going on. Whether it's escapes, drug overdoses in the prison or sex attacks on inmates. A while ago two men on a motorbike torched some prison officers' cars."" A former prison guard was last year jailed for three years after having an 'inappropriate relationship' with an inmate. Joanne Hunter, 28, had the fling with Connor Willis while working at Forest Bank. She was described as 'naïve' and 'vulnerable' in court and thought the prisoner was 'in love' with her and smuggled packages into jail for him.
An officer was also moved from her prison wing after being accused of having a relationship with an inmate. Former cop, James Riley, 28, was given extra time out of his cell due to the fling. He had been jailed for 16 years after trying to kill his ex-partner.
Katana Paris, who identifies as a woman as sexually assaulted two prison officers as they served her breakfast at Forest Bank in 2022. Paris, 27, who was part way through a three-year sentence at the time for attacking a nurse, admitted two counts of sexual assault at Manchester Crown Court and was given a further six months in jail. Manchester Evening News also reported the jail had many absences. A prison officer said: ""A lot of staff are off sick at the moment Staffing levels have hit an all-time low which he said meant inmates ""are not being treated fairly""
The Ministry of Justice said the prison had 76 incidents in 2021, and 149 in 2022. But figures for Forest Bank were 'significantly higher' than those at any other prison, according to reports."
U0Z74PIIZ6_ZF48NMPARUMJY5Y,Beckton baby: Police issue description of woman in bid to track down abandoned Elsa's mum,Ryan MerrifieldNews Reporter,"14:10, 26 Jan 2024Updated14:27, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-beckton-baby-police-issue-31974659,"Police have issued descriptions of a woman they are keen to trace as they continue to appeal to find a missing mum after her newborn baby was dumped in a plastic bag.
Officers are also hoping to speak to a witness after examining CCTV footage. The tiny infant - less than an hour old and with her umbilical cord still attached - was discovered by a dog walker in Beckton, East London, on Thursday, January 19. She was wrapped in a towel inside the shopping bag and the member of the public spotted her at the junction of Greenway and High Street South at around 9pm.
Temperatures had plummeted close to freezing. Hospital staff gave her temporary name Elsa after the Frozen film series character. The baby - described as Black or mixed race by police - was on Tuesday released from hospital and put into foster care after Newham Borough Council successfully applied for a court order. The woman police are looking for was seen entering the Greenway, E6 from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on Thursday, January 18, the Met confirmed today.
She is understood to be Black and was wearing a large dark coat with a light coloured scarf or hood around her neck and had a rucksack on her back, the force said. The witness was male and wearing a dark coloured hooded coat, with a backpack. The coat or backpack has a reflective strip on the rear of it.
Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, said today: ""Since our first appeal we’ve had 17 reports from the public sharing information and I can assure people that every single one is assessed and progressed where that information is thought helpful. Baby Elsa is safe and well. I’m sure people will have seen recent reporting that she has now left hospital.
""Our colleagues in Newham Council continue to make sure she’s well looked after and cared for. My team are continuing their work. We’ve collected a considerable volume of CCTV footage. While we’re still examining it in detail, we have identified a woman we would like to speak to, and a witness who may have seen her.
“We believe the woman is Black, was wearing a large dark coat with a light coloured scarf or hood around her neck and had a rucksack on her back. We believe this woman entered The Greenway from High Street South and left the Greenway heading in the direction of Fabian Street.
“We’re also keen to identify a witness who we think could have seen this woman in the vicinity of the The Greenway. He is believed to be male, wearing a dark coloured hooded coat, with a backpack; the coat or backpack has a reflective strip on the rear of it. He exited The Greenway at around 9.10pm.
“If you have information about these people – or you think I might be describing you – I urge you to please, please contact us immediately. It could turn out that you have nothing to do with it but, it’s still incredibly helpful for us to know so we can focus our efforts on other avenues instead.:""
Police said the child was unharmed and the person who came across her helped saved her life by keeping her warm and contacting the authorities. East London Family Court heard authorities had no information about Elsa's identity. An interim care order for the baby was granted by Judge Carol Atkinson. However, during a hearing yesterday, Elsa's court-appointed guardian was unsuccessful in getting her name changed.The guardian's barrister told the court their client felt it may have an impact on her later as the name is ""gimmicky"". However, Judge Atkinson disagreed and said the court needed to consider the position of a child who had lost everything, adding the name they were given when found could be ""something they can hang on to"".
BBC reported - after getting permission to report under a transparency order issued by the judge - court documents suggest Elsa was very cold when found and it was three hours before doctors could record her temperature. However, she was crying and responsive the whole time. Later that night staff reported she was feeding well and named her.
Doctors believe she was a full-term baby and weighed 6lbs 6oz (2.9kg) when she was found, the documents added. Once deemed medically fit, she was discharged to her foster parents who had visited her in hospital.
Speaking at a press conference in Newham last Friday (January 19), Mr Crick said police were ""extremely concerned"" for the mum's welfare. Making an appeal for her to come forward, Mr Crick said: ""We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.
""Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station. If you are the baby's mother, please know that your daughter is well. No matter what your circumstances please do seek help.""
In a previous statement, he said: ""Last night we were called by a member of the public out walking their dog, who had discovered a newborn baby in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, E6. Thinking fast, that person kept the baby girl warm until London Ambulance Service paramedics arrived and checked her over before taking her to hospital. I am delighted to report that she wasn't injured in any way and is safe and well in the care of hospital staff.
""I am grateful to the members of the public who stayed at the scene to speak with officers and medics – your actions contributed to saving the baby's life. Our thoughts now turn to the baby mother; we are extremely concerned for her welfare as she will have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth."""

Steven Harper was found after falling off a cliff in Italy - four miles away from the French-Italian border in Ventimiglia on November 23. His devastated family believe that the toxins in the mushrooms may have caused Steve to become disorientated. After foraging for food, the cyclist sent his nearest and dearest a message, informing them that he had gone down ill.
His adoring brother, Dale Harper, 40, from Dundee had launched an online appeal to find Steven and made the difficult trip to Italy earlier this month to identify the body. Devastated with the loss of his brother, Dale took to Facebook to update his friends.
He posted: ""The search ended in heartbreak with the discovery of Steven's body in Italy. He had enough resources to survive but might have made a fatal mistake with the mushrooms. His death was attributed to a fall from a cliff, possibly due to disorientation caused by mushroom toxins.
""I was left to grapple with the loss, the responsibility of identifying his body, and the realisation of his final moments in a place he loved.""
Dale explained that the Italian police report revealed that Steven passed away as a result of internal bleeding sustained from the fall. The Scot plummeted from the cliff approximately an hour after sending his final message.
The tragic incident was noticed by a nearby workman, who sprinted to Steven's aid. In addition, a helicopter arrived at the scene. Alas, it was too late to save him. Dale takes great comfort in the knowledge that his brother died doing something he loved.
He said: ""We are still waiting on the toxicology report, but from the evidence we have, it seems most likely that Steven had felt delirious due to the toxins, lost balance and fell with his belongings.
""I take comfort in knowing he was doing what he wanted to do, wasn't wanting for anything, was surrounded by people in his last moments in a place he always said he had wanted to die.""
Steven's devastated mother, Angela Bear, also took to social media to post a heartfelt tribute to her son. She wrote: ""My beautiful, adventurous son's journey in this world has come to an end. Steven was living his absolute best life to the fullest and found joy in every step he took and every life he touched. He was loving life and wanted to inspire others to see the world.""
A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man and are in contact with the local authorities."""

While a fresh bunch of blooms is a traditional Valentine's Day gift, and we've found the best online flower delivery services here, if you're looking for something creative and unique this year, it could be just the ticket.
Over the past few years, LEGO have introduced several floral replicas, including succulents, orchids, dried flowers, wildflowers and more, but nothing is quite as romantic as the Bouquet of Roses. The £55.99 bunch includes a dozen red roses captured at different stages of bloom, and four baby's-breathe sprigs for a realistic finish.
You can personally build each flower from stem to bud, or save this memorable gift as an activity for you and your partner to do together. The set is designed for adult builders aged 18 and up and comes with both a written booklet of instructions and an online companion using the LEGO builder app.
There is a purchase limit of three per order at the LEGO Store UK, and as LEGO fans have already left excited reviews about the launch, we're predicting they won't stay in stock for long. One person said: ""this product is so clever - a gift that lasts forever. A beautiful flower bouquet replica that you can build with your partner on Valentine’s Day or on a date night.""
Another user said that although the building was ""a bit repetitive"", they thought they were a brilliant present saying, ""every LEGO flower I have ever given my girlfriend is still alive and was fun to put together. No wilting, no gnats, just the flowers. They look amazing and you don’t even need to put them in water. From afar they look lifelike, and it’s a great conversation piece. Only downside to these roses is that they don’t smell like roses.""
Elsewhere on the LEGO website, you can buy two single stem roses for £12.99, or this Heart Ornament is £10.99. If you've left your present purchasing until the last minute, Prime members can get free next day delivery of the LEGO Bouquet of Roses for £54.97 on Amazon, as well as a the Flower Bouquet for £42.99, which is £12 cheaper than on the official LEGO website.

A new poll found the talk, delivered in Washington on August 28, 1963, was found by Britons to be the most powerful of all time. In it, the American activist called for equal civil and economic rights and an end to racism in the United States.
The speech was said to have had an important role in helping pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and is seen as one of the most motivating addresses in history. Second on the list was Sir Winston Churchill’s We Shall Fight on the Beaches speech, given in 1940 - a year after the outbreak of World War 2.
In it, the wartime Prime Minister aimed to counter the jubilant public reaction provoked by the evacuation from Dunkirk and remind them that the Battle of Britain was about to begin. In third place was Nelson Mandela’s 1964 speech, Prepared to Die, made while in court as he faced the death penalty for sabotage, furthering communism and aiding foreign powers.
Other notable orations that made the top 10, compiled by insights agency Perspectus Global, was the late Queen Elizabeth II’s 2020 We Will Meet Again speech, made in the face of the coronavirus lockdown and Margaret Thatcher’s 1980 speech at the Conservative Party Conference, in which she famously declared “The lady’s not for turning!”.
The poll also found 93% of people say a powerful speech can be a catalyst for change, while 77% say they have been brought to tears by an inspirational speech.
Caitlin MacLean, of Perspectus Global, said: “We wanted to look at the most impactful and important speeches of all time, and it’s fascinating to see that a 60-year-old speech from the American civil rights activist and Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr is the one that moves Brits the most.”"

Zeus turned on his new owner and another man who both suffered injuries as they tried to defend themselves before armed police stepped in and shot the large dog with a Taser. Despite the volts the animal continued mauling the pair and was eventually shot dead by officers in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire.
The dog had been rescued from England and brought to Scotland just two weeks earlier it has been revealed. His owner was rushed to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital with serious lower limb injuries. His current condition is unknown. A second man was taken to Hairmyres Hospital and treated for minor injuries.
An eyewitness said: “A knife was thrown to the owner to try and kill the dog. He stabbed it but it didn't make any difference."" Another witness, named Kevin, said: ""I heard a lot of commotion and looked out the window to see two men wrestling with the dog. It was a big dog, probably about eight or nine stone. It had hold of one of the guys and wouldn't let go.
""They were hitting it with stuff and shouting at it to stop, but it was so distressed and angry. There was blood everywhere. The owner was covered in blood. His legs, hands and wrists looked badly injured. I phoned the police and when they came the dog was still attacking anyone who went near it. One of the guys managed to get away but the owner was still being attacked.
""Police showed up and Tasered him but he still wouldn't stop. Then armed police came and he was shot four times. The first 2 shots didn't take him out. It was awful to witness, but I know why they had to do it. If he hadn't been killed, he would have killed someone.""
CCTV footage from before the attack show the dog happily wagging his tail and jumping up at the counter of a local shop when he is fed a biscuit. The sweet scene was soon replaced with another full of blood when the dog suddenly mauled his owner and another man.
Local Day Today shopkeeper Numan Saifi told the Daily Record : “Zeus was in here with his owner just before the attack. I can't believe this has happened. He always seemed calm and friendly. The dog would come into our shop most days and always seemed very well-behaved. He would jump up on the counter to get his dog treats and had a little innocent face. He had been rescued a few weeks ago after he was beaten and abandoned. You could tell he hasn't been treated well in the past because he was covered in scars. It's tragic this has happened.""
Police Scotland confirmed the dog was shot dead by specialist armed cops after it also attempted to attack an officer. The incident will now be referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner because a firearm was discharged during the response to the incident.
Superintendent Steven Espie said: “This was a distressing incident for those involved. I would like to reassure the local community this was a contained incident and there is no further risk to the public. There will be a continued police presence in the area while our enquiries continue. Enquiries are also ongoing to establish the breed of the dog.”"

Only recently, the ITV soap was full of heartbreak on New Year's Day as teenager Heath died after joyriding in a car with his twin sister Cathy and Angelica King. The teenagers had been desperate to go to a New Year's Eve party out of the village but couldn't get a lift and their dad Bob Hope refused to pay for a taxi. The trio were left bored at the B&B's party so decided to take matters into their own hands, stealing Wendy's car to joyride to the party.
Since the crash, both Cathy and Angelica have claimed the other person was driving with the village left torn over who to believe, especially Bob who has been refusing to see Cathy in order to protect her from himself. On Thursday, it was the day of Heath’s funeral, and a guilty Angelica decided to tell the truth.
Angelica confessed to her gobsmacked mother, Nicola King, that she was the one driving the car when Heath died as she worried about being sent to prison. On Friday night, it aired the aftermath as Nicola struggled with the bombshell and upon telling husband Jimmy King, he stormed out the house unable to cope.
In scenes this week, despite being urged to lie from Jimmy, Angelica runs over to the B&B where she publicly confesses to a shell-shocked Liam, Brenda, Cathy and April. Later, at the police station, she is arrested for causing death by dangerous driving. In upcoming scenes next week, Nicola is gloomy as she returns from resigning her post at the council.
Meanwhile, Jimmy and Nicola are both apprehensive as they tell Angelica there is a date for her hearing, leaving the family worried. Later, lawyer Ethan Anderson delivers Nicola the bad news that Angelica will likely face a custodial sentence. Yet there's more drama ahead as Bob is left shaking with anger when Jimmy admits he was the one who told Angelica to lie.
The next day, the King family prepare for Angelica's hearing and protective mother, Nicola, urges Jimmy not to tell Angelica about her potential custodial sentence. However, Jimmy is unsure if it’s the best strategy for their little girl and is later left shocked when a distressed Nicola desperately seeks a way out of Angelica's situation by lying by saying Angelica should claim ""not guilty"".
After an argument breaks out, the worried parents agree that they can help their daughter without making her lie. Later, Nicola and Jimmy head off with Angelica, where they spot Brenda and Bob, who are delighted the charges against Cathy have now been dropped. What's next for Angel and is this an exit for the young character?

MPs were told that tourists heading to Europe could be forced to join mammoth queues around the Port of Dover when the EU Entry-Exit System launches in October. Ashford Borough Council told Parliament's European Scrutiny Committee that 14-hour queues are a ""reasonable worst case"" scenario if the scheme is implemented as planned.
Delays at the port could also create long tailbacks, potentially blocking access to the Eurotunnel in Folkestone. Eurostar also warned that there could be queues of more than an hour in terminals at peak times.
High Speed 1, which runs UK high-speed rail services, said that the decision not to enable online pre-registration would ""put enormous pressure on infrastructure at St Pancras International"".
Sir Bill Cash, Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, said: ""Queues of more than 14 hours, vehicles backed up along major roads, businesses starved of footfall: this evidence paints an alarming picture of the possible risks surrounding the Entry-Exit System's implementation.
""Clearly, this policy could have a very serious impact, not only for tourists and travel operators but also for local businesses. I implore decision makers on both sides of the Channel to take note of this evidence. The scheme is due to be implemented in October this year; the clock is ticking, and these issues must be urgently addressed.""
But Downing Street tried to downplay the risks of delays. A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""On some of those scenarios, rightly we're not going to get into hypotheticals about delays.... but there are tried and tested contingency plans in place and a lot of work is managed by the Kent resilience forum so we will make sure we're prepared and our focus remains on ensuring the scheme does not unnecessarily impact local communities or resort in delays for travellers.
""We are working very closely as you would expect with the French, with all the port authorities to ensure that travellers and passengers do not experience unnecessarily delays, that work continues.""
Downing Street also sought to reassure Brits there would be no shortage of red roses on Valentine's Day due to post-Brexit border checks. Labour MP Daniel Zeichner raised concerns in the Commons over the difficulties for importing flowers.
But a No10 spokeswoman said: ""I'm sure people will be receiving bouquets of flowers on Valentine's Day this year."""
UJYXSEIDJL_8NU0GB7WLF1QSQY,Home Alone actor Devin Ratray's domestic violence trial postponed amid hospital dash,Chiara FiorilloNews Reporter,"11:08, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/home-alone-actor-devin-ratrays-31945292,"Home Alone star Devin Ratray's domestic violence trial has been reportedly postponed following his recent hospitalisation.
The 47-year-old actor, best known for playing Kevin McCallister's older brother Buzz in the 1990 film, was taken to the hospital ""in critical condition"" in New York City. Details on the reason for his hospitalisation are scarce, but a family member said the actor has now been discharged and has been told by doctors to stay home and rest.
Ratray was due to go to court in Oklahoma this week after being accused of pushing and punching his ex-girlfriend in December 2021. In the alleged altercation, he reportedly put his hands on her throat and mouth.

According to TMZ, his ex-girlfriend told police that Ratray told her: ""This is how you die,"" during the altercation. The actor was arrested on felony domestic assault, battery by strangulation, and misdemeanor domestic assault and battery.
Devin made bail and was released after paying $25,000 (about £19,600) in bond. He made his first court appearance in February 2022 and entered a not guilty plea.
He was supposed to appear in court on Monday, January 22, but his hospital stay forced a delay in the trial, reported TMZ. A pre-trial has now been scheduled for next month. Devin had denied any wrongdoing.
Ratray's attorney Scott Adams said in a statement: ""Mr. Ratray denies he ever laid a hand on her or did anything in regards to anything like that. What we do know happened was the individual he was with and he was from out of town (and) got into a disagreement. She called the police eventually.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
""They showed up at the scene and two patrol officers talked to Mr. Ratray. They talked to the female. They didn't see anything that they thought was sufficient enough to place him under arrest or take him into custody.""
The domestic abuse allegation is not the only allegation he has faced. Devin was under investigation in August 2022 for an alleged rape that happened in 2017. The victim was friends with Devin and claimed that the actor drugged her drink. She came forward after he was arrested for the crime he is currently facing.
Besides becoming well-known for playing Buzz in the 1990 movie Home Alone alongside Macaulay Culkin, Devin has had various acting roles. He was in films like Dennis the Menace, Nebraska, and Blue Ruin.
Devin made guest appearances on hit shows like Chicago Med, Hawaii Five-0, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. His most recent roles were in 2022 when he played Kevin in Kimi and appeared in an episode of Better Call Saul.

UL8X2MCSVA_QHELGKR0T78G4ES,Woman astonishes cleaning fans with little-known washing machine drawer feature,Julia BanimAudience Writer,"15:33, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/washing-machine-drawer-hack-cleaning-31967574,"A game-changing hack could help you clean out your fiddly washing machine drawer in no time at all.
Keeping your washing machine well maintained is important, as the damp environment inside the machine can quickly become a breeding ground for mould. Wiping inside the seal to clear out any water is vital, and you should always make sure to give the drawer a clean regularly too, as water and laundry products can build up there inside.
Thankfully, one woman has come up with a way to make sure your washing machine drawer remains clean all the time so you don't have to spend time scrubbing all the fiddly nooks and crannies. The cleaning fanatic, whose name is Faith, said she never knew she could remove the drawer so it could be cleaned separately, and the revelation transformed her cleaning routine.
She only found this out when she noticed it had a button to push down so it could be removed. Noticing the compartment was looking rather grimy, Faith set about cleaning it using a simple yet effective combination of warm washing up liquid water, a toothbrush, and a cloth.
After ""a lot of scrubbing"", Faith was able to get her washing machine drawer sparkling once more, and many have been impressed by the satisfying results. Taking to the Facebook group Cleaning tips and tricks in 2022 with before and after pictures of her drawer, an incredulous Faith wrote: ""How on earth did I not know this drawer came out?! I'm not officially an adult and love cleaning haha! Thank you, everyone, for your cleaning tips and tricks"".
Many other members were similarly amazed by the apparently little-known hack, having also had no idea whatsoever that the drawer could be removed and scrubbed separately in this way. One astounded woman wrote: ""They say you learn something every day. Well, today I learned this thank you"". Another gasped: ""I not know of this trickery either!""
Offering help to those who weren't sure how to get their own drawers to budge, various members who've tried this hack before advised to press down in the middle of the drawer, right where the fabric softener is poured, before giving it a gentle pull.
We'll definitely be giving this a go for ourselves!

UNSZRODR76_LP96DXR1MQJHJSD,Alabama nitrogen execution: Kenneth Eugene Smith dies after being pumped with toxic gas,Abigail O'LearyNews Reporter,"Updated09:05, 26 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/live-nitrogen-execution-kenneth-smith-31962131,"Death row inmate Kenneth Smith has been executed in Alabama with a never-before-used method involving the administration of nitrogen through a face mask, expected to suffocate him to death.
The method is widely criticised by experts and human rights advocates who warn that Smith will be subjected to torture for a second time after an attempt to put him to death via lethal injection in 2022 failed. Staff had him suffering for hours in the death chamber as they weren't able to set an intravenous line to administer the poison.
EXCLUSIVE: Alabama's plan to kill death row inmate with nitrogen gas is an 'unknown experiment'
Alabama strapped Smith today to a gurney in the execution chamber — the same chamber where he was strapped down for several hours during the lethal injection attempt — and place a “full facepiece supplied air respirator” over his face. After he is given a chance to make a final statement, the warden, from another room, will activate the nitrogen gas. The nitrogen will be administered through the mask for at least 15 minutes or “five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,” according to the state protocol.
Kenneth Eugene Smith was convicted in 1988 in the $1,000 (£790) murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Sennett. Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the slaying, was executed in 2010.
Smith’s 1989 conviction was overturned. He was convicted again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge overrode the recommendation and sentenced Smith to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury’s death penalty decision.
The state had predicted the nitrogen gas would cause unconsciousness within seconds and death within minutes. State Attorney General Steve Marshall said late Thursday that nitrogen gas “was intended to be — and has now proved to be — an effective and humane method of execution.”
Asked about Smith’s shaking and convulsing on the gurney, Alabama corrections Commissioner John Q. Hamm said they appeared to be involuntary movements.
“That was all expected and was in the side effects that we’ve seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “Nothing was out of the ordinary from what we were expecting.”
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said the execution was justice for the murder-for-hire killing of 45-year-old Elizabeth Sennett in 1988.
“After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr. Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes. ... I pray that Elizabeth Sennett’s family can receive closure after all these years dealing with that great loss,” Ivey said in a statement.
The state had previously attempted to execute Smith in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldn’t connect an IV line.
In a final statement, Smith said: “Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards. ... I’m leaving with love, peace and light.”
He made the “I love you sign” with his hands toward family members who were witnesses. “Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,” Smith said.
The execution took about 22 minutes, and Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes. For at least two minutes, he appeared to shake and writhe on the gurney, sometimes pulling against the restraints. That was followed by several minutes of heavy breathing, until breathing was no longer perceptible.
Following Thursday's execution, Elizabeth's son Mike Sennett, joined by his brother Chuck, issued a statement, saying it was a ""bittersweet day"". He said: ""Nothing happened here today that’s going to bring Mom back. It's kind of a bittersweet day. We're not going to be jumping around, around, hooting and hollering ""hooray"" and all that. That's not us. But we're glad this day is over.
""All three of the people involved in this case years ago, we have forgiven. Not today but we have in the past. Some people may not believe that, you know, how do you forgive somebody. Well, in an effort to be more Christ-like, try to live his teachings and stuff, it is my duty and it is a weight off my shoulders.
""I forgive him, I forgive him what he done, I don't like what he done but they are forgiven from us. The Bible says evil deeds have consequences — and Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions 35 years ago — and his debt was paid tonight.
""Some of you may have heard us talk about over and over about 35 years, 35 years. 35 years - Kenneth Smith, Parker, Williams - Williams not so much because he died in the system, but Parker and Smith have been incarcerated almost twice as long as I knew my mom. Elizabeth Dorlene Thorne Sennett got her justice tonight.""

In a press conference following the execution, officials described the moments after gas was delivered, saying Smith appeared to hold his breath for as long as he could as he struggled against restraints""
Officials said there was visible ""involuntary movement and heavy breathing"" - saying the procedure was ""all expected"" and ""nothing out of the ordinary"".
Nitrogen gas flowed for 15 minutes from the point of delivery to when Smith was confirmed dead.
Death row killer Kenneth Smith was allowed a final meal before his nitrogen gas execution - the first of its kind, which has been heavily criticised as inhumane.
Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, said his last meal consisted of a Waffle House order: T-bone steak, hash browns and scrambled eggs in A.1. sauce and toast. Procedure around the method of execution reports meant Smith was denied food for eight hours before his death.
Smith was said to have consumed his final meal at 10am on Thursday morning, before being denied any further solid food before his death and only clear liquids. According to a court document, the decision to ban all solid foods in the eight hours before his death was to reduce the likelihood of him vomiting during the execution and limit any ""substantial risk of harm"".

Smith's official time of death was recorded at 20:25 on Thursday, 25 of January.
Smith was sentenced to death in 1989 for acting as a hitman to murder a preacher's wife. He survived an execution attempt in 2022 because medics could not find the veins to deliver the lethal injection. Smith later described the experience as ""like being up under a sewing machine.""
His nitrogen execution came after a last-ditch appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the killing, but judges ruled it could go ahead and refused to grant a stay of execution. But not all the judges were in agreement.
Death row killer Kenneth Eugene Smith has become the first prisoner to be executed by a controversial nitrogen gas after surviving the first execution.
The 58-year-old becomes the first-ever inmate to be killed by nitrogen gas at Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility. Speaking ahead of his execution, Smith said: ""I am not ready for that. Not in no kind of way. I'm just not ready, brother.""
The state of Alabama had predicted in federal court filings that the nitrogen gas ""cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes.""
The state placed a ""full facepiece supplied air respirator"" over Smith's face"" allowing the nitrogen to be administered for at least 15 minutes or ""five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,"" according to the state protocol.
Critics of the controversial death penalty said it was unclear what Smith would feel after the warden switches on the gas, according to medics.

Smith's attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the execution to review claims that the new method violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserves more legal scrutiny before it is used on a person.
""There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person,"" Smith's attorneys wrote.
In the hours ahead of the scheduled execution, Smith met with family members and his spiritual adviser, according to a prison spokesperson.He ate a final meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Hood said by telephone.
""He's terrified at the torture that could come. But he's also at peace. One of the things he told me is he is finally getting out,"" Hood said.Smith is one of two men convicted in the 1988 murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Sennett.
Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance.
Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma - have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, but no state has attempted to use the untested method until now.
Much of what is known about death by nitrogen gas comes from industrial accidents or suicide attempts. Dr. Philip Nitschke, a euthanasia expert who designed a suicide pod using nitrogen gas and appeared as an expert witness for Smith, said nitrogen can provide a peaceful, hypoxic death, but said he has concerns about Alabama's proposal to use a mask.
Nitschke told The Associated Press that Smith's facial hair, jaw movements and involuntary movements as he feels the effect of the nitrogen could impact the seal.
If there are leaks, Smith could continue to draw in enough oxygen, ""to prolong into what could be a very rather macabre, slow process of slowly not getting enough oxygen,"" Nitschke said. He said he could envision scenarios where the execution goes quickly or seriously awry.
Smith's Spiritual leader Reverend Doctor Jeff Hood issued a final statement ahead of the planned execution. He said: ""The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse.
“Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other.”
Smith, 58 - who was sentenced to death in 1989 for acting as a hitman to murder a preacher's wife - previously survived an execution attempt in 2022 because medics could not find the veins to deliver the lethal injection. Smith later described the experience as ""like being up under a sewing machine"".
On Wednesday, Smith was reportedly visited by a friend, his brother, two nieces, his son, grandson, wife, attorney and spiritual leader.
He reportedly was visited again by family just hours before his death this morning and also spoke to his wife on the phone. The official witnesses to his last moments alive are said to be his witnesses are set to be his wife, two sons, attorney, and a friend, reports AL.com.
The family of Smith's victim, Elizabeth Sennett, are reportedly at the prison awaiting the execution - including her two sons who lost their mother in 1988.
Smith was one of two men found guilty in the murder-for-hire killing of Elizabeth Sennett in 1988. The prosecutors said that he and another man were paid $1,000 each to kill Sennett by her pastor husband, who was deep in debt and wanted to cash in on insurance.
Elizabeth Sennett, aged 45, was discovered dead in her home in Colbert County, Alabama, with eight stab wounds in her chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner's report. Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr., took his own life when the investigation started pointing towards him as a suspect, court documents reveal.
Ronnie May, the former chief investigator with the Colbert County Sheriff's Office, remembered the terrible scene in 1988 when he responded to Charles Sennett's call reporting his wife's death. He said: ""She fought it and she fought hard. It was horrific to me. You feel for the victim and what they went through - and the horror she went through in her last minutes.""
In a statement, The Innoncence Project – a non-profit organisation working to free wrongfully imprisoned – condemned the use of the “untested” method of execution. In a damning statement, they said: ""Today, the state of Alabama is scheduled to conduct an execution via nitrogen hypoxia, a method that has never been used on a human being and is prohibited for the euthanasia of animals. This is Alabama’s second attempt to execute Kenneth Smith, who survived a botched lethal injection just 14 months ago,” the statement read.
“The Innocence Project – whose mission is to free the innocent, prevent wrongful convictions and create fair, compassionate and equitable systems of justice for everyone – currently represents multiple individuals under sentence of death.
“Because more than 3,000 innocent people have been wrongfully convicted and exonerated in the United States, including almost 200 who were sentenced to death; because it is likely that innocent people have been executed; and because no person should be subjected to torture, we condemn Alabama’s use of this untested method of execution.
“Our hearts go out to the friends and families of Elizabeth Sennett and Kenneth Smith.”
If the research into executions by nitrogen hypoxia weren't grim enough, the spiritual advisor for Kenneth Eugene Smith told The Mirror US that he had to sign a waiver of liability just to be able to enter the chamber and be with the convict.
It essentially bars the state of Alabama from any legal liability if injuries or deaths happen from the nitrogen in the chamber.
""I've never been in another execution where I've had to sign another waiver like that. It's strange. It's bizarre. And it's just absurd that's even something that had to be a part of this.""

When Kenneth Eugene Smith is executed by nitrogen hypoxia, his spiritual advisor, Rev. Dr. Jeff Hood, said it will be ""like putting a bag over your dog's head and holding it as hard as you can until the dog is dead,"" referring to the act as ""barbaric.""
""That's what nitrogen does to a living thing, and that's what we're going to see,"" he told The Mirror US. He added that it's an untested method and that it could also lead to a ""visceral"" reaction in Smith when it begins.
""If he throws up in the mask and chokes to death, I think you’re looking at a horrific moment. That mask is very quickly going to look like a volcano exploding out of his face,"" Hood added. And he said the Alabama Department of Corrections wouldn't care if that happened — it would still be considered a successful execution even if he choked to death on his own vomit.
The Mirror US reached out to the DOC for comment but didn't immediately hear back.

Rev. Dr. Jeff Hood hugged his five young children extra tight before he left for Alabama's William C. Holman Correctional Facility for the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith by nitrogen hypoxia, telling them that he loves them repeatedly.
Hood fears he might not make it out of the death chamber alive, citing several issues that could result from the execution method that could prove fatal to everyone who will be in the chamber with the convicted hitman. If the mask leaks, he and others could be exposed to the deadly chemical.
""If the seal breaks and nitrogen is released into the room, you are talking about an incredibly small room where there’s very little ventilation and very little means for the gas to get out, for the nitrogen to get out,"" he told The Mirror US. ""Yeah, it certainly is terrifying.""
He said he even had to sign a waiver before being allowed to enter the death chamber — something he said he's never had to do before at the numerous lethal injection executions he's attended.

On Nov. 17, 2022, Kenneth Eugene Smith was strapped to a gurney in a tiny chamber at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.
Medical officials prepared him for an IV, which was to administer the lethal drugs that would put him to death after over 30 years on death row. But as they went to insert the needle into his arm, there was a problem — they couldn't find a vein.
So, for four hours, he was poked and pricked, prodded like a pin cushion, and yet the executioners still couldn't find a vein. The execution was called off, and Smith was in excruciating pain.
His spiritual advisor, Rev. Dr. Jeff Hood, told The Mirror US: ""Kenny describes the initial botched execution like being up under a sewing machine — just consistently being poked over and over and over again. It’s horrific to think about.""
The botched execution resulted in a moratorium on executions for a few months as the state attempted to figure out what had gone wrong and how to fix it.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for a halt on the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith on Thursday, citing cruel and unusual punishment and torture in the method being used.
Nitrogen hypoxia, the high commissioner said, would amount to torture and inhumane, degrading treatment of another human, making it a violation of Smith's human rights, the BBC reported.
During Deanna Smith's last visit with her doomed husband, convicted killer Kenneth Eugene Smith, before his scheduled execution on Thursday, she brought her Bible as she always does to go over verses with him.
But before she could enter the room, a prison official confiscated the holy book, telling her that she wasn't allowed to have it in the room with her.
According to Lee Hedgepeth, who interviewed the woman for his newsletter, Tread by Lee, she asked: ""My Bible? I've brought it to ever visit I've had. I brought it to every visit the last time you tried to kill him."" This time was different, though, and she wasn't allowed to carry it in.
Hedgepeth wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""In the shadow of her husband Kenneth Smith's scheduled execution by gas, the State of Alabama confiscated Deanna Smith's Bible during a visit. She said it's just another way for state officials to arbitrarily flex their authority over her family.""
Since she was elected in 2017, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has overseen the executions of 14 death row inmates, and the death of convicted killer Kenneth Eugene Smith will be the 15th.
Many appeals to her office to stay executions or prevent the deaths of several of the men on the list went unheard or denied, and Smith's own appeal was no different.
Ivey was responsible for instituting the moratorium on executions in 2022 following the first botched execution of Smith himself, during which executioners took hours to find veins to insert needles for the lethal injection drugs.
It had been the second botched execution in as many months, and the third since 2018, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, causing her to call for a ""top-to-bottom review"" of the state's procedures before the moratorium was lifted in February 2023 — mere months after it was instated in November 2022.
During the trial for convicted hitman Kenneth Eugene Smith, a jury recommended 11-1 to sentence the man to life in prison without the possibility of parole — the standard penalty for first-degree murder in most states when the death penalty is invoked.
But due to a legal concept known as judicial override, a judge was allowed to review that sentencing and overturn it. And so, despite being recommended for a life sentence, Smith was handed the death penalty.
The practice was outlawed in Alabama in April 2017, making it the last state to ban the practice of overriding juries, but that was after the final sentencing of Smith. At 6pm CT on Thursday, he is scheduled to be put to death as a result of the now-banned practice.
Kenneth Eugene Smith is slated to be the first person executed in 2024 out of 10 scheduled deaths in five states. He is also the only person scheduled for execution in Alabama this year.
Twenty-four people were executed in 2023, with two from Alabama — James Edward Barber and Casey Allen McWhorter. All died by lethal injection.
The state had a temporary stay on executions after a few botched ones in recent years.
Waiting for his execution on Thursday, especially after the one the state of Alabama botched in 2022, has been nothing short of ""torture"", the convicted killer told the BBC.
Nightmares, panic attacks and other horrible after-effects from that first botched execution, during which executioners took several attempts to find a viable vein to insert the needle for the lethal injections.
Smith said he feels nauseous all the time and that he has lost a lot of weight over the last couple of years.
Smith's attorneys on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to halt the execution to review claims that the new method violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserves more legal scrutiny before it is used on a person.
Smith's attorneys wrote: ""There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person.""
It comes after justices on Wednesday rejected Smith's argument that it would be unconstitutional to make another attempt to execute him after the failed lethal injection.
The state executioner of Alabama, and warden of William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, where Kenneth Smith is set to be put to death today, was a former Alabama State Trooper fired two decades ago.
Terry Raybon became the warden of William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore in 2021. A judge once described him as a man who ""beats on women, consorts with felons, and neglects his official duties,"" per AL.com.
Kenneth Smith's execution is scheduled to begin at 6pm local time (7pm ET, 12am Friday GMT) but could be delayed because of legal action or preparation.
Authorities have a 30-hour window to carry out the execution, and that started at 12am local time (1am ET) today and will end at 6am (7am ET) tomorrow, Friday, January 26.
The execution is scheduled to take place at William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.
Protesters are expected to gather outside the facility starting 5pm local time.
Kenneth Smith's method of execution, which involves the administration of nitrogen gas through a face mask, has been deemed ""cruel"", with an expert warning that it even was rejected as a method to kill animals by veterinarians.
With just hours left until the planned execution, Maya Foa, the Joint Executive Director of the non-profit organization Reprieve tells TheMirror.com: ""Once again, Alabama is seeking to hide the reality of what goes on in the execution chamber, switching methods to avoid having to answer questions about what went wrong last time, and now proposes to use a method that has been rejected by veterinarians as a way to kill animals.""

As Kenneth Eugene Smith counts down the hours to the state's second attempt to execute him, one expert has warned that ""we don't know"" what his death will be like as a new form of execution, nitrogen hypoxia, is set to be used on the death row killer.
In a highly controversial decision, Smith will be executed using nitrogen gas, the first person to be put to death by this method in the US. The untested method has sparked pushback and fierce debate surrounding the ethics of nitrogen hypoxia as a form of execution, and now, one expert has warned that the untested nature means ""we don't know what dying by nitrogen hypoxia will be like"" and it could be ""incredibly painful and/or distressing.""
Professor J Wesley Boyd works as part of the faculty at the Center for Bioethics and is an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He spoke to The Mirror about Smith's upcoming execution, and what the convict could experience as he is suffocated using nitrogen gas.

Since the horrific failed attempt of execution that Kenneth Smith went through in November 2022, he has been haunted by nightmares of being escorted back into the death chamber.
Smith told the Guardian: ""I am not ready for that. Not in no kind of way. I’m just not ready, brother. All I had to do was walk into the room in the dream for it to be overwhelming. I was absolutely terrified. It kept coming up. [...] I dream that they’re coming to get me.""
Recalling the crime of which he was convicted, he said: ""Wish I had done things differently. One second, one moment in a man’s life. And that’s been the only incident – I’ve not had any incident with officers, not a single fight with inmates, in 35 years. Violence is not who I am.""
He added: ""I’ve been in prison for 35 years, how have I not been punished? Thirty-five years. I have not gone unpunished for 35 years. I have suffered doing this. So has my family."""
UUK1P0QR6G_719WOWGY64NGV50,Ousted Tory ministers pocketed £1million in payouts in Boris Johnson and Liz Truss chaos,Lizzy BuchanDeputy Political Editor,"17:01, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ousted-tory-ministers-pocketed-1million-31968364,"Nearly £1 million was paid out to quitting ministers during Boris Johnson and Liz Truss’s chaotic administrations, analysis reveals.
Figures buried in the Department of Health and Social Care’s accounts show Sir Sajid Javid accepted £16,876 in compensation after he helped to trigger Mr Johnson’s exit from No10 by resigning as Health Secretary in July 2022. Sir Sajid was the 20th Cabinet Minister to receive a bumper payoff during the turmoil of 2022, taking the final bill for severance payouts for ministers to £933,086, according to Labour.
Some of those who accepted cash under the ""loss of office"" rules, re-joined the Government months later. It was revealed last summer that £2.9 million of taxpayers' cash was spent on payouts to special advisers in 2022/23, taking the total cost including their bosses to £3.83 million.
Mr Johnson and Ms Truss both accepted payments of £18,660, despite being ousted from office in disgrace. Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Grant Shapps, Dame Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Kwasi Kwarteng also took the payouts.
The Mirror previously revealed that Cabinet Office bunglers wrongly awarded flasher ex-MP Peter Bone almost £5,600 of taxpayers’ cash when he was sacked as a minister. The veteran politician was over the age of 65 when he was handed the payout - which means he should not have been eligible.
Three other ministers - Maggie Throup, Sir David Evennett and Baroness Stedman-Scott - were all also wrongly awarded compensation due to their ages, with a total bill of £33,107.
Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry said: ""These are the wages of chaos, with Britain's taxpayers forced to pick up the bill. Thousands of pounds of public money have gone directly into the pockets of Tory minsters, as a sick reward for the mess they made of our country and the damage they did to our economy.
""In a year when families were desperately struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table, it is disgraceful to think that more than £900,000 was spent on severance payments for the ministers who helped to deepen that misery.""
Downing Street said there are no plans to change the rules around payouts for ministers.
Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said: ""There are long-established rules around severance payments and ministers that lose their roles and are then reappointed in a certain timeframe, for example, are not eligible. That is something that is set out clearly and I think agreed through Parliament. I'm not aware of any plans to change that approach."""
UUR1B8FISR_OCR4548CUV76DK7,Car production 'revived' as one million vehicles made for first time since 2019,Lawrence Matheson,"09:50, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/car-production-revived-one-million-31963192,"The number of vehicles built in the UK in 2023 exceeded one million for the first time since 2019, new figures reveal.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported a total of 1,025,474 cars and commercial vehicles were produced, marking a 17% increase on the previous year. The easing of pandemic-related issues such as chip shortages and lockdowns, along with an increase in electrified model production, contributed to this surge in production, according to the SMMT. They added that the industry's fortunes have been ""revived"".
In 2023, several new models entered production and around £23.7 billion of private and public investment commitments were made. Production of battery electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid (HEV) vehicles rose to 346,451 units, a 48% increase from the year before, accounting for nearly two-fifths of overall output.
The EU remained the sector's largest global market, taking 60% of exports, with the United States and China following. Exports to Turkey also increased, making it the UK's fourth biggest global market. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""Receding supply chain challenges, new model introductions and a massive £23.7 billion of investment put UK vehicle production firmly back on track in 2023.""
He added, ""Industry will now focus on the delivery of these commitments, transitioning the sector at pace to electric and scaling up the supply chain."" With global competition as fierce as it has ever been and amid escalating geopolitical tensions, both government and industry must remain singularly focused on competitiveness, with all the jobs and growth this will bring. We are in a much better position than a year ago, but the challenges are unrelenting.""
Meanwhile, the SMMT confirmed that fancy car producers had another fantastic year, with combined volumes zooming up by over 6% to 34,613 units, an estimated worth of whopping £7.1 billion.

UUVD8H3D4G_TL8JZ988J3831UV,"Whole UK 'must prepare for conscription within 6 years' unless Putin defeated, claims prof",Ryan MerrifieldNews Reporter,"17:59, 26 Jan 2024Updated18:03, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/whole-uk-must-prepare-conscription-31978009,"The whole of the UK must prepare for conscription within six years unless Vladimir Putin is defeated, a world affairs expert has told the Mirror.
Downing Street was forced to rule out widespread military call ups after the head of the Army General Sir Patrick Sanders said British civilians would need to prepare to fight Russia in a future war. Under current Government proposals, it is predicted the number of fully-trained soldiers will be reduced to 72,500 from a commitment of 82,000 by next year.
He told the International Armoured Vehicles conference in Twickenham on Wednesday the Army would not be big enough to fight an all-out-war with the former Soviet nation even if it numbered 120,000. Gen Sir Patrick said we need a military that can expand rapidly and train and equip a citizen army, while a shift in mentality of the every day person is needed.
However, on the same day the PM's official spokesman said No 10 did not agree, adding: “The British military has a proud position of being a voluntary force. As I say, there’s no plan for conscription.”
The spokesman said it was unhelpful to debate whether Britain was strong enough to fight Russia. “I think these kinds of hypothetical scenarios, talking about a conflict, are not helpful and I don’t think it’s right to engage with them,” he said, adding that the Government had invested “significant sums into our Armed Forces”.
Prof Anthony Glees, security and intelligence expert at the University of Buckingham, told the Mirror General Sir Patrick is ""absolutely right on this"". He said: ""The UK Government should plan to sign up volunteers now and over the next three years and 'the whole of the nation' should prepare for conscription within six years unless Putin were defeated.""
Last weekend, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps refused to say when a Tory pledge to raise defence spending will be met - despite saying the risk of war has increased. The Defence Secretary was challenged over whether the UK is ready for war, with defence spending below its target of 2.5% of GDP.
Asked when the UK will meet the target, he told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: ""There is a trajectory upwards. I can't give you the exact date because we've always said it's as the economic conditions allow. But the point is we're working to a plan.""
Prof Glees said it's ""totally horrifying"" the Ministry of Defence has ""rubbished"" Gen Sir Patrick's comments and said he's ""puffing"" AI, the internet and DragonFire - a British laser directed-energy weapon technology demonstrator - ""instead of understanding the necessity of having a good supply of young men and women, eager to be trained for warfare"".
He continued: ""Beginning with what the General said, we then need to look at the gathering storm of war clouds over Europe and the world and so understand why he said what he said. Sir Patrick was insisting we need to do two things: first, to boost our regular army...to 120,000 by 2027 - i.e. very soon, to include our reserve and strategic reserve but that this would not be enough.
""We should be spending at least 2.5% of GDP on defence, 3% would be better. In fact we are spending far less, what Shapps calls 'comfortably more than 2%, but not 2.5% - Shapps refused to say how much we were spending right now. Secondly, Sir Patrick said the 120,000 would need to be augmented by a 'citizen army' which would have to be produced from a 'whole of nation' effort.
""The MoD shot down this suggestion at once, claiming it wasn't a call for conscription but just dangling the idea of a 'citizen volunteer' force in front of our eyes. I'm not entirely sure this is true. What Sir Patrick said is that we were in a 1937 moment - so two years before the outbreak of the last European war and four years before the outbreak of the Second World War.""
Prof Glees said there was no conscription in 1937 but there was 'limited' conscription in May 1939, and by the end of 1939 1.5million men had been conscripted. He said: ""I would see a 'limited conscription', a call-up of incentivised volunteers, as being very much on the cards if Putin is now thrown out of Ukraine. Obviously, if there were a wider European or world war conscription would follow at once.
""Whilst it is true that our Trident nuclear submarine fleet deters Russia - or China, Iran and North Korea) from using nuclear weapons to fight a war with us, Putin's awful aggression against Ukraine shows that nukes did not, and do not, deter him from fighting a conventional war so that is what he's doing.
""This is why our armed forces are so vital. The situation in Europe is far more dangerous than many can see, not least politicians who think voters won't be happy about this in an election year."" Prof Glees went on to say: ""Putin thinks we Brits are weak and divided, just as Hitler said we were just a chicken whose neck could be wrung. By re-arming and re-building our woefully small armed forces we will show Putin he's got us entirely wrong.
""Putin has repeatedly said he wants the post 1997 NATO states to be disarmed and brought back into the Russian orbit, re-creating the system of satellites that was the strategic policy of the USSR. Conventional warfighting can do this, he reasons."" He said this is why Lord Cameron ""is so right"" to warn against '1930s appeasement', thinking, as Trump ""clearly does"", that if Putin is given Ukraine, ""he'll go away and leave the rest of Europe alone"".
""There's not a snowball's chance in hell of Putin just going away,"" Prof Glees said. ""Britain's national security has always, always depended on the security of continental Europe. Whether in the EU or out of the EU, engaged with Europe, or isolated from it, we've never been immune from events twenty miles away across the Channel.
""Indeed that is the nub of the matter. Short of Putin turning into a suicidal madman, he's never going to risk a nuclear war to destroy Ukraine because it would end up destroying him as well. But as he's seen, a conventional war is a different matter altogether. In 1937 as Lord Dannatt pointed out the UK was spending under 3% on defence and at that time we had an Empire to defend. By 1940 46% of the UK's GDP had to go on defence spending.""
Gen Sir Patrick has previously said the Ukraine war ""brutally"" illustrates regular armies start wars but citizen armies win, to which Prof Glees said: ""Exactly so."" He continued: ""He's bang to rights in pointing out that in order to do our best to ensure there is not general European war with Putin's Russia within the next 20 years - as Admiral Bauer, chair of NATO's Political Committee predicted the other day - we have to be able to deter Putin and his generals from starting a wider war.
""In other words, the UK Government should plan to sign up volunteers now and over the next three years and 'the whole of the nation' should prepare for conscription within six years unless Putin were defeated,"" he added."
UUYH677PKE_W47SS4DZDYJDD95,Common habit during day is little known symptom that could mean you have dementia,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"10:50, 26 Jan 2024Updated10:54, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/common-habit-during-day-little-31972643,"Brits are being warned by an expert of a common habit during the day that could actually be a sign of dementia.
Taking a nap might appear to be innocuous but Dr Rayaz Malik said that it could be a symptom of dementia as a person becomes weaker. Dementia is a group of related symptoms associated with ongoing decline of brain functioning.
There are many different causes and many types of dementia. The  NHS  says: “It's normal for your memory to be affected by stress, tiredness, certain illnesses and medicines. But if you're becoming increasingly forgetful, particularly if you're over the age of 65, it's a good idea to talk to a GP about the early signs of dementia.""
Research shows there are more than 944,000 people in the UK who have the disease with one in 11 people over the age of 65 suffering from it. The number of people with  dementia  is increasing because we are living longer and it is estimated that by 2030, the number of with it in the UK will be more than one million. While there is no cure for dementia there are treatments to delay its impact and support available to ease symptoms. And there are lesser known symptoms like taking naps that are a sign of the condition.
Dr Rayaz Malik, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine told the Express: “Taking frequent daytime naps is also a notable behaviour associated with certain conditions, including dementia, and losing interest in friends and family is a sign that may indicate dementia.”
This is supported by the Alzheimer’s Society, which says that people in the later stages of dementia have a tendency to feel sleepy. “It is quite common for a person with dementia, especially in the later stages, to spend a lot of their time sleeping – both during the day and night,” said the charity.
“This can sometimes be distressing for the person’s family and friends, as they may worry that something is wrong. Sleeping more and more is a common feature of later-stage dementia. As the disease progresses, the damage to a person’s brain becomes more extensive and they gradually become weaker and frailer over time.” Sleep problems in general are quite common among people with dementia.
Sleeping during the day and being awake and restless during the night
Becoming disorientated in the dark if they wake up to use the toilet
Waking up more often and staying awake longer during the night
Getting up in the early hours and thinking it’s day time or time to go to work (disorientation in time)
Not being able to tell the difference between night and day.
The Alzheimer's Society said: “Nobody completely understands why dementia affects sleeping patterns. For some people, it may be that their internal ‘biological clock’, which judges what time it is, becomes damaged so the person starts to feel sleepy at the wrong time of day.""
Short term memory loss
Challenges with routine tasks, such as driving to familiar places
Cognitive impairment may lead to difficulties in keeping a track of the day of the week, month or even year
Vision and spatial awareness
Naming objects becomes a challenge
Social interactions may decline
Changes in mood, including over-forgetfulness and depression."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed it has initiated a formal investigation into the planned £15 billion merger. It will consider whether the merger could lessen competition for mobile users by combining these two firms into a single service provider.
If consumer concerds were found during this primary study, the CMA could launch a more comprehensive investigation into the union. The largest mobile phone network in the UK would be created by this merger, which was announced last year.
As expected, regulators scrutinised this deal, reducing the number of significant mobile providers in the UK from four to three. Trade unions have also voiced their concern regarding the possibility of job losses due to the merger.
Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA stated: ""This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy. The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps.""
She added: ""We now have 40 working days to complete this formal phase one investigation, before publishing our findings and any next steps."" Vodafone UK's boss, Ahmed Essam, responded to the CMA's announcement, saying: ""We have formally submitted our merger notice to the CMA, having worked with them closely through the pre-notification process.
""We look forward to continuing the constructive conversations now that the formal process has begun. We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players.""
""Our commitment to invest £11 billion will build capacity to meet the exponential growth in demand for data and accelerate the rollout of advanced 5G across the UK, delivering benefits to consumers and businesses throughout the nation.""
Three UK's chief, Robert Finnegan, said: ""By combining networks, Three UK and Vodafone UK will unlock £11 billion of investment that will help the UK close the 5G gap with leading European countries and realise its ambitions to be a front-runner in digital connectivity. Thanks to this transaction, 95% of the population and every school and hospital will be covered by standalone 5G by the end of the decade.""
""Joining forces will also yield more immediate benefits. From day one, our customers will enjoy faster, more reliable coverage over more of the country and without paying a penny extra. We are confident that this transaction will deliver significant benefits to our customers, the country and competition, and we look forward to working closely with the CMA as they review our notification.""
The Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, has raised national security concerns over a UAE firm becoming the major shareholder in Vodafone. In an order published on Wednesday, it was stated that the relationship between Emirates Telecommunications Group (Etisalat by e&) and Vodafone could ""enable it materially to influence the policy of Vodafone"".
Dowden ruled that e&'s stake in Vodafone could pose ""a risk to national security"" regarding cybersecurity and the operator's role as a key supplier to many parts of government. E& has built up a 14.6% stake in Vodafone, deepening a strategic tie-up that began in May 2022.
Vodafone announced in May that e& chief executive Hatem Dowidar would join their board as a non-executive director. Eight months after the initial move, Mr Dowden has now set conditions for Vodafone and e&.
These include ""meeting certain requirements relating to Vodafone's board composition"" and establishing a ""establish a national security committee to oversee sensitive work that Vodafone and its group perform which has an impact on, or is in respect of the national security of the UK"".

Storm gusts which hit 90mph last night and this morning have had a destructive impact on flight schedules, with planes having to divert hundreds of miles after being unable to land at certain airports due to the power of the wind.
One Ryanair plane from Manchester came within metres of touching down at Dublin Airport, only to abandon the landing and divert 500 miles to Paris, where the calmer weather made hitting the tarmac possible. They spent 2.5 hours on the runway in France before flying back to Ireland.
One person on the flight wrote online: ""Flew from Manchester to Dublin today, only we didn't land in Dublin, or back to Manchester. Bonjour from Paris!""

A British Airways flight on its way from Ibiza to London City Airport was diverted in the winds, with nervous passengers erupting into applause when the gush-gattered plane eventually touched down. Scores of passengers were left stranded at Bristol Airport overnight as their flights were either delayed or cancelled.
Arrival and departure boards show delays and cancellations this morning at a number of airports including Dublin, London Gatwick, Birmingham, Heathrow and a number of others.
Graeme McQueen, media relations manager at DAA, the operator of Dublin Airport, told the Mirror: ""Dublin Airport is open and operational today. Winds associated with Storm Isha have eased this morning, while wind direction has changed to a more favourable westerly direction, allowing for a smooth first wave of flights.
""However, with some aircraft still out of position, a total of 29 flights have been cancelled so far today, including 16 arriving flights and 13 departures. This is in addition to the 166 inbound and outbound flights that were cancelled by airlines on Sunday. In addition on Sunday, 36 flights opted to divert away from Dublin Airport to other airports, while 34 aircraft performed go-arounds.""
Those due to fly today are advised to check with their airline for a status update before heading to the airport and re-book cancelled flights online rather than at the airport, to avoid making the terminal busier.
There were 14 cancellations leaving Manchester Airport yesterday due to air traffic control restrictions and Logainair cancelling its schedule.
A spokesperson for Manchester Airport explained why planes were being sent on such long diversions. They said: ""You’ll have seen coverage of flights to Dublin being sent to France. That was because of NATS advising operators to look outside the UK when diverted.
""Where planes are diverted to Manchester we make sure there is a facility to look after disembarked passengers but it’s for airlines to decide to disembark. Airlines, some in particular, are sometimes loathed to do this because it effectively cancels the flight and they end up with displaced planes. And just to add, we’re advising passengers to allow extra time to get to the airport and to stay in touch with their airline.""
London Gatwick was also impacted by the storms. Its spokesperson said: A spokesperson for London Gatwick said “Flights are mostly back to normal this morning. But we would advise passengers to check with their airline before travelling. Yesterday we managed to accept the vast majority of scheduled flights, but 22 were diverted due to weather. Additionally, London Gatwick accepted five flights diverted from other UK airports.”
EasyJet has warned passengers to expect ""some knock-on impact this morning, as a number of aircraft are out of position"" following cancellations and delays yesterday.
“We are doing all possible to minimise the impact on our customers, providing those on cancelled flights with options to rebook or receive a refund, as well as hotel accommodation and meals where required,"" a spokesperson for the airline said."

At least 1,300 unaccompanied children - some as young as 14 - were wrongly put in unsupervised adult accommodation and detention in 18 months, figures show. Campaigners say the findings show there is something ""fundamentally wrong"" with Home Office decision-making at the border.
Fourteen under-18s spent time in adult prisons after being charged with immigration offences after being wrongly age assessed between January 2022 and June 2023, it is claimed. And Humans for Rights Network says it identified 832 cases where a child may have been sharing accomodation with unrelated adults - including 50 who it was unable to find.
A 16-year-old girl, whose age has since been accepted, told researchers: ""When I said my age they said to me you are lying, so they took us to a private room and a lady asked me some different questions, she said ‘ok your age, I can guess your age is 22’.
""She said because you arrive by boat, you must know what you are doing, therefore you are over 18."" The teenager, from Eritrea and identified as Helen in the report, added: ""The hotel I am in now, there are lots of people, more than my age, men more than my age, I find it quite stressful here.""
Kamena Dorling, director of policy at the Helen Bamber Foundation - which produced the report along with the Refugee Council and Humans for Rights Network - said: “These new figures show that there continues to be something fundamentally wrong with Home Office decision-making at the border, and hundreds of children are suffering as a result.""
And Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""Each case is a child who is being put at risk and whose welfare is being forgotten. It is an alarming child protection failure and the Government must take urgent action so every child is kept safe.""
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Age assessments can be challenging and there is no single method which can determine a person's age with precision. Many individuals arriving in the UK who claim to be children often don't have clear evidence like an original passport or identity document to back this up.
""We are strengthening our age assessment process, including establishing the National Age Assessment Board and specifying scientific methods of age assessments. Measures under the Illegal Migration Act will ensure the swift removal of individuals who have been assessed as adults and who have no right to remain in the UK."""

The five- year-old was at Paddington station and desperately needed the bathroom. Trouble was, her English didn’t stretch further than “Yes” and “No”.
Nor was it appropriate for her foster father, a 6ft-tall, dog-collared Baptist minister in a black suit whom she had met only minutes before, to accompany her down the wide steps to Platform 1 and escort her through the ladies' toilets himself. The kindly, if initially austere-seeming man resolved to ask the female toilet attendant if she wouldn't mind inserting a penny in the brass machine on his behalf and letting Renate into the facilities, so that the pair could continue on their way to Cardiff.
But after having ""spent her penny"", little Renate wasn't strong enough to turn the heavy lock by herself. ""He had to give someone another penny and say, 'there's a little girl shouting down there, I don't know if she is shouting German or Czech, but will you please let her out?'"", Renate, now 90 years-old, reminisces, her eyes glittering with laughter.
Renate has only hazy memories of the journey which brought her 800 miles unaccompanied, by steam train and ferry, to escape the Nazis.
What she does remember is her mother protesting that she was too ill to board the train, Renate being stricken with chickenpox and a fever on the day of departure. A friend of the family, a doctor saying goodbye to her own daughter, urged: “If you don’t put her on the train, she’ll never go”.
The doctor's warning proved prophetic - and saved Renate's life. Hers was the eighth and final Kindertransport train allowed out of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. On September 1 1939, Hitler invaded Poland and all borders were closed. A ninth transport carrying 250 Jewish children was stopped from leaving. Most of those children were sent to Terezin concentration camp and later transferred to Auschwitz, where they perished at the hands of the Nazis.
We are meeting today ahead of today's Holocaust Memorial Day, when the world remembers the six million Jews murdered in the Second World War, the millions of others persecuted by the Nazis and those killed in later genocides.
""It's our 85th anniversary and there's so few of us left,"" says Renate, one of the few lucky enough to escape continental Europe before the horrors of the Holocaust were unleashed.
Renate lost 64 of her relatives. The last correspondence she received from her mother, Hilda, was a ""typewritten happy birthday message"" sent via the Red Cross from a concentration camp in June 1942. Hilda and Renate's grandmother Jenny are believed to have been shot after their train broke down on the way to Treblinka extermination camp, though their death certificates, held at the Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Israel, simply state “Treblinka”. Renate’s father, Otto, and uncle, Felix, died in Auschwitz.
As we talk, Renate stretches out her left hand and motions toward two rings soldered together on her finger: “That’s my mother’s and that’s my grandmother’s,” she says matter-of-factly. The rings were smuggled out of Treblinka in a loaf of bread by the same doctor who had convinced her mother to put her on the train.
Shielded from the horrors with a foster family in Porth, South Wales, Renate says she “must have been more than seven before I realised there was something wrong”.
Back in Prague, all she’d known of Nazism was that German soldiers took over her nursery. “I think they thought of us children like the ones they left at home. But I was always told ‘Don’t have anything to do with the ones who dress in black leather coats and black hats’, which I never had any contact with,"" she recalls.
Today, Renate speaks with an unmistakably Welsh accent. Her foster father, Reverend Sidney Coplestone, was ""very intent"" on her learning English quickly, and by senior school she was top of the class.
“They’d never heard of Czechoslovakia in the valleys and they’d never heard of a Renate. Eventually, three of the church members, their children named the grandchildren after me. So I often wonder where these Renates are!”, she chuckles.
In 1988, Renate attended the famous filming of the BBC’s That’s Life programme with Esther Rantzen when Sir Nicholas Winton, the stockbroker-turned-activist whose rescue mission before the outbreak of World War Two saved her and 668 other children from the clutches of the Nazis, was surprised by so many he saved. The emotional moment is a favourite on social media. Sir Nicholas, who died in 2015 aged 106, is also the subject of the new film One Life starring Sir Anthony Hopkins.
When they met again for the 70th anniversary of the Kindertransport, her sons, Peter and Paul, shook his hand and thanked him for saving their mother.
“We’ve got the most wonderful picture of me in the middle, Peter one side and Paul the other, with Sir Nicholas Winton. And he is concentrating – he was halfway through a sandwich!”, she says.
Renate was so young when she became a refugee that she feels “philosophical” about it – and is a “professional” at telling her own story. The way she tells it, she could be talking about someone else. Her attitude seems similar to that of her birth mother, who she also describes as “philosophical” and says “brought her up hard, to be able to stand up for myself”, perhaps in the knowledge of what was to come. When Renate’s foster mother, Arianwen, first gave her a hug, she “looked up at her and didn’t know what she was doing”.
Renate is grateful to Britain for being “the only country who said they would take us in” but points out that “the foster parents were left to their own devices, there was no back-up, no one ever enquired”.
It was meeting King Charles (then Prince) on the 80th anniversary of the Kindertransport in 2018 that helped Renate realise the gratitude now went both ways. “He said, ‘yes, I accept your thanks, but I would also like to thank you for what you brought to this country’, and that was a great boost. That was quite pleasing, to hear he felt we brought something into the country”, Renate says.
Asked why she is so willing to keep talking about her painful past, Renate says “Young people need to realise that we all need to learn to live together”."
V4GLRRRNKJ_9YM925Y103EGAYA,Overlooked supermarket self-checkout 'rule' that's leaving shoppers gobsmacked,Zahna EklundAudience Writer,"09:57, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/overlooked-supermarket-self-checkout-rule-31953233,"You might think self-service checkouts allow you to scan and pack your shopping however you want - but it turns out there are rules in place that many of us don't know.
These days, most supermarkets have a handful of self-service checkouts that you can use to scan your own shopping, with the idea being that it saves you time, especially when you only want a few items. Alongside being faster than queuing up at a manned till, many would argue one of the benefits of the self checkout is the ability to scan your items in whatever order you like, which can make packing your bags easier.
But one woman has found that not all supermarkets let you do things exactly the way you want to, and some of them have overlooked rules that many of us were unaware existed.
Teya, from Australia, made the self-service checkout discovery when she was shopping at the Australian supermarket chain Coles, where she headed to the checkout with her shopping, including a bulk box of mineral water. She was baffled, however, when the employee monitoring the self checkout area demanded that she scan her mineral water first.
In a video posted to her @teya0466 account, she said: ""I was using the self-service checkout, the one with the conveyor belt. I was going to purchase a box, or a carton, of mineral water, and the lady who was overseeing the area was very insistent on helping me. I was like, 'No it's fine, I'm in the self checkout, I'll just do it myself'.
""She was like, 'Okay, but can you scan it [the water] first?'. I'm like, okay, that's a bit weird, I don't know why. But she was very adamant that I had to scan the carton first. Do you know why I had to do that? Can you let me know? If you work at Coles, what is the reason for having to scan your groceries in a certain order when you're using the self-service checkout, and why do they even care?""
Commenters were quick to give Teya the answers she was looking for, with several employees at Coles and other supermarkets telling her that the rule was put in place to stop the theft of bulk items. One person told her: ""As an ex-Coles service employee, it's because bulk items are their highest stolen item. Even at the normal registers, they'll ask you if you have any bulk items first. It's hard on workers.""
Someone else also wrote: ""As a Woolies worker I don't often shop at Coles but to be honest bulk items are monitored due to theft. Not saying that all customers would thieve - but the loss of bulk items adds up daily. Same as fruit and vegetables.""
The rule on bulk items at the checkout is not set in stone in UK supermarkets, but there are other ways they are clamping down on shoppers stealing items by scanning their shopping incorrectly. Last year, Tesco and Sainsbury's began trialling schemes in which shoppers would have to show their self checkout receipts before leaving the supermarket.
The scheme left many shoppers reeling, with some saying it ""makes life harder"" and is bad for the environment, as you now need to print a receipt instead of being able to opt out and go paperless. At the time of the scheme's launch in May, a Sainsbury's spokesperson said the introduction of the barriers ""is one of a range of security measures in a small number of stores"".
In Australia, a Coles spokesperson told Femail: ""Our team members are always encouraged to help our customers where possible. Where a customer has certain items, which may include bulky or heavy items, our team will offer to assist them in scanning the items when checking out. This is all about providing great service to our customers and helping them get through the checkouts quickly and efficiently.""

Sharing the news with her followers, Ruby admitted the romantic moment was almost ruined by food poisoning. The baker confirmed her long-term partner had proposed more than three weeks ago, but she had wanted to tell each of her family members before making the engagement public. ⁣
Announcing the news on Instagram, she wrote: ""Have deceptively been hiding my hand in the recent the vids because it’s taken me about 3 weeks to tell most of my family whilst it took James a whole 3 minutes.
""I wish we had a romantic story to go alongside it but food poisoning managed to kick in right about 5 mins before he was about propose and I was about to have a bridesmaid moment running across the street... so yay for love and yay for uncooked chicken in NYC.""
⁣She added: ""I love this life (time to start planning a big FAT Indian wedding but all I’m thinking about is the CAKE am I right?!)""
Ruby, who finished the 2018 series as a runner-up, posted a series of photos from her recent trip along with the announcement revealing that James cheekily hid the engagement rings in plain sight while his now-fiancée obliviously went about her day.
In the collection of pictures, Ruby is seen brushing her teeth and sleeping on a plane while James secretly flashes the rings to the camera. In one clip, Ruby can be seen walking through Central Park while the presenter repeatedly flashes the ring without her noticing.
The Great British Bake Off finalist captioned the post: ""POV: You're prancing around New York unaware you're about to be proposed to."" Ruby's pals from the Channel 4 cooking competition rushed to congratulate her, with one even suggesting her former co-stars could cater the wedding.
Rahul Mandal, who won the series in 2018, commented: ""Congratulations, what amazing news. Waiting for this to happen for years. But the big question is 'who is baking the cake?'...you have a lot of options, just saying."" Ruby replied: ""Thank you Rahul!!

Orla Baxendale, 25, a dancer originally from Lancashire, had moved to New York to pursue her career in the arts. When tragedy struck, an EpiPen was unable to save her.
This cookies were sold by Stew Leonard's, a chain of supermarkets in the US, and manufactured by Cookies United, with undisclosed peanuts. The grocery store, in partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration, has since recalled the batch of Vanilla Florentine Cookies. About 500 packages of the cookies were sold, Stew Leonard's said in a video post about Ms Baxendale's death and has asked for customers to return the product to their stores.
A statement by Orla's family's lawyer on January 11 said her death was confirmed as an ""unfortunate incident involving the consumption of a cookie."" The legal representatives wrote: ""Preliminary investigation has revealed that Órla’s death occurred due to the gross negligence and reckless conduct of the manufacturer and/or sellers who failed to properly identify the contents of the cookie on the packaging. This failure in proper disclosure has led to this devastating yet preventable outcome.""
They added: ""We stand with Órla’s family in this difficult time and extend our deepest condolences. They have been overwhelmed and comforted by the outpouring of love, support, and tributes from around the world. Órla’s vibrant spirit and her relentless pursuit of excellence in her art have left an indelible mark on all who knew her.""
Back home in Lancashire, tributes poured in for the young and talented dancer. Orla's sister and star of E4 series My Mad Fat Diary, Ciara Baxendale, wrote on Instagram: ""Órla was radiant, a dreamer. I am so honoured to say that this girl is my sister, she was just so cherished by everyone. She aimed for the stars and truly deeply lived for her dreams every day of her life. I’ll never stop talking about my Órla. I felt like she was my twin, my little sidekick.
""She used to always joke and say that she was my mini me, but there is no one like Órla. She was so unique and special, there never was anyone like her and there never will be.
""I’ll will never ever, as long as I am on this earth, stop talking about how radiant, how beautiful, how kind, how cool, how hilarious, how witty, how vibrant she was. She had a golden touch. Everything about her was magical, she was just so otherworldly. She looks just like an angel, and I just cannot believe that she has gone. I’ll carry her with me always, in my heart, and by my side. If you met her, you are lucky, she was just such a warm and golden soul, she’s left a trail of light behind her and she will never be forgotten.
""It is just incomprehensible that allergies can take lives and it’s a tragedy and a living nightmare that they do. Please, please educate yourself and everyone around you about anaphylaxis, how to use epipens and how to spot the warning signs for severe allergic reactions. I wouldn’t want this to happen to any other family, the pain we feel for her absence we will never have the words for. I love her with my whole entire heart and her presence in our lives will be missed forever. I really hope our little Órla is somewhere dancing amongst the stars.""
Westholme School in Blackburn, where Orla attended before moving to the US, spoke of her ""charismatic smile and her happy, kind-hearted nature"" in a tribute. The school said: ""This weekend we received the tragic news of the passing of former student Órla Baxendale. Órla joined Westholme in 2010, brightening the corridors with her  charismatic smile and her happy, kind-hearted nature. As an outstanding dancer from a young age, Órla was pursuing her dream as a professional dancer in New York City. We will always remember her lighting up the stage with her brilliance and raw talent.""
Stew Leonard's issued an updated recall of the Vanilla and Chocolate Florentine Cookies on Thursday, following an earlier recall this week, saying ""the cookies contain undeclared peanuts and eggs"" and that those with an allergy to either food ""run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction"". The product had been sold in two Connecticut towns starting 6 November and they remained on shelves until the end of the year.
Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Bryan Cafferelli called Ms Baxendale's death ""a heartbreaking tragedy"". He said his state agency was working with local and federal officials as well as other states in an effort to ""prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future"".
Stew Leonard's president and CEO Stew Leonard Jr alleged that the Cookies United changed the ingredients ""from soy nuts to peanuts"" and the company's chief safety officer was not notified of the change, a claim challenged by the Long Island-based manufacturer, saying that it notified Stew Leonard's in July 2023 of the recipe change.
General counsel for the company said all products shipped to Stew Leonard's were labelled accordingly, adding that the product ""is sold under the Stew Leonard's brand and repackaged at their facilities"" with the incorrect label."

Emergency services were called to Highgate Road, Bradford, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A neighbour said barriers surrounding the manhole had been blown ""all over the place"". He said: ""From what I've been told a man was leaving the pub and he's fallen into the hole and banged his head. It happened late last night and I think I must have walked past him on my way to work.
""Those holes are much deeper than you think and the barriers are there for a reason. But the winds were horrific and had blown them all over the place. The winds might have even blown the poor chap into the hole. It's heartbreaking to think that he had been there all night.""
Another resident, who asked not to be named, described the tragedy as a ""freak accident"".

He will serve as a non-executive director and help oversee the running of the business. Mr Gilinski Bacal invested about £100 million into the bank through his firm Spaldy Investments, which increased its stake in the bank from 9% to nearly 53%. This means he is now a controlling shareholder.
Metro Bank had been struggling with debts and concerns over its finances, but announced in October that it had secured a funding package worth £925 million. The bank said this ""proves there is a place"" for its branches, or ""stores"", in towns and cities.
Jaime Gilinski Bacal, one of Latin America's richest men with an estimated worth of about 5.4 billion US dollars (£4.2 billion), is based primarily in London. He has long-term investments in banks in Latin America, Spain and the UK, and is known for his strategy of buying into struggling lenders and turning them around.
Robert Sharpe, the chairman of Metro Bank, has praised the appointment of Mr Gilinski Bacal, stating: ""He brings decades of banking expertise and experience, which will prove invaluable in the next stage of the bank's journey. Jaime's appointment underscores the commitment he has long shown to the bank as a supportive, long-term shareholder,""
Mr Gilinski Bacal expressed his excitement about his new role, saying: ""There are many opportunities for Metro Bank to grow, and I am looking forward to playing a part in the evolution of the bank as we build on the solid foundational work undertaken to date. A customer-centric physical presence complemented by digital capabilities remains a unique offering and sets Metro Bank apart.""
In November, Metro Bank announced it was cutting about a fifth of its workforce to save around £50 million a year. The bank, known for its community-based model, is also considering whether to stay open seven days a week to be more ""cost-efficient"" while keeping its high street presence. Currently, it opens from 8.30am until 5pm Monday to Saturday and 11am to 5pm on Sunday.

Lorraine Stanley is set to reprise her role on the BBC soap, just weeks after she left Walford for Spain. Karen left under a cloud when she took full responsibility for the orchestrated kidnap of Albie, Sharon and Keanu's son. She decided to leave the Square for good, taking Phil Mitchell's money - which he gave to Sharon to pay off the kidnapper - with her.
However, new listings for the BBC soap have confirmed Karen will make her return in early February. Not much is known about her being back, or whether it will be permanent, but there's no doubt Phil will want his money back when she returns.
She will also be heading back to Walford following the death of her son Keanu Taylor, who was killed by Linda Carter in shocking scenes on Christmas Day. No one apart from The Six know he's dead yet - so what will Karen think when she arrives back to see he's gone, with the women having spun a story to say he attacked Nish and fled Walford?
Speaking about her exit from the show previously, Lorraine said: ""I just want people to remember her as the best mum on the square, a heart of gold, she'd give you her last fiver and would do anything for her kids - a bit like myself.""
She also penned an emotional message to fans on social media, where she added: ""Hey everyone! I'm so grateful for all of your lovely messages this past week. Thank you to Daran Little for creating the Taylors and to the BBC for giving me the opportunity to play such a fabulous character, I'll be sad to be saying goodbye to Karen Taylor and will miss all the cast and crew at EastEnders."" However I'm looking forward to my next chapter and excited about being a jobbing Actor again and starting new ventures.""
However, she later revealed she was ""struggling"" to find new work. She wrote back in December: ""Self tape setup in the loft, I'm so not technical but I'm proud I've managed to set it up all by myself, with advice on equipment by @_zack_morris. Just finished one and its hard work... I'll get there, it's a struggle watching yourself back & not being highly critical on yourself... just let it go & send it."" She then added ""#sent,"" to confirm she took the brave step of sending off her audition.

VGKQHZ7TZR_44VH7DITEA7VSOJ,"The risks of weight loss surgery explained after Brit, 20, dies of botched procedure",Graeme MurrayNews Reporter,"08:20, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/risks-weight-loss-surgery-explained-31947900,"The risks of undertaking weight-loss surgery have been explained a British woman died following botched surgery abroad.
Morgan Ribeiro decided to have an operation suffering cruel taunts from bullies for several years. She and her boyfriend travelled to Turkey to have a £2,500 gastric sleeve fitted on January 5, with the 20-year-old choosing to have the procedure overseas to avoid being put on ""an NHS waiting list for years.""
The 20-year-old told posted about her plans before she embarked on the journey and openly told followers about the operation. She said: ""My last post before weight loss surgery - see you on the other side."" After she had been through the surgery, she was told she was safe to go home after just three days. But Morgan became very ill during return flight to Gatwick, forcing the aircraft to make an emergency landing in Serbia after she was diagnosed with septic shock.
According to reports, around 10cm of her small intestine had been cut during the procedure, and she eventually had a heart attack on January 9. Doctors placed her in an induced coma but she died four days later in a Belgrade hospital.
The NHS is now warning Brits to carefully consider the implications of surgery abroad. Health experts say people should cautious of websites selling cosmetic surgery as part of a holiday, highlighting a ""consultation with a surgeon"" is essential and anyone considering it should ""avoid meetings only with sales people"".
The service also warns patients on its website not to pay for a hospital which they have never seen or for a consultation with a surgeon they have never met. It states on its website: ""While it's possible to have a holiday before surgery, it's unrealistic to have one straight after as this can increase the risk of things going wrong. You need to rest. You should not drink alcohol, lie in the sun, go sightseeing or go in the water.
It was reported Morgan had a virtual consultation with the Turkish company in September last year before she booked the surgery. But her boyfriend, James Brewster claims doctors and translators failed to highlight any risks linked to the operation. He said his partner was ""really hot and in a lot of pain"" on the flight home. He added: ""The flight attendant gave her some ice and water and she was finding it hard to breathe so they took her to the front of the plane where there was more space, they tried to give her an oxygen mask. I could tell something was seriously wrong.""
Morgan's mother Erin Gibson wants to raise up to £10,000 to repatriate her daughter's body. She told the Independent: ""Growing up she was bullied a lot, she's always battled with her weight and been a bigger girl and she had a really rough time with it. I told her she was beautiful inside and out, she really was a beautiful girl. By the time I found out it was too late, she was already on the plane. I had that sinking feeling because I'd heard horror stories about Turkey. I never ever want this to happen to another daughter. I don't want her life to be in vain."""
VJVP93HNJP_W7549P898DDDK4U,Woman cleared of spiking colleagues' coffee with Viagra despite hidden CCTV footage,Kelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter,"15:51, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-cleared-spiking-colleagues-coffee-31967163,"A factory cleaner accused of spiking the office coffee with Viagra has been cleared more than five years after she was first accused.
Karen Beale, 62, had claimed during her three-day trial at Canterbury Crown Court that she had been ""set up"" and suggested that one senior staff member found her ""irritating"", and that the camera footage which allegedly implicated her had been tampered with. The former Dover resident told the jury she simply checked one Nescafe Blend 37 coffee jar ""under instruction"" from the general manager and maintained she had never added any substance to it.
Ms Beale, who worked as a holistic therapist before becoming a cleaner, was unanimously cleared after jury of seven men and five women, deliberations lasted just over three hours. She had denied two offences of attempting to administer a poison or other destructive or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy between November 2017 and September 2018.
The mum of three thanked the jury as she was released from the dock and a young woman, believed to be her daughter, sobbed in the public gallery. Despite Ms Beale's arrest in September 2018, proceedings took three years to reach the crown court. After the verdicts had been returned, Judge Simon Taylor KC told jurors the delay had been due, in part, to Covid.
""This case was very old and delayed due to various events we have experienced including the worldwide panic, but it needed to be resolved and has been now thanks to your hard work and dedication,"" he said. At a pre-trial hearing in December last year, the same judge had remarked that the court ""owed Ms Beale an apology"" for such a lengthy wait.
The trial heard she had been employed at fire protection product manufacturer Envirograf in Dover for seven years when she was secretly filmed allegedly fiddling with the jar of instant granules in September 2018. The covert camera had been placed in the spine of a lever arch file after the firm's accountant Katrina Gravenor began to notice a strange taste, blue and white specks, and a slurry in her drink. ""Not what you would expect to be in Nescafe,"" said prosecutor Matthew Hodgetts at the start of Beale's trial. The court heard Ms Gravenor, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, had started to feel ill and stopped drinking her coffee when she noticed the ""specks"".
She then installed the motion-activated camera, switching it on when she left her office at night and turning it off once back at work in the morning. Filming started around mid-August 2018 and when she checked the footage a few weeks later she saw Ms Beale, employed to clean at night, handling her coffee jar.
Ms Gravenor, who had been appointed as accountant when Ms Beale's husband James worked for the firm in credit control, then took the memory card to a friend, asking him to copy the clips, and handed it in to police. Giving evidence, she said the footage was ""genuine"", had not been tampered with and was not ""part of a plan"" to incriminate her colleague. She added she had not discussed the issue with general manager Paul Ackerman-Mond and there had been no disagreements between herself and Ms Beale.
In the 13-minute-long footage, with the first clip dated September 10 2018, Ms Beale could be seen wearing blue latex gloves as she picked up the jar, occasionally shook it, and took off the lid to decant some of the contents before placing it back onto a shelf. One clip also showed her using her sleeve pulled over her bare hand in what the prosecution alleged was an attempt to avoid leaving fingerprints behind. Police were alerted and it was discovered that the jar, as well as one in the office belonging to company secretary Jean Smith, contained a number of abnormal 'ingredients'.
These included Sildenafil - an erectile dysfunction treatment sold under the Viagra brand name - as well as a medication for high cholesterol. But although none of the chemicals were toxic or would have ""necessarily caused problems"", explained the prosecutor, it was said the full-time cleaner had ""hoped and intended it would have some effect"".
Ms Beale, who lived in The Street in Eythorne, Dover, but now has an address in Winsley in Westbury, Shropshire, had previously worked as therapist based in Faversham and then her home. In a character reference provided to the court, a former client described her as someone with ""integrity and compassion"" who would ""help people not harm"". Following Ms Beale's arrest she was sacked from her job for gross misconduct, a decision she appealed. Police also searched her home but did not find any substances which could have been used to contaminate the coffee."

Newlyweds Paolo Mugnaini and Valeria Ybarra were forced to spend their honeymoon night in seperate hospital beds after their reception party ended with friends and family burried under rubble.
Video footage shows the converted convent, Convento di Giaccherino, in Pistoia, Tuscany, filled with dancing guests on January 13 as the party gets into full swing. But just moments later, a huge hole, taking up the majority of the floor's area, opens up - sending dozens of guests falling 25 feet from the attic into the floor below.
As the dust settles, other guests can be seen looking down into the hole as guests gasp and scream in terror as the footage ends. Local media reported that 30 guests needed treatment, with many of them in hospital, including the bride and groom.
Images show Newlyweds Paolo and Valeria lying hand in hand beside each other in separate hospital beds with a drip attached to Paulo's arm. Another photo shows accident investigators examining the structure of the room guests fell into through a nearly perfectly round hole.
The couple have now filed a complaint against the venue with local prosecutors, handing over the footage as evidence. Pistoia Public Prosecutor's Office is also investigating the incident for causing injury by negligence.
Paolo's father, who has not been named, told local media: ""It happened while people were dancing. I immediately tried to help."" Prosecutors have since shut the building down to investigate its structural integrity.
On the website of the venue, operators promise couples an ""unforgettable party"" to ""amaze guests"". The centuries-old convent, located in the countryside near Pistoia, Tuscany, is now listed on Google as being 'temporarily closed', with a number of one star reviews having emerged since the incident.
Leaving comments about the venue, one user said: ""Thank you for almost k1lling me and my girlfriend"", while another added ""very dangerous place. This place is not safe ! Don’t book here!"" One person said: ""It falls apart, in every sense. Dangerous place""
A further added: ""this place is terrible!! Go save your money and book somewhere else!! Go here or you will have a disastrous event!"""
VM3COLP8QY_5TM6UWIS90A4AMF,Terrifying moment drone smashed into Fatboy Slim concert 'like a flying bomb' in front of thousands,Jim Hardy,"10:23, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/terrifying-moment-drone-smashed-fatboy-31971914,"A drone operator has been fined after it smashed into the stage while Fatboy Slim was performing.
Police have shared the terrifying moment a drone shot onto the stage in front of thousands of people. Giles Dalby, who was operating the drone, lost control of the drone over the heads of the crowd and it eventually smashed into the stage at the Brighton concert in July 2022. It is believed to be the first prosecution of its kind under the legislation.
Prosecutors said if it had smashed into the 8,500 spectators- it would be like a high speed ""flying bomb"". Sussex Police have shared the moment of the incident after Dalby admitted to recklessly or negligently causing or permitting an aircraft to endanger a person or property.
‌The 39-year-old appeared at Brighton Magistrates’ Court on January 4 where he was fined £576, with a £230 surcharge and £85 costs. Dalby, who is an amateur photographer, told the court he ""mixed up the controls"" of his device while trying to create a ""cinematic"" video of the gig starring the Right Here, Right Now star.
He put it into sport mode — making it harder to avoid obstacles — and recording data showed he ""ignored multiple warnings"", the court heard. The court heard footage from the drone showed the near miss, fifteen minutes before the gig ended. Prosecutor Megan Attree said: ""The footage shows a near miss with the crowd and performer.
""There was no damage or injury, but the risk was very real. Security were alerted that a drone had crashed into the stage, narrowly missing the crowd and headline act."" Dalby said he has since gained a drone operator licence — and now knows he should not have flown it over the crowd.
He told the court: ""I did not intend to put anyone in danger. I wanted to create a slow, cinematic appearance. I crashed trying to get an overview of the scene. It was an honest mistake that I will never repeat. There was no malicious intent."" Sussex Police and the UK Civil Aviation Authority released the footage to highlight how his use of the drone was illegal and put those in attendance at the concert in danger.
Sussex Police Drone Training Officer PC Steven Prince said: ""Dalby operated a drone above a crowded beach concert on Brighton beach. He lost control of the aircraft which then crashed into the stage, near to a musician who was in the middle of a live performance. Dalby is fortunate that no one was harmed, but this case should act as a reminder to all drone operators about how to stay within the law.""
‌Jonathan Nicholson, of the UK Civil Aviation Authority, added: ""Drones can be great fun to fly and are undertaking more and more useful rules such as delivering medical supplies. However, they must be flown safely and this incident shows what can happen if people don’t follow the rules. Our dronecode provides a simple guide to the rules along with advice on how to enjoy flying your drone.""

VR6A2YH59C_VDQG9XL88CGR6PI,Human remains found at home of suspected serial killer 30 years ago finally identified,Fiona LeishmanUS News Reporter,"16:49, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/human-remains-found-home-suspected-31976911,"Bones found on a suspected serial killer's land have been identified after nearly 30 years.
They were initially dug up at Fox Hollow Farm in Indiana, the home of Herbert Baumeister, in 1996. Now, they have been identified as the bones of Manual Resendez, who was just 34 when he disappeared in August 1993.
Coroner Jeff Jellison said they could tell it was Manual because his family gave DNA early this year. ""I Would like to thank the entire team of law enforcement and forensic specialists that have come together to support this effort,"" he said. It's thanks to many experts that they figured out who the bones belonged to from Baumeister's place near Indianapolis.

The 18-acre estate has yielded around 10,000 charred bones and bone fragments over the years. Despite the remains being discovered almost 30 years ago, Coroner Jellison and the County Coroner's Office are still working to identify victims. The investigation into Baumeister began in the 1990s, with police suspecting he lured gay men to his home from the mid-80s to mid-90s, killed them, and disposed of their bodies on his property.
In 1996, Baumeister, a married father of three, was exposed. However, before investigators could question him about the fragmented remains found on his property, Baumeister took his own life in Canada in July 1996. Although he was never questioned about the crimes, police believe Baumeister was responsible for the deaths of several young gay men in and around Indianapolis. The case started in the early 90s when two detectives began investigating the disappearances of gay men in the area, convinced the crimes were connected.
In 1993, Tony Harris contacted the detectives investigating the disappearances. He claimed a patron of a gay bar, known as 'Brian Smart', had killed his friend, Roger Goodlet, and tried to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session in his mansion after meeting at the 501 Club in Indianapolis.
The detectives told the man to get in touch if he saw 'Brian Smart' again. Two years later, in 1995, he provided the man's license plate number. But after checking records, the detectives discovered 'Brian Smart' was actually Herb Baumeister.
A detective approached Baumeister and told him he was being investigated for the disappearances. They asked to search his home, but both Baumeister and his wife Julie said no. But by June 1996, Julie, scared by her husband's strange behaviour, allowed a search after filing for divorce. The first search happened while Baumeister was on holiday, revealing the remains of eleven men.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
With an arrest warrant out, Baumeister ran away to Ontario, where he ended his own life at a park. He left a three-page note expressing regret for messing up the park and feeling bad about his failed marriage and business, but didn't mention his victims or confess to any crime.
Baumeister is suspected of killing nine more men, their bodies found in rural areas along the I-70 corridor between June 1980 and October 1991. All victims were found near I70, often dumped in rivers and streams. Each had been strangled to death, earning their killer the nickname the I-70 Strangler.
The case remains unsolved, though Baumeister was named the prime suspect in 1999. His wife, Julie, told authorities her husband made many business trips to Ohio, which would have likely taken him along the I-70. Authorities noted that bodies stopped being found in 1991, after Baumeister bought Fox Hollow Farm.

VRZVZ1TARB_4QWNN9HJ7YAB9TH,Incest monster Josef Fritzl seen in public as court grants him 'conditional freedom' after 15 years,Ryan MerrifieldNews Reporter,"09:03, 25 Jan 2024Updated12:59, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-josef-fritzl-freed-jail-31962156,"Evil Josef Fritzl has been granted conditional release from a prison for the mentally ill following appeal.
The 88-year-old incest monster was snapped in a car as he arrived at Landesgericht District Court at 7.20am UK time for a hearing. The first time he's been seen outside prison for 15 years. It comes after he was allegedly seen visiting local cafes near Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau, Austria. He is set to be moved to a regular prison before he is eligible for release in March - though the decision is not yet legally binding.
He was jailed for life in 2009 after keeping his daughter, Elisabeth, as a sex slave, locked in the basement of his home in Amstetten, Austria, for 24 years and forcibly fathering seven children with her. Fritzl was convicted for incest, rape, enslavement, coercion and the murder, by neglect, of his newborn son.
After the court hearing today, Fritzl's attorney, Astrid Wagner, said after the hearing: ""We were successful. It was a long hearing. He told again how he regrets what he did. He was actually close to tears. In summary, the court came to the conclusion that my client is actually no longer dangerous.""
Newspaper Bezirksblatt claimed this week Fritzl ""has been seen in different cafes of Krems"". One staff member at the newspaper who has been covering the Fritzl case for many years told Newsflash that she had been ""told by several people I fully trust that they have seen him"", with ""several trusted acquaintances"" reporting sightings independently from each other.
Judicial officials have refused to comment on the report. The pensioner is eligible for parole in March of this year under Austria's lenient sentencing laws. Inmates who are judged ready for parole can be freed, depending on their conduct and mental and physical condition.
Fritzl, who has repeatedly asked to be released, is set to have his case reviewed by justice and prison officials. As well as suffering from Alzheimer's disease, he is also said to be so frail that he now needs a walking frame to get around. Adelheid Kastner, one of Austria's most renowned psychiatrists, said Fritzl was no longer a threat to society and would be incapable of carrying out any crimes. Psychiatrists and medics continue to monitor his condition.
Fritzl, who changed his name to Mayrhoff in an alleged attempt to evade physical attacks by other inmates, has reportedly applied for an early release several times in the past two years. His lawyer Astrid Wagner, who last year published a book based on a series of his letters, suggested that a new life in a care home is ""within the bounds of possibility"".
She said: ""I personally see a chance for a release. He fulfils all the criteria. This man is almost 90 years old and his mental condition is deteriorating. He needs support and care."" She explained that she is able to communicate normally with him most of the time apart from the ""odd lapses"", including a delusion that his daughter had married Boris Becker. ""The next time I saw him, he told me they had broken up"", she said.
Josef Fritzl repeatedly raped and abused his daughter Elisabeth, who gave birth to seven children. One, who died at birth with breathing difficulties, was heartlessly tossed in a furnace by Fritzl. Three were brought up in the basement with their mother, and three others were brought up as foundlings by sick Fritzl and his wife.
In his trial in 2009, Fritzl pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment, manslaughter by negligence and incest. She has since changed her name and has received support from the authorities in protecting her identity and the well-being of her children."

If you've been as obsessed as we have about The Traitors, you will be equally as impressed (and envious) of Claudia Winkleman's outfits on the BBC1 show. And while we want all of her knitted jumpers and duster coats, we can't quite justify spending hundreds of pounds to look as chic as she. Thankfully, the high street has a number of affordable alternatives, such as this gorgeous green jumper from Superdry that'll set you back £49.99. It's an incredible dupe for Claudia's green Laura Aston Designs oversized knit - which costs an eyewatering £225 - but for much less.
The sage-coloured Slouchy Stitch Roll Neck Knit from Superdry has the shape, roll-neck and hems of Claudia's more expensive jumper, as well as the ribbing but will only set you back £49.99. Crafted with a loose fit, the green woolly jumper is stylish and can be worn country-style - like Claudia with Huntington Wellies and leggings - with jeans and trainers for a more casual affair or even dressed up with a satin or leather skirt.
Get it here.
Now, this dress isn't necessarily new to the high street, but it's been brought to our attention by King of the Jungle Sam Thompson's girlfriend, former Love Islander and documentary maker Zara McDermott after her fans fell in love with the Beige Knitted Wrap Jumper Midi Dress from River Island when she posted an Instagram reel in which she was seen making her beau dinner for date night.
However, the gorgeous knitted dress, that features a deep v-neckline, raglan sleeves and a split hem (to show a sassy bit of leg), has recently been launched in three new neutral colours - black, brown and grey - each priced at £49.
The 27-year-old fans have shared a sneaky way to get it for as little as £21.50 however by shopping the exact same dress in the Very sale. The black and Zara’s exact beige number are now both just £21.50, while the brown is £24.50 and the grey is £38.25.
You can't go wrong with a classic black leather jacket - but what if you want to brighten up your outfit, ready for spring? Michelle Keegan's new Very collection has the answer with its new PU Crop Trench Jacket in a gorgeous camel colour that is inspired by the classic trench coat - featuring shoulder epaulettes, wide lapels and a handy front flap pocket. Made from supple faux-leather, the jacket is soft, comfortable and so chic with its dropped shoulder and relaxed, boxy fit.
Showing how it can be perfect for both winter and spring, Michelle modelled the jacket herself with a tonally matching cardigan and trouser set, also camel-hued, that has a ribbed finish and a nude handbag in teddy material. Neutral perfection!

VUYPOMZX0Z_9IKW0DN42C9EZGT,Keir Starmer vows to end 'weak' rules that let kids with knives write apology letters,Dave BurkePolitical Correspondent,"22:30, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-vows-end-weak-31959458,"Keir Starmer has vowed to get rid of ""weak"" rules he says mean young people caught with a knife can avoid punishment by writing an apology letter.
The Labour leader said those found carrying a blade will ""feel the full force of the law"" if he becomes PM. Mr Starmer, who headed the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) before he was an MP, said he was appalled that half of knife possession cases result in no further action being taken by police in they year to last March.
Lack of punishment has led to young lives being lost, Labour says, while Mr Starmer said a 70% rise in knife crime reports since 2015 highlights Tory failure. He said he had been horrified by killings in his constituency, including that of 16-year-old Harry Pitman on New Year's Eve.
He said: ""The hardest thing I've ever done as an MP, but will continue to do, is go and see the parents of a young person who's been killed. There is nothing harder than that meeting."" He continued: ""We need someone to grip it and say we're not going to put up with this anymore.""
Under Labour, he promised, young people found with a knife have to be referred to a Youth Offending Team. They would face sanctions including curfews, tagging, or behavioural contracts, alongside requirements for parents to prevent it happening again.
Labour has vowed to cut knife crime by half within five years. Mr Starmer said he had been heartbroken listening to a radio interview with the dad of Grace O'Malley-Kumar, 19, who was stabbed to death while defending her friend Barnaby Webber in Nottingham last June. The Labour leader said he was moved by Dr Sanjoy Kumar's call for knife crime to be tackled. He said little had changed since the death of 16-year-old Ben Kinsella, who was stabbed to death in Islington, North London, in 2008.
""I was really struck by Ben Kinsella's dad who listened to Grace's dad. He said: 'That's me speaking 15 years ago, and nothing has changed'."" Mr Starmer continued: ""I can't live with those personal stories that I've heard from grieving parents and simply walk by on this so I'm very happy to have that fight going into the election.
""I don't think they (the Tories) have got a record to stand on. And I don't think they've got the right to pretend that they're the party of law and order.""
Mr Starmer added that youth hubs - identifying kids who are at risk of falling into a life of violence - would be set up using £100million raised by scrapping tax breaks for private schools. And he vowed that a Labour Government would put an additional 13,000 neighbourhood police officers and PCSOs on the streets.
Since 2010, when the Tories came to power, the number of police officers per 100,000 of the population has dropped from 264 to 251. Mr Starmer said this has had an impact on tackling the knife crime epidemic. He said: ""I saw as Chief Prosecutor the power of prevention - lives are being lost to knife crime because Tory governments don’t. Labour will turn this around. We will give young people real support to achieve their potential and stay on track, but flout that chance, and they’ll feel the full force of the law.”"
VXWIFAPP0U_D5I4KG0KBE8FT9D,Post Office investigator claims Horizon IT victim who died a 'broken man' was guilty,Sophie HuskissonPolitical Correspondent,"16:04, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/post-office-investigator-claims-horizon-31955509,"A Post Office investigator has insisted a subpostmaster was guilty of embezzlement despite his wrongful conviction being overturned by a court.
Raymond Grant said he still believes William Quarm stole cash from his branch in North Uist, Scotland, in an extraordinary claim to the Post Office Inquiry. But he failed to give proper evidence to the probe for his reasons - and was accused of being too busy with ""dog walks and carols"".
Mr Grant had to be hauled before the Inquiry on Wednesday to give evidence as he claimed his ""time was limited"" as he wanted to focus on his current job at the Salvation Army. He had submitted a ""minimum"" witness statement that was just over two pages.
He was grilled over the prosecution of William Quarm, who was convicted in 2010 and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Mr Quarm died two years later aged 69, not knowing that he would eventually be cleared. His conviction was finally quashed in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh last year.
Mr Quarm's wife Anne, 72, said her husband died a “broken man” when he was convicted of embezzling thousands of pounds from his Post Office in North Uist. ""My husband pleaded guilty because he was told he was going to jail if he didn’t. He was a broken man and very upset and not well, as it later turned out,"" she told the Daily Record.
“I promised him I would try my very best to clear his name and asked for him to forgive anyone who had done him wrong and to go in peace. He agreed to do that and that was a blessing.”
Asked by Counsel to the Inquiry Jason Beer KC whether he still thought Mr Quarm was guilty of embezzlement, Mr Grant said: ""In my mind, I still think Mr Quarm had a role to play in the loss of the money."" Pressed on whether he thinks he was ""guilty of the crime"", he replied: ""Yes I do.""
But Mr Grant denied that was his reason for not regarding the inquiry as a priority. Challenged about the shortness of his witness statement, Mr Grant said he his ""time was limited"" as he defended not prioritising the inquiry.
""My current role is I work in a homeless centre for a Christian organisation - it has 30 residents in it,"" he said. ""I am the programme manager... Part of the role is to ensure that at that time of the year, December in a Christian calendar, there are a lot of activities going on.""
""We were, at that point, five members of staff short. I was working somewhere in the region of 10 to 11-hour days - I was going home, walking my dog and at the same time."" He added that he has to house-hunt after being asked to vacate his property by the end of December, as well as ""then having to prepare a detailed statement of my memory from the time of employment, which was 16 years ago, to any involvement in any Post Office investigation"".
He also lamented that ""there was nobody paying me the salary to do the work that we're here talking about today"". Mr Grant only appeared at the inquiry in person ""under the threat of the exercise of compulsory powers"" after being served a section 21 notice.
During the evidence session, Mr Grant was asked about interrogating Mr Quarm after he had experienced minor strokes from the previous year. During one interview in 2008, the Inquiry heard that Mr Grant's evidence suggested that Mr Quarm was ""dazed and not understanding the questions put to him"". He then took his daily medication and confirmed he was fit to continue.
Mr Beer read out part of his statement where it says Mr Grant later suspended the interview ""due to the health condition of Mr Quarm and the inability to contact anyone in authority because of the remote location of the branch"".
At the end of his evidence, Mr Grant appeared to become emotional as he said for his ""part"" in the scandal, he was ""humbly sorry"". In a personal statement, he said: ""The Post Office let postmasters down, they let the staff who they employed down by being less than open and honest with information that should have been shared, wasn't shared and the ultimate result has led to significant upset and significant difficulties for people who were left behind.
""They deceived me and they deceived an awful lot more people. For my part in it, I'm humbly sorry. I just hope people do learn from this.""
More than 700 branch managers were prosecuted by the Post Office after Fujitsu's faulty accounting software, Horizon, made it look as though money was missing from their shops. The saga prompted an outcry across the country after it was dramatised in the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office earlier this month.

The brave man, from Switzerland, was helping at the sanctuary in Mueang Ngai, Thailand, when he went to feed the Asian black bear. But as the 32-year-old put food on the tray, the animal launched the frightening attack on Thursday. The bear sank its teeth into his arm and refused to release the limb from its grip, so the volunteer got out his pocket knife and cut his limb below the elbow.
He was immediately administered first aid by shocked bystanders before he was rushed to hospital closeby in Chiang Dao. He was later transferred to a private facility in Chiang Mai. According to local media, the volunteer will have an operation, but it is not clear if surgeons will be able to reattach the crushed limb.
Locals showered him with praise after he decided to sever his arm instead of hurting the animal. One person said: “His heart is truly kind. He was willing to amputate his own arm, but he did not harm the animal.” The bear in question was rescued in 2013 after getting lost outside the forest. It was taken to a national park before being transferred to the wildlife sanctuary. The injured Swiss man’s name is withheld in local reports.
The Asian black bear is a vulnerable species due to shrinking forests, poaching, and other threats. Although usually shy, it is more aggressive towards humans than the Eurasian brown bear or the American black bear. Last month, a zookeeper was recently killed by a hippo after he attempted to clean an enclosure in India. Suraj, 40, of Lucknow Zoo in Uttar Pradesh, stepped into the enclosure and was killed on the spot.
Another employee named Raju was taken to hospital after he became injured as he escaped the cage. Zoo director Aditi Sharma said an investigation would be conducted into the incident. The director confirmed the site was closed to the public at the time and said the animal was locked up after the incident. ""If there is any mistake, it will be rectified. It would be part of the inquiry to find why the animal was not confined in a portion of the cage when the two employees entered,"" they said at the time."

Vile Steven Hicks ""used his position"" to attack the 85-year-old lady while on an unscheduled visit to her home in Berkshire in January 2022. The 60-year-old had told the victim he was coming to check on her mobility at the time after she had suffered from a fall, despite her having cancelled appointments the day before.
Arriving at the woman's door in a surgical mask, apron and thick-rimmed glasses, he told her he was from the Royal Berkshire orthopaedic unit and, whilst in her bedroom, began pressing his face against her intimate area, Reading crown court heard. She then asked him, ""What on earth are you doing?"" and pushed him away, asking to see his ID which he did not provide and left her home.
When the woman called relatives to inform them what had happened, prompting them to tell the police. Body-cam footage from officers who turned up at the woman's home showed her telling them Hicks had apologised, telling her he'd gotten ""carried away"".
She also told officers there had been no discussion of ""anything intimate"" happening. Hicks was identified in September of that year using DNA taken from the victim's leggings and he was arrested by Thames Valley Police shortly after.
Hicks, from Woodley, Berkshire, was charged with sexual assault and found guilty by a jury last week, before being sentenced to four-and-a-half years, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed.
Specialist investigator on the case Philippa Sharman told the court that phone data placed him in the vicinity of the pensioner’s home at the time of the offence. Meanwhile, the victim's detailed account and doorbell camera footage confirmed she had had a visitor on the evening in question.
It was also found that Hicks had used his position to access the woman's medical records while she was receiving home visits, often when he was on annual leave and unauthorised to do so, as well as on the day of the assault. CPS lawyer Shilpa Shah said: “This was a shocking crime carried out by someone in a trusted profession.
“Steven Hicks knew the victim was vulnerable and that no other carers were due to visit her that evening, and he used his position to gain access to her home to assault her, in her own bedroom. Hicks denied the charges against him, but we were able to present evidence to the court clearly linking him to the assault.
“His DNA matched that found on the victim and her clothing, and his phone data placed him near her home at the time of the offence. He will now spend time in prison for his crime.” Speaking from Reading Police Station, Ms Sharman told the PA news agency that officers were “keeping an open mind” as to whether there are more victims of Hicks.
She said: “If any more information comes to light, then that will be for us to look into. This is a serving member of the NHS, they’re a very trusted profession, they have a certain amount of power when they get into people’s homes, into care homes, and people deserve to be safe in their homes.”"

I saw one of them lifting another boy's shirt up to check if he had been hurt.""A parent who was outside the college to collect their son said: ""It was like a free for all brawl in the road. Never seen scenes like it."" Another bystander said: ""I came down here because my granddaughter works at the college, and I wanted to check she was OK.""I've heard three people were carried away on stretchers and there had been stabbings.

On the back of Storm Isha that left five people dead and one seriously injured, another weather system will bring more extreme conditions today and tomorrow which will affect the northern part of the country worse said the Met Office said.
Amber and yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued covering much of the UK, together with yellow warnings for rain covering parts of western and southern Scotland, and north-west England.
A yellow warning for ice has also been issued across northern and eastern parts of Scotland. Gusts of 80mph could be experienced in exposed areas, with 40-50mm of rain possible over higher ground, the forecaster said.
Steve Willington Met Office chief meteorologist said: “Although this system will be a step down relative to Storm Isha, with the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn. Outbreaks of heavy rain on Tuesday could bring rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20mm quite widely with 40 to 50mm over higher ground in southwest Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northwest England.
""Wind gusts are expected to reach 55 to 65mph across northwestern Scotland while there is potential for winds to gust to 75 to 80mph in a few places; in particular, exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal northwest Scotland early on Wednesday morning.”
More than 100 food alerts and warnings have been issued across the UK today. There are 85 flood alerts and 13 flood warnings in place for England. Elsewhere in the country, Scotland has 10 alerts and 15 warnings, while Wales has two alerts. The River Spey in Scotland is expected to be hit badly by flooding, as well as along the Nine Mile River and Bourne Valley in England.
One of Northern Ireland's most popular tourist attractions has been forced to close after Storm Isha caused damage on its roof.
The Titanic museum in Belfast said the decision was made to safeguard the public and staff after Storm Isha, and due to the risks posed by looming Storm Jocelyn.
Stormont's Department for Infrastructure said that workers have been trying to restore electicity supplies damaged by falling trees as around 7,000 Northern Irish homes remain without power.
The Environment Agency has urged hikers to avoid wandering too close to swollen rivers, as the risk of flooding continues to rise in the UK.
Agency workers are ""out on the ground"" in Cumbria to lower the risk of flooding, as Storm Jocelyn edges ever nearer...
#StormJocelyn could bring the risk of flooding in #Cumbria.We are out on the ground, taking action to reduce the risk & impact of flooding and support those communities affected. We advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water. https://t.co/Q3Q7VmWvWS
Road users in the north of the UK are being warned to be careful of heavy rainfall and debris, according to an RAC spokesperson.
Drivers should beware that spray from larger vehicles will have a severe impact on visibility. Pooling of water on tarmac will also increase stopping distances, they added.
""We urge drivers to consider postponing their journeys in these areas if at all possible.
""Those that do need to drive should try to avoid exposed coastal routes where strong winds will make driving much more difficult.""
The high-speed ferry service running between the Isle of Wight and Southampton have been suspended.
Red Funnel, the operator, says it's stopped the Red Jet service for foot passengers due to ""adverse weather"" conditions.
The affected route is the one between West Cowes and Southampton terminal two.
There is a slower Red Funnel ferry carrying passengers and vehicles between East Cowes and Southampton still in operation.
The Met Office has issued yet another Yellow weatherwarning for torrential rain across parts of Wales.
The national forecaster predicts the downpour will take place from 12.30pm today to 7pm.
Warning: Storm Jocelyn is set to bring heavy rain which could result in flooding on roads and in homes and businesses. Bus and train services will probably be affected.
Locations: Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea, Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham

A map of Storm Jocelyn has turned completely red as chilling 80mph winds head to the UK.
Forecasters have claimed the storm could produce gusts of up to 80mph in some places, and is expected to hit later today.
The north west of Scotland will bear the brunt of the storm, which comes in the wake of the last named storm, Isha, which caused severe damage across the country.
Amber and yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued for much of the UK and yellow warnings for rain have also been put in place for parts of western and southern Scotland, and north-west England.
Another new severe weather warning has been issued by the Met Office.
On top of the already large number of warnings in place, a new rain warning for all of Wales was put out this morning.
Kicking in from 12.30pm today and lasting until 7pm, it brings ""a period of heavy rain, associated with storm Jocelyn, could result in the flooding of a few places,"" the forecasters warned.
The country is racing to recover from Storm Isha as Jocelyn powers across the Atlantic.
Whilst Storm Jocelyn isn't due to be as powerful as Storm Isha, due to it coming so soon after, its impacts could be worse. A mixture of flooding, and widespread damage and disruption, all combine to make precarious conditions for the tenth storm of the season.
At the Kinnaird estate in Larbert, workers were trying to remove a tree that had fallen on an electricity substation - indicative of the nation's efforts to repair the damage of one storm, with one around the corner.
Elsewhere, roads and rails were also heavily hit by the first storm.
8am - The low pressure weather front already covers much of Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, and parts of the west of England and Scotland, bringing generally light rain. But downpours are more intense across Northern Ireland and western Scotland.
9am - The rain and showers will continue to spread across the UK, covering much of the country. Only a few pockets around the Midlands, East of England, and a strip of the North East will see drier conditions.
10am - Storm Jocelyn's rain will begin to hit in earnest around midmorning with a huge band of rain bringing much fiercer downpours now. Parts of the east coast of England will remain drier but elsewhere rain will be much harder, pushing 8-16mm/hour in places.
11am - By then almost all of the UK and Ireland will be covered by Storm Jocelyn, with the worst rain across Ireland, Northern Ireland, parts of the North West of England and west of Scotland.
2pm - The picture continues much the same over midday, with slow-moving Jocelyn battering the UK with rain. The areas seeing the worst rain will slowly move eastwards across parts of the north of England and Scotland.
3pm - The rain will begin clearing in places, as the low pressure system begins to move past the east coast of England. By mid this afternoon, parts of Ireland will finally see drier conditions.
5pm - Rain will continue clearing on the whole, but parts of the south of England will see light showers and rain.
8pm - Whilst showers, some heavy, will pass over Scotland, only the South East and East of England will continue to see persistent rain.
Recent days has seen Storm Isha batter the UK with winds of up to 107mph.
Alongside that, it brought over 1.2inches of rain in Resallach, Scottish Highlands, and temperatures fell as low as 1.6C in Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire, but were as unseasonal as 11.6C in Plymouth.
Whilst most Brits struggled under cloudy, grey conditions, Tibenham, Norfolk, enjoyed over six hours of sunshine as well.
Storm Jocelyn is a large low-pressure system sweeping in from the Atlantic.
Bigger than Storm Isha, it has made a path across the Atlantic, preluded by a rash of showers, pushed by the Jet Stream. It will pass over northern Scotland into Tuesday night, bringing its wet and windy weather with it.
Waking up tomorrow, Ireland and Northern Ireland will experience the worst of rain, before it spreads into Wales, and parts of the South West of England. Following that, the rain will track its way eastwards across the entire UK.
There may be some bright starts in the east, but these won't last, giving way to clouds and rain. The heaviest rain will hit over the hill of North West England, Wales and western Scotland.
There may be some drier spells in bits of the south of England, with temperatures remaining quite mild, in the low teens.
Here's a brief summary of the weather warnings covering the country over the next two days:
There are over one hundred flood alerts and warnings issued across Britain today.
The worst of the flooding is in England, which has 85 flood alerts, where flooding is possible, and 13 flood warnings, where it is expected. Scotland has ten alerts and 15 warnings and Wales has only two alerts.
In Scotland, the River Spey especially is hit badly by flooding and in England, flooding along the Nine Mile River and in Bourne Valley will be especially bad too.

Tens of thousands of people across the UK and Ireland have been left without power as back-to-back storms rock the countries.
In Ireland, as of around 9pm last night, around 68,000 ESB Networks customers were without power - whilst a further 167,000 had had it restored. But some will be left without power ""for a number of days"" the network warned.
In Northern Ireland, 13,000 people were without power and in Scotland, somewhere around 3,500 homes had no powers - with over 33,000 having had it restored.
Electricity North West said that this morning 2,000 homes remained without power, as 55,000 had had it restored.
Amid the expected chaos later on today and tomorrow, caused by Storm Jocelyn, one rail company is ""strongly urging"" passengers not to travel between England and Scotland.
From 3pm on Tuesday until noon Wednesday, TransPennine Express (TPE) has said services in and out of Scotland could be hit by ""major disruption"". They said: ""High winds and heavy rainfall are set to cause major disruption to services in and out of Scotland.""
The affected routes are between Glasgow and Preston, and between Edinburgh and both Newcastle and Preston. Services across the rest of the operator’s network are also expected to be affected by the severe weather.
TPE customer experience and operations director Kathryn O’Brien said: “Our number one priority is to keep our customers and colleagues safe, and we will be doing all we can to keep people moving in difficult conditions. We are urging anyone travelling across the affected routes to plan ahead, allow extra time, check their journey up until the last minute and follow the guidance provided.”
Storm Jocelyn could potentially have more impacts than Storm Isha, despite not being as powerful.
This, the Met Office explained, was because the storm is coming so hot on the heels of the previous one. As the country scrambles to clean up and recover from the damage caused by Isha, it will be left more exposed to Storm Jocelyn.
Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Steve Willington, said: “Although this system will be a step down relative to Storm Isha, with the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn.
“Outbreaks of heavy rain on Tuesday could bring rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20 mm quite widely with 40 to 50 mm over higher ground in southwest Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northwest England. Wind gusts are expected to reach 55 to 65 mph across northwestern Scotland while there is potential for winds to gust to 75 to 80 mph in a few places, in particular exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal northwest Scotland early on Wednesday morning.”
Avanti West Coast has called on passengers not to travel north of Preston after 3.30pm today, due to Storm Jocelyn.
The operator warned that last scheduled train from London to Glasgow leaves the capital at 3.30pm, calling at Preston at 5.41pm and is expected to be ""extremely busy"".
The last trains of the day from Glasgow and Edinburgh will depart before 5pm. Services to and from Scotland are expected to be suspended until at least noon on Wednesday with journeys in the north-west of England facing possible speed restrictions too.
Passengers with tickets for travel north of Preston on Tuesday and Wednesday can use them at any time until the end of Thursday. Those who cannot complete their journey due to the disruption can request a full refund from where they bought their ticket.
Storm Jocelyn is going to be the tenth named storm to hit the UK this season.
A storm season runs from September 1 to August 31 of the next year. Already this year we've had nine storms, including Storm Isha, with Jocelyn set to be the tenth.
This will take the country within touching distance of the record, set in 2015/16, when the Met Office reached the K-named storm - Storm Katie.
It leaves the UK months to get two more storms and break the record.
Today, a number of weather warnings are in place, including an amber wind warning for Scotland that is threatening to bring winds of up 80mph.
Alongside that, there is also a number of severe weather warnings for ice, rain and wind.
As the country braces for Storm Jocelyn, a number of schools have been froced to close due to damage caused by Storm Isha.
Winds reached 107mph and brought chaos and disruption across the UK.
But even as the country begins to recover from Isha, Storm Jocelyn is just around the corner. Schools in several UK regions have been forced to shutter, many of them reporting major power cuts, no heating and damage to school buildings.

Further transport disruption is expected on Tuesday after services had largely recovered on Monday.
ScotRail services across Scotland will be suspended from 7pm and there will be no rush-hour services on Wednesday, the railway operator has said.
Martin Thomson, national operations manager for resilience at Transport Scotland, said: “Across the wider network, we can expect to see more delays and cancellations with ferries, flights and rail from Tuesday into Wednesday morning.”
UK wide, Network Rail spokesman said “hundreds of engineers” were deployed with chainsaws and cherry pickers to remove debris from tracks.
Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon says the UK is set for another wet day before windspeeds start to pick up towards the evening.
“Tuesday will be quite a wet day for many people with a rain front bringing the chance of disruption,” he said. “Higher windspeeds will start to develop overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.
“Windspeeds from Storm Jocelyn will be a slight notch down from Storm Isha, but with the clean up still underway, more disruption is likely.” Temperatures are expected to remain mild during the day"
W91I5OOZYS_V4GS8GY66C4Z53E,Ozzy Osbourne's angry children hunted down famous dad after hairdresser cheating scandal,Sam Elliott-GibbsReporter,"17:07, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ozzy-osbournes-angry-children-hunted-31949737,"Ozzy Osbourne's children tried to ""talk some sense"" in their father when they learned of his four-year affair with a hairdresser after hunting him down when he vanished.
The cheating scandal rocked the family as the music legend's wife Sharon admitted taking an overdose and locking herself in the bathroom on hearing of the 2012 to 2016 fling with stylist Michelle Pugh. The couple were seen as one of the strongest in showbiz before the bombshell more than ten years ago.
Ozzy and Sharon did separate in 2016, but rumours of a divorce never played out as they eventually worked through their issues. Their kids Kelly, Jack and Aimee were all devastated when the truth came out but their dad went into hiding after the affair was made public.
Desperate to speak to him, Jack tried to track the former Black Sabbath star down as their mother was left in a very dark place. Sources at the time said Sharon kicked him out and this week she opened up about the aftermath saying she considered ending it all following her husband's betrayal.
“Jack tried to get hold of Ozzy because he thinks he might talk some sense into him, he and his sisters Kelly and Aimee are worried about him and a bit shocked by what has gone on,"" a source told The Sun at the time. “But Sharon is in an unforgiving mood and does not want him in the house - has got a fiery temper but after a row they often kiss and make up. It is a bit different this time though and she is extremely angry with Ozzy.”
Speaking on stage with friend Jane Moore at a London theatre show on Sunday night, Sharon said: “He always, always had groupies and I was so used to that. “But when he knows the name of the person, where they live and where they work... it is a whole different thing as you are emotionally invested.
""I took, I don’t know how many pills,"" the former X Factor judge, who married the rocker in 1982, explained. “I just thought ‘My kids are older, they are fine and can take care of themselves’. So I took an overdose and locked myself in the bedroom. The maid tried to come in to clean room and saw me.”
Ozzy spoke about their problems back in 2018. He said: It’s a rock & roll thing – you rock and you roll. You take the good with the bad. When I was a crazy f*****, I’m lucky she didn’t walk out I upset my wife and I upset my family and I made a lot of shock and shame. I love my wife, and it made me realize what a f***ing idiot I’ve been.”
Asked what kept them together, he told Rolling stone magazine: “I suppose it’s fair to say we love each other. I love her, and she loves me. She was brought up in a music industry, so she’s not like a schoolteacher who married a rock star. But that’s a very good question.""

WFBDKP0MPT_LI11VPL9QP875RT,DWP explains full list of 16 questions that appear on 'light touch' PIP review,Linda HowardMoney and Consumer Writer,"14:17, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/dwp-explains-full-list-16-31966350,"The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) recently introduced a new “light touch” review for some Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claimants.
PIP is designed to help working age adults living with an illness, disability or mental health condition. Those with shorter-term PIP awards typically have to fill out a 16-page form - but if you are moved to a “light touch” review then you will have to fill out a shorter six page form.
This normally applies to claimants whose condition is severe and unlikely to change, and your PIP will only be reviewed every ten years. The DWP has published a sample copy of the shorter “PIP AR2” six-page form on GOV.UK.
While this is only designed to be used in reference, it could help you understand what questions you will need to fill out. DWP guidance states that you will continue to get PIP while your claim is being reviewed.
The six-page review form covers:
Identity and contact details
Immigration status
Your main healthcare professional
Details of any changes to your health condition or disability
Details of any changes to your daily living needs
Details of any changes to your mobility needs
Your consent to allow the DWP to collect further information
Here are all 16 questions on the PIP AR2 form.
Q1 - Your name
Q2 - Your date of birth
Q3 - Your address
Q4 - Is this a hospital, hospice or other residential or nursing care accommodation?
Q5 - Your correspondence address
Q6 - A phone number DWP can contact you on
Q7 - Have there been any changes to your immigration status? - additional space is provided to write an answer
Q8 - Tell DWP anything they need to know about how they communicate with you - additional space is provided to write an answer
The form explains that this may be your GP, hospital consultant or a specialist nurse and asks you to provide their details.
Q9 - What is their name?
Q10 - What is their job?
Q11 - What is their phone number?
Q12 - What is the address where they work?
Questions 13, 14 and 15 are given the most amount of space on the form to write additional information. It also reminds people: “PIP is assessed on how your condition affects you, not the condition itself.”
Q13 - Have there been any changes in your health condition or disability since DWP last awarded you PIP?
Q14 - Have your daily living needs changed since DWP last made a decision on your PIP?
The form states: “By daily living we mean preparing food and cooking, eating and drinking, managing treatments and taking medication, washing and bathing, managing toilet needs, dressing and undressing, communicating, reading, mixing with other people and managing money.”
Q15 - Have your mobility needs changed since DWP last made a decision on your PIP?
The form states: “By mobility we mean getting around and planning and following a journey.”
Q16 - Do you give consent for your doctor or other relevant professionals to give DWP more information about your health condition or disability?
The final question also provides guidance on giving DWP consent to obtain further information on how your health condition affects you.
The form explains: “The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or approved healthcare professionals that work for DWP, might need more information about your health condition or disability and how it affects you.

The show, made up of six hour-long episodes, is produced by Eric Newman and Andrés Baiz, the creators of the popular crime series Narcos and Narcos: Mexico. Protagonist Vergara, who is renowned for her roles in Modern Family and America's Got Talent, is also executive producer of the series.
Newman described Sofia as ""a force of nature"" and said she was perfect for the role as just like Griselda, she is ""a single mother who came to America from Colombia with nothing and built an empire."" Here, we take a look at the real people behind Griselda - and the actors playing them.

Actress: Sofía Vergara
Griselda was born in Santa Marta, Colombia, and was said to pickpocket from a young age as growing up in poverty forced her into a life of crime. It has been reported she even helped kidnap a boy when she was just 11 years old. It is believed she also went into prostitution to make money.
She then went on to marry a small-time criminal when she was still a teenager and was said to have ordered his murder following their split. She found love again with drug trafficker Alberto Bravo, who introduced her to the cocaine industry, which saw her become a major trafficker.
Griselda, who amassed a vast empire with a net worth of billions, was prominent in the cocaine drug trade and was a central figure in the Miami drug wars during the 1970s and 80s. She was branded ""La Jefa"" (The Boss) and the ""Godmother of Cocaine"".
She displayed a brazen ruthlessness with the aim of eliminating her competition - and this plunged Miami into a period of violence that became known as the Cocaine Cowboy Wars. She was accused of committing numerous murders, many carried out by gunmen on motorcycles, a practice she was said to have invented.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
It has been claimed that she smuggled more than three tons of cocaine into the US annually, netting around $80million (£63million) per month. She enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes and hedonistic parties.
In 1984, she moved to California but the following year she was arrested and taken to New York to face the 1975 drug charges. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison but she reportedly continued to run her empire while behind bars. She was released and deported to Colombia in 2004 but in 2012 she was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle as she left a butcher shop in Medellín.
Griselda had four children, but three of them - Osvaldo, Dixon and Uber – were murdered. In 2020, Griselda's only surviving son Michael Corleone Blanco spoke to the Sunday Mirror about his upbringing as the son of such a notorious crime boss.
He said: ""My mother was no saint. She had to survive to do her thing. But at the end of the day, she was my mother. I will forever honour and respect her. I love her."" Michael now lives the life of a ""suburban dad"" in Miami with two teenage sons and a daughter. But from the day he was born, he was linked with crime.
Griselda gave him the middle name Corleone after the Mafia family in the Godfather movies. He said: ""I never actually had a childhood."" As a boy, he survived seven assassination attempts, including one when his drug trafficker father Darío Sepúlveda, Griselda's third husband, died in his arms after their car was ambushed. In a fractured life split between Medellin, Florida and California, he had armed guards night and day as his mother made ran her empire.
In the new series, Sofía Vergara plays Griselda Blanco, looking practically unrecognisable thanks to the wigs and make-up she wore during filming. She recently revealed that to play the role, she had to be taught how to inhale fake cocaine and smoke a cigarette.
""The cocaine that I did was fake. But I had to pretend. The cigarettes are also fake. Everything was, it's fake,"" she said during an interview with Jimmy Fallon.
Actor: Alberto Guerra
Darío Sepúlveda was Griselda's third husband and father of her youngest son, Michael Corleone Sepulveda. The couple met when drug trafficker and assassin Sepúlveda was sent to Miami to kill Griselda - but they fell in love and got together instead. They reportedly married in 1978 and had their son the same year.
Their marriage was far from perfect as Blanco was constantly suffering from drug-induced paranoia. She was also reportedly very jealous, to the point that she once ordered the killing of eight strippers as she thought they might have had sex with her husband.
In 1983, Sepúlveda took their son and returned to Colombia. He was later killed by men dressed as police officers in Medellín with his son next to him. Cuban actor Alberto Guerra, 42, known for his appearances in Spanish-language melodramas and crime series, plays Sepúlveda.
Actor: Christian Tappan
Arturo Mesa was Griselda and her second husband Alberto's accountant in Medellín. According to the show's notes, he convinced her to bring her business to fruition and even travelled to Miami to help the drug trafficker source product and make ""important connections with key players"".
Christian Tappan, known for appearing in Pablo Escobar, The Drug Lord and telenovelas La fiscal de hierro and La Reina del Sur, stars in the series as Mesa. He also appeared in US crime drama Snowfall.
Actor: Martín Rodríguez
When he first met Griselda, Rivi Ayala was the lieutenant for one of her rivals but decided to start working for her as he became impressed by her tactics, eventually becoming her right-hand man. Martín Rodríguez, known forUruguayan-Argentine drama Zanahoria (Detrás de la verdad) and Uruguayan film El cuarto de Leo, plays Ayala in Griselda.
Actress: Juliana Aidén Martinez
June Hawkins, played by Juliana Aidén Martinez, was a Miami police department analyst, who, thanks to her Spanish language skills, investigated Griselda. According to reports, the real-life police officer served as a consultant on the Netflix series.
Actress: Vanessa Ferlito
Carmen Gutiérrez, played by Spider-Man 2 and Graceland actress Vanessa Ferlito, worked with Griselda and her husband's New York operation. She runs her own travel agent and, despite letting Griselda stay with her when she arrives in Miami, she appears reluctant to be close to her friend as she finds out she is still involved in the drug trade.
Actor: Fredy Yate
Chucho Castro, played by Colombian actor Fredy Yate, initially picked up a one-time job for Griselda, but eventually ended up working for her for years. An incident depicted in the series is the killing of his two-year-old son Johnny who was shot twice in the head as he rode in a car with his father. Griselda had sent Ayala to killed Chucho - and details of the shooting were revealed by the hitman who later testified against the drug lord.
Ayala said Blanco wanted Castro killed because he kicked her son in the buttocks. He told police: ""At first she was real mad ‘cause we missed the father. But when she heard we had gotten the son by accident, she said she was glad, that they were even.""
Actress: Carolina Giraldo Navarro, known as Karol G
Another character you will come across in Griselda is Carla, one of the drug trafficker's friends and confidants. The Colombian woman, from Medellín, used to travel to Miami with other sex workers to transport product.
She was close to Griselda in Colombia and remained close with her in Florida. Colombian singer, songwriter and actress Carolina Giraldo Navarro, known as Karol G, plays Carla in the series."
WO9C4UJ86S_BCCC0TCAP952YEV,Donald Trump wins New Hampshire Republican Primary - five bombshell moments that rocked result night,Charlie JonesNews Reporter,"09:08, 24 Jan 2024Updated10:51, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-wins-new-hampshire-31953201,"Donald Trump has scooped a win in the New Hampshire Republican primary, setting the stage for a potential rematch with Democrat Joe Biden.
His main competitor, Nikki Haley, came in second with 43.1% of the votes compared to Trump's 54.6%. Joe Biden won on the Democratic side as a write-in candidate, despite not being on the ballot.
This was a night full of drama, marking the first time a presidential candidate has won the first two contests on the primary nomination calendar and failed to become the party's general election nominee. Here are five key moments from the night.
Trump is now expected to clinch the Republican nomination, grabbing the 22 delegates available from New Hampshire. Usually, the winner of both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire Primary is always able to get the nomination.
READ MORE: New Hampshire Primary results: Donald Trump secures victory in tight race with Haley
Despite some thinking Trump would easily beat Haley, the result was much closer than anticipated.
Haley secured 43.1% of the votes to Trump's 54.6%. The tight race triggered a bitter outburst from the ex-President. Unlike his unity call during his election night speech in Iowa, Trump expressed his anger that Haley is not stepping down after coming second.
""This is not your typical victory speech, but let's not have someone take a victory when she had a very bad night,"" Trump said, grumbling about Haley's third-place finish in Iowa and her continued presence in the race. ""I don't get too angry. I get even,"" he told a crowd of supporters in a packed hotel ballroom.
Trump criticised Haley, saying: ""You can't let people get away with (expletive),"" after she didn't drop out of the race post his New Hampshire GOP primary win. On her part, Haley was gracious in defeat. At her election night party, she expressed gratitude to New Hampshire ""for the love, the kindness, the support and a great night.""
Haley also congratulated Trump on his victory, stating, ""He earned that, and I want to acknowledge that."" However, she insisted that the GOP race ""is far from over."" She pledged to continue her ""scrappy"" campaign in her home state of South Carolina, which will hold its GOP primary next month.
Both Trump and Haley were accused of breaking the law by electioneering at polling stations during the New Hampshire primary. This claim was confirmed by a political expert and caused outrage among voters on social media. The Republican presidential front-runner was accompanied by Majorie Taylor Green, Republican representative of Georgia. Users on X, formerly Twitter, claimed Trump was violating voting laws, specifically the act of electioneering.
The law says that anyone running for office, and their teams, can't hand out campaign material or canvas voters close to voting places. It's to keep voters safe and make sure nothing unfair happens near the polling station doors.
Inderjeet Parmar, a big politics professor at City, University of London, told The Mirror: ""That's so blatant and Haley doing it too. They say a fish rots from the head down - that's the GOP.""
The ex-president was caught on camera shouting ""don't waste your time. Get in and vote"" to his fans. He got a massive welcome when he showed up, with one person even skipping work to see him.
President Joe Biden scooped up New Hampshire's Democratic primary without even being on the ballot.
He didn't go to the state or put his name forward because New Hampshire went against new rules and had its primary before South Carolina did.
Biden said thanks to everyone who wrote his name down in the Democratic primary. He also reached out to people who don't like Trump, including independents and Republicans, asking them to back him.
Biden warned the nation, saying: ""My message to the country is the stakes could not be higher. Our Democracy. Our personal freedoms - from the right to choose to the right to vote. Our economy - which has seen the strongest recovery in the world since COVID. All are at stake.""
A row also has erupted within the Republican Party. New Hampshire's governor, Chris Sununu, and former President Donald Trump have been trading insults during the state's primary elections.
Sununu has thrown his weight behind Nikki Haley, the ex-governor of South Carolina and Trump's former UN Ambassador. But Trump used his social media platform, Truth Social, to criticise Sununu and his support for Haley. He also had a pop at Fox News - a network he was unofficially banned from after the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot.
However, Fox News has recently started covering Trump again, even hosting one of his town halls during a Republican Presidential debate. This seems to have led Trump to believe that the network is backing him as he campaigns against other candidates.
""Why does Fox keep putting New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu on??? Every time I mention his name at a Rally, they BOOO like crazy. He's all jacked up on something, but he ran for President, without having the courage to announce, and did really poorly. To have this loser on so much is really bad TV,"" Trump blasted on Truth Social about Sununu.
Sununu didn't hold back in his response, firing back on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""I suppose it's tough keeping up with the conversation given your advanced age. Maybe try subtitles next time. Thanks for watching.""
Melania and Ivanka appeared to be missing from Donald Trump's victory celebrations days after the couple were spotted travelling in separate cars.
Despite Trump's triumph, both Melania Trump and daughter Ivanka were noticeably absent from the festivities. The former President and Melania, who tied the knot on January 22, 2005, marked their 19th wedding anniversary on Monday, with neither of them publicly acknowledging the milestone.
After Melania's dear mum, Amalija Knavs, passed away, the former First Lady and her husband, the ex-President, were spotted taking separate cars. They looked quite apart even though they were together at the service. A clip online shows Melania hopping into a black SUV with her security, while Donald stands by before he heads to another vehicle. People on the internet are whispering that this might mean trouble between them. One person pointed out on Twitter, ""Separate cars,"" and some others said, ""Separate lives.""

WP18XR3EJX_W6JSX5SEOXI1IFX,NHS hospital suspends more than 30 staff after 'falsifying records and harming patients',Zahra KhaliqNews Reporter,"11:26, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nhs-hospital-suspends-more-30-31953084,"More than 30 NHS workers have been suspended from a healthcare trust - while it investigates allegations of falsifying records and mistreating patients.
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust treats more than two million patients a year from a number of care units, including Highbury Hospital, where Nottingham killer Valdo Calocane was admitted to in-patient psychiatric services and discharged multiple times before stabbing three people to death.
The 32-year-old, who killed students Barnaby Webber, 19, and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, had previously been detained in hospital four times under mental health laws.
Prosecutor Karim Khalil KC told Nottingham Crown Court on Tuesday: ""The theme of [Calocane] being prescribed medication but declining to take it is a constantly recurring one.""
On May 23 2020, Calocane attended hospital believing he was having a heart attack, but was arrested after causing damage to a door when he returned to his flat. He was detained under the Mental Health Act and re-admitted to in-patient psychiatric services at Highbury Hospital, before being discharged on June 17 into the care of the Nottingham City Crisis Team.
Calocane was advised to take medication for a minimum of six to nine months, but had stopped taking it and was readmitted to hospital in July 2020 after attempting to force his way into a flat. Calocane was again admitted at the end of January 2022 and discharged on February 24.
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust confirmed that more than 30 of its staff members were suspended across the organisation. The names of the hospitals where staff work, as well details surrounding the case of suspensions has not yet been released.
The organisation, which employs more than 10,000 people, provides a range of services, including mental health services, community health, intellectual disability, and forensic and offender healthcare services throughout Nottinghamshire and the surrounding areas. It is one of the largest mental health and community trusts based in the East Midlands.
A spokesperson for the Trust said: “Nottinghamshire Healthcare is committed to ensuring we provide the very best and safest care we possibly can for our patients. We take any allegations against members of staff very seriously.
""Where there is an allegation that staff conduct has fallen below what we would expect for our patients, we will investigate fully and fairly and sometimes it is necessary to suspend staff members to enable this. Unfortunately, over recent weeks it has been necessary to suspend over 30 colleagues across the organisation whilst investigations take place.
“We are grateful to colleagues who have stepped in to support services at this time and know that the vast majority of the over 10,000 members of staff at the Trust demonstrate the compassion, kindness and genuine care we value and expect. As investigations into these allegations are ongoing we are unable to comment further.”"

Consumers have been visiting the mall, known as the Twin Pines Mall from the 1985 film, less frequently, seemingly due to the recent closings of several popular franchises and family-owned businesses. Locals recalled how busy the mall used to be years prior as before all the closures.
Now, stores permanently marked ""closed"" outweigh other businesses that are still running. ""It's sad seeing a lot of stores closing,"" shopper Isaias Zambrano said. ""We probably went to like three stores and we're heading out already.""

The recent holiday season made that fact much more apparent. A comparison of other malls around the country, which were understandably packed as consumers snagged their last-minute holiday gifts, revealed that Puente Hills had lost its spark. Footage shows a very festive, but empty, mall that barely even looks open to the public.
One shopper, Esther Garibay, said Puente Hills used to ""be hoppin."" She reminisced the old times when scores of children lined up to sit on Santa's lap. A man hired to play Santa this year even cited the lackluster turnout, saying he used to hear laughter echo throughout Puente Hills but now ""it's silent.""
A mall employee said business has been incredibly slow with Puente Hills attracting about six kids who want to see the big guy. Once the holidays edged closer, she said more families began visiting the mall. Some customers, like Esther, speculated that online shopping had eroded interest in visiting Puente Hills.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to   The Mirror US   .
""As life goes on, we get busier and there's no more time to be spent for running to the stores,"" she said. One former Puente Hills enthusiast, named The Layman Collector on YouTube, said he was disappointed to learn of the mall's fate. He shares that as a child he'd frequent Puente's Kmart, which had fun activities and delicious food.
While still in business, the Kmart now mirrors the vibe of Puente Hills itself: deserted. ""In 2021 I went to a Kmart that I used to frequent as a child over 35 years ago,"" they said. ""There used to be an arcade there and a pizzeria, and it was very busy and fun in the late 80s. When I went everything was shut down. The Kmart was open but it was completely deserted and looked barren. It was so sad to see - a clear reminder to people in mid-life now that some places they remember from childhood completely fade away."""
WRMV9Q0N6G_ZXNR3DLMM0G3UWD,Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd walks free from jail after serving just half his sentence,Dan WarburtonSenior News Reporter,"11:57, 24 Jan 2024Updated19:14, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-speedboat-killer-jack-shepherd-31944872,"Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd has walked free from jail after serving just half a six-year sentence for killing his Tinder date, the Mirror can reveal.
Shepherd, 36, left his cell in Cat B HMP Dovegate, Staffs., despite pleas from victim Charlotte Brown’s father for his release to be blocked. He was ghosted out of the 1,150-capacity privately-run jail yesterday , with sources claiming he left in the back seat of a silver estate car just after 5pm.
The “evil” killer claimed Charlotte, 24, was partly to blame for her death after his vessel capsized on the Thames in 2015. He had taken her on the champagne-fuelled trip after their first date. Despite fleeing to Georgia before his trial, Shepherd was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and jailed for six years.
He spent 10 months as a fugitive - enjoying ski trips and striking up a romance with a TV broadcaster - before returning to the UK where he was sent to prison. A source said: “Charlotte’s family are devastated. They believe he should have been convicted of murder.”
Speaking exclusively to the Mirror last month, Charlotte’s father, Graham, said: “Jack Shepherd should not be released until he tells us the truth.""
Graham, who works for the prison service, added: ""The only one who knows what really happened is Shepherd. We want to know what happened. But evil men like this who do these sorts of things never admit or tell anyone how it happened. He shouldn't be released until he tells us what he did.""
Business consultant Charlotte drowned on her first date with Shepherd when he invited her on to the clapped-out speedboat he had bought on Gumtree. The 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte GTO, which was riddled with defects, hit a log and capsized, throwing them into the river near Wandsworth Bridge.
Shepherd was charged with manslaughter but fled to Georgia, where he lived in a tatty Soviet-era flat on the outskirts of capital Tbilisi. He surrendered in January 2019 after an international manhunt and was deported back to the UK in April.
In his absence, Shepherd, 35, from Exeter, was given a six-year determinate prison sentence after being convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was also handed a further four years after admitting hitting a barman over the head with a vodka bottle in a hotel in Devon. But his fixed term means he was allowed to go free this week - just halfway through his sentence.
Graham says it is a bitter blow and branded Shepherd a ""misogynist"" who still posed a danger to women. The Ministry of Justice said they do not comment on individual cases.
Mr Brown, who describes Charlotte as 'Mrs Sensible' says there is no way she would have driven the boat at high-speed. ""I believe she thought it was going to be a toddle up the Thames. I'm sure she had no idea he was going to put his foot down,"" he added.
During Shepherd's trial in July 2018, the jury heard how he had purchased the second-hand 1980s boat in a bid to impress women. Mr Brown said it was his 'dangerous party trick' and an accident waiting to happen. The father continued: ""Sometimes people say to me, ‘It was just an accident’
.
""Let’s be clear, Jack Shepherd’s routine, his modus operandi, was to go on a dating site, take them to the Shard and then on his speedboat. He did this with multiple women, he’d just move on to the next woman. The speedboat that he bought on Gumtree would never have passed a speedboat MOT, if they existed."
WTCYMN0UVX_9YVDCWWA6S4DPK3,King's Guards should ditch wearing bear fur - poll results,Paul SpeedOnline Reporter,"12:31, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/kings-guards-should-ditch-wearing-31945664,"""There’s absolutely no need for animals to lose their lives for a monarch's vanity"" said one Mirror reader, after we asked should the King's Guards ditch wearing bear fur?
Hundreds of you voted, with 644 saying yes it should be ditched and 349 saying no it shouldn't. Real fur in the bearkskin caps worn by the King's Guards - and various members of the Royal Family at parades - has been used for the past 200 years, but many want to put a stop to it.
'Tradition is never an excuse for cruelty', says actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry, who backs a campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) calling for fake fur to be used instead of real bear fur. The comedian, who says it takes at least one bear for each cap, says it's time to 'stop using the fur of slaughtered wildlife'.
A PETA supporter made an undercover video - narrated by Mr Fry - which purports to show hunters baiting the bears with strongly-scented food, before shooting them with a crossbow. Mr Fry says the animals may not die immediately but later succumb to infected wounds or blood loss. The bears are later disembowelled and it's claimed body parts are used for trophies and their fur sold.
""By continuing to purchase caps made of black bear fur, the UK government drives demand for pelts and effectively incentivises hunters,"" says Mr Fry. But a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman told the BBC its pelts are sourced from authorised hunts and a regulated Canadian fur market: ""To date and to the department's knowledge, an alternative has yet to meet the standards required to provide an effective replacement for the bearskin ceremonial caps.""
The historic black hats, designed to make the soldiers appear taller and more intimidating, are sported by all five regiments - the Grenadier, Welsh, Irish, Scots and Coldstream Guards - who protect Buckingham Palace and other royal sites. King Charles, and other members of the Royal Family, also traditionally wear bearskins at parades such as Trooping the Colour.
Many of you commented on our original story, here's just a selection of what some of you had to say:
Jimmyv: ""Tradition is wonderful when the tradition is noble and unifying - but not when it’s standing in the way of technology and progress, and not when it’s a cruel affront to decency. Save the bears! Use faux fur hats. This is a no-brainer!""
Rw51: ""(my vote in the poll is) definitely a YES from me. Shame on others who voted no.""
Iceladyk: ""There’s absolutely no need for animals to lose their lives for a monarch's vanity. If Charles is the environmentalist he claims to be why hasn’t he put a stop to this? After all he banned foie gras quickly enough!""
Briggs: ""There is no substitute for natural bearskins, man-made fabrics have been tried and they are useless, they make the guardsmen hot and sweaty. A lot of the real bearskin helmets are recycled, cleaned and given to other guardsmen. Bears die naturally in the wild then if the skins are suitable they are used and made into the helmets. Plus the bears are culled because there are too many of them and are a nuisance.""
Ddwuk: ""Being a bit naive I thought synthetic fur was already in use, sad to find I am wrong and hope the Army rectifies this.""
LucyPost: ""It's 2024. We have incredible, cruelty-free faux furs that could replace bearskins for these caps. To continue killing these animals and stealing their fur is appalling and unacceptable.""
Pwilly: ""The skins used in the making of military bear skin hats are sourced in Canada, when there's been a cull. The MOD purchase 100 pelts per year or when needed. The fur is not supplied to order. That doesn't mean it's right or proper to wear animal pelts ... but I also think the bear skin should stay. ""
Kurt Wallander: ""The bear skins are not supplied to order, they are supplied by Canada from bears that are part of the annual cull. The skins would otherwise be destroyed. The bears get shot regardless of the skins supplied for the Army."""
WUEOOC0LPV_ODHLO19JP3BUMUW,Mum of Morgan Ribeiro who died after Turkey weight loss surgery calls for change,Matthew YoungNews Reporter,"22:19, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-morgan-ribeiro-who-died-31970738,"The family of Morgan Ribeiro, who died after complications following weight loss surgery in Turkey, are calling for tighter regulation in the industry.
Mum Erin Gibson, 44, wants social media adverts for operations to come with details about the risks involved including deaths and injuries. She is also calling for cosmetic insurance to become compulsory.
Erin said: “I would love for there to be a Morgan’s Law to come from this so it doesn’t happen to anybody else. Cosmetic tourism must stop.”
At least 25 Britons have died after medical tourism trips to Turkey since January 2019, the Foreign Office said. Morgan, 20, died this month, days after a gastric sleeve op in Istanbul. Her flight home had to make an emergency landing in Belgrade when she fell ill. Serbian doctors said her intestine was cut during the surgery in Turkey, which led to an infection.
The Mirror tracked down Dr Serkan Bayil, who performed the op. He denied botching it, saying she suffered an embolism.
Erin and Richard Ribeiro, Morgan’s dad, also called for parental consent for under-25s to go abroad for surgery. Erin, from South London, said: “It needs to be made more difficult to research surgery in Turkey.”
Marc Pacifico, of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said “unscrupulous” surgeons operate in Turkey. He said: “It’s much cheaper there but there’s a reason why.”
He and Turkish counterparts drew up 10 recommendations for those seeking surgery there. Department of Health officials have discussed safety measures with Turkish authorities.
1. Surgeon should be member of Turkish Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons – check online or email tprecd@gmail.com
2. Surgeon should have Turkish board certification. You should be able to see their certificate on request.
3 It is desirable the surgeon belongs to the European Board of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery.
4 Surgeon should have been in practice in plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery for at least five years.
5 Make sure you get an aftercare plan.
6 Know your surgeon’s name and how to contact them if there is a problem.
7 Ask how long your surgeon has been working with their clinic or company. At least three years is recommended.
8 It is compulsory in Turkey to have a comprehensive consent form completed ahead of travel. If this does not happen it should raise concerns.
9 Double-check surgeon’s specialty. In Turkey, some practitioners claim to be plastic surgeons who are not. Others work outside their areas of training.
10 Your surgery should be performed in a fully recognised hospital.

Róis Porter was selected as one of the people to miss out on the flight for Tokyo because British Airways (BA) had oversold it. She had been planning the trip, to meet up with friends who she hadn't seen in years, for some time.
When staff at Heathrow Airport told Róis the news, she feared her once-in-a-lifetime trip would be ""ruined"". BA eventually booked her onto a flight to Hong Kong, with another connecting flight to Tokyo, which extended her travel time and cut into her holiday.
The UK's flagship carrier airline offered Róis a £50 voucher for the inconvenience, the nurse claimed She slammed the ""poor communication"" she experienced ahead of the holiday on September 30, 2023.
Róis said: ""I'd booked everything a year in advance, I'm a nurse so it's quite difficult to get days off. It's even more tricky and expensive to get to Japan. I had been planning to go back before lockdown, which obviously didn't happen. So this trip had been three years in the making.""
The nurse was left at Heathrow all day as she waited for her new flight, EdinburghLive reports. She continued: ""I was basically begging them to let me get on the flight. They were pretty blunt and not very compassionate. I just don't see why they oversell flights... I was meant to arrive at 8am the next day, but instead it was 8pm the following day.
""I wrote all of this down at the airport and submitted a complaint. I was just so confused and stressed, it wasn't clear what was happening on the day or where I was meant to go. It was just a horrible way to start my trip. I thought the whole holiday was ruined.""
British Airways later offered her a £50 voucher with the airline, which Róis feels wasn't adequate. She said: ""I lost a whole day. That was time out of my annual leave, time out of my holiday. I've still not spoken to an actual human, the whole time it's been through a system where I'm basically told there's nothing they can do. I've chased real compensation, heard nothing back. The communication has been poor throughout.""
""I was meeting up with friends who live in China and the delay meant we missed a whole day together, which out of only a week is a lot. I hadn't seen them in years and probably won't get to for a long time.""
British Airways said: ""We’re in contact with the customer to apologise for the inconvenience and resolve the issue."""
X2ZRAIV93L_M3HBELV8KSDAVCU,Holidaymakers hit the Benidorm beaches amid freak winter heatwave of 30C while Brits freeze,Antony Clements-ThrowerNews Reporter,"11:26, 26 Jan 2024Updated11:27, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/holidaymakers-hit-benidorm-beaches-amid-31973501,"Beaches in areas of Spain have been packed out all week after temperatures in the country rocketed to more than 30C.
The conditions in areas including Murcia, Malaga and Valencia have reached temperatures usually seen in the summer months. The mercury usually reaches around half the current heat being experienced by people in the country. Thousands of people are making the most of the heat, caused by an anticyclone in the Mediterranean, and flocking to beaches.
The unseasonal weather certainly sounds more appealing than in the UK, where several storms have battered the nation in the last week, causing at least five deaths, transport nightmares and power cuts. And before that, Britain shivered through sub zero temperatures after just getting over severe flooding.
David Corell, from the University of Valencia, told AFPTV: “There are no studies yet evaluating the long-term trend of this type of event but it is clear we are experiencing this type of abnormal situation more and more frequently.” The unseasonal heat has also crossed into southern France where places such as Marseilles are basking in 20C.
Among those to make the most of the heat in Spain were Brits Graham, 38, and Darren, 48, who regularly travel to the tourist hotspot and say their holiday is cheaper than warming their homes. The pair got return flights for £37.99 each from Newcastle Airport.
As the UK shivered in cold conditions, they enjoyed 24C heat and sunshine. Their accommodation at the Carlos V apartments in Benidorm cost £70.86. Meanwhile, at home Gram says his electric and gas bill costs him £120 per week with another £130 on the food shop.
He said: “I feel not enough is done to help people with the cost of living and people see no way out. In the UK - £250 wouldn't get you much but in Benidorm, that kind of money gets you a lot."" The heatwave in Spain follows much milder weather as a colder Atlantic front brought the mercury down as low as minus 12.
The north and centre of the country was affected by snow with the cold weather front working its way further south towards the beach resorts. The full bulletin issued at the time by the Spanish national weather forecaster warned the ""greatest thicknesses"" of snow was predicted in the Cantabrian Mountains, North Iberian and Western Pyrenees."
X8HYF8Y1ZV_1S0JX21CFPI58LL,'I saw Alabama killer's eyes bulge as he took 22 minutes to die in first nitrogen execution',Jeremiah HasselUS News Reporter,"21:26, 26 Jan 2024Updated22:53, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/i-saw-alabama-killers-eyes-31979473,"Murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith has become the world's first prisoner to be executed using nitrogen gas.
The convicted hitman, who has been on death row since 1989, took 22 minutes to die at a jail in Alabama - in what the state's attorney general described as a ""textbook"" execution. He was originally convicted of a murder-for-hire in 1988, during which he and another man, John Forrest Parker, killed 45-year-old Elizabeth Sennett after they were paid $1,000 each by her husband, Charles Sennett, Sr.
Smith - who survived a botched lethal injection attempt in 2022 - was accompanied to the gas chamber by his spiritual advisor, Reverend Dr Jeff Hood. Rev Hood described how he watched the 58-year-old killer writhe around like a ""fish out of water"" while his eyes bulged.
Here, in the reverend's own words, he tells of his haunting, traumatising experience as he watched Smith die after anointing his head with holy oil.

“I go into the execution chamber, and one of the first things that I realize was what the oxygen meters were saying. The oxygen meters, when I went in for orientation the other day, were at 22%, which makes sense because air is like 78% nitrogen. When I was going into the chamber, it was 25.4%, which means that they were pumping extra oxygen into the chamber — so that was kind of how they managed that.
“I immediately notice that Kenny has on a mask that extended from the top of his forehead to underneath his chin. It looked like a firefighter’s mask, and it was super tight. There were sorts of straps everywhere. It felt like I was looking at Bane from Batman. That’s what it felt like — it was a super gnarly, intense mask. There were strings going from the mask to the gurney.
“There were two corrections officers and a woman by the name of Cynthia Stewart Reilly, who is in charge of male prisons in Alabama. They were all sort of nonchalant-looking when all of this was happening.

""Kenny, of course, gave his last words. I was, the whole time, going back and forth with Kenny. I put my hand over my heart to let him know that I loved him. He was talking to me, letting me know that he loved me. It was really powerful.
""At this point, the curtains were still shut, so the witnesses can't see anything. As the curtains were opened, I was allowed to go up and make the sign of the cross on his leg. I did that, and he, again, repeatedly telling me how much he loved me and how thankful he was that I was there. Obviously, that was incredibly touching to me.
""Then, he looked at the room where his family was. He kept telling them how much he loved them. He gave his last words, and then the execution started.
“When the execution started, based on what the state said, I was expecting him to go unconscious in seconds. Well, as soon as the nitrogen hit, he began to convulse, and he didn’t stop convulsing for minutes. I know that by some accounts, it was two or three minutes.
""We had our own independent journalist in the room, who was a witness. He said the entire procedure lasted 22 minutes. That's Lee Hedgepeth, who spoke at the press conference last night.
“It looked like a fish out of water. He kept heaving back and forth, back and forth. And the mask was tied to the gurney, and so every time he heaved forward, his face was hitting the front of the mask and pressing into the mask.
""His eyes started to bulge. He began to turn colors. He was spitting, and mucus was coming out of his mouth and his face. He kept almost hitting his face on the front of the mask.
""The mucus and saliva was hitting the front of the mask, and it was drizzling down the front of the mask. His whole body was seizing. It was absolutely, positively a horror show.
“It was so intense that the expressions of the corrections officers and Ms. Stewart Reilly dramatically changed from the nonchalant facial expressions that they had to real looks of concern.
“One of the reasons why I feel very comfortable calling Mr. Hamm [Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm] a liar, calling the attorney general [Steve Marshall] a liar, is because they know, based on the reactions in that room, that this was not a success, this was not what they thought it would be, this is not something that happened in seconds. This was something that was torture, cruel and unusual punishment, for minutes and minutes.
""Cynthia Stewart Reilly, she had on women's dress shoes, and she kept on tapping her feet out of nervousness. It was almost as if she was tap dancing in the execution chamber. It was one of the noises that I kept hearing was her tapping her feet.
“It was just an unbelievably intense situation. I was crying my eyeballs out. I had my hand on the space behind me. The longer it went, I kept thinking in my head, ‘How long is this going to last? How long are we going to have to watch this s**t?’
“On a personal level, I felt an unbelievable sense of guilt that there was nothing I could do to stop it. I felt like I needed to tell Kenny that I was sorry that I couldn’t stop it. I think that comes from a couple of spaces, but ... as an activist, I felt guilty that I couldn't stop it beforehand. In the chamber, I felt just completely powerless.
""Witnessing a murder, a horror show like that, it's horrible. The tears were running down my face.
“When it finally became apparent that he at least appeared to be deceased, they were waiting on a flatline from the EKG. My face went from just complete sadness and horror to absolute rage that the state of Alabama thought that it was morally appropriate to suffocate someone to death, to torture someone to death, in that manner.
“The tube that was coming out of the control center was a very thin tube. It actually looks like something that would have come out of plastic plumbing that kind of extends, except it was clear. The more he heaved, and the more he looked like a fish out of water, swinging back and forth, the more I was concerned that that tube was going to bust, or at least break, so there was that concern for my safety.
“I kept on wringing my hands. I couldn’t figure out what to do with my hands. You know when you rub your hands so hard you feel like you’re going to rub your hands off when something horrible is happening like you’re going to lose a finger at any moment? All of this happens, and I am eventually escorted out of the chamber.
""The state of Alabama does not send a doctor into the chamber to declare a time of death in front of the witnesses because they're scared that the doctor will be revealed. In this circumstance, I was taken out of the chamber, and the reason that's so important is nobody knows the exact time of death. We just have to trust the commissioner to come out and say the time of death.
""This is a state that says, 'Trust us,' but they are consistently not being honest and not telling the truth. I think it is very possible — I'm not saying this for certain — I think it is very possible that we could have left that room and Kenny [would] still be alive. We would have never known. We would have no idea.
""All we could tell was it didn't look like he was breathing. It looked like he was unconscious. But there was no way for us to know that because there was no doctor in the space. There was no doctor who came out and declared a time of death.
""Then, what happens is I am escorted down the hallway. On my right, as I was walking down the hallway, I saw the doctor, and he was very shocked and upset that I saw him because he was trying to hide. And the reason he was trying to hide is because he could lose his medical license for participating in that.
""It just shows that there are so many secrets and so many crimes and so many just horrific things that happened last night, and I hope that the state of Alabama is held accountable for the horror that they perpetuated.
“These state officials are obviously chicken hawks. They are all about executions. They’re hawks on executions, making those things happen. But they are too chicken to be present, to take any sort of responsibility, for what’s happening. They’re not in the execution chamber. They are not pushing the mechanisms.
“They’re cowards. They are all about talking about these executions and how they want them to continue and all this kind of fluster, but they are too chicken to participate in them themselves. They sit up in Montgomery, and they talk about how it was successful and this and that, but they're never there.
""They're forcing the corrections officers to do this stuff, and there's no doubt from what I saw last night that it has an unbelievable, detrimental effect on them.
“I was a trauma chaplain for a while, so I’ve seen people [who went through] car accidents and burn victims. I’ve seen, unfortunately, all sorts of horrific things — [including] four executions last year. This is the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen done to a human being, by far.
""This was, again, a fish out of water. It was someone heaving over and over and over again, and in a viewing chamber where there were state officials, corrections officers, people who could have stopped it. And it just kept going. It wouldn't stop.
""To say that this was successful... It's just insane that they keep on saying that. Nobody that saw that would say that was a success, unless you consider a success to just be killing somebody.
""If a success is something that doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment, if a success is something that's moral — if this is a success, then they have a very different understanding of morality, any of these things."""
X9PYABUWJN_V9AHRXFII0MQ95Q,EU's new entry rules for Brits explained - why they could mean 14-hour queues,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"14:26, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/eus-new-entry-rules-brits-31973570,"Tourists heading on holidays in Europe could face waits of 14 hours or more at border controls under a new scheme, MPs have been told.
Holidaymakers determined to leave the UK behind in favour of some continental sun may spend more than half a day queueing to get out when the EU's new Entry-Exit System launches. Already the wait at ports like Dover are considerably longer than pre-Brexit, due to extra passport checks border guards are required to make.
The system is scheduled to come into force in autumn 2024. Passport stamping will end for those from third-countries such as the UK entering member states, while every traveller must be fingerprinted and provide a facial biometric.
The Entry/Exit System will check travellers when they either enter or leave at an external Schengen border – such as flying from the UK to Spain. It will not be used for internal frontiers within the Schengen area, such as moving from France to Italy. That means that had the UK not left the EU, no such checks would have to take place.
It is designed to keep a closer eye on who is entering and exiting the bloc, in order to ensure people do not overstay their welcome. Brits are now limited to 90 days’ stay in any 180 day period within the Schengen area.
Although those found to have stayed too long potentially face being banned from the bloc for a year, the current system is difficult to enforce, based as it is on checking passport stamps. The new process is designed to streamline the act of moving in and out of EU states, but MPs have been told that it will increase friction at UK ports and airports, leading to longer queues.
The Port of Dover and the surrounding area could be hit by major disruption when the EU Entry-Exit System launches unless measures are introduced to prevent delays, Parliament's European Scrutiny Committee heard yesterday.
Ashford Borough Council told the committee that 14-hour queues are a ""reasonable worst case"" scenario if the scheme is implemented as planned in October, likely leading to queues along the A20 and M20, which could block access to staff and tourist traffic at Eurotunnel in Folkestone.
The Port of Dover and surrounding roads have seen multiple episodes of gridlocked traffic over the past few years, with post-Brexit checks adding to waiting times. Tourist organisation Visit Kent voiced concerns that delays caused by the new system could have a knock-on effect on local businesses, which has been the case during previous periods of disruption.
Eurostar said that without upgrades, terminals could see queues of more than an hour at peak times. High Speed 1, which runs UK high-speed rail services, said that the decision not to enable online pre-registration would ""put enormous pressure on infrastructure at St Pancras International"".
Downing Street has downplayed the risks of delays. A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""On some of those scenarios, rightly we're not going to get into hypotheticals about delays.... but there are tried and tested contingency plans in place and a lot of work is managed by the Kent resilience forum so we will make sure we're prepared and our focus remains on ensuring the scheme does not unnecessarily impact local communities or resort in delays for travellers.""
""We are working very closely as you would expect with the French, with all the port authorities to ensure that travellers and passengers do not experience unnecessarily delays, that work continues.""
The Entry-Exit System is different from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which will require Brits to apply for a visa waiver to visit popular destinations like Spain and Italy.
The ETIAS, first approved by the European Commission in 2016, is designed to boost security checks on travellers who don't need visas. An approved ETIAS visa waiver will allow British nationals to visit any of the 27 Schengen countries, and will cost €7 (£6).

X9Q3JMP90J_FFGVQYAN6NQ2JU2,Grenfell Tower survivor who lived in flat where blaze started now 'a ghost of a man',Matthew YoungNews Reporter,"19:41, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grenfell-tower-survivor-who-lived-31950753,"The man who lived in the flat where the Grenfell Tower fire began has told how he has become “a ghost of a man” in the aftermath of the disaster.
A statement by Behailu Kebede was read aloud on Tuesday at the start of Grenfell Testimony Week - an event put together after an agreement was reached last year for a global settlement of compensation claims made by people affected by the 2017 tragedy. A legal hearing in May 2023 was told there had been a settlement of about 900 cases and a global sum of about £150million compensation agreed.
Organisers of the four-day event said it is being held to give the bereaved, survivors and residents an opportunity to “speak directly to representatives from the defendant organisations that many of them hold responsible for the fire”. In a heartbreaking testimony, Behailu described the fear and grief he has lived with for the past six-and-a-half years.
“I cannot be with you, today” said Behailu, who said he came as a refugee to the UK in 1992. “Because though I know, in my head, that the fire was the fault of RBKC (the council), Celotex, the government....in my heart - which is full of fear and grief, it was in my flat, my kitchen, where it started. It’s a deep pain, a shame that I carry.”
Behailu was cleared of any blame by the inquiry into the disaster but he said he had felt unable to attend the community’s silent marches or the inquiry. But he described his “pride” at watching those affected continually fight for justice.
He spoke of the “special place” Grenfell had been for him before the fire but described how he felt he had to “hide away” after what happened because of media attention, and how the ongoing sense of trauma kept him from attending testimony week. He said those responsible had failed to admit any fault in the immediate aftermath, leading to “division and confusion” among victims about where the blame lay.
This could have been avoided, he said, had the “wealthy” and “powerful” organisations been open about their roles in what had happened. “After the fire, I wanted and needed to meet the families of the deceased, but I did not have the courage to do so,” he said. “I just wanted to hide away.”
He described how he told the Grenfell Inquiry in 2018 that he was “not the same man I used to be”. “Nearly six have passed...I cannot really say I’m any better,” he added. “My partner and my children live with a ghost of a man.”
Bereaved dad Marcio Gomes, the father of a baby stillborn following the 2017 blaze, described the life his son could have had, telling the firms: “This is what you have taken away from me.” Opening the testimonies, Marcio spoke of the blissful family life he and his loved ones had been robbed of - as he told “a story” about his son Logan Gomes.
At times tearful and pausing to compose himself, he described his family’s excitement at the arrival of their “prince”, the “magical and mesmerising” cry of a newborn and the milestone first steps that had been missed. His son would by now have celebrated his sixth birthday, he added.
Looking directly at representatives from companies associated with the tower, as well as the council and Government, who sat silently to his right, he said: “This is what Logan’s life would’ve been. “This is what our lives would’ve been like.”
He added: “This is what you have taken away from me.” Mr Gomes and his wife Andreia Perestrelo were expecting their third child on August 21 2017, but Logan was stillborn in hospital following the blaze. The couple lived with their two daughters in the North Kensington tower for 10 years, and all four narrowly escaped the blaze.
Representatives from Celotex, Exova, London Fire Brigade, Kingspan, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), Rydon, and Whirlpool Corporation all accepted invitations to be present at testimony week, alongside representatives from the Home Office and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
Arconic, which supplied the cladding on the outside of the tower, said it has made a “significant financial contribution to fund the organisation” of testimony week but regrets that no representatives could attend. The 24-storey tower had completed a refurbishment, covered in flammable cladding, in 2016.
Councillor Kim Taylor-Smith, the deputy leader of RBKC, caused fury shortly after the fire when claiming in several broadcast interviews he was unaware of Grenfell residents’ repeated concerns about safety, despite being a member of the council’s housing scrutiny committee for a year before the fire.
Taylor-Smith and council leader Elizabeth Campbell, who were both appointed to their roles in the weeks after the disaster, sat side-by-side as they listened to devastating testimony on Tuesday. Organisers stated that testimony week is “completely independent of, and has no impact upon, the ongoing Grenfell Tower Inquiry”.
Inquiry chair Sir Martin Moore-Bick was among those gathered at Church House in Westminster to listen to the testimonies, sitting alongside lead counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett KC. A film of excerpts from the inquiry’s hearings was played at the event, entitled “I don’t recall”.
During the audio various people from RBKC, Rydon, Kingspan, Celotex, Arconic and former Government minister Lord Eric Pickles were heard saying they could not recall when asked questions during the inquiry. A clip of Lord Pickles, who was secretary of state at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) between 2010 and 2015, noting how much of his time the inquiry was taking up was also included.
Other testimonies included from Emma O’Connor, who lived on the 20th floor of the tower and managed to escape with her partner on the night of the fire. Ms O’Connor, who is disabled, said: “I still struggle every day with survivor’s guilt.”
Before the testimonies the names of all those who died in the fire were read aloud, followed by a 72-second silence - one for each life lost."

The boost in sales was particularly good in the company's stores located in UK airports, railway stations, and hospitals. The firm reported an 8% rise in group revenues over a twenty-week period up to January 20 when compared to the same time last year.
Sales from UK travel locations alone rose by 15%, leading to a 13% overall growth in their travel division. ""We continue to see improving passenger numbers across UK air, a strong performance in hospitals, and rail is performing well,"" the retailers said.
However, the company's high-street business saw a 4% sales drop over the twenty weeks. Despite the drop, WH Smith saw a 1% like-for-like growth across its shops, which the company insisted was aligned with their expectations.
Group chief executive Carl Cowling stated: ""The group is trading well and is in its strongest ever position as a global travel retailer. We are confident of another year of significant growth in 2024.""
Mr Cowling singled out the North American sector of the company for its impressive performance and highlighted the group's hope for ""substantial"" growth potential through the opening of new stores in the region. He said: ""We continue to make excellent progress in North America, and I am particularly excited by the substantial growth opportunities that exist in this market.""
""We are on track to open over 50 new stores in North America this financial year. In total, we are on track to open over 110 stores this financial year.""
The company said that this will include 15 new stores across the UK, with plans to open a similar number each year for the foreseeable future.

The former co-stars played siblings Derek ""Del Boy"" Trotter and Rodney Trotter respectively on the BBC show, which ran from 1981 to 2003. David, 83, and Nicholas, 62, have both previously spoken about getting along during its production.
It's however been teased by David that they once pranked their colleagues by pretending to have a ""terrible row"" on set. He said that a producer didn't seem ""much impressed"" following the concern that the co-stars had prompted.
As previously reported, David recalled: ""One day, Nick and I were in our very small caravan on location. We were all fed up because nothing was happening so [we] said 'why don't we stage a huge row and you can storm out and say you're leaving and I can shout at you saying don't you ever come back again'.""
He continued: ""'I never want to work with you'. The whole crew went stiff. Five minutes went by and the producer and director came to see me and they were quaking in their boots. They asked what's going on and I told them to go see Nick. When they got to him, I couldn't contain myself any longer and roared with laughter. They went from white to purple in their faces. I don't think the producer was much impressed.""
David is understood to have previously recalled the prank during an appearance on Aspel & Company in 1989. He teased to host Michael Aspel that colleagues heard their exchange and that people described it as a ""terrible row"".
He added whilst on the ITV talk show that he and Nicholas were encouraged to reconcile. He recalled being told by someone on the production: ""I'm sure we can come to some arrangement - we've already done half the filming"".
They have spoken fondly about working together over the years. David said once in an interview: ""You couldn't have had a better co-partner than Nic. We liked and respected each other so much, we were genuinely good friends.""
Whilst Nicholas told Red Carpet News in 2017: ""We had a very similar work ethic and ethos - that we wanted to do our best as quickly as possible. You didn't have very long to record an episode [...] We didn't have much time to rehearse it so we had to have each other's back.""

XCZBEI2P7S_QQV0EV0D0XBSKEL,Energy bills could fall by hundreds from April as households can 'breathe sigh of relief',Ruby FlanaganMoney Reporter,"12:06, 22 Jan 2024",20240122,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/energy-bills-could-fall-hundreds-31936788,"The Ofgem energy price cap is predicted to fall by £308 a year from April - meaning households could see their monthly bills drop very soon.
According to fresh predictions from consultancy firm Cornwall Insight, annual energy bills could fall by 16% from the current £1,928 to £1,620 in April 2024. This would be the lowest point in a little over two years and is £40 less than its December predictions.
It then expects energy bills to drop even further to £1,497 a year from July 1, compared with a previous forecast of £1,590 a year. The reduction in Ofgem's price cap means that a typical household will see their bills drop by more than £300 a year from spring.
It is important to note that Ofgem's price cap does not cap the energy bill, but caps what can be charged for a unity of energy. According to its predictions, those on the price cap tariff will pay 23.56p per unit of electricity and 5.73p per unit of gas they use from April. This is down from the January level of 28.62p for electricity and 7.42p for gas.
As bills depend on how many units a household uses, those who use less will pay less than £1,620, and those who use more will pay more. According to the energy regulator, the price cap covers around 29million energy customers.
Dr Craig Lowery, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that ""concerns"" over events in the Red Sea - which were thought to lead to energy price spikes - were so far ""proved premature"" and household could ""breathe a sigh of relief'.
He said: ""Healthy energy stocks and a positive supply outlook are keeping the wholesale market stable. If this continues, we could see energy costs hitting their lowest since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“Though recent trends hint at possible stabilisation, a full return to pre-crisis energy bills isn't on the horizon. Shifts in where and how Europe sources its gas and power, alongside continued market jitters over geopolitical events, mean we are likely still facing costs hundreds of pounds above historical averages for a while, potentially the new normal for household energy budgets.""
Even with this positive news, Cornwall Insight said despite the wholesale drop, UK energy prices ""remained vulnerable to global events"".
To stabilise the UK's energy bills, Dr Lowery said the country needed to ""break free"" from the volatility of imported energy prices added: ""To make a real and lasting impact, we need to commit to a sustained transition to homegrown renewable energy sources, reducing our reliance on the volatile international energy market.”
Alongside this, Cornwall Insight highlighted that there are ""ongoing consultations"" on potential changes to Ofgem's price cap, including the standing charge and bad debt collection, which could impact the overall price cap level going forward."

Dr Alexander Kudryavtsev was sacked as head of the Russian Academy of Science's Vavilov Institute of General Genetics. And despite the Russian Education Ministry not giving a reason for his dismissal, but his outlandish views - linked to his religious beliefs - are widely seen as the trigger.
‌At a conference in March the academic argued that the Universe, made by God in the process of creation, fell into “decay” due to the sins of people. ‌In the deep past, people lived to be 900, he said, citing only “evidence” of a graph on the Internet. ‌He claimed sin was the cause of mutations in genetic diseases harming modern man, he told his shocked audience in Minsk.
‌The 60 year old had also claimed children “up to the seventh generation are responsible for the sins of their fathers” and when challenged by the media, he said: “I wanted to emphasise the harmful influence of so-called bad habits - what theologians call sin. They also affect the genome. ‌If a mutation occurs in your body, in your gametes, it will be passed on to your offspring, and nothing can be done about it. ‌The conclusion is simple: if you want to have healthy offspring, don’t develop bad habits, don’t fall into sin.”
‌He was forced to add: “I would like to state that I voiced my personal point of view. ‌It is in no way the position of the Russian Academy of Sciences, nor the position of the Church. ‌All this does not affect the work of the Institute of Genetics in any way.”
In June last year he was removed from his post as chairman of the academy’s Council on Genetics and Selection and ‌he head of the Russian church’s commission on family issues, Fyodor Lukyanov, criticised Kudryavtsev’s dismissal. He had been sacked “for religious beliefs and statements in accordance with these beliefs” and this “violates the ethics of the scientific community”. Mr ‌Lukyanov said: “We have already gone through Soviet times, when genetics was long considered a pseudoscience.”"

Saydi Abu Sheikh, 23, and Zakariya Jeilani Mohamed, 31, were left dead or dying in a bedroom in the savage attack inside the home in Ilford, east London, last October. Saydi had been stabbed 28 times and shot four times while Zakariya was stabbed five times and shot at least seven times. Survivor Khalid Khalid was shot six times. One bullet entered the side of his face, passed through his head and exited beside his mouth, causing damage to parts of the skull, his brain and his teeth.
Two other victims managed to escape during the attack the Met Police said was an ""unspeakable act of extreme violence"". Saydi, who rapped under the name Gidd, and Zakariya, who used the name Shifty, were said to be part of the group known as Drillford. Today their killers were sentenced to a total of 38 years behind bars.
During the trial prosecutor John Price KC told how a resident had called 999 just after midnight after hearing a bang and seeing a car on fire. Police and paramedics found a ""scene of bloody carnage"" when they arrived at the address a few minutes later, Mr Price said.
""In an upstairs room were two young men, both dead or dying. They had each been shot and stabbed many times. A third young man, gravely wounded, had been left for dead. Though he sustained a gunshot wound which had passed through his head, he was to survive. It was later discovered that a fourth man had run from the back of the house when a group of attackers armed with guns had forced their way in.
""A fifth man was even more fortunate. Before the gunmen were able to force their way into the room, he had concealed himself between a bed and the wall. Almost miraculously, his presence there went undetected by the gunmen.""
The attackers were caught on CCTV cameras outside the property, jurors at the Old Bailey heard. They had donned burkas to hide their identities when they set off for the attack from a “mission control” flat a couple of miles away. Another defendant, Zain Mirza, had “procured” the murders in revenge for the killing of his brother in 2019. He was in prison for a drugs offence but set about putting a plan into action after being released while being careful to remain at “arm’s length”, jurors were told.
Prosecutor John Price KC had said: “He [Mirza] was the one who most wanted it done. His motive was revenge.” In November 2019, Mirza’s 19-year-old brother Mohammed Usman Mirza was murdered and one of those convicted over the killing was “closely associated” with Mr Sheikh, jurors were told.
Chibuike Ohanweh, 21, of Romford; Ayaanle Adan, 20, from Barking; Mahad Gouled, 22, from Enfield; and Mirza, 21, of Newham, had denied double murder, two charges of attempted murder and perverting the course of justice. Mirza claimed he was in Manor Park dealing drugs and celebrating a friend’s birthday at the time of the killings while Ohanweh, Adan and Gouled also denied involvement.
A jury deliberated for more than 40 hours to find the four men guilty of all the charges. Today, Judge Mark Lucraft KC sentenced them to life with a minimum term of 38 years. He told them: “I’m entirely satisfied that the events were the culmination of a carefully planned retaliation attack for the killing of Mohammed Usman Mirza. You were each involved in planning and carrying out this horrific attack.”
A fifth defendant, Zakarie Mohamad, 19, of Kensington, had admitted perverting the course of justice by destroying the car. He was cleared of the murder and attempted murder charges. Today he was sentenced to four years in a young offenders institute."

The 16-year-old was stabbed with a hunting knife 28 times in her head, neck, chest and back after being lured to Linear Park, Culcheth, a village near Warrington, on the afternoon of February 11 last year. A boy and a girl were found guilty of the ""frenzied"" murder, at Manchester Crown Court last December.
The pair, identified only as Girl X and Boy Y, aged 16 but 15 at the time, had denied murder and each blamed the other for the killing of the transgender teenager, described as ""horrific"" by detectives.
After the teenage killers were convicted, Brianna’s mother Esther Ghey called for “empathy and compassion” for their families as “they too have lost a child” and “must live the rest of their lives knowing what their child has done”.
And while she continues to have compassion for the parents of the killers, she believes the teenagers who committed the crime were beyond rehabilitation. “They're cowards really and it shows the character of them,” she told Good Morning Britain.
She added: “Maybe if they had admitted it or shown some remorse I would feel some sympathy for them. But the fact that they both pointed the the finger and neither of them admitted anything and there was no emotion there... I don't feel guilty that they've been sent to prison.”
On the impending sentencing of the pair she continued; “As long as possible really. At this moment in time I don't think there's any rehabilitation. So if not forever... I don't know how I would feel further down the line if they did show any change in their behaviour.”
Reflecting on the situation for the killers’ parents, Ms Ghey said it must be difficult for them. “When do we stop blaming the parents? What age do we stop blaming the parents? Nobody wants their child to commit such a crime and nobody plans to bring a child up like that,” she said. “People need to show some empathy and compassion to them as well because they don't need a constant reminder of what their child has done. They know very well what their child has done.”
During the trial the court heard that after arresting the pair, police found the handwritten note in girl X's bedroom and hundreds of messages between the pair, including the plans to kill Brianna and others. Both killers had a fascination for violence, murder and torture the trial heard, with Girl X enjoying watching ""snuff"" and killing videos on the dark web. Girl X also compiled notes on serial killers, including Richard Ramirez, known as the Night Stalker, and the notorious cannibal, Jeffrey Dahmer.
The pair drew up a ""kill list"" of four other children before settling on Brianna as the target, Girl X sharing with Boy Y a handwritten plan of how to carry out the murder. Police discovered a handwritten note detailing a “plan to kill” Brianna in the bedroom of Girl X more than a month after her death - the note is believed to have been sent from Girl X's phone to Boy Y on February 3.
Outside court, Detective Chief Superintendent Mike Evans, head of crime at Cheshire Police, said: ""If you can imagine if you download an iPhone, you get about 11,000 pages. So, trying to go through that it wasn't a case of all sudden, 'Bang. Here's these five text messages'. It was a slow (process), almost a slow reveal. I do accept now, looking at it, you sort of go, 'Wow'. There's not many murders where you get from planning to execution almost documented, word for word."""

The tiny infant was ""less than an hour old"" when she was found in a shopping bag by a dog walker as temperatures plummeted below zero last Thursday night (January 18), investigators confirmed.
The tot was wrapped in a towel inside the bag when the member of the public found her in Beckton at 9pm. They quickly acted to keep the youngster warm and alerted authorities.
The Met Police said the child was unharmed and the person who came across her helped saved her life. Hospital staff named her Elsa.
A force spokesperson confirmed to the Mirror they ""still appealing"" for the mum to come forward. They said: ""Unfortunately, there haven’t been any developments, and we’re still appealing for her to make contact.""
Speaking at a press conference in Newham on Friday (January 19), Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, said the child was not injured in any way and was now being cared for in hospital. He added she had been given the temporary name and was believed to be black or mixed race.
He said police were ""extremely concerned"" for the mum's welfare and said members of the public saved the baby's life after she was found at the junction of Greenway and High Street South. Making an appeal for the mother to come forward, Mr Crick said: “We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.
“Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station. If you are the baby’s mother, please know that your daughter is well. No matter what your circumstances please do seek help.”
At a previous police briefing he said: ""Last night we were called by a member of the public out walking their dog, who had discovered a newborn baby in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, E6. Thinking fast, that person kept the baby girl warm until London Ambulance Service paramedics arrived and checked her over before taking her to hospital. I am delighted to report that she wasn’t injured in any way and is safe and well in the care of hospital staff.
“I am grateful to the members of the public who stayed at the scene to speak with officers and medics – your actions contributed to saving the baby’s life. Our thoughts now turn to the baby mother; we are extremely concerned for her welfare as she will have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.""
Restaurant manager Tania Iurac, 25, who lives nearby, said: “My friend came home from work at around 11pm and she told me a lot of police officers were outside with a dog and the area was closed.
“I was worried. We went outside and asked the police for more information. I saw a white towel on the floor. It was clothing. It did not have blood on it or anything. The baby was not in there. There was… I would say six to eight police officers around. There were a lot of people asking questions. I am just shocked.” She said she did not know the identity of the mother."

David, 83, shot to fame as the iconic Peckham market trader Del Boy and starred alongside Nicholas, who played his hapless younger brother Rodney Trotter, while Lennard Pearce played Grandad and Buster Merryfield was later cast as Uncle Albert. The show ran from 1981 until 2003.
Despite the BBC sitcom's immense success, rumours swirled about the relationships between the cast, with a reported 'divide' between Sir David and Nicholas. In 2022, the Del Boy star revealed that the pair didn't see each other as much as they'd like, admitting: ""He's much more – how can I say? – self-contained, perhaps, than he used to be.
""So, unfortunately, we don’t see each other as much as I would like to. But that’s how things work out sometimes."" Last year, David, who tonight appears on The Repair Shop spinoff, David & Jay's Touring Toolshed, put the record straight about the friendship.
During a documentary about the making of the show, he expressed: ""You couldn’t have had a better co-partner than Nic. We liked and respected each other so much, we were genuinely good friends."" Sir David, who was knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in December 2005 for services to acting and comedy, also became known for his roles in The Darling Buds of May and A Touch of Frost. He also voiced cartoons such as Dangermouse.
Born in Edmonton, North London, in February 1940, his dad was a B­illingsgate market porter and his mum a maid. But while Sir David started out working as an electrician, his love of theatre lured him into acting.
From early on it was clear his talents stood out, and he was quickly snapped up by agents who then encouraged him to move into TV. In the 1980s, he starred alongside Ronnie Barker in classic comedy Open All Hours, when he was offered to read a script for a new series called Only Fools and Horses.
He has said that during their very first read-through, the cast knew immediately ""there was magic in the room"". The show went on to win six BAFTAs, with two going to Sir David for his portrayal of Del Boy, and 18.8 million viewers tuned in to one episode in 1986. That year, the cast appeared at the Royal Variety ­Performance, in front of the Queen Mother.
Sir David went on to spend 15 series playing ­Detective Jack Frost in A Touch of Frost, throughout the 1990s until 2010. He then returned to his role as Granville in 2013, for Still Open All Hours, for another 41 episodes."
XP4NRUPNIB_R34Q5VG1YOWMDXO,Easily missed dementia sign could help people spot disease early - and shouldn't be ignored,Gemma StrongLifestyle Writer,"12:17, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/easily-missed-dementia-sign-could-31946667,"It's a sad fact that one in 11 people over the age of 65 have dementia in the UK - and that number is only increasing as people live longer. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people living with dementia in the UK will be more than 1 million.
It's a devastating disease that destroys memories, causes erratic behaviour, and robs a person of their personality. The exact cause is not yet fully understood, but it's a progressive condition with symptoms developing gradually over years and becoming more severe.
But now experts have revealed one common dementia symptom that could help people catch disease early.
The sign, highlighted by the Alzheimer's Society, involves day-to-day memory. The society said that while anyone can temporarily misplace a wallet or keys, a person living with dementia may put things in inappropriate places, like an iron in the freezer or a wristwatch in the sugar bowl.
Early signs of dementia can also include becoming disorientated with time and space, and even getting lost on a familiar street. People suffering with dementia may also forget how to carry out typical routines like preparing meals or getting dressed.
Dr Richard Restak, a dementia expert, told the Express that being unable to carry out ""purposeful and highly practised actions, such as brushing teeth, despite normal muscle strength and tone"" could indicate apraxia, one of the ""four impairments"" he identifies in Alzheimer's patients.
Writing in his book How To Prevent Dementia, he added: ""A person with apraxia may be able to recognise and even name a toothbrush and toothpaste but may be unable to carry out the act (praxis) of squeezing the toothpaste onto the toothbrush.""
Dementia, which has around 200 types including Alzheimer's, has no cure. But the decline can be slowed.
TV doctor Dr Michael Mosley, meanwhile, recently advised people to start taking a daily vitamin supplement that boosts your immune system and could help prevent the risk of dementia.
Speaking on his  BBC  podcast - Just One Thing - Dr Mosley admitted: ""I don't usually recommend supplements, but I do make an exception for this one. It's vitamin D. And it can be bought very cheaply - with 400 pills available for less than £8 online meaning they're less than 2p a day.""
Vitamin D also has the ability to help ease symptoms of depression, and Mosley broke down exactly why it's such a crucial supplement to integrate into your routine at this time of year.
""It is essential for healthy bones and a properly functioning immune system. And unfortunately, at this time of year in the UK, many of us are deficient in vitamin D, and that's because it just simply isn't bright enough out there to generate vitamin D in our skin.""
Studies have shown that Vitamin D deficiency can  increase  your risk of dementia and Alzheimer's, and recent  research  conducted by the University of Exeter and the University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Canada showed that taking supplements ""found that taking vitamin D was associated with living dementia-free for longer"".
The NHS states: ""Dementia is not a natural part of ageing. This is why it's important to talk to a GP sooner rather than later if you're worried about memory problems or other symptoms. These symptoms are often mild and may get worse only very gradually.
""It's often termed ""mild cognitive impairment"" (MCI) as the symptoms are not severe enough to be diagnosed as dementia. You might not notice these symptoms if you have them, and family and friends may not notice or take them seriously for some time. In some people, these symptoms will remain the same and not worsen. But some people with MCI will go on to develop dementia.""
If you're worried about your memory or you think you may have dementia, you should see a GP. For more information see the NHS website here.

She is recuperating at the London Clinic, a private hospital in Marylebone, before she returns home to Anmer Hall to continue her recovery. According to the palace, it's unlikely she will ""return to public duties until after Easter"".
Her husband Prince William has put aside all his official duties to care for his wife and their three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, eight, and Prince Louis, five.
That decision came as no surprise to royal watchers; William and Kate place a great deal of importance on family life and have made caring for their young children a priority.
One of William's key roles in Kate's absence will be reassurance. As well as hospital visits and regular Facetimes, he may well draw on his wife's early years experience when it comes to broaching the subject of her recovery. Keeping the children's routine will also be key to helping them feel safe and secure.
Sadly, he has personal experience to draw on. Royal correspondent Jennie Bond told OK: ""William is, sadly, perfectly placed to help. He knows exactly how it feels to be worried about your mum and, in his case, to lose her. So he will be taking extra care to reassure the children and tell them as much, or as little, as he judges they need to hear.
""I'm sure that, as soon as it is appropriate, William will take them to see her in hospital, because children need that face-to-face reassurance. They'll be Facetiming a lot, I'm sure, and showing them that mum's alright.""
Last week, William was seen visiting his wife in hospital while his children were at school. He is understood to be planning to spend as much time as possible with Princess Kate as she recovers following her hospitalisation and will balance daytime visits with looking after their three children.
They are a tight-knit family who have opted against having a large private staff. As a result, William is an incredibly hands-on father.
""He doesn’t want any mistakes made with the next generation. He wants to give them a proper upbringing and lots of love. That is foremost in his mind,"" a close family friend told People.
A palace insider also confirmed that Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton, who live in nearby Berkshire, have also been involved with the children during Kate's extended hospital stay.
""Her parents are an enduring factor in the upbringing of their grandchildren,"" the insider said. ""And they will be a reassuring presence when she goes back to Windsor to recuperate.""

Terry Raybon, warden of William C. Holman Correctional Facility, oversaw the death of Kenneth Smith, 58, at an Alabam prison following his toxic gas execution this morning.
It marked the first time a new execution method was used in the U.S. since 1982, when lethal injection was introduced and later became the most common method.
The execution took about 22 minutes from the time between the opening and closing of the curtains to the viewing room. Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes. For at least two minutes, he appeared to shake and writhe on the gurney, sometimes pulling against the restraints. That was followed by several minutes of heavy breathing, until breathing was no longer perceptible.

However, who is the man overseeing the much-criticised death which has been labelled ""inhuman"" by human rights campaigners?
Raybon was a former Alabama State Trooper before he was sacked in April 2000 following a scathing report from a judge after he claimed Alabama Department of Public Safety’s and its supervisors’ decision to fire him was racially motivated.
This was rejected by District Judge Ira De Ment, writing: “The Alabama Department of Public Safety fired a state trooper who beat up two of his female acquaintances, refused to perform his work acceptably, and incurred various debts from convicted felons.
""That should have been the end of instance in any sane world the police should not be required to employ persons of questionable character. But this state trooper has made a federal case of it, alleging that he was canned because of his race.”
According to the report, Raybon, who started working for the troopers in 1985, was recommended he be suspended without pay in November 1998 following a ""domestic violence altercation.""
It claimed a drunk Raybon “beat or used physical force against a woman to such extent that hospital treatment was necessary.” The victim was left with a perforated left ear drum and dozens of bruises. Raybon rejected claims he hit her. The woman, from Australia, travelled to Alabama to meet him after the pair met online, where he used the name ""Supertrooper.""
According to a suspension letter, Raybon showed “a series of lack of attention to (his) assigned duties and failure to submit reports.” It suggested Raybon didn’t submit driver’s licence and vehicle inspection reports, arrest reports, or incident reports. Raybon did not appeal this suspension and accepted the 30-day suspension without pay.
Raybon was issued a warning, which was detailed in the state’s court filings: “In short, there is no one except yourself that can cure your problems.”
However, less than 30 days after returning to work, Raybon was involved in another domestic violence altercatoin in Prattville. In February 1999, he ""used physical force against a woman in a hotel room, causing injury to her by striking her face with a telephone, pushing her, and breaking off a fingernail.""
According to the judge’s order, “Raybon had developed a romantic relationship with the woman, and it turned out that Raybon now owed her several thousand dollars.” A filing from Raybon’s lawyer said Raybon didn’t know that the woman was a convicted prisoner and that he didn’t intend to hit her when he “tossed” the telephone to her.
The same chief recommended Raybon be fired and along with an administrative review board, and he was terminated from the position in March 1999. “The department has determined that you are a danger to the public and our attempt to help you rehabilitate yourself has failed,” the acting chief of the highway patrol division wrote.
Despite the sackings, he was able to get a job at the Alabama Department of Corrections in 2000 and worked his way up to one of the state's most notorious despite numerous accusations of domestic abuse."

According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), 144 suspected cases were logged in the fortnight leading up to January 14. Seventy-four of those in the first week, and 70 in the week after. The West Midlands appears to be the worst-affected region, where 36 cases were reported in the seven days before January 14.
The prior week, 27 were recorded. In London, there were 12 cases in comparison to eight the week before. In the East of England, there were four cases in the second week, compared to a single case the week prior. In all other regions, the number of infections fell. The data, which was obtained from the UKHSA's weekly Statutory Notifications of Infectious Diseases report, represents suspected rather than confirmed cases.
In 2023, there were a total of 1,603 suspected cases of measles in England and Wales, a significant rise compared to 635 in 2022 and 360 the in 2021. It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a fresh warning over measles after an almost 45-fold rise in cases across Europe.
#
Experts from the global health body said Europe is seeing an ""alarming rise"" in the spread of the disease, which has ""accelerated in recent months"". Some 42,200 cases were reported by member states in 2023, almost 45 times the 941 cases in 2022. Two in five cases were in children aged one to four, while one in five were among people aged 20 and over. The rising trend is expected to continue if people do not vaccinate their children against the disease, WHO said.
It comes after the UK launched its own campaigns to encourage parents to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children. Measles can lead to serious complications, lifelong disability and death. It can affect the lungs and brain and cause pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said: ""Vaccination is the only way to protect children from this potentially dangerous disease. Urgent vaccination efforts are needed to halt transmission and prevent further spread.
""It is vital that all countries are prepared to rapidly detect and timely respond to measles outbreaks, which could endanger progress towards measles elimination."" The WHO said that sliding vaccination rates were to blame, but more people were now travelling abroad after Covid-19, increasing the risk of cross-border disease transmission and spread within communities."

Shanda Vander Ark, 44, was on trial for torturing her disabled 15-year-old son Timothy Ferguson at their home in Michigan, USA. During the hearing, prosecutor Matt Roberts showed pictures of Timothy's 69lb body to the jury and Vander Ark, causing her to vomit. The jury took just over an hour last month to find her guilty of first-degree murder and now a judge has sentenced her for life in prison without parole. Ark, who tortured Timothy with ice baths and withheld food, sat motionless and looked steadily ahead as she listened to her fate.
Timothy was found dead at his family's home in Norton Shores, Michigan, about 39 miles west of Grand Rapids. An autopsy found Timothy died on July 6, 2022 from malnourishment and hypothermia, and his death was ruled a homicide. The teen, who weighed just 69 pounds when he died, had autism and was speech and motor impaired. Timothy was subjected to horrific torture that included being forced to eat bread doused in hot sauce and lay in ice-cold baths for hours at a time.

Ark maintained she was unaware her son was starving, but prosecutor Matt Roberts disagreed, saying she tortured Timothy by feeding him hot sauce, putting him in ice baths, depriving him of sleep and locking up the fridge and food cupboards. ""She killed him. She starved him to death,"" Roberts said, referring to Timothy Ferguson who had some mental disabilities and was home-schooled. Vander Ark's older son, Paul Ferguson, 21, has also been caught up in the case. Court prosecutor Matt Roberts scrutinized Vander Ark with texts between her and Paul revealing they planned punishments for Timothy.
Roberts told the court Ark did not look at her children while they read their statements, adding: ""She had stopped thinking of her children as human beings."" Timothy's older siblings, Millie and Nolan Ferguson traveled from two states to make impact statements about their little brother, according to local ABC affiliate WZZM.

Mille said: ""I want the world to know that Timothy was wanted. If not by her, then by me. He was loved by me. I regret not hugging more, and teasing him so much, and not telling him I love him more often.
""I regret not dancing with him at my brother's wedding the last time I saw him. These are the things that I can't remedy now. There's no fixing what's been done. That's my regret - that I couldn't protect him when he needed me most."""

A statement from Kensington Palace read, in part, ""The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince William to Miss Catherine Middleton.
""Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private holiday in Kenya. Prince William has informed The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middleton’s father.""
A short time after the happy news was announced, William and Kate sat down for their first-ever joint interview - and it was incredibly revealing.
The couple spoke about the origins of their relationship, their brief split, and her sapphire engagement ring, inherited from William's late mother, Princess Diana. They also discussed meeting each other's parents.
Asked by interviewer Tom Bradby about her first interactions with the royals, Kate admitted she had felt a little anxious about meeting the then-Prince Charles. ""I was quite nervous about meeting William's father, but he was very, very welcoming, very friendly, it couldn't have gone easier really for me.""
""Meeting the grandmother, the Queen, again not your average meeting with a grandmother, were you nervous about that too?"" Tom enquired.
""I first met her at Peter and Autumn's wedding and again it was amongst a lot of other guests and she was very friendly,"" Kate replied, with William adding: ""She was very welcoming. She knew it was a big day and everything was going on with Peter and Autumn. She wanted to meet Kate for a while, so it was very nice for her to come over and say hello.""
Similarly, Kate's relatives - mum Carole, dad Michael, sister Pippa and brother James - embraced William as part of the family early on.
""Mike and Carole have been really sort of loving and caring and really fun,"" William said. ""They have been really welcoming towards me, so I've felt really a part of the family.""
The couple also spoke about the proposal, with the Prince confirming it had taken place three weeks earlier in Kenya. ""We had a little private time away together with some friends and I just decided that it was the right time really,"" he shared,
""We had been talking about marriage for a while so it wasn't a massively big surprise. I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya and I proposed.""
He added: ""I'd been planning it for a while but as any guy out there will know it takes a certain amount of motivation to get yourself going. I was planning it and then it just felt really right out in Africa. It was beautiful at the time. I had done a little bit of planning to show my romantic side.""

YE5Q0HINU7_AS2RMMVTEUAJGPX,BBC The Traitors final review: 'I found myself rooting for everyone and no-one',Polly Hudson,"22:45, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-traitors-final-review-i-31980043,"Four weeks. Twelve episodes. An agonising wait of over ninety million zillion years in between each one. And then, finally, after all we’ve invested, a BEYOND thrilling climax… that we almost cannot bear to watch.
Unlike last year, when good HAD to triumph over evil (ie Aaron had to beat Wilf) or the world would literally end, the finale of this series was more confusing. I found myself rooting for everyone, which really means rooting for no-one. But then I reminded myself that this isn’t life, it’s a game show, and there can be no denying who has played that game the best, consistently since day one. It had to be Harry.
It was also, obviously, GOING to be Harry, because Harry had said it would be Harry and everything Harry says always comes to pass. The last part of the show, again featured the world’s campest barbeque – this time indoors, because of the great British weather – with only Harry, Andrew, Jaz and Mollie left. Mollie had been completely suckered in by Harry. J
az – who has spotted Traitors repeatedly throughout but never had the balls to back himself – had finally plucked up the courage to tackle Harry at the final round table. Although he recovered his composure quickly – natch – this was the first time we’d seen him rattled, stumbling over his words, unsure. Would Jaz finally come through at the last moment and defeat the champion???
After a truly insane moment when Andrew went absolutely rogue and tried to take Harry down, he was dispensed with, Harry not even breaking into a sweat. And then there were three.
Claudia (SPARKLES!) announced that the final vote wouldn’t be counted until everyone was happy, which seeing as Mollie was currently sobbing over her board, seemed like it might be a while. Harry was obviously going to vote for Jaz. Jaz was going to vote for Harry. The outcome of the entire game was all down to sweet, gullible, weeping Mollie. We saw her write an H. HARRY STARTS WITH H!!!! She looked up at him and mouthed, “It’s not you?”
“It’s not,” her very best friend and confidante mouthed back, without hesitation. And so, she rubbed out her H. She wrote the word Jaz.
And we were left with the prospect of the right guy winning – come on, he deserved it – but in the process, we were going to have a front row seat for the moment a hopeful young girl lost all faith and trust in mankind for ever.
“I am… and I have been from the start… a Traitor,” Harry told her moments later, and she stared at him in teary disbelief, shock and confusion before storming out, presumably never to be seen again – by him, anyway.
The show ended with Harry toasting his £95,150 win with champagne, and gloating about being the best Traitor ever, which in fairness, he probably is.
“I promise I’m a good guy,” he told the camera at the end. And come on, what reason do we have to doubt that? Anyway, never mind him, WHEN IS SERIES THREEEEEEEEEEE?????!!!!

YETR4GE4FD_D29EDSPA0QDBWRX,Cadbury confirms new taste to iconic chocolate bar - but fans are left absolutely furious,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"07:57, 25 Jan 2024Updated08:24, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cadbury-confirms-new-taste-iconic-31962201,"Chocolate lovers have hit out at Cadbury as it said “changing tastes” was behind a reason to alter the recipe of a favourite bar.
Cadbury has confirmed that it won’t be reversing its decision on the Time Out chocolate with people asking if it was going to be a permanent move. The manufacturer replied to a person enquiring on social media who was not happy about the new taste.
The Time Out fan from Leeds showed a photo of a half eaten bar on X and then questioned what plans Cadbury had for it. ""Is there any chances of bringing back the original time out bar? These new ones are just not the same, and depressing,"" he wrote in a post.
And Cadbury responded by saying that it wouldn’t be returning the chocolate bar to its previous recipe due to changing tastes and a bid to “cater for everyone”.
It stated: ""People's tastes change from time to time, so it's important that we have a wide range of products to cater for everyone."" But it wasn’t the response that the Cadbury fan wanted clearly as he replied: ""But the original obviously tasted better.""
The Time Out is a Cadbury classic that has been going for more than 30 years in the UK, since 1992, with the layout of two single wafers inside the wrapper. It was launched in Canada and South Africa in 2001 but sales were poor so it was dropped in those countries a few years later.
The original design though was altered to a single wafter low-calorie version called the Time Out Wafer, which is 111 calories, and the company said was down to a lack of popularity in the earlier version.
The first Time Out bar was more substantial, weighing 50g. It was later reduced to 41g and then 32g, while the Time Out Wafer is 21.2g. A Cadbury spokeswoman said following the change in 2016: “We have withdrawn the current brand so the old one has gone and will be replaced. The original Time Out bars started to be withdrawn from sale in February.""
It comes as the confectionery company has announced a sweet new twist on one of their most popular items - and fans can't wait to get their hands on them. High up on that list of fan favourites are their Chocolate Buttons - and it's these that have been given a revamp. Fans will now be able to pick up Mega White Chocolate Buttons, which are available to buy in Asda."
YFQWUHFNI6_BI0VCY5HY7IM7UJ,Late Queen's blunt reply to Harry and Meghan's request for Lilibet photo,Gemma StrongLifestyle Writer,"10:53, 23 Jan 2024",20240123,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/late-queens-blunt-reply-harry-31945464,"The Queen was able to meet her great-granddaughter Lilibet before she passed away - but she wanted to ensure it was a private family affair.
Lilibet, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's youngest child was born on 4 June 2021 in Santa Barbara - a little sister for their son, Archie. The following year, in June 2022, the family travelled to London to attend the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, and it was during this visit that the monarch was able to meet her namesake for the first time.
According to multiple reports, Harry and Meghan had requested they be allowed to bring a photographer into Windsor Castle to capture the sweet moment. But the Queen was firm in her decision and they were told, unequivocally, 'no'.
Following Harry and Meghan's controversial interview with Oprah Winfrey, there were fears any photos of the Queen and Lilibet taken by the couple's photographer would be shared by them with American TV networks.
An insider told the Sun: ""An insider said: ""Harry and Meghan wanted their photographer to capture the moment Lilibet met the Queen. But they were told no chance. It was a private family meeting.""
Harry and Meghan famously chose to give their daughter the Queen's childhood nickname - much to the surprise of royal fans.
Harry and Meghan said at the time they would not have used the name without the Queen's blessing, with lawyers even telling news organisations such as the  BBC  to drop ""defamatory"" suggestions to the contrary.
A spokesperson at the time said in a statement: ""The duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact, his grandmother was the first family member he called. During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name.""
But according to  Daily Mail  writer Robert Hardman's new biography, Charles III: New King, New Court, a palace insider said that Queen Elizabeth was ""as angry as I'd ever seen her"" over claims she had given her blessing for the girl's name choice.
The royal biographer also claimed the couple tried to ""co-opt""  Buckingham Palace  aides into ""propping up"" their version of events, only to be ""re-buffed"".
Hardman writes: ""One privately recalled that Elizabeth II had been 'as angry as I'd ever seen her' in 2021 after the Sussexes announced that she had given them her blessing to call their baby daughter 'Lilibet', the Queen's childhood nickname. The couple subsequently fired off warnings of legal action against anyone who dared to suggest otherwise, as the BBC had done. However, when the Sussexes tried to co-opt the Palace into propping up their version of events, they were rebuffed.
""Once again, it was a case of 'recollections may vary' - the late Queen's reaction to the Oprah Winfrey interview - as far as Her Majesty was concerned. Those noisy threats of legal action duly evaporated and the libel actions against the BBC never materialised.""

The UK agency has just issued an urgent alert after the discovery that thousands of UK internet users have been targeted by a scary new TV Licence scam.
Emails have been released across Britain that claim households have missed payments or their accounts are about to expire. One email seen by Action Fraud states, ""We were unable to take a payment from your Licence number, as your bank has declined the Direct Debit payment request."" This is then followed by a link that urges users to update their details.
The messages appear real and the threat of hefty fines for lack of payment will clearly have some worried.
Of course, these messages all contain links which offer to solve the issues but clicking on them will leave users with more than they bargained for.
According to Action Fraud the emails are all designed to steal personal data including passwords and bank details.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter) Action Fraud said : ""Action Fraud has received 6,307 reports in two weeks relating to fake emails purporting to be from TV Licensing,"" the group said in a message on X, formerly Twitter. ""The emails state the recipient's TV Licence is about to expire, or that there was an issue with their latest payment.
""The links provided in the email lead to genuine-looking websites that are designed to steal your personal information.""
If you spot a message that appears to have come from TV Licensing then be on high alert as it could well be fake. If you're unsure about things then email TV Licensing directly or give them a call using the official number found on its website.
Whatever you do, don't use email address or call any numbers written within the email as these could be fake.
""If you have doubts about a message, contact the organisation directly. Don't use the numbers or address in the message - use the details from their official website,"" added Action Fraud.
""Your bank (or any other official source) will never ask you to supply personal information via email.""
Google also has some top tips on how to avoid so-called phishing scams.
In a post on its website, the technology giant said: ""Phishing is an attempt to steal personal information or break into online accounts using deceptive emails, messages, ads or sites that look similar to sites you already use. For example, a phishing email may look as though it's from your bank and request private information about your bank account.""
Tips to avoid phishing messages and content
1. Pay attention to warnings from Google
2. Never respond to requests for private information
3. Do not enter your password after clicking on a link in a message
4. Beware of messages that sound urgent or too good to be true
5. Stop and think before you click"

The baby was around two to three weeks old when it was found on Wednesday near Cayce, an unincorporated community in Marshall County, on Mississippi’s northern tip. Marshall County authorities say the baby was found at a mobile home community on Grove Boulevard at around 7:30 by three men who were throwing away their trash.
After hearing what they thought was a crying baby they went to investigate, and found the newborn in a car seat wrapped in blankets, authorities said. The baby was taken to Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and is reported to be healthy and in a stable condition. Once the hospital has completed its duty of care the baby will be handed over to Marshall County Department of Human Services.

Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital told Memphis news station WREG3 that they will be providing no comment on the case while the investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with any information on this case is asked to call the Marshall County Sheriff’s Office at 662-252-1311.
However, they provided information on Tennessee’s safe haven law - which allows unharmed infants to be left with “statutorily designated private persons."" In practice, this means newborns can be left at the hospital or with first responders without fear of repercussions or prosecution.

In Tennessee, the law was put in place on July 1, 2001, and it permits mothers of newborns up to two weeks old to surrender babies to the designated facilities. There is also a guarantee of anonymity for the mother, as long as the child is not harmed. Safe haven facilities in Tennessee include birthing centers, health departments, hospitals, fire stations, walk-in clinics, EMS and police stations.
In a similar case last month, a baby was found abandoned in a rubbish bin in a dumpster in Hawaii. The baby was found in Honolulu, Oahu, after a neighbor saw a woman give birth on the street before placing the baby in a rubbish bin.
Hawaii’s DHS said it would at first try to find a family member who would be able to take the child into their care. If this was not possible, it would begin searching around for other options for the baby’s future.
Representative John Mizuno, who introduced Hawaii’s Safe Haven law, told KHON 2: “It’s to save newborn babies from abandonment. If that young girl knew about the law she could have had the baby at Queens Medical Center or a hospital and relinquished the baby right after birth and there would have been no criminal charges at all.”"
YT159T0Y24_OLBRYYTKU0X1WFB,Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd's twisted double life and family he forgot for romance on run,Dan WarburtonSenior News Reporter,"12:04, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/speedboat-killer-jack-shepherds-twisted-31948232,"Jack Shepherd will be forever known as the 'speedboat killer' whose reckless antics took the life of his date Charlotte Brown. But just weeks after the tragedy, Shepherd started a new life in Wales.
He had pulled out all the stops for his first date with Charlotte, who he met online, taking her for food and drinks at The Shard in London on December 8, 2015. The pair then took his old speedboat out onto the River Thames for a champagne-fulled ride, where Shepherd drove at twice the speed limit.
But the rendezvous came to a tragic end when the boat hit a log and flipped, throwing the 24-year-old into the icy water. A post-mortem found she had immediately died from cold water immersion, with a body temperature of just 25C.
Shepherd - who walked free today - was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence but cruelly fled the UK for Georgia, leaving the 'bubbly' business consultant's family without answers as to what really happened that fateful night. The website designer, then 28, proclaimed his innocence and blamed his date for playing a part in her death, saying she took the wheel before it capsized - claims her parents have disputed.
Just six weeks after his boat overturned in the Thames, Shepherd was leading a double life - he had married and moved to the quiet market town of Abergavenny in Wales. His wedding took place the day after he had his second interview with police. And by November 2016, less than a year after Charlotte's death, he became a father to a baby son.
In a 2021 two-part documentary on ITV2 - The Speedboat Killer - Daily Mail contributor Sam Greenhill said they started to look into his background. He explained: ""Just nine weeks after the crash, Jack got married.
""In the same year, 2016, even before the first anniversary of Charlotte's death, they had a baby, a boy born in November. We were told that Jack was living in Wales. They lived in a beautiful house, on the edge of the tiny remote village, a complete world away from Jack's life in the heart of London.
""Jack seemed to be known to some people. People seem to have taken him at face value. Had he told anyone, his new wife, his neighbours, anyone at all about what had happened to Charlotte Brown?""
Also featured in the documentary was DS Chris Davis, a detective on the case, who revealed Shepherd tied the knot just one day after he'd been interviewed under caution by the police in relation to Charlotte's death. He said: ""Another twist in this chain of events he said he's met someone, married and he had actually had a child.
""Not only did Jack Shepherd get married within two months almost to the day of Charlotte losing her life. We saw the registration document the day after his second interview with the police, and had gone from the police station to the registry office.""
But his quiet life in the remote Welsh countryside didn't last long, as by Septemeber 2017, he was charged with manslaughter and pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey in January 2018. However he didn't turn up to the trial and was nowhere to be seen.
It transpired that he had been living in a Soviet-era flat on the outskirts of the capital Tbilisi, Georgia. The fugitive enjoyed regular boozy nights out and trips to the ski slopes. Whilst there, struck up a romance with model and TV journalist Maiko Tchanturidze, who eventually convinced him to turn himself in. He did so in January 2019 and was deported back to the UK in April.
In his absence, Shepherd, from Devon, was given a six-year prison sentence and was also handed a further four years after admitting to hitting a barman with a vodka bottle in a hotel - an incident that took place shortly before he fled that he blamed on the breakdown of his marriage.
But he has been released, just halfway through his sentence. Charli's dad Graham, 60, who has three other daughters, Victoria, 36, Katie, 35, and Olivia, 13, said Shepherd still posed a danger to women.
He told the Mirror last December: ""He's an evil man. He's got no idea of the devastation he's caused. I have this vision of him just shrugging it off, saying, ‘It wasn’t my fault'.""
Talking of how Shepherd fled after becoming a married man, Mr Brown said his behaviour indicated a brazen disrespect for the law. He added: ""One thing we can be sure of is that Jack Shepherd is a misogynist, he only cares about himself, he’s got no respect for women.
""After he had killed my daughter, he got married and had a child. Then he went to Georgia and got another girlfriend. The man is evil and is a complete danger."" Before he returned to the UK, Shepherd apologised to Charlotte's family, but still blamed her. He claimed she was at the controls of the boat and must ""share"" responsibility for her own death.
The father continued: ""His sentence made a mockery of our laws. He absconded from his trial and when he was brought back to the country he was put before a senior judge who gave him six months for absconding. He also said that he wouldn't get his time back for his time in Georgia when he was held in prison.
""But after he was brought back to the UK, he got his six months quashed. The message that sends is that you can abscond, not turn up to your trial, and there's no consequence. That's what a mockery our justice system is. I'm beside myself with this legal system. I'm appalled by the way legal aid supported all this.""
Shepherd served his sentence at HMP Woodhill, near Milton Keynes. In 2019, he was moved to a high-security jail for his own safety after being bullied by inmates."

Ellie lifted the show's Glitterball Trophy last month with her professional dance partner Vito Coppola - pipping rivals Bobby and Dianne Buswell to the accolade in a tense final that also involved Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin.
Following a series of steamy performances and as a result of their on-screen chemistry, rumours were rife throughout the series that Ellie and Vito were romantically involved. Similarly, speculation surrounding EastEnders star Bobby and Dianne also mounted as the former declared his ""love"" for his partner on more than one occasion.
On Wednesday, however, it was reported that the soap pair have been enjoying secret rendezvous as they embarked on Strictly's live tour of the UK. It has also been claimed that they've been seen holding hands on the tour bus and have even shared a ""cheeky snog"" in view of others.
On Thursday, meanwhile, in snaps obtained by the Sun, Ellie and Bobby were seen leaving their hotel in Newcastle together following the latest leg of the tour. Both parties were seen pulling a large suitcase and carrying hold-alls, with makeup-free Ellie wrapping up warm in a long, black leather-style coat and a multi-coloured scarf. Bobby on the other hand, wore a black puffer jacket over a grey t-shirt, completing his look with pale blue jeans.
A source told the same publication earlier this week: ""Bobby and Ellie are the talk of the tour. Their friendship has grown and grown, and they’ve been spending nearly all their free time together before and after performances. They’ve been having their meals together, and flirting increasingly openly.
""The chat on tour is they may have enjoyed a cheeky snog, and will go public with their romance any week now. They’re both hugely popular characters, and make a really cute couple. There are also endless commercial opportunities for them as a pair because they are both hugely in demand, with the world at their young feet. Everyone is very excited about this hot new pairing.""
Ellie and Bobby allegedly first noticed a romantic spark after a performance in Birmingham, before they spent the night partying together. It was claimed that the pair had also enjoyed a secret trip to Nando's during a break on the Strictly tour in Sheffield

YY974TX1TS_4YDBPO5VBYHEZ2R,Mum forced to rip out six-year-old's teeth with pliers because she couldn't book a dentist,Antony Clements-ThrowerNews Reporter,"13:26, 26 Jan 2024Updated16:46, 1 Feb 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-forced-rip-out-six-31974369,"A mother who could not get a dentist appointment for her young daughter was forced to end her toothache by yanking one out with pliers.
People across the UK have been left in agony as they struggle to see their dentists who has stopped taking new NHS patients. Some Brits were forced to take matters into their own hands and travelled abroad for help - while others have taken a more dramatic route and resorted to ending their pain by forcibly removing their own teeth.
Scott Benton, MP for Blackpool, told the House of Commons about the desperate plight of one of his constituents, the BBC reported. He said: “Only last week, a mother attended my surgery who had to physically remove the teeth of her six-year-old daughter with pliers because she was in so much pain and could not access the treatment her family needed.
""As the NHS dentistry recovery plan is long overdue, would it be in order for the House to receive a ministerial statement on when we may finally see some progress on this issue?"" Labour's shadow health minister, Preet Kaur Gill, described a case of someone called Emma who was unable to access NHS dentistry in their own town. She was forced to go to hospital to have wisdom teeth removed.
Health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom told the Commons an NHS dentistry recovery plan is coming ""very soon"". She said: “I absolutely understand the challenge for some people. The situation has improved over the last year. Since the Covid pandemic, where almost every dentist had to stop working altogether, we have not seen the recovery we want to see and we are putting in plans, not a paper ambition like the members opposite have put forward, but some really significant reforms to enable many more people to be seen by NHS dentists.""
Earlier this week it was reported millions of patients fed up with waiting to see their NHS dentists have given up waiting for appointments, according to new data. A yearly survey of patients on their experience trying to get an appointment showed 19% said they did not try to make an NHS dental appointment in the last two years. Of those, 22% said it was because they did not think they would be able to get one. The number is up from 18% in 2022, and 13% in 2021.
But between 2013 and 2020, around 93% of patients who tried to make an appointment with an NHS dentist in the previous two years had managed to do so. Only around 5% said they had been unable to get an appointment. The cost of hospitals  removing children’s rotten teeth has doubled  amid a collapse in access to NHS dentistry in the past five years. NHS  hospitals  spent £81million on child extractions in 2021/22, the latest government figures show.

Everyone should have access to an NHS dentist
More than 12 million people were unable to access NHS dental care last year – more than 1 in 4 adults in England. At the same time 90% of dental practices are no longer accepting new NHS adult patients. Data from the House of Commons Library showed 40% of children didn't have their recommended annual check-up last year.
Restore funding for dental services and recruit more NHS dentists
The UK spends the smallest proportion of its heath budget on dental care of any European nation. Government spending on dental services in England was cut by a quarter in real terms between 2010 and 2020. The number of NHS dentists is down by more than 500 to 24,151 since the pandemic.
Change the contracts
A Parliamentary report by the Health Select Committee has branded the current NHS dentists' contracts as “not fit for purpose” and described the state of the service as ""unacceptable in the 21st century"". The system effectively sets quotas on the maximum number of NHS patients a dentist can see as it caps the number of procedures they can perform each year.

Teacher Sumayah Zaman was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and could have just months left to live. Sumayah and her husband said they have waited for a home from Birmingham City Council for a year, and there's no signs of a property coming up.
Sumayah's husband Mohammed Ali, 32, has bedded down in his Toyota Yaris, while his wife and one-year-old son stay with her mum, who is also seriously unwell. Mohammed hopes they'll be reunited, but remains frustrated they were unable to secure a property, despite both having worked full-time.
He told BirminghamLive: ""My wife has terminal cancer. At first the council wouldn't accept us on the housing register even with her condition. They said we didn't meet the criteria. We then went to our MP and she got us put into Band A. But since then, the council doesn't reply to us. It doesn't help us. My wife is going back in for surgery soon. According to the doctors, she doesn't have very long left. We have a young son and we don't live together as a family. I sleep in my car sometimes. I just want us to be a family even for a short amount of time.
""My wife sometimes stays with her mum, but she also has cancer - stage four bowel cancer. So she can't help us as much as she'd like to. I have been in care and now work as an area manager. My wife was a teacher. We've made a go of our lives - it's not as if we've been on benefits. It's just an unfortunate situation we find ourselves in now. I feel like giving up. I'm trying to keep a full-time job as well and look after my wife and son. I have hospital appointments to go to three or four times-a-week. I don't know what to do.""
Mr Ali had previously been living with his parents and planned to save up to buy a house. But personal reasons and his wife's terminal condition turned their lives upside down. He said he was either unable to get through to the council or received no response when making inquiries on its housing search. The family approached their MP Jess Phillips for help, and she has assisted in getting them onto Band A of the ladder - for people with an extremely urgent need to move - but the authority has yet to rehome them, he claimed.
There are currently 20,700 households on the housing register with varying degrees of urgency awaiting suitable accommodation in Birmingham. Yardley MP Ms Phillips said: ""The lack of social housing is a nationwide problem and I am supporting a number of constituents who are struggling to find stable accommodation. This family are in a dire situation and I have been working with Birmingham City Council in the hope they will be able to move somewhere suitable and permanent as soon as is possible.""
A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: ""We are very sorry to hear about the housing challenges faced by this household. Unfortunately, they are not alone, due to the ongoing national housing crisis, demand for accommodation in the city has never been higher. There are currently over 22,000 households on the housing register in Birmingham – of which nearly 7,000 are band A. There are around 7,000 families seeking a two-bedroom home.
""The shortage of accommodation is severely restricting the options we can offer to people in need, and we know many people across the city are in difficult situations like this family. Mr Ali has been accepted into Band A and an officer has recently reviewed their case to note the mobility issues they are both experiencing.”"

Runners discovered the body of Tyler Donnelly in Hanworth Park, West London at around 7.40am on Thursday morning.
Tyler had left his home on his bike wearing dark clothing at around 9.10pm on Wednesday evening, but did not return home.
He was found in the park in Feltham the following morning. Tyler's next of kin have been notified, though formal identification of the body is yet to take place.
A post-mortem examination will conducted in due course. No arrests have been made, reports My London, and a crime scene is expected to be in place in the park for a number of days.
The Met Police's Chief Superintendent Sean Wilson, policing lead in Hounslow, said in a press statement that it ""saddens"" him to ""see another young life so needlessly cut short"", and urged people who may have any information about the incident to come forward. ""I know that this incident will be a shock for those living and working in the area and my officers will be conducting additional patrols to provide reassurance to the community"", he added.
Detective Chief Inspector Brian Howie, leading the investigation from the Met’s Homicide Command said:  “Members of the public called us shortly after 7:40am reporting that they’d found a man’s body in Hanworth Park. We now know that the victim is 19-year-old Tyler Donnelly, who was from Feltham.
“Tyler left his home around 9.10pm on Wednesday evening and rode his bike along Elmwood Avenue and at some stage entered the park. He never returned home. If you were in the park and saw something, regardless of the reason you were there, please do get in touch. Our focus is on what happened to Tyler and who was responsible.
He continued: “Similarly, if you were driving through Elmwood Avenue, returning home or out walking, did you notice anything? Did you perhaps see Tyler, who was wearing dark clothing, riding his grey bike or did you see him with anyone?
“The H25 bus route goes through Elmwood Avenue, were you travelling through this area on Wednesday or in the early hours of Thursday? Did you see Tyler or anyone matching his description? Tyler’s family and friends are inconsolable after receiving the worst possible news imaginable – our thoughts are with them and they are being supported by specialist officers.”

ZBJE5JUZ7Y_SIG9D6KE726OABO,Retired policewoman wins £100k court battle against pensioner neighbours,Monica CharsleyNews Reporter,"16:01, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/retired-policewoman-wins-100k-court-31974205,"A couple has won a £100,000 court battle after their elderly neighbours tried to sue them because their vintage lantern was ruining their ""quiet enjoyment"".
Former policewoman Frances and her husband Graham Pollard got into a dispute with Roger and Margaret Hunt, both 80, after they received a complaint about their decorative lantern in Kent. The pensioners claimed the ornament was causing ""sky glow and excessive light pollution"" because it was placed at the back of the Pollards house.
They further claimed that their sleep had become disrupted at their £1million home. But despite trying to get the light categorised as an official public ""nuisance"", Folkestone Magistrates Court ruled that they didn't have enough evidence.
It comes after the court heard that the neighbours, who had already clashed over previous issues, noticed that the Pollards moved the lantern from the side of their £550,000 second home in Union Road, Deal - where it had been for nine years without being used - to the back and lit it up in December 2021.
Ian Rees Philips, for the Hunt family, told Mr Justice Bourne that the former PC and her husband turned on the light on December 23, drawing immediate complaints from their neighbours. The Hunt family explained that the light sits on a bracket 4m above the ground and about 5m from the back bedroom windows of their home. They also told the couple they would take legal action if the issue continued.
But the Pollards - having inserted a small plastic shield to block the direct glare of the light onto their neighbours' windows - replied the next day in an email, stating: ""We don't consider that the light causes a nuisance... we reserve the right to switch the light on or off at any time"". The Pollards ""then operated the lantern continuously all night for the next 16 nights...on a dusk until dawn basis of around 4pm to 8am every day,"" the barrister said
""It was on throughout the whole night and the early hours. Mr and Mrs Hunt had to have their curtains drawn and had their room lit up at night, meaning they had difficulty sleeping and were regularly being kept awake at night,"" he added. ""Despite the blanking shield...light was still cast directly onto their property's windows on the second floor and was causing sky glow and excessive light pollution onto their property and the surrounding area.""
A second bigger shield was installed, but the Hunts were still unhappy and took their case to Folkestone Magistrate Court. They applied under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to get the light classified as a statutory nuisance, meaning the Pollards would have to stop lighting it or potentially face criminal proceedings for breaching an order not to. However, the justices rejected the Hunts' case after a three day trial. Appealing, the Hunts asked Mr Justice Bourne to clarify whether the magistrates had taken the wrong legal approach to the case when dismissing their claim.
Their barrister, Mr Rees Philips, argued that the magistrates had wrongly relied on the evidence of the electrical engineer who measured the light output of the lantern at ground level, pointing out that it actually projected its light upwards and an accurate reading would have to be taken from the Hunts' home or another high-level area.
But Matthew Withers, for Mr and Mrs Pollard, said that the magistrates had been well aware of where the light readings submitted by the engineer had been taken from, but had rejected the case anyway. ""The magistrates were not wrong. It was a conclusion open to them based on the facts,"" he said.
Mr Justice Bourne agreed and dismissed the appeal. He said: ""The question was not if there was a departure from guidance, but whether there was a statutory nuisance. The magistrates simply identified a lack of sufficient evidence. No more was needed in this case. The appellants have not shown that the magistrates made any error of law and this appeal will be dismissed.""
Mr and Mrs Hunt were ordered to pay most of the costs of the appeal, having already had to foot the cost of the trial as the losing party. The judge ordered that they pay £18,000 of their neighbours' costs of the appeal, with their bills totalling £26,000 for last week's hearing.
Lawyers outside court confirmed that the total costs of the trial and appeal was over £100,000. Mrs and Mrs Hunts' son, Jonathan Hunt, who was a party to the action and attended the hearing, agreeing and adding: ""I told my parents not to do this."" Mrs and Mrs Hunt were not at court for the appeal."

Sixteen months into his reign, the royal could call on someone to deputise for him as he undergoes medical treatment for an enlarged prostate this morning. Buckingham Palace said today that the King has been admitted to hospital for treatment on his enlarged prostate.
There are currently seven counsellors of state - members of the royal family who can deputise for the monarch if he is abroad or unwell. This includes the Duke of Sussex, who lives in California after stepping down as a working royal, and the disgraced Duke of York.
The royals who can stand in for the King are the Queen and the four most senior adults in the line of succession – Prince of Wales, Harry, Andrew and Princess Beatrice.
But it is thought that none of them will be asked to step in for the King while he is in hospital and then at home recovering, as the King plans to carry on working as usual
Only ""working members"" of the royal family will be called upon to act as Counsellors of State - ruling Prince Andrew and Prince Harry out of the list. Instead, Princess Anne and Edward can be called upon to take their places. Both were previously counsellors of state before they were overtaken in the order of succession.
Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, withdrew from royal duties after his association with US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became public. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, lives with his family in the United States and has stepped back from being a ""working royal"". By law, counsellors of state are required to have a UK domicile, but Harry has no address here after stepping back from official duties.

Charles, 75, was seen entering The London Clinic in London on Friday morning with the Queen at his side.
It is the same hospital where the Princess of Wales is recovering after undergoing successful abdominal surgery last week and it is understood the King has visited her.
The Palace spokesman said: “The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment.
“His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.”
The news announced last week came just an hour and a half after Kensington Palace announced that the Princess of Wales was recovering in hospital after undergoing abdominal surgery, and would be recuperating and away from official duties for up to three months."
ZCUB5C66IX_24LUUWHB7AC3JC5,Holidaymaker who thinks he spotted Loch Ness Monster says it's a surprising colour,James Sweetnam,"23:23, 25 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/holidaymaker-who-thinks-spotted-loch-31970917,"While the Loch Ness Monster is one of the world's most iconic mythical creatures, only a few people have claimed to have seen it. However, on a trip to Scotland, one holidaymaker claims he saw it and was surprised at her colour.
While we don't know for sure whether Jarod Strong really saw the iconic 'Nessie', he seems utterly convinced that the animal he spotted was the genuine article. During a trip to visit family on October 21, 2023, he hit the water and allegedly encountered the animal, which he had always thought would be green.
Jarod was located close to Urquhart Castle on the banks of the loch when something caught his eye. He recalls spotting a huge underwater creature, that was, surprisingly to him, grey in colour.
The tourist said: ""I was near the castle with my family at about 1 pm when I noticed a little movement in the water. Then the water started to move a bit more, and a long shape came out of the water. He wasn't the green which I thought he would be, he was more a dark grey colour. Then it quickly went away again, but as it was going back under, I could see a longer body. I don't know how long it was, but it looked really long.”
The encounter lasted for a mere four or five seconds, giving Jarod no time to take a picture, leaving him with just the memory. His sighting is one of ten that occurred last year. Three weeks earlier, Cumbria's Richard Story, who was on a walk from Fort Augustus to Invergarry, claims that Nessie glided through the water from the bank to the middle of the loch.
Thinking fast, he whipped out his camera and caught two snaps. On October 7, Sasha Lake, 29, from Bath, Somerset, was completely taken aback when she noticed the humongous animal, which she described as being the size of a 'double-decker bus'.
In addition, local Siobhan Janaway saw ripples in the water, and three days later, nurse Fiona Wade spotted three humps rising above the surface. Further sightings included Alistair Gray, and father-of-four, Steve Valentine, who noticed a 'black shape' with a 'hump'.
Furthermore, while on a visit from Lyon, France, couple Etienne Camel and his wife Elaine were rendered flabbergasted after being witness to a 65ft-long dark shape swimming under the water. And they're not the only internationals to have had a glimpse at the Loch Ness Monster. Ceci, from the USA, noticed something mysterious in the deep depths on her trip to Scotland.
All sightings are recorded by expert Gary Campbell, who's been keeping track for The Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register since 1996. In August, wildlife enthusiasts conducted a massive search with drones. However, to this day, we're yet to uncover any concrete evidence."

Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, his girls Jasmin, 12, and seven-year-old Downreuang and their aunt were found dead at a property in Costessey, near Norwich, on Friday morning. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating Norfolk Constabulary after the force admitted it received a 999 call from a man inside the property earlier that day but failed to attend.
And now it's understood the IOPC is also investigating contact Norfolk Police had with Mr Kuczynski on December 14 after he was reported missing. The father of two was taken to hospital for an emergency mental health assessment but somehow was able to leave the site in Colney, Norfolk, unescorted before it was carried out.
Neighbours also said said Mr Kuczynski had been suffering with mental health problems for months and had asked for help, although they didn’t know if he had engaged with mental health services. Norfolk Police, whose Chief Constable, Paul Sanford, said last night the force will be will be ""open and transparent"" with its investigation, is currently involved in a phased introduction of a scheme called Right Care, Right Person, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time officers spend on mental health-related incidents, it is believed.
Campaigners have warned more people could be left at risk as a result – although Norfolk Police has said officers would still attend incidents where there is believed to be an immediate threat to life.
Norfolk Constabulary received the 999 call from Mr Kuczynski at around 6am on Friday but ""resources were not deployed"". They finally responded after a second call around an hour later from a member of the public who ""wanted to raise a concern about the people inside,"" Mail Online reports.
Officers arrived at 7.15am and broke in to find the bodies of Polish-born Mr Kuczynski, his daughters, and their aunt, Kanticha Noon, 36, from Bangkok, Thailand. The girls’ mother, Nanthaka Kuczynska, was at her job as a caretaker at the time.
Post-mortem examinations on Sunday revealed Ms Noon – who arrived in the UK on December 27 to help care for her nieces - died from multiple stab wounds to the neck, while Mr Kuczynski had a single stab wound to the neck.
Chief Const Sanford described the incident as ""horrific and tragic"" but said he couldn’t comment on it further due to the IOPC investigation. The county’s police and crime commissioner, Giles Orpen-Smellie, has stated he will ""robustly"" hold the chief constable to account for the actions of officers and other staff.
Chief Const Sanford added: ""This is a tragic and horrific incident and my thoughts, and that of the entire constabulary, remain with the family of those involved. I’m aware this incident has also caused great upset and shock in Costessey, the wider community and beyond.
“Following the identification of the earlier 999 call, the constabulary referred itself to the IOPC who will now investigate. It is because of this process that I choose my words carefully; not because I don’t want to be open and honest, but because I have a duty to protect the integrity of any investigation that needs to follow.
“It will be for this investigation to identify and consider the circumstances and to consider if there were any issues with the response. I know the family and the public will rightly want to know whether there was an ability to prevent this tragedy, and this is a question that must be answered.
“However, at this stage, I cannot answer that question. What I can say is that we will be open and honest in the days, weeks, and months ahead, to get the answers to this question. There will, of course, also be an inquest that will review the wider circumstances surrounding the deaths and the involvement of the police and other agencies.
""We have thousands of interactions with the public every single day, on the phone and in person. It’s only right that when there are questions about our response, they are properly investigated, and I fully support and welcome this scrutiny. I will not wait for the outcome of this investigation to review our working practices and that process has started.
“Furthermore, the constabulary is currently undergoing a routine inspection by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. That inspection includes an assessment of our response to 999 calls.
“Today, I have asked the Inspectorate to consider undertaking a deeper review than the robust inspection already planned, to provide the reassurance that the public and I need in our response to emergency calls.”"

Young Australian entrepreneur Max McKay says he was teased for years after attending an independent school, despite his family 'not being rich'. The online content creator said he does not understand why people are mad at him ""because my parents spent money on my education"".
Max, who has an online fitness business and reportedly makes over £5,000 every month, said he would get on the bus to school and be picked on for wearing a tie and a blazer. Strangers would call him a ""rich kid"", but he claimed his family do not come from money.
According to the young entrepeneur, his parents saved up and spent all their money on sending him to a private school as he ""kept getting kicked out of public schools"". ""A lot of people that go to private schools are like drop-kick kids because their family is worried their kid is going to be a failure,"" Max said online.
Max, who says he gets to ""buy anything he wants"" - thanks to his business success - shared his thoughts about private education on his TikTok page @max.mckay. He said: ""Never understood how being called a private school kid is an insult. Every time I'd get on the bus a public school kid would say 'nice blazer d*******'. My family is the same as yours, I don't even know why I'm going to this school.""
One other privately education individual said: ""I'm a private school kid and my family is middle class, it's not my fault my parents care about my education, I hated my private school. I'd rather go to a public school with my friends.""
Another explained: ""As a private school kid it's not the actual schooling it's the type of kids that come out of it, who think they're better than everyone else.""
A third person wrote: ""It's not the fact that your parents can afford to send you to a private school, it's a matter of a fact that majority of private school kids seem to think they are richer and better than public school kids, when majority of us public school kids are just as well off as private school kids.""
""At the end of the day most private school kids are up themselves because of where they go to school,"" said another. One other commented: ""It's the people that come out of it not the actual education.""

ZFRVFHAVO9_HN3QDAOGFXLUAKL,John Lewis slashes redundancy pay package sparking fears of more job cuts,Lawrence Matheson,"08:14, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/john-lewis-slashes-redundancy-pay-31971563,"John Lewis Partnership is set to cut its redundancy pay package for workers in half, sparking fears of more job cuts.
The retail giant, which owns both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, announced the changes as part of a major cost-cutting overhaul. Employees were told on Thursday that the company's redundancy pay plan will be reduced.
Currently, workers receive two weeks of redundancy pay for every year they've worked at the business. This will now be cut to one week of pay per year.
In addition to this, the minimum payment for redundancy will increase from one week's salary to four. A spokesperson for JLP said: ""We offer a generous and attractive range of benefits that includes a redundancy package, which will continue to be above the market.""
""We're making changes as a high proportion of our current benefits package is weighted towards partners after they have left, when we want to better reward those currently working for us. These changes will allow us to invest more in our partners still within the business.""
The company has cut thousands of jobs since it launched its turnaround plan almost four years ago, involving the closure of high street stores and head office redundancies. Thursday's announcement comes after the employee-owned business cautioned last March about potential future job losses as an aggressive turnaround plan was pursued.
In its latest update on performance last September, JLP revealed another financial loss, albeit reduced to £59 million amid ongoing recovery efforts. Chairwoman Dame Sharon White also warned that the five-year transformation plan, set out by the retail group in 2020, will require an additional two years to complete.

You should order your bridesmaid dresses at least six months before your wedding date - this gives time for them to arrive and for any alterations to be made. You may want to wait until the bride or groom has their outfit sorted so you can coordinate with them and make sure the entire wedding party matches.
Traditionally the couple who are getting married pay for the bridesmaid dresses but it is a completely personal choice. Some bridesmaids will offer to pay for their own, or you may suggest politely that you will cover the cost of the outfits if they are able to source their own accessories. If you're not able to pay for the bridesmaid dresses, it's important you communicate this early on and are a really clear about it.
As our round-up proves, there's no reason that you have to spend hundreds when trying to find a beautiful bridesmaid dress as there are tons of cheap bridesmaid dresses that are excellent quality. An affordable bridesmaid dress typically costs between £80-150, and if they can re-wear them post-wedding you're getting even more for your money.

ZOX2JQKTLY_B7OT945G5Q5EPBP,Two lads baffled after discovering Subway drive-thru - but there's an annoying catch,Liam GilliverOpinion Writer,"10:47, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/two-lads-baffled-after-discovering-31953821,"There are not many problems a footlong sub won't fix. Especially if you make it a meal deal.
Brits and their service stations is a love much greater than what we see in films and read in books. They're a quintessential part of any road trip, and can be the difference between a terrible journey and an incredible one.
There are more than 2,000 Subway stores dotted across the country, making them a popular service station choice. But two lads were left utterly baffled after coming across a rare sighting of a Subway drive-thru. However, there is an annoying catch that quickly crumbled their high hopes.
Kevin and Kieran D'Arcy are twin brothers who have amassed more than 87,000 TikTok followers due to their travel and food videos. In a recent post, they came across a Subway drive-thru located in Guisborough, Yorkshire, whilst driving down from Glasgow.
""I'm so bloody excited for this. Why is there not more Subway drive-thrus?"" they said. ""Now I don't even know where the hell we are, but if this is your local Subway be proud of it.""
However, the siblings' excitement was dampened slightly after they realised all of the salad toppings and sauces were missing from the menu. This meant the Subway employee had to go through every single option for them to build their sandwiches.
""It turned something that was supposed to be fast into something that took forever,"" the content creators added. ""That is right, they went through every single salad option and every single sauce.""

People took straight to the comments section to praise the drive-thru, with one user writing: ""That's amazing... [I] never knew this was a thing."" Another commented: ""Shut up, that's crazy."" While a third added: ""I'd be here every single day. I'm addicted to Subway salads.""
However, many criticised the arduous task of not having the salad toppings or sauces clearly displayed on the menu. ""How long did it take?"" one person asked - while another said they felt sorry for the employee having to read all the options out loud.
Whilst not hugely common, the first UK Subway drive-thru opened back in 2019 in Swindon. Other outlets include Rochdale, Salford, Wakefield, and Belfast.

ZP0L1IQJX5_30EKBP6IF352F9A,Miss England beauty queen stripped of crown after refusing to give up bridesmaid duties,Ryan FaheyNews Reporter,"08:59, 26 Jan 2024Updated09:15, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/miss-england-stripped-crown-after-31971708,"A Miss England beauty queen is to be stripped of her crown - for going to her best friend's wedding on the day of the pageant final.
Natasha Beresford, 26, was crowned Miss London in the 'world's first' make-up free beauty competition last September. The dental nurse hit headlines after beating 18 other women, who all competed ""bare-faced"", in the first make-up free pageant of the competition's 95-year history.
She had been due to compete in the Miss England final in Wolverhampton in May and had a ""great chance"" of being crowned the winner, organisers say. But Natasha has ditched the chance to become the next Miss England because the final clashes with her best friend's big day.
So instead of walking down the catwalk, she will now walk down the aisle as a bridesmaid after turning down the chance to be the next Miss England. Natasha, who is originally from Sheffield and now lives in London, said: ""Unfortunately I will no longer be representing London and taking part in the Miss England national final in May.""
""My best friend is getting married in the north of England on the same weekend, and I have already promised to be her bridesmaid. I would like to thank everyone for their support during my time in the contest, and I wish all the Miss England finalists the best of luck.""
Ironically, Natasha wowed the Miss England judges with her natural beauty while wearing a white lace bridal gown at the make-up free contest. Organisers said the concept aimed to empower women, boost confidence and promote a more realistic body image as it focuses on natural looks.
National director of Miss England Angie Beasley said: ""We are so disappointed that Natasha can't take part in the Miss England final, she had a great chance. It's so unfortunate that Miss England has fallen on the same date as her best friends wedding. But the show must go on. I wish Natasha all the very best going forward. Natasha is a true beauty with a purpose putting others first before her own, she doesn't want to let her best friend down which is totally understandable.""
Runner-up Temi Adeyemi, 26, an accounts assistant from Enfield, Middlesex, will now compete as Miss London in the final. She said: ""I was hoping to enter the Miss England Final make up free to embrace natural beauty. For me it's an empowering statement. It's also an honour for me to represent London. I'm so excited.""
The Miss England final will take place over two days on May 16 and 17 at the Grand Station in Wolverhampton. For more details about the contest visit: www.missengland.info

ZPW7FSFZJT_1JMV74IBA9PTDHL,'I got dementia in my 50s - it changed my personality and sent my life into a spiral',Hannah Van De Peer,"13:57, 26 Jan 2024Updated14:11, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/i-dementia-50s-changed-personality-31975166,"A mum who thought she had a brain tumour after she went from laidback to aggressive was told she has early-onset dementia aged 50 and won't live to see her 60s. Jana Nelson, 53, first noticed symptoms in 2017, after friends and family pointed out her personality had changed.
She was repeating the same questions and sentences and thinking she'd just become forgetful. She also felt like she couldn't keep her balance when walking, was having trouble making decisions, and suffered from severe mood swings. Her counsellor recommended she go for neurological tests - believing she could be suffering from MS, or a brain tumour.
But an MRI scan revealed she was suffering from stage five dementia - and would eventually need round-the-clock care. While there isn't any history of dementia in Jana's family - she was diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome in 2013, which doctors say played a major part in her health decline.
Mum-of-two Jana, who is no longer able to work, from Idaho Falls, Idaho, US, said: “You think you’d know when something was really wrong - but I didn’t realise things were bad to this extent. I was really devastated. My doctor doesn’t see me living into my sixties and eventually I’m going to need round-the-clock care at home.
“The symptoms and tests were so scary - I’m a college-educated businesswoman, why couldn’t I do simple maths problems and name different colours? Before her diagnosis, Jana described herself as a “very knowledgeable person” who was quick-witted, decisive and spoke her mind.

She was confident in her abilities, studied psychology at degree-level, and ran a business managing MMA fighters. But in 2017, she slowly began experiencing a series of symptoms which prompted her husband, Kenny, 55, nuclear reactor supervisor, and her counsellor, to encourage her to see a doctor.
She said: “I had so much trouble regulating my emotions - I’d become so furious over things I usually wouldn’t be angry about, like people correcting me if I said something wrong. It also became really hard for me to calm down if I had a mood swing - which really wasn’t normal for me.
“I couldn’t keep my balance, and also began to really struggle with problem-solving. I just knew something was wrong.” Jana - who is mum to a daughter and son - referred herself to the hospital, where she was given two days of intensive neurological tests.
She was told to solve number problems, remember flashing light patterns and name different colours - and quickly became frustrated and scared after not being able to complete them as well as she thought she would. Her doctor also gave her an MRI - hoping any issues would show up on the scan.
“The tests brought me to tears on both days,” Jana said. “It was so demoralising and devastating, I was scared because I knew something was wrong. There were so many different things - there were little pegboards where you’d have to take a key and fit it into the correctly shaped hole, and you’d have to do it as quickly as you could.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
“Then they put me in front of a computer, there were all these colours and words flashing and you’d have to remember the pattern. I couldn’t even work out how to do the numerical patterns - like, ‘you have five dollars and you spend two dollars fifty - how much have you got left?’.
“I couldn’t draw a clock face and I struggled to write out a cheque. It made me feel stupid and really confused - I knew something was wrong but I didn’t realise the extent of it until then.” Jana’s doctor asked her to come back to the hospital with Kenny and her daughter and she was told her MRI and tests indicated she was suffering from stage four dementia.
She was told it's unlikely she’ll live beyond her early sixties. She said: “I thought 'OK, it’s dementia - but surely it must only be in the early stages'. But it wasn’t, I have advanced dementia and a prognosis of 10 years to live. The doctor even said she was surprised I was functioning as well as I was, and she’s seen people with worse symptoms at earlier stages of dementia.”
Her symptoms have continued to progress and she is now experiencing speech issues, with a ""very limited vocabulary"". The condition has now progressed to stage five - which typically includes symptoms like disorientation, pronounced memory loss and ‘Sundown syndrome’ - which means confusion that worsens in the night.
Feeling isolated, Jana began researching community groups for people with dementia - but she could only find elderly people with Alzheimer’s, and struggled to find people with early-onset dementia. She began documenting her decline on TikTok - and has since found a number of middle-aged people suffering from similar types of dementia.
Through this, she has found a group of friends and uses their experiences as a “roadmap” of what to expect from herself. She added: “My therapist recommended I start my own TikTok - I didn’t want anyone else to feel as isolated as I did at the time. It’s really rewarding to know there’s people out there who need the same guidance I need. It’s really nice that they just understand - and I don’t have to explain myself.”
Up until now Jana has only needed in-house care if she’s injured or ill - but doctors believe she’ll need full-time care within the next year. She said: “My doctors’ recommendations have been to look into resources for in-home care, and it’s probably going to happen within the next year. We know which company we’re going to have now - so that’s ready to go as soon as I need it.”

ZQTZMW6C9T_7B0GELCWS8HR7PO,Optician's warning over cold weather hack as people smear Vaseline into eyes,Liam GilliverOpinion Writer,"09:01, 25 Jan 2024",20240125,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/opticians-warning-over-cold-weather-31962604,"Another bitter snap is on its way, as temperatures are expected to plunge to -6C.
If the cold British wind is causing your eyes to water - join the club. It's another annoying side effect of our miserable weather, but will often get better on its own without any treatment. The NHS states a pharmacist can help with watering eyes if you think a bigger issue (such as an allergy or dry eye syndrome) is at place.
However, skincare gurus online are raving about a hack that's been described as the 'best tip' to stop those tears falling. It involves smearing Vaseline into the corner of the eyes - and has concerned experts.
TikTok user Dani has garnered an impressive 468,000 followers due to her skincare and beauty advice. One of the influencer's most popular videos shows her using Vaseline as a moisturiser to create a luminous effect on the skin - which she states Marilyn Monroe used to do.
In a more recent video, she can be seen applying Vaseline in the corners of her eye using a Q-tip, which she says stops her eyes from watering altogther. While some users were excited to try the hack one, many were doubtful.
""Best way to get milia and eye infections,"" one person wrote. Another commented: ""Don't do it - your eyes can swell up."" While a third added: ""I put Vaseline on my eyes and they puffed up so fast.""

Mark Shelton is an optometrist at Bayfields Opticians and Audiologists and warns people against the hack, even if it is 'effective'. ""The eye lids contain meibomian glands which help to regulate the quality of the tears and blocking these glands can cause complications like styes and cysts or even infections,"" he told the Mail.
The expert recommended wearing sunglasses to shield the eyes from blusterous winds and cold temperatures. He also urged the important of staying hydrated to 'help maintain the natural moisture balance of the eyes'.
People often use Vaseline on their eyelids if they're suffering with dry skin. Whilst experts over at Medical News Today say this is safe - they warn users must be careful and make sure it doesn't enter the eye.

Officers rushed to a home just after 11.30am on Sunday after receiving a call from a man who said his wife had been shot. The victims - identified as 53-year-old Majeda Kassem, 25-year-old twins Halema and Zahia, and their 24-year-old sibling Hanan Kassem - were pronounced dead at the scene.
All the victims had suffered gunshot wounds, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. The dispatcher said: ""A male subject said his wife was shot. The line disconnected. He wasn't really cooperative."" They later asked to send more officers while describing the scene as a ""massacre"".

The suspect has been taken into custody and a gun was recovered from the scene on 173rd Street in Tinley Park, near Chicago, Illinois, the police said. Village Manager Pat Carr said the incident was a tragedy not only for the family - which was made up of the husband and wife, three adult daughters, and two grown sons - but also for all the neighbours. The manager added there were no prior police calls at the location and the emergency services were not familiar with the family.
Neighbour Charlotte Vaitkus told ABC 7 that her daughter knew the family as she went to school with the oldest son and employed the twin sisters. She explained: ""She always talked about how they were all very intelligent, and they had very high goals in life.""

She said some of the children had dreams of becoming a pharmacist or a doctor. Another neighbour who knew the family said the crime was ""shocking"" given that the victims and alleged killer were ""such a good family that had a bright future"".
Police released a statement after the man's arrest saying: ""The offender is in custody and scene is secure. Due to ongoing investigation, we are asking residents to stay out of the area.""
The murders were the deadliest incident to hit Tinley Park, a village southwest of Chicago, in nearly two decades. In 2008, five women were killed inside a Lane Bryant store and the case remains unsolved to this date. Carr said: ""This stirs a lot of emotions for people. It brings back a lot of bad memories for a lot of us who have been around here.""
The official charges against the man in custody are still pending. Carr said that authorities are set to provide further details on the investigation at 11am local time on Monday."

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) today confirmed Norfolk Constabulary received a call at around 6am on Friday January 19 from the man at a property in Costessey near Norwich. It is believed this was Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, whom neighbours say had challenges with his mental health for months.
The caller ""expressed concerns for his own mental state saying he was confused"" but was advised to seek medical help, and officers did not attend the property. However, just over one hour later Mr Kuczynski, his girls Jasmin, 12, and seven-year-old Downreuang and their aunt were found dead there.
Charmaine Arbouin, IOPC regional director, said: ""Norfolk Constabulary established that the man had made a 999 call to the force shortly before 6am on January 19. During that call the man expressed concerns for his own mental state saying he was confused.
""He was advised to seek medical advice and police did not attend. At around 7am the force received a call from a dog walker concerned for the welfare of those within the home. Officers attended shortly after and, tragically, found the man, a woman and two children dead.""
Norfolk Police had conceded last week officers did not attend the address after a call from it at around 6am but the IOPC has now offered fresh detail about the nature of this report.
Ms Arbouin added: “Following a mandatory referral from the force we have decided to investigate and will be examining if the force’s handling of the contact they had with the man was appropriate and in line with force policy, training and procedures. We will be making contact with the families of the deceased to explain our role. Our sympathies are with the families and friends of the deceased and all those affected by this incident.”
Chief Constable Paul Sanford said last night the force will be will be ""open and transparent"" with this investigation, is currently involved in a phased introduction of a scheme called Right Care, Right Person, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time officers spend on mental health-related incidents, it is believed.
Campaigners have warned more people could be left at risk as a result – although Norfolk Police has said officers would still attend incidents where there is believed to be an immediate threat to life.
Father-of-two Mr Kuczynski was taken to hospital for an emergency mental health assessment last month, it also emerged today, but somehow was able to leave the site in Colney, Norfolk, unescorted before it was carried out."
ZUV3J3RHK4_BHFHTDAKW5V2GC4,Log burner warning as new regulations could land you with 'large fines',Emma MackenzieLifestyle Writer,"12:34, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/log-burner-warning-new-regulations-31974229,"Lighting your log burner might be one of your favourite parts of the cold months, and a way of making your home as cosy as possible during the long evenings we experience in the winter. But experts have issued a stark warning that you might be leaving yourself open to ""large fines"" if you aren't careful about how you use it.
Back in 2021, new regulations were introduced by the government regarding log burners and the kind of wood that could be burned in them - making it unlawful to sell wet wood. This is because wet wood - as opposed to dry wood - ""is a major source of the pollutant PM2.5"" which the World Health Organisation has identified ""as the most serious air pollutant for human health"" the government said at the time.
On the other hand, dry wood produces up to 50% fewer emissions and also can create more heat, arguably making it a more cost-effective option as well.
These restrictions don't mean that you can't have a log burner at all - around 1.5 million people in the UK are estimated to own one - but simply that it must meet certain standards, and if it doesn't or you are burning wet wood in it, you could face a significant fine, an expert has warned.
John Cutts, from MeandMyGlass.co.uk, explained that ""many log burner owners are unaware of the recent implications of clean air regulations. If they're not followed correctly, thousands of Brits could face large fines and even a criminal conviction.
""The regulations state that owners are to face penalties for using wood-burning stoves which don’t meet the UK’s standard for emissions. Not only do people have to be aware of the type of log burner they're using, but also the material being burned on it. Using the wrong log burner and materials will result in a hefty penalty.""
The new standard is that log burners can only emit 3g of smoke per hour - this used to be 5g, but it has dropped with the new regulations. A new scheme was brought in where all fuel must be certified, and shops are only allowed to sell items that come with the proper labelling - and the expert warns that you must make sure you have bought certified fuel only.
Cutts has said: ""The regulations encourage owners to switch to more eco-friendly alternatives, so we strongly advise all log burner owners to be cautious of the materials they’re using on the stove.""
Equally, the expert advises that you regularly do a careful, regular check-up of your log burner itself, to make sure that there is no damage to it, which could cause it to emit more smoke: ""It's important to make sure that the materials being used adhere to the guidelines and that any stoves with glass doors are still fit to function without any cracks that could lead to fumes escaping from the burner.""

ZWTY1MUZK5_0L14F9LXYILRCZW,Foreign Office updates France travel advice amidst protests across the country,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"12:39, 26 Jan 2024",20240126,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/foreign-office-updates-france-travel-31973057,"Brits heading to France may find themselves swept up in widespread protests, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has warned.
The FCDO issued a new alert on Thursday evening due to ongoing protests in the country. French farmers have been blocking roads and dumping produce in protest against low prices and green regulations.
Snowballing protests crept closer to Paris on Thursday, with tractors driving in convoys and blocking roads in many regions of the country to ratchet up pressure for government measures to protect the influential agricultural sector from foreign competition, rising costs and what they have described as poverty-levels of pay for the worst-off producers.
Holidaymakers heading to France may want to bring a heavy duty raincoat due to the dirty nature of some of the protests. One supermarket was showered with a thick jet of pig slurry by furious campaigners.
The FCDO's new alert warns: ""Protests by farmers have taken place across France. Since January, action has included blocking roads and delaying traffic.""
It advises travellers to keep an eye on the news, avoid protests, expect delays on major roads and follow local authority advice. Reports suggest that regional farming unions are calling on their members to converge on the capital, Paris. If they do, then it is likely that tourists will find themselves amid the protests.
Traffic-snarling drive-slows, barricades of straw bales, stinky dumps of agricultural waste outside government offices and other demonstrations have rapidly blown up. Roads hit Thursday morning by drive-slows included a highway west of the French capital.
“We are getting progressively closer to Paris,” farmer David Lavenant said to broadcaster BFM-TV.
Two agricultural unions called for farmers to converge on highways into the city on Friday to blockade it. Highway operator Vinci reported blockages on 14 of the motorways that it operates, as well as disruptions on others.
Protest leaders said farmers would closely scrutinise measures expected Friday from the government in response to their demands before deciding on next steps. In recent weeks, farmers have staged protests in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.
France is not the only country which has been the subject of an updated FCDO warning this month. It also updated its travel advice for those heading to the United Arab Emirates, urging them to ""remain vigilant at all times"" as the risk of a terrorist attack targeting UK citizens has ""increased"".

More than 60 calls were made to professionals by people who were concerned about Alfie's welfare in the years leading up to his death, the BBC reported.
Alfie was found unresponsive at his home in Droitwich, Worcestershire, in 2021, after ""sadistic"" punishments by is mother Carla Scott and her Partner Dirk Howell, 41, which involved beating Alfie and holding his head under bath water. A safeguarding report published on Friday made light of a catalogue of missed opportunities by professionals.
Alfie's grandparents said they were ""living in a nightmare"". His grandfather, Paul Scott, said hearing about the 64 referrals made him ""very angry"", adding ""it just makes me want to cry the amount of time it shows in here that Alfie didn't have to die. Every single one of them times is a time they could have stopped my grandson from dying. That's not just a number to me.""
He said that at times ""social services acted like it was our fault [with] the way that they were fighting us."" Alfie's mother, Carla Scott, was convicted of his manslaughter in June 2023, while her partner Dirk Howell, 41, was found guilty of murder.
The Worcestershire Safeguarding Children's Partnership report said a number of agency professionals were involved with the family ""over an extended period of time"" but ""were often hampered by two adults who sought to deliberately lie, mislead and cover up what was happening to this little boy"". At the time of his death, Alfie had suffered years of abuse and had more than 50 injuries on his body.
Reports revealed that Alfie was subject to a child protection plan for Neglect in 2018, and by August 2019, family and neighbours had raised the alarm about Howell's lengthy criminal history, aggressive behaviour and drug use. He was also under investigation for robbing firearms and had threatened neighbours who had raised concerns with violence and arson.
The report said: ""They said they did not want to pursue a complaint because they were worried about repercussions,"" it said, concluding ""more could have been done to support them"".
Alfie's grandfather Mr Scott added: ""We reported Howell again and again to social services and nothing was done. Nobody joined the dots; so many chances were missed. They know they let Alfie down."" Mr Scott said family members had flagged Howell's criminal past to social workers: ""[They said] they were aware of the background and looking into it.
""We used to report bruises, we reported the little things, the niggles. We were just dismissed,"" added his wife Alaina.
At their sentencing at Coventry Crown Court, in June 2023 Howell was jailed for life with a minimum of 32 years, while Carla Scott was given 27 years with a minimum 17-year term.
Neighbours had reported seeing Alfie being forced to ""stand like a statue"" outside his house and had filmed him crying ""let me in"".
Freedom of Information requests by the BBC found that Worcestershire County Council was contacted 36 times between 2018 and 2020 and West Mercia Police were contacted 28 times by those concerned for Alfie's welfare. The report said some incidents of concern raised about physical abuse or Howell's ""harsh and cruel"" practices were followed up by a police or social worker visit but added ""too often he was described as safe and well when he had not been spoken to"".
""Over the period of this review there were many incidents of concern, they were different in nature, but all were treated in isolation from each other and were not discussed holistically in the context of joint enquiries between the police and children's services,"" it said.
Eight recommendations for agencies were made in the report. Scott was asked to supervise all contact between Alfie and Howell, but the report said there was a lack of clarity about what that meant. Just four months before Alfie's death, Howell was convicted of a physical assault on a train guard for an incident that had occurred earlier in 2020. He was sentenced to a community order and an electronic monitoring curfew, but this was never put into place.
Stephen Eccleston, the partnership's independent chair said: ""Whilst the investigation and trial were ongoing, the immediate learning from both this case and other child safeguarding practice reviews has resulted in a change of safeguarding practices and activities""
West Mercia Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Jones said an initial review into the force's involvement with the family had resulted in ""enhanced training"" for officers and staff ""to ensure they fully understand the signs of vulnerability, that they are professionally curious and don't take information on face value.""
The force referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over its involvement.
An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We are looking at the force's response to concerns about Alfie's welfare and we have so far examined a large number of documents including police logs, witness statements and relevant policies, along with body worn video."""

Mollie is one of the 22 contestants from BBC reality show The Traitors. The 21 year old from Bristol is a healthcare assistant and a stunning model who has starred in campaigns for the likes of Kurt Geiger, Tommy Hilfiger and adidas.
She is in a long-term relationship with her lucky fella Max Backwell and the loved-up pair went Instagram official back in July 2021. Just before Mollie's debut on the reality show, her chuffed chap took to the social platform to shout about his girl: ""Super proud of everything you have achieved but I think this one tops it cannot wait for tonight,"" he wrote.
The couple love to go to festivals, including Glastonbury where they've been several times and relish jetting off on holiday together. They regularly post snaps of their trips to fabulous destinations such as Italy, Greece and Lanzarote.
In fact Mollie has revealed that if she won the show prize money she'd spend it on more trips abroad and put it towards a deposit for a house. She told the BBC: ""I’d love to go travelling in the future, so I'd definitely feel more relaxed about that if I won because at my age, you kind of have to choose between getting your own place, moving out, travelling but then having nothing to come back to.
""It would be so nice to have that and go and live my dream of travelling and come back and still be secure enough to put a deposit down on a house, that would be amazing.""
But behind the fun, frolics and her beautiful smile, Mollie has endured a painful struggle with her health. When she was just 11, she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammation of the lower end of the digestive system, including the large bowel and rectum.
At times Mollie was in so much pain she could barely walk up the stairs and hospital became her ""second home"". She has described the illness as a ""vicious disease which will tear you up from the inside out"".
The cause of the painful and debilitating condition is unknown and in Mollie's case it became so severe that three years ago doctors decided they had to remove her colon.
When she was told she would need the procedure she shared her fears on Instagram, writing: ""This is a post I hoped I would never have to write. On the 30th of September, I went to the hospital for a check-up and ended up being admitted due to the severity of my symptoms. I didn't think in a million years my biggest fear was about to come true.
""I have been fighting ulcerative colitis for 8 years and last week it finally won when I had to say goodbye to my colon forever. It is a major 7-hour operation which has scared me since being diagnosed.""
However, Mollie, who was also born with some missing digits on her right hand, has embraced her stoma bag and poses for pictures with it on her social media, promoting stylish stoma-friendly underwear sets.
Mollie now wants to promote awareness of colitis and Crohn's disease, as she says that although the conditions aren't rare, many people don’t talk about it as it can be hard to open up due to the fear of embarrassment.
""All I ask is that if you have any time please educate yourself on Crohn's and colitis,"" she wrote at the time of her op. ""It affects a huge amount of people and can be very hard to explain and understand.
""It's going to take a lot of time and strength to adjust to my new life with a stoma bag. It's important to remember beauty isn't external and it's about who you are and how you view things. All our bodies are beautiful! Please share this and anything you know about IBD to spread as much awareness as possible about this vicious illness. Let's get you educated! Thank you to everyone for all the love and support. Scars make us strong.""
Back in October, Mollie even marked three years of having her stoma bag with a celebratory post. She shared a photo of herself with it on show next to a pink number 3 balloon and captioned it: ""Happy 3-year stoma-versary Sid. Thanks for giving me my life back.""

ZXUTYKLDRS_GBJ7UI1K0XETNTV,Conscription in the UK - who would be called up after military draft warning by Army chief,Tim HanlonNews Reporter,"12:51, 24 Jan 2024Updated16:15, 24 Jan 2024",20240124,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-would-conscription-uk-work-31955816,"Brits woke up on Wednesday morning to the surprising news they could  face conscription if the UK went to war – and despite Rishi Sunak eventually speaking out to quell those concerns, here is how it would work as military tensions continue to rise around the world.
The head of the British Army warned ministers today that they may need to “mobilise the nation” if war breaks out with Russia. General Sir Patrick Sanders was addressing the International Armoured Vehicles expo in Twickenham and expressed his concerns over the current situation - and the need for a change in the public’s mindset.
It comes just days after a top NATO chief said civilians must be ready for an all-out war with Russia within the next 20 years. Admiral Rob Bauer  said last week: ""It is the whole of society that will get involved whether we like it or not. That realisation, we didn't talk about that a year ago.""
The Dutch military chief said nations will need to mobilise civilians in case a global war breaks out - saying governments need to be ""war ready"". He went on: ""I'm not saying it is going wrong tomorrow. But we have to realise it's not a given that we are in peace. And that's why we have the plans.""
The UK has had conscription twice in the past during WW1 and WW2 and many countries around the world use it even in peace time and here is what would happen if it is introduced in the UK.
On Wednesday (January 24, 2023) the Prime Minister's official spokesman, asked about whether Rishi Sunak could rule out conscription in future circumstances, said: ""There is no suggestion of that. The Government has no intention to follow through with that. The British military has a proud tradition of being a voluntary force. There are no plans to change that."" The No 10 official said ""hypothetical scenarios"" about potential future conflicts were ""not helpful"".Factors in who is called up
When conscription has been used in the UK in the past it has depended on age with younger people first called up and those who are unfit through medical conditions would have exemptions. People in certain careers which were needed for the war effort were also among those who were excluded and there were also restrictions on women being called up.
The British Army today is a far cry from the armies of the First and Second World Wars. Nowadays. the sheer variety of roles within our armed forces is hard to wrap your head around. Roles on the battlefields of 2024 include infantry soldiers on the front line, special forces operators conducting more specialised missions, drone pilots flying armed munitions or running reconnaissance, vehicle technicians keeping tanks and other vehicles running and emergency physicians looking after other troops when they get injured.
There has also been a keen focus in recent years on electronic counter measures and other high-tech ways of fighting a war away from the frontlines. The British Army's 10 Signal Regiment, founded in 1908, acts in a command support role with its troopers providing everything from secure, unhackable communication lines to blocking detonation signals to improvised explosive devices.
Who were people called up?
In WW1 it quickly became clear that conscription would be needed due to a lack of voluntary recruits with Lord Kitchener’s famous “Your country needs you” poster. And in 1916 the Military Service Act was passed requiring all men aged 18 to 41 to fight and in 1918 the age limit was extended to 51. Conscription continued until 1920.
Exemptions
Exemptions were for the medically unfit, clergymen, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker. For the first half of the war from 1916-18 married men were also not conscripted.
Conscription of women
Women were not conscripted in WW1.
Conscientious objectors
Men who objected to fighting on moral grounds were also exempted, and were in most cases given civilian jobs or non-fighting roles at the front.
Who were called up?
In 1939 shortly before war began, a limited conscription of men aged between 20 and 22 was introduced but that was quickly widened to all men between 18 and 41.. And men up to the age of 60 had to take some form of national service from 1941.
Exemptions
Those medically unfit were exempted, as were others in key industries and jobs such as baking, farming, medicine, and engineering.
Conscription of women
In December 1941 Parliament passed a National Service Act which widened the scope of conscription by making all unmarried women and all childless widows between the ages of 20 and 30 liable to call-up.
Conscientious objectors
Conscientious objectors had to appear before a tribunal to argue their reasons for refusing to join-up. If their cases were not dismissed, they were granted one of several categories of exemption, and were given non-combatant jobs.
Then following WW2 healthy males aged 17 to 21 had to take part in national service which meant serving in the armed forces for 18 months and being on the reserve list for four years. This changed to two years national service following the start of the Korean war in 1950 but then it was gradually wound down from 1957 onwards and it ended completely in 1963.
Many countries around the world have conscription as part of their law and after they have completed military service then they will be a reserve who is called up in times of emergency. Russia, Netherlands, Austria, Belarus, Switzerland, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Ukraine, Sweden, Turkey, Israel and Brazil are among the 85 countries with obligatory military training.
Meanwhile, former minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News that there was a “1939 feel to the world” and that the UK was not militarily equipped to deal with what may lie ahead. He stated: ""So Patrick Sanders is saying prepare for what's coming over the horizon - there is a 1939 feel to the world right now,"" he said.
""These authoritarian states are rearming. There's a risk averseness about the West in wanting to deal with that and our  global institutions such as the United Nations aren't able to hold these errant nations to account."" But what would conscription look like if in the worrying scenario that the UK did go to war? As a comparison we can look back at the situation during WW1 and WW2 with conscription carrying on from the second conflict until the 1960s.
Currently there have been concerns expressed about the size of the British Army and a former chief of the general staff warned this week the UK risks a repeat of the 1930s unless more is invested in its armed forces. General Lord Dannatt hit out at the shrinking size of the army, which he said has fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today ""and falling fast""."
