5,6WFNRSJM30_IIYKIX0OFWCQHWP,FDA approves Florida's request to import cheaper drugs from Canada,By Brandon Livesay,5 January,20240105,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67884838,"The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Florida's request to import prescription drugs from Canada to rein in drug prices in the state.
Medicines in Canada can be nearly half the price of US counterparts and some drugs cost almost $400 a pill in Florida.
The FDA's decision could open the door for other states to follow suit.
The major policy shift overrides decades of opposition from the US pharmaceutical industry.
The industry's major lobbying group has already indicated it will try to intervene.
Florida estimates the programme, which allows the import of certain prescription drugs used to treat conditions such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and mental illness, will save state taxpayers up to $150m (Â£118m) a year.
The sky-high costs of prescription drugs have been an ongoing political issue in the US, where prices are among the highest in the world.
According to a report by the OECD group of industrialised nations, the US spends more than double the average amount spent by other member countries on prescription medicines per capita.
For example, where the UK paid approximately Â£246 ($314) per head in 2023, the US paid $1,139.
In a statement announcing the FDA's authorisation, Commissioner Robert Califf said the administration would continue to work with states and Indian tribes on these  proposals.
""These proposals must demonstrate the programmes would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" he said.
Florida's approval does come with requirements, including how the drugs are labelled and ensuring they meet FDA specifications and standards.
The state's health care administration will need to submit quarterly reports to the FDA that outlines cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
There will also be restrictions on who can access the imported drugs.
The FDA's decision comes after President Joe Biden's executive order in 2021 - which directed federal agencies to work with states on lowering costs through importation plans.
An online statement published on Thursday from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America President and CEO Stephen J Ubl said the FDA's decision was ""reckless"".
He said his organisation would consider ""all options for preventing this policy from harming patients"".
It is not known how Canada's healthcare system will react to Florida's plan, but it could stoke fears of drug shortages for its own citizens.
Canada banned the export of some prescription medicines in 2020 to prevent a shortage in the country after then-US President Donald Trump proposed a plan to import drugs from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans.

34,HJISU3AK2X_NPVZ0D4CU0BESOI,FDA approves first state request to import drugs from Canada,"By Tami Luhby, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:09 PM EST, Fri January 5, 2024",20240105,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/05/politics/florida-canada-drug-imports-fda/,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Florida’s request to import certain drugs from Canada, marking the first time a state has been authorized to buy lower-cost medications in bulk from abroad.
Florida’s plan calls for importing medications for several illnesses for residents covered by certain public programs, including Medicaid enrollees and inmates.
The historic move is the latest salvo in the long-running battle to lower drug prices, one of Americans’ biggest health care headaches and a major element of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, is also highlighting his importation proposal as he seeks to curtail drug costs.
“After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,” DeSantis said in a statement Friday. “It’s about time that the FDA put patients over politics and the interests of Floridians over Big Pharma.”
While US law allows drug importation, it never gained traction because of federal health officials’ concerns over safety and actual savings as well as fierce opposition from American drug manufacturers and Republican lawmakers.
Former President Donald Trump, however, made drug importation a centerpiece of his effort to reduce drug costs and pushed for federal approval of Florida’s proposal. In 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule establishing a path for states and certain other entities to set up drug importation programs. The next year, Biden issued an executive order directing the FDA commissioner to work with states that want to develop importation programs.
Though Biden, Trump and DeSantis are likely to take credit on the campaign trail for initiating drug importation in the US, major hurdles remain before Florida can actually start importing certain medications, and it could be a while before the state and its residents see savings. The drug industry is expected to continue its efforts to prevent the importation of drugs, and Canada has opposed the mass importation of its medications.
Florida, which filed its proposal with the FDA in 2020, initially wants to import drugs to treat chronic health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, mental illness and prostate cancer, the governor’s office said in a press release Friday.
The state would make the imported drugs available to patients at county health departments managed by the state Department of Health, inmates at state correctional facilities and certain others served by state agencies. The program would then expand to Medicaid enrollees.
Florida expects to save up to $180 million in the first year and around $183 million annually once the program is fully implemented, the state said.
“We’re creating a system with importers and vendors that we as a state will import drugs from Canada, relabel them, get them to Florida and send them out through various state programs that way,” Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration secretary, Jason Weida, told state lawmakers last month. “That guarantees safety. That guarantees cost savings.”
Seven other states, including Colorado, Maine and Texas, have passed laws that would allow them to create state drug importation programs. Some are in various stages of seeking FDA approval. New Hampshire’s application was rejected in 2022 because it did not identify a Canadian wholesaler.
Florida must meet certain FDA requirements before drugs can be imported. It must submit additional drug-specific information for the agency’s approval, ensure that the medications have been tested and comply with FDA standards, and relabel the medications consistent with FDA rules. In addition, the state must submit a quarterly report about the imported drugs, cost savings and potential safety and quality issues.
“These proposals must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,” said FDA Commissioner Robert Califf.
The state’s plan is authorized for two years from the date the FDA is notified of the first drug shipment.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, quickly issued a statement that said it is “considering all options for preventing this policy from harming patients.”
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan,” said Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, the main industry group. “Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health. Politicians need to stop getting between Americans and their health care.”
The Canadian government, which is concerned about its own drug shortages, and independent experts have questioned whether importation would do much to help lower prices in the US since Canada’s drug market is relatively small. In 2020, Canada announced measures to protect its drug supply, including banning the distribution of certain drugs outside of the country that would cause or worsen a shortage. This includes all medications eligible for bulk importation to the US, according to Health Canada, which is responsible for national health policy.
“The Government of Canada is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need and has been clear in its position: bulk importation will not provide an effective solution to the problem of high drug prices in the US,” Health Canada said in a statement Friday evening.
But others are more hopeful.
“This is a significant step in moving towards wholesale drug importation and residents of the United States accessing the same drugs at a lower cost,” said Maureen Hensley-Quinn, senior director of coverage, cost and value at the National Academy for State Health Policy, which developed drug importation model legislation that states can use.

There has been uncertainty over the relationship between China and Argentina since far-right economist Javier Milei was elected president of the Latin American nation in November. While Milei has softened his tone recently, he had campaigned on breaking ties with China, stating that its people were ""not free"" and that Argentina would no longer work with nations ""ruled by communism"".
Milei's China policy is a stark contrast to that of his centre-left predecessor Alberto Fernandez, who in 2022 signed onto Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. His attendance at the Beijing Winter Olympics that year and the belt and road forum in October were seen as signs of growing ties.

But Milei has made clear that his country's ""geopolitical alignment"" is with the United States and Israel, whose ongoing attack on Gaza has alienated much of the Global South.
Milei - whose letter to Brics leaders in December said the moment was not ""opportune"" for Argentina to join as a full member - is seemingly fulfilling his pledge to ditch Fernandez's efforts to seek closer ties with developing economies.

According to Josef Gregory Mahoney, a politics and international relations professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai, Beijing had anticipated that Argentina would join Brics, so its withdrawal was ""a source of some embarrassment"".
But he said it would be Argentina that lost out over the decision.
Argentina, which is facing a deepening economic crisis, was among six countries invited in August to join Brics - made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - to form an 11-nation bloc. Fernandez had endorsed joining the alliance as an opportunity to reach new markets.
""I wouldn't really describe Argentina's decision as a setback for Brics or China - it's a setback for Argentina,"" Mahoney said.
He added that Beijing had been eager to grow the bloc ""in ways that balance different regional interests without alienating current members"", given that some were ""less enthusiastic about expansion"".
""Given the poor state of the Argentine economy and the damage that's being done to it by Milei's economic policies, his withdrawal is a blessing in disguise for the other Brics members - they've dodged a bullet,"" Mahoney said, adding that the radical libertarian was pursuing ""shock therapy policies"" such as a move to slash the value of the Argentine peso by over 50 per cent against the US dollar.
According to Zhang Chi, associate lecturer of international relations at the University of St Andrews, Milei's decision on Brics reflects a broader concern among developing countries being pressured to choose between the US-led world order and alternative systems.
""In the short term, Argentina's decision to pivot towards the West and align with the US, despite receiving goodwill from Chinese President Xi Jinping, may lead to a decrease in diplomatic and economic engagement with China,"" Zhang said.
In November, Xi sent a congratulatory message to Milei on his election, saying he was ready to work with the new leader to ""continue the China-Argentina friendship, help the development and revitalisation of our respective countries through win-win cooperation, and promote steady and far-reaching development of China-Argentina relations"".
""In the long term, if other Latin American countries follow Argentina's lead in re-evaluating their involvement in Brics, where China plays a major role, it could potentially weaken the bloc's regional economic influence and undermine China's growing influence in Latin America,"" Zhang said.
""China has emerged as South America's foremost trading partner, wielding substantial influence through extensive foreign direct investments and lending, particularly in energy and infrastructure sectors via the belt and road,"" she said, noting that 21 South American nations had joined the initiative.
Those links have worried Washington, while for Milei it has become imperative to ""convey a more pronounced alignment with the US, particularly following his recent meetings with US officials"", according to Zhang.
""This shift signifies a deliberate departure from prior policies and a renewed emphasis on aligning with the US while taking a more assertive stance against China,"" she added.
Mahoney likened Milei's style to that of former US president Donald Trump, especially his stated goal of strengthening bilateral ties with nations without going through international organisations like Brics.
""Milei is a right-leaning populist who ran against the previous government's policies, which had pursued Brics membersship, and he also used Trump-style dog whistle tactics to demonise the Chinese government,"" said Mahoney, adding that his election victory ""surprised pundits"".
Mahoney said Milei, like Trump, used ""radical, populist messaging to appeal to deeply frustrated, polarised electorates who are fed up and willing to try something new"".
Xu Qinduo, a political analyst at the Chinese think tank Pangoal Institution, argued that had Argentina joined Brics it might have made the bloc more attractive to other Latin American countries.
""Argentina is the second-largest economy in [South America] and remains a major agricultural power, despite its chronic economic crisis,"" Xu said. ""Having it join Brics would make it more influential as a bloc of emerging economies and perhaps more representative of the Global South.""
Xu said some Latin American countries were concerned about being seen as ""anti-West"" by taking part in Brics, while others were focused on economic opportunities. Members benefit from loans from the New Development Bank established by Brics in 2014, and from more access to regional economies.
Despite rejecting Brics and attempting to ""demonstrate his loyalty to Washington"", Xu said Milei was open to developing trade and investment ties in other ways.
""There are reasons for Argentina to maintain trade ties with the Brics countries,"" Xu said. ""Brazil, China and India are among its top five trading partners.""

According to a new filing from a co-defendant in the Trump case, Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade, her alleged partner, to prosecute Trump and benefited financially from the relationship in the form of vacations the two took using funds that his law firm received for working the case.

But also embedded in the filing are invoices for the Law Offices of Nathan J. Wade. One invoice calls attention to ""Fulton County District Attorney’s Office.""
Wade billed the county for a May 23, 2022, event described as ""Travel to Athens; Conf with White House Counsel."" Wade charged $2,000 for eight hours at $250 an hour.
Several months later, Wade billed for ""Interview with DC/White House"" on Nov. 18, 2022. Wade again charged $2,000 for eight hours at $250 an hour, according to the documents.

The subject of the meetings remains unclear.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
""Fani Willis’ alleged romantic partner/special prosecutor coordinated with the White House while building the political prosecution of Donald Trump,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., posted on X in reaction to the filing Tuesday. ""All on the taxpayer dime.""
""It has become increasingly clear that the Biden White House is directing these baseless, political prosecutions against President Trump because they know they cannot beat him fair and square at the ballot box,"" MAGA Inc. spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""This latest news about Fani Willis is disturbing yet sadly unsurprising.""
Meanwhile, Fulton County records show Wade has been paid nearly $654,000 in legal fees since January 2022, an amount authorized by the district attorney, which is Willis in this case.
The revelations come as part of a motion that was filed on behalf of former Trump campaign official Michael Roman, a co-defendant in the case, in a bid to have the charges against him dismissed.
It cites ""sources close to both the special prosecutor and the district attorney"" as confirming ""they had an ongoing, personal relationship.""
The filing also calls for the entire district attorney's office, including Willis and Wade, to be disqualified from prosecuting the case.
In August, Willis charged Trump out of her investigation into his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state. Trump was charged with one count of violation of the Georgia RICO Act, three counts of criminal solicitation, six counts of criminal conspiracy, one count of filing false documents and two counts of making false statements.
Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Roman, alongside Trump, was hit with a racketeering charge as part of Willis’ case and was charged with seven felony counts last August.

94,6KYJFLPQUZ_ZAB8EYMG7GOX2ZL,Florida will soon be able to import prescription drugs from Canada. What to know,Michelle Marchante,"January 6, 2024 at 12:18 AM·6 min read",20240105,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-soon-able-import-prescription-161858549.html,"Florida is the first state to be given the OK by federal regulators to import certain prescription drugs from Canada, a move that is expected to help save taxpayers millions.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the state’s request to import medication from Canada on Friday, the deadline given by a judge in a lawsuit over the issue.
While some people already buy medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, it’s technically illegal to import them, according to the Associated Press.
With this approval, Florida will be able to import medications for its Medicaid recipients, as well as for facilities run by the Florida Department of Children and Families, people who are under the care of the Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities, patients at county health departments and inmates in the custody of the Florida Department of Corrections.
“After three long years of waiting for FDA approval, we are excited to finally have the opportunity to see this vision come to fruition and provide Floridians access to safe and affordable prescription drugs,” said Jason Weida, secretary for Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration, in a statement. “As we move forward, we will continue to work every day to find ways to lower costs for Florida’s vulnerable populations.”
The state on Friday said it estimates the program will save Florida taxpayers $183 million per year once the program is fully implemented, with plans to import medications to treat various conditions, including HIV, AIDS, mental illness, prostate cancer and urea cycle disorder. The state expects to save up to $180 million in the first year.

However, before the state can begin importing drugs from Canada, Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration will have to tell the FDA what drugs it wants to import, verify that the drugs are tested, authentic, comply with the FDA’s standards, and relabel the drugs to be consistent with FDA-approved labeling. The FDA will have to review and approve the drugs.
The state agency will also be required to submit a quarterly report to the FDA that includes information about the imported drugs, cost savings and any possible safety and quality issues. Under the authorization, Florida will be allowed to import select drugs from Canada for two years from the date the FDA is notified of the first drug shipment to be imported.
Other states have also submitted requests to the FDA to import medications from Canada. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said the agency is committed to working with states and Indian tribes who create proposals that demonstrate programs that would “result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs.”
Prescription drugs cost more in the U.S. than in other countries, in part because the U.S. doesn’t impose a limit as to how much pharmaceutical companies can charge, while other countries, like Canada, do. However, Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors, can now negotiate with drug companies on certain high-cost medications because of the Inflation Reduction Act, with negotiated prices set to go into effect in 2026.

In 2021, the U.S. Government Accountability Office did an estimate comparison of the prices for 20 brand-name drugs in the U.S. to the same drugs in Australia, Canada and France. Its analysis found that retail prices in the U.S. for these drugs were 2 to 4 times higher than in other countries. Florida says some medications cost almost $400 per pill.
While Congress passed a law allowing drug importation two decades ago, federal officials kept delaying it over safety concerns, one of the main arguments drug companies have used against it, the New York Times reported.
Then in 2020, President Donald Trump green-lit states to submit proposals to the FDA to import medications from Canada. President Joe Biden continued the push in 2021 with an executive order directing the FDA to work with states and Indian tribes to ensure that their importation programs could help reduce the cost of medication for people in the U.S., while still ensuring that the drugs were safe.
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2019 signed into law a bill that would let the state import prescription drugs from different countries, including Canada. The state first needed to get its drug importation program approved by the FDA. The state applied in 2020, and nearly two years later, sued the federal agency over its delay in reviewing its proposal. A federal judge ordered the FDA to decide on Florida’s proposal by Jan. 5.
There’s support in the U.S. to import medications from Canada. A 2019 survey by KFF, a nonprofit health research group, found that nearly 80% of respondents support buying prescription drugs imported from licensed Canadian pharmacies. However, some experts have expressed skepticism about how effective the importation of Canadian medications will be in reducing the cost of pricey, brand-name drugs.
“Pharma is smart. They know exactly how much Canada needs to buy. They’re not going to oversell to Canada knowing it can be imported into the U.S., especially for a big state like Florida,” said Emma Dean, assistant professor of health management policy at the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School.
“It’s politically popular. People like to think that they can pay Canadian prices, the practical reality is they probably won’t change most people’s prices they pay,” Dean added.
The pharmaceutical industry is also against the push to import medications from other countries. It’s warning that allowing medications from foreign countries could pose a health risk, despite the fact that the imported drugs would have to comply with FDA standards.
“Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health,” Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for pharmaceutical companies, said in a Friday statement.
Canada likely won’t make it easy, either.
In 2020, Canada prohibited companies from exporting certain medications meant for the Canadian market to other countries like the U.S. if it would cause or worsen a drug shortage in Canada. The Canadian government has also previously cast doubt on whether the U.S. push to import Canadian medication would reduce drug prices, noting that the Canadian market is smaller.
In a statement released Friday evening, the Public Health Agency of Canada said that the 2020 measure covered “all drugs that are eligible for bulk importation to the U.S., including those identified in Florida’s bulk importation plan, or any other US state’s future importation programs.”
Anne Génier, spokesperson for the agency, said the Canadian government’s priority is protecting the domestic supply of prescription drugs.
“The Government of Canada is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need and has been clear in its position: bulk importation will not provide an effective solution to the problem of high drug prices in the U.S.” she wrote."
112,92TF2MGF5Z_O0KZDMBRY4Q86XJ,California lieutenant governor ‘swatted’ after push to boot Trump from ballot,Christopher Cadelago,"January 5, 2024 at 7:50 AM·2 min read",20240105,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/california-lieutenant-governor-swatted-push-235055543.html,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the victim of a “swatting” call last weekend at her San Francisco home, authorities confirmed exclusively to POLITICO, following a series of elected officials being targeted with phony calls to police after they pushed to remove former President Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot.
The incident at Kounalakis’ Pacific Heights condominium came days after California’s No. 2 official wrote to California Secretary of State Shirley Weber urging her to exclude Trump from California’s 2024 primary. Weber did not acquiesce to Kounalakis’ request, siding with Gov. Gavin Newsom who telegraphed to fellow Democrats not to get ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court and dismissed the moves as “political distraction.”
San Francisco Police responded to Kounalakis’ home about 11:20 a.m. on Dec. 30 after receiving reports of a possible shooting. The officers arrived on the scene and determined there was no merit to the call, public information officer Eve Laokwansathitaya said Thursday.
Kounalakis and her husband, Markos, were not at home at the time, said Aleksandra Reetz, the lieutenant governor’s deputy chief of staff. Their two college-aged sons were there when police arrived, Reetz confirmed to POLITICO.
Kounalakis, a candidate for governor in 2026, is the latest politician to have an armed response arrive at her doorstep since the Colorado Supreme Court on Dec. 19 ruled that Trump was ineligible to run for president due to his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Last Friday, state police went to the home of Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows after she barred Trump from the ballot, sparking widespread condemnation from Republicans who note that he hasn’t been convicted of a crime. That incident remains under investigation, and Bellows and her staff continue to receive threatening communications, she told the Portland Press Herald.
A broad range of politicians and other public figures have been targeted by swatting calls for a variety of reasons that aren’t always tied to Trump. The pranks are designed to fool unsuspecting police into responding with force, sometimes with their arms drawn. Callers have reported fake incidents at the homes of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, and Republican Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has claimed multiple incidents, criticizing the FBI while lauding local police for their response.
Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, also a Republican, said that his Naples home was targeted while he and his wife were out on Dec. 27 and called the incident a waste of law enforcement resources “in a sick attempt to terrorize my family.”"
145,CPFNGMEVAZ_22JDP3XS7G03N8J,"Florida can import prescription drugs from Canada, US regulators say",Matthew Perrone,"January 7, 2024 at 5:09 AM·4 min read",20240106,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-import-prescription-drugs-canada-210926491.html,"WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the way for Florida's first-in-the-nation plan to import prescription drugs from Canada, a long-sought approach to accessing cheaper medications that follows decades of frustration with U.S. drug prices.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.
Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.
The White House called Friday’s action “a step in the right direction,” and encouraged more states to apply for importation.
“For too long, Americans have been forced to pay the highest prescription drug prices of any developed nation,” White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said in a statement.
But even as U.S. politicians applauded the plan, Canadian health providers said it was impractical given the supply challenges the country already faces.
“Historically, we’ve had some pretty devastating drug shortages in Canada,” Joelle Walker, spokesperson for the Canadian Pharmacists Association, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation “So the idea that they could import them from us is not really feasible.""
The policy represents a major shift in the U.S. after years of successful lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.
But the politics surrounding the issue have shifted in recent years, with both parties — including former President Donald Trump — doubling down on the import approach.
Jeff Johnson, director for AARP Florida, said he was excited about the federal decision, though he said it’s only one step of many the group would like to see to help lower prescription drug costs. He noted savings won’t be noticed by most people, but the state will save money overall.
“Unless our healthcare coverage comes through Medicaid or through some another state-run program, we probably won’t save that money on prescription drugs,” Johnson said. “If there are enough different things out there that help reduce drug prices, together they’ll make a difference.”
The FDA said Florida’s program will be authorized for two years, though imports won't begin immediately. Under federal requirements, state officials must first test the drugs to make sure they’re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.
Florida’s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
The FDA action was first reported by The New York Times.
DeSantis, who is battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, previously sued the Biden administration for allegedly delaying approval of the import program. Several other states are also awaiting federal approval.
“After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,” said DeSantis in a statement.
The FDA is likely to face legal challenges over the decision, which the pharmaceutical industry's trade organization called “a serious danger to public health.”
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan,"" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement Friday.
Many people already buy at least some of their medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, although technically it’s illegal to import them.
Work on allowing state imports began under Trump, a relentless critic of industry pricing.
Under the current regulations, states can import certain medicines through pharmacies and wholesalers. DeSantis has previously estimated taxpayers could save up to $150 million annually under the program.
The state’s proposal includes a number of drug classes, including medications for asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD; diabetes; HIV and AIDS; and mental illness.
The medications would be only for certain people, including foster children, inmates, certain elderly patients and — eventually — Medicaid recipients.
Like most developed nations, Canada sets limits on the prices drugmakers can charge if they wish to enter the market. Health officials there have suggested their country’s prescription drug market is too small to have any real impact on U.S. prices.
Until recently, the U.S. government had almost no leverage over the prices set by drugmakers. Only in 2022 did Congress pass a law allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for a small number of medications used by seniors in the Medicare program. The first such negotiations are set to take place later this year.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.
Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.
The policy change represented a seismic shift after decades of lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.
But the politics have shifted in recent years, with both parties — including former President Donald Trump — doubling down on the import approach.
The FDA said Florida’s program will be authorized for two years. Under federal requirements, state officials must test the drugs to make sure they’re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.
Florida’s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
“These proposals must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement.
Many people already buy at least some of their medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, although technically it’s illegal to import them.
Work on allowing state imports began under Trump, a relentless critic of industry pricing.
Under the current regulations, states can import certain medicines through pharmacies and wholesalers. DeSantis has previously estimated taxpayers could save up to $150 million annually under the program.
The state’s proposal includes a number of drug classes, including medications for asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD; diabetes; HIV and AIDS; and mental illness.
The medications would be only for certain people, including foster children, inmates, certain elderly patients and — eventually — Medicaid recipients.
Like most developed nations, Canada sets limits on the prices drugmakers can charge if they wish to enter the market. Health officials there previously have suggested their country’s prescription drug market is too small to have any real impact on U.S. prices.
The U.S. has long had the highest prescription drug prices in the world, with essentially no government limits on what companies can charge. Only in 2022 did Congress pass a law allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for a small number of medications used by seniors in the Medicare program. The first such negotiations are set to take place later this year.

162,EIHFXLFJR9_IPVZKIE3RS8GUSJ,FDA approves Florida's request to import cheaper drugs from Canada,Brandon Livesay - BBC News,"January 5, 2024 at 1:27 PM·2 min read",20240105,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/fda-approves-floridas-request-import-192620272.html,"The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Florida's request to import prescription drugs from Canada to rein in drug prices in the state.
Medicines in Canada can be nearly half the price of US counterparts and some drugs cost almost $400 a pill in Florida.
The FDA's decision could open the door for other states to follow suit.
The major policy shift overrides decades of opposition from the US pharmaceutical industry.
The industry's major lobbying group has already indicated it will try to intervene.
Florida estimates the programme, which allows the import of certain prescription drugs used to treat conditions such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and mental illness, will save state taxpayers up to $150m (£118m) a year.
The sky-high costs of prescription drugs have been an ongoing political issue in the US, where prices are among the highest in the world.
According to a report by the OECD group of industrialised nations, the US spends more than double the average amount spent by other member countries on prescription medicines per capita.
For example, where the UK paid approximately £246 ($314) per head in 2023, the US paid $1,139.
In a statement announcing the FDA's authorisation, Commissioner Robert Califf said the administration would continue to work with states and Indian tribes on these proposals.
""These proposals must demonstrate the programmes would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" he said.
Florida's approval does come with requirements, including how the drugs are labelled and ensuring they meet FDA specifications and standards.
US government targets lowering cost of 10 key drugs
The state's health care administration will need to submit quarterly reports to the FDA that outlines cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
There will also be restrictions on who can access the imported drugs.
The FDA's decision comes after President Joe Biden's executive order in 2021 - which directed federal agencies to work with states on lowering costs through importation plans.
An online statement published on Thursday from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America President and CEO Stephen J Ubl said the FDA's decision was ""reckless"".
He said his organisation would consider ""all options for preventing this policy from harming patients"".
It is not known how Canada's healthcare system will react to Florida's plan, but it could stoke fears of drug shortages for its own citizens.
Canada banned the export of some prescription medicines in 2020 to prevent a shortage in the country after then-US President Donald Trump proposed a plan to import drugs from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans."
282,RGW62VKCS3_6DXQR87OVWWYLZQ,"Florida can import prescription drugs from Canada, US regulators say",MATTHEW PERRONE,"Updated January 5, 2024 at 2:30 PM·4 min read",20240105,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-import-prescription-drugs-canada-153101085.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the way for Florida's first-in-the-nation plan to import prescription drugs from Canada, a long-sought approach to accessing cheaper medications that follows decades of frustration with U.S. drug prices.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.
Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.
The White House called Friday’s action “a step in the right direction,” and encouraged more states to apply for importation.
“For too long, Americans have been forced to pay the highest prescription drug prices of any developed nation,” White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said in a statement.
But even as U.S. politicians applauded the plan, Canadian health providers said it was impractical given the supply challenges the country already faces.
“Historically, we’ve had some pretty devastating drug shortages in Canada,” Joelle Walker, spokesperson for the Canadian Pharmacists Association, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation “So the idea that they could import them from us is not really feasible.""
The policy represents a major shift in the U.S. after years of successful lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.
But the politics surrounding the issue have shifted in recent years, with both parties — including former President Donald Trump — doubling down on the import approach.
Jeff Johnson, director for AARP Florida, said he was excited about the federal decision, though he said it’s only one step of many the group would like to see to help lower prescription drug costs. He noted savings won’t be noticed by most people, but the state will save money overall.
“Unless our healthcare coverage comes through Medicaid or through some another state-run program, we probably won’t save that money on prescription drugs,” Johnson said. “If there are enough different things out there that help reduce drug prices, together they’ll make a difference.”
The FDA said Florida’s program will be authorized for two years, though imports won't begin immediately. Under federal requirements, state officials must first test the drugs to make sure they’re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.
Florida’s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
The FDA action was first reported by The New York Times.
DeSantis, who is battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, previously sued the Biden administration for allegedly delaying approval of the import program. Several other states are also awaiting federal approval.
“After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,” said DeSantis in a statement.
The FDA is likely to face legal challenges over the decision, which the pharmaceutical industry's trade organization called “a serious danger to public health.”
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan,"" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement Friday.

326,VN1SEFYFU8_4WPUO6SR83GNZCN,Florida lawmakers return to Tallahassee with lighter agenda as DeSantis focuses on Iowa,"Ana Ceballos, Lawrence Mower, Romy Ellenbogen","January 7, 2024 at 6:30 PM·8 min read",20240107,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-lawmakers-return-tallahassee-lighter-103000828.html,"On his political ascent, Gov. Ron DeSantis has used Florida’s annual legislative session as rocket fuel, pushing an aggressive agenda in recent years that has rewired state institutions with right-wing orthodoxy, punished critics and enthused conservatives around the country.
But with lawmakers set to reconvene in the Florida Capitol on Tuesday, and DeSantis’ fading presidential ambitions hinging on contests playing out this month more than 1,000 miles away, the two-term governor is returning to Tallahassee this week to what could be his most tamped-down legislative session yet.
While things could change quickly, more than a dozen lawmakers and consultants interviewed by the Herald/Times say they’re expecting a less explosive session than in recent years, when the GOP-controlled Legislature approved restrictions on transgender care, a six-week abortion ban, limits on what can be taught in public schools and an historic expansion on school choice, among other polarizing issues.
But a slower pace in Tallahassee, they say, is not an indication that DeSantis is losing influence over the legislative process as he struggles on the national stage. Like the governor, many Republicans say that after pushing Florida further to the right in recent years, they expect a sleepier session as the race for the Republican presidential nomination plays out.
“The last year was a year where I feel like we got 10 years worth of bills, and for us, that has been really fantastic,” said Sen. Jason Brodeur, R-Lake Mary. “It’s like the dog that caught the bumper. Now what do we do?”
Unlike last year, when DeSantis rolled out a slew of contentious measures that helped generate headlines in the lead-up to his presidential campaign, this year the governor has been relatively quiet on state issues.
He has asked state lawmakers to continue paying for some of his top political priorities — including another $5 million to continue his migrant flights program and $45 million to pay teachers $3,000 to undergo civics training crafted by conservative organizations. But he has pitched no major new initiatives, and his proposed spending plan for state government suggests he intends to do less in the name of “efficiency.”
On the presidential campaign trail, DeSantis is telling voters he has already fulfilled the agenda he set for his time in the governor’s office.
“I can stand here and say, I’ve delivered on 100% of what I promised I would do,” DeSantis said at a campaign event in Scott County, Iowa in late December.
Lawmakers are similarly signaling a slow-down in pace. By the deadline to file bills, senators had filed just over 800, well below the roughly 1,000 they file each year. In the House, which has three times as many lawmakers as the Senate, representatives have filed even fewer bills — just 695. Last year, they filed 919, and they regularly filed more than 2,000 bills in prior years.
In past sessions, DeSantis largely set the agenda. And for the most part, lawmakers obliged.
In the last two years alone, he has had Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate create an elections police force, restrict the teaching of race-related issues in schools and workplaces and create a program to relocate migrants to other parts of the country. Lawmakers also passed a 6-week abortion ban, allowed Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit, restricted treatment for children with gender dysphoria and gave every school-age kid vouchers or education savings accounts. They expanded restrictions on sexual orientation and gender identity discussions in K-12 schools and cracked down on Disney after the company disagreed with DeSantis.
“We’ve passed all of his priorities,” said Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, who endorsed DeSantis’ opponent, former President Donald Trump, in the primary. “I don’t know if there’s anything left from the standpoint of major policy initiatives that he’s trying to tackle.”
But even if they don’t match the breakneck pace of recent years, lawmakers still expect to be busy.
“Just like a goldfish will always grow to fill the size of the tank you put them in, our ambitions for session will always grow to fill the full 60 days,” said state Rep. Fiona McFarland, R-Sarasota.
So far, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, wants to pass legislation to create more doctors and nurses in Florida, and to “deregulate” public schools to put them on a level playing field with private schools. House Speaker Paul Renner, her counterpart in the House, has said he wants to regulate kids’ use of social media. Other lawmakers are proposing new regulations on the use of artificial intelligence, a rollback of child labor laws to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work more hours during the school week and penalties for college students who back “foreign terrorist organizations” such as Hamas.
Lawmakers are also seeking to make changes to the state’s gaming laws, prompting questions about whether new casinos could come to Miami-Dade County. And they are taking steps toward regulating kratom, a controversial substance derived from the dried leaves of a tropical Southeast Asian tree that over the past decade has been tied to hundreds of deadly overdoses.
And while there are fewer politically-charged issues this year compared to recent years, there are still some measures that could spark emotional debates in the state capitol building.
Lawmakers have proposed eliminating a statewide three-day waiting period to buy a rifle or a shotgun, a move that would undo one of the changes enacted after the Parkland high school mass shooting. DeSantis was receptive to the idea when asked about it Thursday during a CNN town hall.
“You shouldn’t have to be on a mandatory waiting period. Instant checks will do the job,” he said.
Two lawmakers are also reviving DeSantis’ wish to make it easier to sue media companies for defamation. And legislators are crafting legislation to reform regulations impacting condominium owners and associations.
Despite DeSantis’ mission-accomplished campaign message, Democrats — and many Floridians — say the state still has plenty of problems left to solve.
Homeowners insurance premiums haven’t gone down despite years of reforms. Auto insurance rates are among the highest in the country. Rent and housing costs are through the roof. State government has been beset by widespread vacancies. Florida needs to invest billions to renovate its prisons. And a growing number of condo owners are increasingly frustrated about state laws limiting their ability to hold condo and HOA boards to account.
Republicans and Democrats have filed various bills to lower premiums for some homeowners.
“Of course he’s trying to project success at the legislative level,” House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said of DeSantis. “But let’s be honest. We know what that means. What has it done for Floridians?”
“To me, it’s like he’s used the Legislature as his vanity project for his own ambition,” Driskell added.
Even Trump is needling DeSantis as the governor returns to Tallahassee, with a super PAC erecting billboards along the drive from the governor’s mansion to the state Capitol building urging DeSantis to “quit the campaign and get back to work!”
Just as the torrid pace of recent legislative sessions accompanied DeSantis’ ascendance to presidential contender, the relative placidity expected over the next two months comes as his prospects of earning the GOP’s 2024 nomination are dimming.
Virtually every national and state-level poll shows DeSantis trailing Trump — the primary contest’s clear frontrunner — by wide margins. The upcoming Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15 are widely seen as make-or-break for the governor.
But legislators and lobbyists said the mood heading into Tuesday shouldn’t be misconstrued as DeSantis losing control over Florida’s Capitol.
“If anyone thinks that he’s not going to be the same Ron DeSantis, the person who is driving the conversation both in the state of Florida and nationally, they are sorely mistaken,” said Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican who is a close ally of DeSantis.
Ingoglia acknowledged that the lead-up to this session has been quieter than in recent years. That’s partially due to DeSantis splitting his time on the presidential campaign trail and Tallahassee, and also because of the timing of this year’s session, he said.
“Let’s not forget that this is an early session in an election year, and traditionally those years do not produce the same type of spotlight legislation as a normal session,” Ingoglia said.
Brian Ballard, a lobbyist who has been involved in Florida’s legislative sessions since 1986, said it would be “foolish” to think DeSantis’ influence is dwindling.
“What is happening on the presidential side is of interest, but the fact that he’s a governor with three years left — two [legislative] sessions after this — makes him incredibly powerful,” Ballard said.
For the most part, that’s because DeSantis has strong relationships with Renner and Passidomo, the two Republicans who carry the agenda in each chamber — and who largely agree with the governor’s priorities.
“I am a big believer that in the Legislature, there’s probably 20 people that matter a lot, and of those 20 people, I think the governor’s relationship is strong,” Ballard said.
But one thing is likely to change: a small but loud group of Republicans who have publicly endorsed Trump in the presidential race are more willing to criticize DeSantis this session.
State Rep. Juan Porras, R-Miami, is one of them. He believes the governor’s influence over the Legislature could wane midway through the legislative session based on the governor’s performance on the national stage.
“I think he was seen as the shining star of our state and nobody could ever dare speak against him,” Porras said. “I think as time goes on, and some of these election results start coming in, I think you might see a lot more people start to break.”"
355,ZAYY6G6VJW_RFT9HH4Y0F1YRB1,The U.S. Is Done In Iraq,Daniel DePetris,"January 9, 2024 at 1:50 PM·5 min read",20240109,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/u-done-iraq-195024059.html,"U.S. officials ritualistically tout their respect for Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but the fact is that every U.S. president over the last 33 years has bombed Iraq in one way or another. The 1991 Gulf War occurred during George H.W. Bush's administration. Bill Clinton authorized several rounds of airstrikes against Iraqi military facilities, including a four-day bombing campaign in December 1998. George W. Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq in 2003 sucked hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops into a nearly decade-long morass. Barack Obama brought U.S. troops back to Iraq in 2014 after the Islamic State arrived at the gates of Baghdad, while Donald Trump continued the military campaign throughout his term.
President Joe Biden, too, has taken military action in Iraq during his first three years as president. Approximately 2,500 U.S. troops are stationed in several large bases across the country, ostensibly tasked with the ""enduring defeat"" of ISIS. U.S. special operators partner with their Iraqi colleagues to capture and kill ISIS leaders, planners, and facilitators. The U.S. military has also taken unilateral action against Shia militias that have lobbed attack drones and rockets toward U.S. bases on a regular basis since mid-October. On January 4, the U.S. killed Abu Taqwa, a senior commander of the Harakat Al Nujaba militia, in the heart of Baghdad.
The Iraqi government responded with fury to that airstrike in particular, blasting the U.S.-led coalition for violating the agreement governing the U.S. military's operations on Iraqi soil. Days later, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani, who a year ago insisted Baghdad still needed a U.S. military presence, pledged to form a committee to boot U.S. forces out.
The conventional wisdom in Washington, D.C. is to shudder with fright at the news. But for those who have long believed the U.S. military presence in Iraq had lost its utility, two words sum up the development: good riddance.
First, we should be clear about one thing: while ISIS is still around, its capacity to plan and execute large-scale terrorist attacks is severely degraded. ISIS no longer controls any territory in Iraq (or Syria, for that matter), which means the group has lost its ability to tax people living under its thumb. The decline in financial resources, combined with the constant targeting of ISIS commanders and the Iraqi army's growing capabilities, translates into a low pace of attacks from the group (less than 20 per month, according to the Pentagon's inspector general for the counter-ISIS mission in Iraq and Syria). Attacks that do happen are unsophisticated, against targets of opportunity, and typically take place in remote areas where the Iraqi state has long had trouble extending its writ. Whatever support base ISIS once possessed is gone, replaced instead with millions of angry Iraqis who have first-hand experience with ISIS's brutal rule and no intention of letting the organization reemerge as a viable pseudo-state actor.
Despite all this, successive U.S. administrations continue to argue that Washington's job isn't done. Before he retired as the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, Gen. Frank McKenzie predicted that U.S. forces would be in Iraq for years. The Biden administration apparently agrees with this assessment. During a bilateral security committee meeting with Iraqi defense officials last summer, the Defense Department said in a joint statement that both delegations ""reaffirmed their commitment to developing Iraq's security and defense capabilities and determination to deepen security cooperation across a full range of issues to advance our countries' shared interest in Iraq's security and sovereignty, and in the stability of the region.""
Parse the cookie-cutter language, however, and one can see just how maximalist all of these objectives really are. If the U.S. is prefacing a withdrawal from Iraq on the stability of the region, then it either doesn't really want to leave Iraq in the first place or does, but only in the most ideal of circumstances. Either way, the result is the same: a perpetual U.S. military mission with little return on investment.
If U.S. troops weren't dealing with so much risk in the meantime, perhaps advocates of a long-term U.S. military deployment in Iraq would have a halfway decent case to make. But this isn't the reality our troops are dealing with. Iranian-backed militias have attacked U.S. forces more than 115 times since October 17. Some of the militias launching these attacks are technically a part of the Iraqi state. Fortunately, fatalities have been avoided thus far. Even so, the danger is of such sufficient gravity that President Biden authorized a few rounds of precision airstrikes in retaliation. Defense Department assertions that these strikes are having a deterrent effect on these militias don't pass the laugh test for the simple reason that the drone and missile attacks keep coming. U.S. pressure on the Iraqi government to get the militias under control (CIA Director William Burns reportedly warned the Iraqi prime minister of ""harsh consequences"" if the militias couldn't be reeled in) isn't working either. That shouldn't be a surprise; the only reason Al Sudani is in the prime minister's office is because the Coordination Framework, which represents the militias' interests in the Iraqi government, supported him.
U.S. policymakers, therefore, have a choice to make. They can continue the status-quo policy, which amounts to being a willing hostage to an indefinite mission and carrying on with the delusion that any Iraqi prime minister has the power to do much of anything about the militias. Or they can finally admit that the U.S. has succeeded in doing what it set out to do—eliminating ISIS's proton-state—and extricate the U.S. military from a mess only the Iraqis have the ability to clean up.

357,ZG4CC0W4VT_WJ4SSSBWY45TBSG,US FDA to allow Florida to import cheaper drugs from Canada,Khushi Mandowara and Deena Beasley,"Updated January 6, 2024 at 6:11 AM·3 min read",20240105,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-fda-allow-florida-import-144611327.html,"By Khushi Mandowara and Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Florida on Friday won authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to directly import prescription drugs from Canada, the first state to get such approval for a strategy that could lower prices for medicines.
Drug costs in the U.S. are higher than in Canada and other countries where government-run healthcare systems negotiate prices for individual prescription drugs.
But importation faces challenges. In the past, Canada's government has opposed any U.S. plans to buy Canadian prescription drugs, citing threats to the country's drug supply or higher costs for its own citizens. The pharmaceutical industry opposes the plan and has long fought such schemes.
Drug pricing experts said it would be difficult to put into place. The U.S. population is nearly 10 times the size of Canada, said Dan Ollendorf, chief scientific officer at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.
""This is probably another area of leverage as opposed to anything that will materially make an impact,"" he said. ""Just the idea that a state could bring in drugs from Canada might help with negotiations over discounts and rebates.""
Health Canada told the New York Times importation will not solve high drug prices in the U.S., but did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
For years, supporters of importation policy have said buying drugs from another country could help lower costs in the U.S., where more than half of Americans are covered by private health plans.
The U.S. government has taken steps to start negotiating prices. Under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, the government's Medicare health program for people over 65 will be authorized to negotiate prices with drugmakers, but only for a limited number of medications, starting in 2026.
The pharmaceutical industry has said the plan will not lead to lower costs for consumers and will put the safety of the U.S. drug supply at risk.
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the industry's leading trade group, said it was deeply concerned about the plan and looking at its options.
""The importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health,"" PhRMA CEO Stephen Ubl said in an emailed statement.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020 finalized a plan allowing states to submit import proposals. President Joe Biden followed with a 2021 order for the FDA to work with states on the plans. Florida first submitted its proposal to the FDA in November of 2020.
FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said other states seeking similar approvals ""must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs.""
Florida still needs to submit drug-specific information for FDA review and approval as well as evidence that the drugs it seeks to import have been tested to comply with FDA standards, the agency said.
Florida must also submit a quarterly report that includes information about the imported drugs, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues, the FDA said.

417,H099GBH0II_FSPMF2F1I1WPI6T,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:57 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/us/texas-border-patrol-us-mexico/,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
2 children and a woman drowned in the Rio Grande, authorities say, days after Texas blocked the feds amid migrant crisis
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
What we know about the drownings of 3 Mexican migrants near Eagle Pass, Texas
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”
The Texas Military Department, meanwhile, said by the time Border Patrol agents requested access to the site Friday night, “the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site.”
“At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the US during this period,” the Texas Military Department said. “Also, at no point was TMD made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park, nor was TMD made aware of any bodies being discovered on the US side of the border regarding this situation.”
The federal-state border standoff in Texas has prompted members of a kind of group known for using demonizing rhetoric and intersecting with extremists to issue a call on social media for people to travel to Eagle Pass in protest.
The group is urging “patriots” from across the country to go to Eagle Pass “to demand that elected officials honor their oath of office to defend the border against a ‘foreign invasion,’” according to a member’s online video that employs the term far-right groups use for the border crisis.
A property owner will let the group set up tents, campers and RVs, he says.
These “patriots,” however, are misinformed about border security and immigration policy, said Texas state Rep. Eddie Morales Jr., a Democrat who represents 11 counties in West Texas, including the city of Eagle Pass. Instead, they should camp outside Congress and demand lawmakers act on immigration, he said.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives right now, if they were truly interested in solving this issue, they would fast track a border immigration and a border security bill by tomorrow,” Morales said.
Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber is monitoring the potential arrival this weekend of people from around the country and is concerned for the safety and security of the area due to the heated rhetoric on immigration, he told CNN.
Groups like this one that use “patriot” as part of their names have emerged since 2020 in an effort to get Donald Trump to form a third major political party, the Anti-Defamation League told CNN in a statement. While such groups are not inherently extremist, they engage in demonizing rhetoric, far-right policy causes and at times intersect with extremist groups and movements, it said.
A state away, Louisiana’s new Republican governor has directed state agencies to report any arrests of or funds spent on undocumented immigrants, he mandated in an executive order signed Friday.
﻿“The cost of illegal immigration in this state is falling on the shoulders of hard-working Louisianans,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement Tuesday. “This Executive Order will analyze data to determine the financial burden our citizens are being forced to carry because of those who do not follow the law.”
“Louisiana will always welcome those who legally immigrate, but taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill for individuals who break the law and skip the line.”
The heads of every executive branch in the state must provide within 120 days a report to the governor’s office detailing any use “of public funds directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of illegal aliens,” the order says.
The governor directs the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police to provide monthly reports on the number of people “charged or convicted of a criminal offense” and to note whether they are documented or undocumented, according to the order.
Law enforcement is also directed in the order to “regularly publish” to the public data regarding “arrests and convictions of illegal aliens,” their nationality, their offense, whether charged or convicted and report any “known or suspected gang affiliation” for arrested undocumented immigrants and where they were arrested.

436,03B6WPFPPS_R6SIEEMK64ZJBRZ,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","January 17, 2024 at 4:57 PM·7 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/texas-until-end-today-stop-175227331.html,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”

NASHUA, NH (NEXSTAR) – After relocating much of his campaign staff to South Carolina, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis returned briefly to New Hampshire for a town hall event in Manchester and one in Dover ahead of the primary on Tuesday.
Desantis bragged about how he led Florida out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how Florida led the rest of the country.
“If it wasn’t for us in Florida, who knows what would’ve happened in this country,” he said. “We’re the ones that dragged this country out of lockdown and made sure that we could be free.”
DeSantis told his rally-goers that he is a different candidate than his Republican rivals, former President Donald Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.
“I think the choice on Tuesday is very simple. Donald Trump is running for his issues, Nikki Haley is running for the donors issues,” DeSantis said. “I’m running for your issues, and your family’s issues, and solely to turn this country around”
DeSantis took shots at both Trump and Haley. He’s fallen far behind in the polls in New Hampshire, polling at about 6%. However, he says he isn’t worried about what the polls say.
“I can tell you I mean people when I was governor, they would try to produce polls in advance saying I want going to win re-election,” DeSantis said. “Heck, I had polls coming out right before the election saying I was up 3 or 4 points. I won by 20.”
Governor DeSantis will be flying back to South Carolina Saturday for three events in Myrtle Beach, Florence, and Lexington. It is unclear when or if he’ll return to the Granite State.

483,30KLNEAT2Q_TFP7EOIG0ERVRUQ,"Ladapo’s escalating vaccine war is a DeSantis campaign strategy, critics argue","Steven Lemongello, Caroline Catherman, Orlando Sentinel","January 13, 2024 at 9:00 PM·7 min read",20240113,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladapo-escalating-vaccine-war-desantis-130000571.html,"Florida Surgeon General Joe Ladapo’s campaign against COVID-19 vaccines has intensified in the past few weeks before Gov. Ron DeSantis’ crucial tests in the Iowa presidential caucuses and New Hampshire primary. And experts say that’s not a coincidence.
“It’s one thing for a large state’s leading health officer to be an advocate for shared values,” said Kenneth Goodman, the director of the University of Miami Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy. “It’s another to weaponize medical misinformation to trick citizens into voting for his boss.”
Ladapo called for a complete halt in the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines earlier this month. A few days later, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist” on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast.
Ladapo’s growing war against the vaccines comes in the wake of a surprise appearance with DeSantis on the presidential campaign trail in November. The New Hampshire event, dubbed a “Medical Freedom Town Hall,” was a rare move even as the lines between official and political events have been increasingly blurred by the DeSantis administration.
“It is a choice to be as public as Ladapo has been,” said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. “… It seems like an effort to kindle interest among a narrow fringe of anti-vaxxers.”
Ladapo claimed that DNA fragments used in the vaccine’s development could integrate into human DNA, resulting in various problems, including cancer. Federal leaders and others in the scientific community fired back, saying the possibility of that happening was theoretical and implausible.
Florida surgeon general calls to pause COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, citing discredited theory
Dr. Kenneth Alexander, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Nemours Children’s Health in Orlando, dismissed the allegation as recycled rhetoric from anti-vaccine circles. “These are the claims you’ve heard from anti-vax people for decades,” he said.
He emphasized that the COVID-19 vaccines are “probably the most studied vaccines in history,” with over a billion doses administered.
“I would argue that the U.S. has the best post-marketing surveillance of vaccines in the world. We’re not seeing any of this stuff,” he said.
DeSantis, who appointed Ladapo in late 2021, shifted from a governor who traveled the length of the state to promote the COVID-19 vaccines earlier that year to one who later called for a grand jury to investigate “wrongdoing” by their creators.
His eventual turn against what he calls “the jab” came after he gained national attention for his stance against most COVID restrictions, despite his shutdown of the state in May 2020 that closed bars and limited capacity at restaurants through the summer.
But the same “Free State of Florida” pandemic-era rhetoric that propelled him to prominence has since faded as an issue in the Republican presidential primary.
DeSantis, Trump seek to rewrite history on COVID response
DeSantis trails former President Donald Trump by huge margins in most state polls and is battling former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for second place in Iowa and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for third in New Hampshire.
“There probably is a narrow market for that,” Koger said of anti-vaccine sentiment. “He’s campaigning for small slices of the Republican electorate in both states, and in Iowa he needs to appeal to people who want to get up out of their homes on a cold January night and go to a high school gym for a couple hours.
“And anti-vax people might fit that description. … He can use every additional voter he can get.”
Dave Peterson, a political scientist at Iowa State University, said Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, a key DeSantis endorser, “was very, very similar to DeSantis on COVID, and part of her popularity in the party was her COVID policy. So maybe he is trying to remind them of that.”
But, he added, “at some point, a lot of folks have moved on from that. If that is a campaign strategy, it’s a surprise to me at least. I don’t think it would be a very effective one.”
DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin did not respond to a request for comment on whether Ladapo was doing the campaign’s bidding.
In New Hampshire, the “Live Free or Die” state, the Republican Party has a reputation for being individualistic and libertarian-leaning. But even there, said Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, COVID is not a major issue.
“There is some of that kind of anti-vaccine sentiment up here,” Scala said. “But what I’ve been more struck by is how COVID has really declined in relevance for Republican voters in this cycle. … It’s certainly not any sort of magic rocket fuel. It just doesn’t matter.”
Ladapo’s campaign appearance in New Hampshire in November was part of the campaign’s repeated attempts to attack Trump, whose administration launched the vaccine initiative called Operation Warp Speed.
While Ladapo told the crowd he had “nothing against Mr. Trump,” according to CNN, DeSantis used the event to slam Trump’s pandemic record and vowed to radically reform the nation’s health agencies.
One group backing DeSantis even used artificial intelligence to create a fake image of Trump hugging his White House health adviser Anthony Fauci, a hated figure on the right.
“I think DeSantis was hoping he would be able to kind of connect Trump to Fauci and that would pay dividends, but I just don’t see it,” Scala said. “Part of that is, no one’s figured out how to make something stick to Trump.”
In New Hampshire, Ladapo claimed to be surprised to find himself on the campaign trail.
“On the spectrum of ‘where do you want to spend your time and your energy and your life,’ politics was about as far away as you can imagine for me,” he said, according to CNN.
But Ladapo has been at the center of a political firestorm over mRNA vaccines for years. His statements this month were just the latest in a series of recommendations criticized by some experts as contributing to vaccine hesitancy without adequate evidence.
Previously, Ladapo advised against COVID-19 vaccines for healthy kids, then men ages 18-39, and later recommended against them for those under 65, culminating in this month’s call to end their use entirely. All these recommendations contradicted guidelines from the CDC and FDA, prompting leaders of those agencies to publicly rebuke him.
While Ladapo has conducted analyses of vaccine safety data through the Florida Department of Health, which he says support his positions, others in the medical community have criticized these studies.
“I think they’re poorly done. They’ve been unpublished. And they’ve been misuses of databases,” Alexander said. “We’re doing bad research, and publishing bad guidance that contradicts what public health experts around the world are saying.”
In a prior interview with the Sentinel, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf questioned the quality of an October 2022 report from the Florida Department of Health on the risk of cardiac-related death post-vaccine, stating it “lacked the quality of analysis needed to draw a conclusion.”
Public records from FDOH obtained by the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel showed that Ladapo removed analyses from the paper, pre-publication, that would have weakened the association between vaccination and cardiac-related death.
Ladapo said that was a normal part of the revision process, but others in the health research field previously told the Orlando Sentinel and Sun Sentinel his revisions took out necessary context and constituted scientific fraud.
Joseph Ladapo says anti-vaccine crusade was God’s plan. It cost him his peers’ trust
Several instances where Ladapo cited peer-reviewed, published studies by other researchers to support his recommendations against the COVID vaccine were also met with rebuttals.
Researchers accused him of misrepresenting their conclusions, with one scientist accusing him of “cherry-picking” sentences from her paper to support his argument in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times.
In his appearance on Bannon’s show, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist of all products. … It’s just complete disrespect to the human genome and the importance of protecting it and preserving it. And that is our connection to God.”
In the end, if Ladapo’s latest attacks on COVID vaccines were partly a continuation of his insertion into the DeSantis campaign, it would probably be for naught, Scala said.
“DeSantis’ campaign in New Hampshire is one long painful example of inability to move the needle,” Scala said. “This is just one more example.”"
506,4P5DNZVJC6_4HL946AC7YUMR4L,North Korea launches suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile that can reach distant US bases,HYUNG-JIN KIM,"Updated January 14, 2024 at 11:29 PM·4 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-061018218.html,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Sunday, South Korea’s military said, two months after the North claimed to have tested engines for a new harder-to-detect missile capable of striking distant U.S. targets in the region.
The launch was the North’s first this year. Experts say North Korea could ramp up its provocative missile tests as a way to influence the results of South Korea’s parliamentary elections in April and the U.S. presidential election in November.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it detected the launch of a ballistic missile of an intermediate-range class from the North’s capital region on Sunday afternoon. It said the missile flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launch a provocation that poses a serious threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea’s military will maintain its readiness to overwhelmingly respond to any provocations by North Korea.
The South Korean assessment suggests North Korea could have launched a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, whose solid-fuel engine the North said it had tested in mid-November.
The missile is mainly designed to hit U.S. military bases in the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which is about 3,400 kilometers (2,110 miles) from Pyongyang, the North’s capital. With a range adjustment, the missile can also be used to attack closer targets — the U.S. military installations in Japan’s Okinawa island, according to Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul.
Built-in solid propellants make missile launches harder to detect than liquid-fueled missiles, which must be fueled before launch and cannot last long. North Korea has a growing arsenal of solid-fuel short-range missiles targeting South Korea, but its existing Hwasong-12 intermediate-range missile is powered by liquid-fuel engines.
Japan’s Defense Ministry said its analysis showed the missile traveled at least 500 kilometers (300 miles) at the maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (30 miles), data that suggest North Korea may have fired a short-range and not an intermediate-range missile.
Japan and South Korea said they closely exchanged information about the launch with the United States, but they didn’t immediately explain the discrepancy in data.
In a trilateral call later Sunday, senior diplomats from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan condemned the North Korean launch and stressed that a North Korean provocation would lead to the three countries strengthening their security cooperation, according to South Korea’s Foreign Ministry.
The last time North Korea performed a missile launch was Dec. 18, when it test-fired its Hwasong-18 solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile, the North’s most advanced weapon. The Hwasong-18 is the country’s only known solid-fuel ICBM and it’s designed to strike the mainland U.S.
On Jan. 5, North Korea fired a barrage of artillery shells near the disputed western sea boundary with South Korea, prompting South Korea to conduct similar firing exercises in the same area. The site is where the navies of the two Koreas have fought three bloody sea battles since 1999, and attacks blamed on North Korea killed 50 South Koreans in 2010.
In recent days, North Korea has also been escalating its warlike, inflammatory rhetoric against its foes ahead of an election year in South Korea and the U.S. Last week, leader Kim Jong Un called South Korea “our principal enemy” and threatened to  annihilate it if provoked.
Experts say Kim likely wants to see South Korean liberals win the election in a blow to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line on the North. They say Kim also wants former U.S. President Donald Trump to be elected again because he may believe he could win U.S. concessions if Trump returns to the White House.
Kim has been pushing hard to enlarge his nuclear and missile arsenals since his high-stakes diplomacy with Trump broke down in 2019. In recent months, North Korea has also been expanding its military and other cooperation with Russia.
The U.S. government said it has evidence that missiles provided by North Korea to Russia had been used in the war in Ukraine. In a joint statement last week, the U.S., South Korea and their partners said the missile transfer supports Russia’s war of aggression and provides North Korea with valuable technical and military insights.
North Korea and Russia announced Sunday that North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will visit Russia from Monday to Wednesday at the invitation of her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.
“Pyongyang’s show of force should be of concern beyond Seoul, as its military cooperation with Moscow adds to the violence in Ukraine, and because it may be more willing to challenge the U.S. and its allies while global attention is fixed on the Middle East,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - About two-thirds of Canadians surveyed this month said American democracy cannot survive another four years of Donald Trump in the White House, and about half said the United States is on the way to becoming an authoritarian state, a poll released on Monday said.
The November U.S. election is likely to pit President Joe Biden against Trump, who is the clear frontrunner to win the Republican nomination as voting in the presidential primary race kicks off in Iowa on Monday.
Sixty-four percent of respondents in the Angus Reid Institute poll of 1,510 Canadians said they agreed with the statement: ""U.S. democracy cannot survive another four years of Donald Trump."" Twenty-eight percent disagreed.
The Jan. 6, 2021 attack on Capitol Hill by Trump supporters seeking to block certification of Biden's 2020 election win shocked many Canadians, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly blamed Trump for inciting the mob.
Trump has vowed if elected again to punish his political enemies, and he has drawn criticism for using increasingly authoritarian language.
Three times as many Canadians say a Biden victory would be better for Canada's economy (53%) than a Trump win (18%), according to the poll which was seen exclusively by Reuters. The poll, taken between Jan. 9-11, had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points
Forty-nine percent of people said the United States is on the way to becoming an authoritarian state and 71% of Canadians say the concept that the rule of law applies equally to everyone is weakening in the United States.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment
about the poll.
""What we're seeing is people quite alarmed about the prospect of a return of Donald Trump,"" said Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid Institute.
The polling is also ""an indictment"" of ""how poorly Canadians now view the democratic institutions and the checks and balances that in the past people on both sides of the border took for granted,"" she added.
American allies around the world and financial markets are watching the election with unease given the isolationism and the protectionist trade policies of Trump's presidency. Because of their proximity and economic ties, Canadians have more at stake than most countries.
Two-thirds of Canada's 40 million people live within 100 km (62 miles) of the U.S. border, and the trade relationship with the United States is of existential importance to Canada.
Three-quarters of all exports go to the southern neighbor, and half of its imports come from the United States, including 60% of all imported fresh vegetables.
""One can make the argument that there's no country that would be more negatively affected by a Trump win than Canada,"" said Kim Nossal, a professor of political studies at Queen's University in Kingston and author of ""Canada Alone: Navigating the Post-American World"".
In his first term, Trump forced the renegotiation of the North American trade pact and clashed with Trudeau, who he once called ""very dishonest and weak"".
Trump's ""mercantilist view involves thinking of Canada and every other so-called friend of the United States as no friend at all, but just a bunch of free-riders sucking off the wealth of the United States,"" Nossal said. ""He is the ultimate protectionist.""
There is a provision in the new North American trade pact that requires it to be reviewed for renewal after six years, or during the next American president's term in 2026.

Date,"Updated January 16, 2024 at 5:40 AM·4 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-put-most-chips-iowa-103542567.html,"Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis leaves after speaking Friday at a Northside Conservatives Club Meeting in Ankeny, Iowa. The Arctic temperatures are raising concerns about turnout for the Iowa caucuses on Monday.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — One year after leading the polls for the Republican presidential nomination, Ron DeSantis is just hours away from his moment of truth.
The Florida governor, fresh off his 20-percentage-point reelection win, was beating Donald Trump both in the first-in-the-nation voting state as well as in some national polls in early 2023. Today he heads into Iowa’s caucuses looking at a potential third-place finish behind both the coup-attempting former president as well as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Which, after having spent the better part of the last few months traveling back and forth across the state, would raise the question: What’s the point of staying in the race?
“I’m sure they’ll try to find a rationale to stay in but I really don’t see what it would be,” said David Kochel, a decadeslong Republican consultant from Iowa who points out that as weak as DeSantis’ position is in Iowa polling, it’s even worse in the next states to come. “He’s so far back in New Hampshire and South Carolina I can’t imagine he’ll get any attention over those weeks.”
Mike Murphy, a fellow longtime GOP consultant, had a more blunt assessment of a DeSantis third-place finish: “Get a fork. He would be done.”
DeSantis, for his part, at campaign stops in Dubuque and Cedar Falls did not mention Saturday’s Des Moines Register final pre-caucus poll that showed Haley moving past him into second place with 20% compared to DeSantis’ 16%. Trump held a large lead with 48%, although that was three points less than the last Register poll in December.
DeSantis did tell attendees that caucus night would be “fun” because he would be able to prove the media wrong with a strong finish.
One source in the campaign apparatus backing DeSantis, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said while a third-place finish would be disappointing, there were still good reasons for him to hang in there: “The uncertainty created by Trump’s age and legal challenges means that there is a strong rationale for the only candidate with broad support in the party to stay in the race.”
That analysis, of course, does not explain why DeSantis went from ahead of Trump a year ago to 30 points behind him, dropping steadily in the polls even as his campaign and his supporting superPAC spent at least $160 million boosting him.
“I don’t understand it either,” said Marylou Erlacher, a 76-year-old retiree who came out to the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids to hear him. She said one reason is probably that Haley is a more polished and empathetic speaker. “He just doesn’t have as much charisma.”
Scott Pinter, who is 58 and runs an industrial painting business and who also came out to the Cedar Rapids visit, said DeSantis had been drawing voters who liked Trump, but then abandoned DeSantis after Trump started getting indicted last year. He said DeSantis would have been better off waiting until 2028. “If Trump wasn’t there, he’d be my guy,” Pinter said, adding that he hoped DeSantis does not do anything to alienate Trump supporters like himself. “He’s just got to be careful he doesn’t ruin it for next time.”
A few hours and 135 miles west at Haley’s final pre-caucus campaign stop in Adel, Robb Ryerse said people are overthinking DeSantis’ fall.
“He’s a terrible candidate,” the 44-year-old pastor-turned-anti-Trump activist said. “Everything from his boots to the lifts in his shoes to his smile seems fake…. He doesn’t come across as a real person.”
The bitter cold weather forecast for Monday evening during the hours of the caucuses combined with DeSantis’ monthslong effort to build a massive operation to turn out his supporters could pay off with a performance that exceeds his polling.
If not, though, even his supporters wondered what the point would be of continuing. “None,” said one backer who helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for his campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He added that even a second-place finish should persuade DeSantis to drop out. “That’s the best thing for him. Finish close enough to get out with some pride.”"

Ron DeSantis’ crucial tests in the Iowa presidential caucuses and New Hampshire primary. And experts say that’s not a coincidence.
“It’s one thing for a large state’s leading health officer to be an advocate for shared values,” said Kenneth Goodman, the director of the University of Miami Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy. “It’s another to weaponize medical misinformation to trick citizens into voting for his boss.”
Ladapo called for a complete halt in the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines earlier this month. A few days later, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist” on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast.
Ladapo’s growing war against the vaccines comes in the wake of a surprise appearance with DeSantis on the presidential campaign trail in November. The New Hampshire event, dubbed a “Medical Freedom Town Hall,” was a rare move even as the lines between official and political events have been increasingly blurred by the DeSantis administration.
“It is a choice to be as public as Ladapo has been,” said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. “… It seems like an effort to kindle interest among a narrow fringe of anti-vaxxers.”
Ladapo claimed that DNA fragments used in the vaccine’s development could integrate into human DNA, resulting in various problems, including cancer. Federal leaders and others in the scientific community fired back, saying the possibility of that happening was theoretical and implausible.
Dr. Kenneth Alexander, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Nemours Children’s Health in Orlando, dismissed the allegation as recycled rhetoric from anti-vaccine circles. “These are the claims you’ve heard from anti-vax people for decades,” he said.
He emphasized that the COVID-19 vaccines are “probably the most studied vaccines in history,” with over a billion doses administered.
“I would argue that the U.S. has the best post-marketing surveillance of vaccines in the world. We’re not seeing any of this stuff,” he said.
DeSantis, who appointed Ladapo in late 2021, shifted from a governor who traveled the length of the state to promote the COVID-19 vaccines earlier that year to one who later called for a grand jury to investigate “wrongdoing” by their creators.
His eventual turn against what he calls “the jab” came after he gained national attention for his stance against most COVID restrictions, despite his shutdown of the state in May 2020 that closed bars and limited capacity at restaurants through the summer.
But the same “Free State of Florida” pandemic-era rhetoric that propelled him to prominence has since faded as an issue in the Republican presidential primary.
DeSantis trails former President Donald Trump by huge margins in most state polls and is battling former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for second place in Iowa and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for third in New Hampshire.
“There probably is a narrow market for that,” Koger said of anti-vaccine sentiment. “He’s campaigning for small slices of the Republican electorate in both states, and in Iowa he needs to appeal to people who want to get up out of their homes on a cold January night and go to a high school gym for a couple hours.
“And anti-vax people might fit that description. … He can use every additional voter he can get.”
Dave Peterson, a political scientist at Iowa State University, said Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, a key DeSantis endorser, “was very, very similar to DeSantis on COVID, and part of her popularity in the party was her COVID policy. So maybe he is trying to remind them of that.”
But, he added, “at some point, a lot of folks have moved on from that. If that is a campaign strategy, it’s a surprise to me at least. I don’t think it would be a very effective one.”
DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin did not respond to a request for comment on whether Ladapo was doing the campaign’s bidding.
In New Hampshire, the “Live Free or Die” state, the Republican Party has a reputation for being individualistic and libertarian-leaning. But even there, said Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, COVID is not a major issue.
“There is some of that kind of anti-vaccine sentiment up here,” Scala said. “But what I’ve been more struck by is how COVID has really declined in relevance for Republican voters in this cycle. … It’s certainly not any sort of magic rocket fuel. It just doesn’t matter.”
Ladapo’s campaign appearance in New Hampshire in November was part of the campaign’s repeated attempts to attack Trump, whose administration launched the vaccine initiative called Operation Warp Speed.
While Ladapo told the crowd he had “nothing against Mr. Trump,” according to CNN, DeSantis used the event to slam Trump’s pandemic record and vowed to radically reform the nation’s health agencies.
One group backing DeSantis even used artificial intelligence to create a fake image of Trump hugging his White House health adviser Anthony Fauci, a hated figure on the right.
“I think DeSantis was hoping he would be able to kind of connect Trump to Fauci and that would pay dividends, but I just don’t see it,” Scala said. “Part of that is, no one’s figured out how to make something stick to Trump.”
In New Hampshire, Ladapo claimed to be surprised to find himself on the campaign trail.
“On the spectrum of ‘where do you want to spend your time and your energy and your life,’ politics was about as far away as you can imagine for me,” he said, according to CNN.
But Ladapo has been at the center of a political firestorm over mRNA vaccines for years. His statements this month were just the latest in a series of recommendations criticized by some experts as contributing to vaccine hesitancy without adequate evidence.
Previously, Ladapo advised against COVID-19 vaccines for healthy kids, then men ages 18-39, and later recommended against them for those under 65, culminating in this month’s call to end their use entirely. All these recommendations contradicted guidelines from the CDC and FDA, prompting leaders of those agencies to publicly rebuke him.
While Ladapo has conducted analyses of vaccine safety data through the Florida Department of Health, which he says support his positions, others in the medical community have criticized these studies.
“I think they’re poorly done. They’ve been unpublished. And they’ve been misuses of databases,” Alexander said. “We’re doing bad research, and publishing bad guidance that contradicts what public health experts around the world are saying.”
In a prior interview with the Sentinel, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf questioned the quality of an October 2022 report from the Florida Department of Health on the risk of cardiac-related death post-vaccine, stating it “lacked the quality of analysis needed to draw a conclusion.”
Public records from FDOH obtained by the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel showed that Ladapo removed analyses from the paper, pre-publication, that would have weakened the association between vaccination and cardiac-related death.
Ladapo said that was a normal part of the revision process, but others in the health research field previously told the Orlando Sentinel and Sun Sentinel his revisions took out necessary context and constituted scientific fraud.
Several instances where Ladapo cited peer-reviewed, published studies by other researchers to support his recommendations against the COVID vaccine were also met with rebuttals.
Researchers accused him of misrepresenting their conclusions, with one scientist accusing him of “cherry-picking” sentences from her paper to support his argument in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times.
In his appearance on Bannon’s show, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist of all products. … It’s just complete disrespect to the human genome and the importance of protecting it and preserving it. And that is our connection to God.”
In the end, if Ladapo’s latest attacks on COVID vaccines were partly a continuation of his insertion into the DeSantis campaign, it would probably be for naught, Scala said.
“DeSantis’ campaign in New Hampshire is one long painful example of inability to move the needle,” Scala said. “This is just one more example.”"

Rep. Schiff launched a 30-second spot in which, among other things, he touted his experience in the impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump, lowered drug costs, and helping to build affordable housing.
“This election is a choice between results and just rhetoric,” Schiff can be heard saying in the ad. “Californians deserve a senator who is going to deliver for them every day and not just talk a good game.”

Rep. Porter’s 30-second spot leans into her trademark whiteboard and new “Shake up the Senate” messaging her campaign has rolled out this week.
“Not just any whiteboard, Katie Porter’s whiteboard,” a voiceover in the ad can be heard saying. The ad highlights Porter’s progressive bona fides including her refusal to take corporate PAC money, “leading the fight to ban congressional stock trading,” and opposing earmarks.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Porter’s ad is running solely in the SF Bay Area, which some have seen as an attempt to tap into the Bay Area progressive support Rep. Barbara Lee’s campaign is banking on.
Schiff remains the front runner, according to data collected by Real Clear Polling, with Porter trailing slightly behind and Lee running close with Republican candidate Steve Garvey in the race for third place.

But now, the crisis is threatening to upend America’s support for the war in Ukraine, throwing the centerpiece of Biden’s foreign policy into jeopardy.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
After a meeting with Biden at the White House on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson insisted that the Republican-led House would not pass legislation to send aid to Ukraine unless Democrats agreed to sweeping new restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.
And even if the two sides do come to some sort of agreement, many Republicans, especially in the House, would be loath to give an election-year win to Biden on an issue that has given them a powerful line of criticism toward the White House. The issue is also at the center of the candidacy of Biden’s likely opponent this fall, former President Donald Trump.
The stalemate shows how the debate over immigration in the United States is no longer just about the border. The issue is spilling over into other parts of Biden’s agenda, taking on outsize influence as Republicans use it to block the president’s top foreign policy priorities.
“I think the vast majority of members of Congress support aid to Ukraine,” Biden told reporters on Thursday before traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina. “The question is whether or not a small minority are going to hold it up, which would be a disaster.”
Biden has characterized aid to Ukraine as a matter of American leadership on the global stage. If the United States fails to send more, he warned last month, other allies may back off their own commitments. President Vladimir Putin of Russia, he said, could reclaim momentum in the war.
But House Republicans have so far been unmoved. Johnson said this week he was focused on “national security and a humanitarian catastrophe” within U.S. borders.
Janet Napolitano, former governor of Arizona and homeland security secretary in the Obama administration, said she could not remember a time in recent decades when so much of an administration’s agenda hinged on immigration policy.
The legislation that Biden is pushing does not only include Ukraine aid. It also has money for Israel and Taiwan — and billions of dollars to bolster security along the U.S.-Mexico border, just not enough to satisfy Republican demands.
“They looked at this as an opportunity and they’ve taken it,” said Napolitano, who described the politics of immigration right now as “dire.”
“It really means the president has got to go as far as he can and to work with those across the aisle to get a package through,” she said.
Biden has said he is willing to make compromises on the border. Democratic negotiators, with the approval of the White House, have signaled that they would consider proposals making it more difficult to gain asylum in the United States.
The White House has appeared less willing to substantially restrict humanitarian parole, a program that has allowed thousands of Afghans, Ukrainians and migrants at the border to enter the United States.
While members of Congress are still debating details of that policy, it’s not clear that compromise is in the cards.
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday evening, Johnson made a point of saying he had spoken about the negotiations with Trump, who encouraged him to oppose compromising.
Biden is also facing pushback from progressives, who do not want to see restrictions on asylum.
“Republicans are holding foreign aid hostage to extract extreme immigration measures that would not solve the problem,” said Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “Many of us support aid to Ukraine, but not at the expense of these extreme immigration policies on the table.”
Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank, said the linking of aid for Ukraine to border restrictions was “unprecedented.”
“It’s hard to imagine a time previously in our nation’s history where something that is so important from a national security standpoint, that would normally unite all Americans of both political parties, is caught up in games,” Kessler said.
The White House initially portrayed the decision to pair immigration with the military funding request as an enticement, or at the very least an attempt at compromise, to win over Republicans who had been calling on Biden to get tougher on the border.
William B. Taylor Jr., who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, said there would be severe consequences both for Ukraine and the United States if the strategy ended up failing.
“I imagine that the calculation was that there’s a lot of support for these and if we put them all together we’ll have a winning strategy,” Taylor said. But if the White House cannot reach a deal, he added, it would undermine “a crucial component of U.S. foreign policy.”
“That U.S. leadership would be badly damaged if we can’t provide the assistance to the Ukrainians to allow them to stop the Russians now,” he said. “It has enormous implications.”

Rusak,"January 16, 2024 at 7:28 PM·4 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/iowa-proves-haley-desantis-won-112800175.html,"Two of the most important tasks to win in politics are to make your opponent toxic to voters and make yourself palatable to them as the alternative. If you’re facing an incumbent, it has to happen in that order.
Donald Trump’s resounding victory in Iowa on Monday night proves that no Republican challenger could pull that off. Simply put, the other candidates — chiefly Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley — would not do what it took. So, neither will win.
Trump isn’t currently in office, but as a two-time nominee, he fits the role of incumbent in the Republican primary, at least. To have any chance, DeSantis and Haley needed to bloody him and then present themselves as the best remaining choice. There are many reasons they couldn’t, but the main one is a lack of will, daring and creativity.
Neither would forcefully make the case that Trump is bad for the party and the country. They wouldn’t say that his character flaws, legal liability and narcissism make him unlikely to achieve what Republicans want from the next president. Neither would make the case that he is a consistent loser and likely to fall short again. Neither gave the vast number of Republicans a reason to oppose Trump — so they don’t.
Incredibly, they repeated the mistake of the candidates who watched Trump rise up in 2016 and roll over experienced governors and senators. Each tried to focus on becoming the last standing rival to Trump, targeting one another while Trump simply rolled to victory. As recently as last week, DeSantis and Haley spent hours on a debate stage sniping over their records in Florida and South Carolina and comments from years back, all while ignoring the double-digit margins by which both trail the frontrunner.
It was beyond useless; it was counter-productive. When you look like you’re fighting for second place, you look small. And Americans don’t want a small president.
To be fair to DeSantis, Haley and every other candidate who tried to stop Trump, it’s unclear anything would have worked. There was a time, shortly after his loss in 2020 and his disgraceful behavior leading up to the Jan. 6 riot, when it seemed impossible Republicans would stick with him. When the party did poorly in the 2022 midterms — in many cases because of weak Trump-backed candidates and swing voters’ continuing disdain for him — an aggressive push might have knocked him off the pedestal.
But DeSantis waited and others ran in different lanes. Trump played the hits, and when Democratic officials across the country began bringing absurd legal cases no one else would have faced, such as the weak charges over hush-money payments to a former lover, Republicans saw a guy they still appreciated getting rolled over.
The other thing that has helped Trump is Joe Biden’s political weakness. Republicans no longer worry that Trump, who activates Democrats like no other, can’t beat BIden. It looks like any Republican could, so why not go with the one they love best?
Iowa is but one state. Haley could surprise in New Hampshire. Or maybe a second-place win gives DeSantis new life. Perhaps something on the legal front scares Republican voters before Super Tuesday, when Texas and other large states could deliver a decisive verdict.
But DeSantis sounded oddly triumphant Monday night, as if a 30-point loss was a great victory. He said not one word to persuade voters in New Hampshire that they should, in just a week, regard the race any differently. He gave no rationale for his candidacy over the guy who just demolished him.
Haley did a little better, comparing Trump to Biden in age, complicity in the national debt and grievance politics. “America deserves better,” she said. “We deserve a president who will focus on the needs of our people, not themselves.”
She added: “Our campaign is the last, best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare.”
Iowa, though, made crystal clear what has long been frustrating and obvious: Neither DeSantis nor Trump will pull the trigger on a real effort, no matter how long a shot it might be, to actually defeat Donald Trump. So, get ready for Trump vs. Biden … again.

“High-speed internet isn’t a luxury anymore. It’s an absolute necessity,” Biden said.
The president highlighted the American Rescue plan which he says included more than $25 billion to invest in affordable high-speed internet across America.
“Our goal is to connect everyone in America to affordable, reliable high-speed internet by the year 2030,” Biden said.
The president’s remarks today focused on his so-called “Bidenomics” agenda and how his administration says it’s working to lower costs for Americans.
“We work with internet service providers to bring down prices for people struggling with their payments. It’s called Affordable Connectivity Program. It’s already helped 880,000 households in North Carolina save a total of $440 million in internet bills collected,” Biden said.
The Biden administration is committing a total of $3 billion to build out and fund internet connections in North Carolina.
Biden’s trip to Raleigh Thursday comes as his campaign sets its sights on winning over North Carolina voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The president narrowly lost the state in 2020 to former president Donald Trump.

""We are determined to sustain our support for Ukraine and we're working very closely with Congress in order to work to do that. I know our European colleagues will do the same thing,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy as they met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Biden administration has struggled to get Congress to approve a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine in the face of opposition from Republican lawmakers.
U.S. funding for Ukraine locked up in Congress
President Biden's request for the Ukraine aid, part of a $106 billion foreign aid package, has been stalled for weeks amid demands from Republicans — including many supportive of the Ukraine assistance — that it include strict new border security provisions and changes to U.S. immigration policy.
Negotiations continue, but the White House warned before Christmas that the U.S. would run out of funding to assist Ukraine by the end of 2023 if more was not approved, with Mr. Biden warning that if the funding wasn't approved, it would be the ""greatest Christmas gift"" for Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Given former President Donald Trump's bid to return to the White House with the U.S. elections in November, and his previous remarks suggesting some level of trust in Putin, Zelenskyy has been keen to stress to American politicians the importance of U.S. assistance as his country tries to fend off Russia's ongoing invasion.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan had both discussed with Zelenskyy in Davos ""the importance of continued global assistance to support Ukraine as it fights for its freedom and sovereignty"" and ""strongly reiterated the United States' enduring support for Ukraine and its territorial integrity in the face of Russia's illegal war of aggression.""
European funding for Ukraine blocked by Hungary
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday said Ukraine's allies need to guarantee stable backing for Kyiv as questions swirl over future support from not only the United States, but the European Union. ""Ukraine can prevail in this war. But we must continue to empower their resistance,"" the head of the EU's executive arm told the Davos forum. ""Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory."" EU leaders will hold a summit on Feb. 1 to try to overcome a block from Hungary on providing 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion) in financial aid to Ukraine over the next four years.
The government in Kyiv desperately needs the funds to prop up its economy and keep services working as Russia's all-out war heads toward the start of its third year. Budapest — Moscow's closest ally in the 27-nation EU — has signaled that it could agree to the aid if it is given the chance each year to veto further payments. EU officials say that if they cannot win over Hungary, the other 26 member states will look to provide cash outside the EU's budget, but this would likely be for a shorter timeframe. Despite the concerns over funding and Ukraine's failure to make a breakthrough on the battlefield, von der Leyen said Russia was still ""failing on strategic goals"" with its war. ""Russia has lost roughly half of its military capabilities. Ukraine has driven Russia out of half the territories it had captured. Ukraine has pushed back Russia's Black Sea Fleet,"" she said. ""Russia's failure is also economic. Sanctions have decoupled its economy from modern technology and innovation. It is now dependent on China.""

828,UH25S20YGS_MLB2ZTA84MW372I,UK lobbied White House to lift Houthis ban shortly after Joe Biden elected,Edward Malnick,"January 21, 2024 at 3:18 AM·3 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-lobbied-white-house-lift-191818566.html,"Britain lobbied the US to lift its ban on the Houthi rebel movement shortly after Joe Biden entered the White House, The Telegraph can disclose.
The Foreign Office joined the United Nations in pressuring Washington to lift severe penalties imposed on the Iran-backed militant group in the final months of Donald Trump’s administration.
Last week Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, announced that the US would once again designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation, after weeks of attacks on UK and US vessels in the Red Sea. The UK is considering following suit.
Writing in The Telegraph, Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, urges Rishi Sunak’s government to proscribe both the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, insisting “it cannot be business as usual for the UK’s posture towards Iran”.
A parliamentary answer delivered by Lord Ahmad, the Middle East minister, in March 2021, two months after Mr Biden entered the White House, revealed that the UK had been raising concerns that the Houthis’ designation by the US would disrupt the flow of aid to Yemen. At the time, Boris Johnson was Prime Minister and Dominic Raab was foreign secretary.
Asked on March 22 2021 what steps, if any, the UK was taking to designate the Houthi movement as a terrorist organisation, Lord Ahmad said: “We have no plans to proscribe the Houthis, but we keep the use of sanctions under review.
“We welcomed the US announcement to revoke the previous administration’s designation of the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.
“The UK had engaged closely with the US administration on this matter, sharing our concerns that designation would disrupt humanitarian operations in Yemen.”
This weekend, the Foreign Office declined to answer further questions about its approach in 2021, including who signed off the decision to press the US to drop its terror designation.
Lord Ahmad acknowledged at the time “the Houthis’ dangerous military escalation, including cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia and their renewed offensive on Marib. In addition, the UN Security Council recently adopted a UK drafted resolution sanctioning Houthi official Sultan Zabin for the use of sexual violence as a tool of war.” He added: “We must address the Houthi sense of impunity.”
Writing in this newspaper, Mr Jenrick states: “Behind the Houthis lies the hand of Iran who have spent years training and supplying them as one of their many regional proxies. Indeed, Hamas’s October 7th massacre would not have been possible without Iran, even if Tehran’s tactical involvement is currently unclear. And in the last fortnight alone the Iranian regime itself has sent a wave of violence reverberating through the region.
“Against this backdrop, it cannot be business as usual for the UK’s posture towards Iran. It’s time we took the fanatical Iranian regime at their word and treated them as the zealots they openly profess to be. Their friends the Houthis should be proscribed as a terrorist group as the American Government has now done for the second time, as should the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp, which we have been painfully slow to do.”
A government spokesman said: “The UK government, law enforcement and our international partners continue to work together to identify, deter and respond to global threats.
“Whilst the government keeps the list of proscribed organisations under review, we do not comment on whether a specific organisation is or is not being considered for proscription.”

831,UQYIIP4IL2_2W1DYBXLDJBCU3Q,Grim realization sets in over state of Ukraine war as funding fight continues in Washington,"Katie Bo Lillis, Natasha Bertrand, Haley Britzky and MJ Lee, CNN","January 19, 2024 at 1:00 PM·10 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/grim-realization-sets-over-state-050018062.html,"As President Joe Biden continues to urge top lawmakers to approve his $60 billion aid request for Ukraine, a grim realization has settled in for the administration that this is likely the last chance for any new US military funding to flow to the war-torn country before the 2024 presidential election.
Lawmakers have conveyed as much directly to the White House, a US official told CNN. And underscoring the current gridlock, Pentagon officials have not held a single meeting since last month to decide on what to send Ukraine from the Defense Department’s weapons stockpiles — because there is no money left to fund the aid packages.
Biden met with House and Senate lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday to outline what is at stake for Ukraine. At one point, the President turned to his national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to lay out specific capabilities that Ukraine would run out of in the coming months, according to a White House official familiar with the meeting, who declined to get into more detail. Another official told CNN that they specifically pointed to air defense systems and artillery ammunition as examples of key capabilities that could be depleted without US support.
Biden also warned that US personnel were on the line, saying that if the Ukraine-Russia war spills over into NATO territory, the US would have to get directly involved in the conflict.
But House Speaker Mike Johnson, who along with other House Republicans has tied additional Ukraine funding to a broader immigration deal, said afterward that continuing to fund Ukraine risked turning it into a quagmire for the US akin to its two-decade war in Afghanistan.
“We cannot spend billions of dollars without a clear strategy articulated and I told the president in the meeting today again, as I’ve been saying repeatedly, ‘Sir, you have to articulate what the strategy is. What is the endgame?’” Johnson said Wednesday night in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
At the White House on Thursday, Biden told reporters he thought the meeting went well and that he believed “the vast majority of members of Congress support aid” to Ukraine.
“The question is whether or not a small minority are going to hold it up, which would be a disaster,” Biden said.
Meanwhile, inside the White House, NATO headquarters and in Kyiv, there is a keen awareness that if Donald Trump is reelected in November, he will likely slash support for Kyiv.
“The number one reason Republicans will not come out in favor of a supplemental for Ukraine is they don’t want to offend candidate Trump and his supporters,” Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley said on CNN Max on Wednesday. “He’s already made it clear what he would do — the war would be over on his first day, which means Putin gets to keep the borders he has, if not more.”
No matter what happens in American politics this year, US and Western intelligence officials believe that Russia’s war in Ukraine is likely to go on for much longer.
Assessments vary, but virtually all of them assume that there will be at least two more years of fighting, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence — long enough to outlast Biden’s first term. Privately, some US and Western officials say there could be as many as five more years of fighting.
Administration officials and lawmakers, including some hawkish Republicans, have for that reason been eager to approve and channel the funding to Ukraine before the clock potentially runs out at the end of 2024.
“Aside from there being a desperate need, getting as much aid in before January 2025 is on the minds of a lot of folks I’ve spoken to,” said one US official. “Not only is it important that the monies get appropriated, but that they get disbursed before the election as any FY24 funds still waiting to be spent can get blocked by Trump.”
A congressional aide familiar with the discussions said that the more hawkish lawmakers, like Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, were among those pushing last fall for Congress to approve enough funding to hold Ukrainian military forces over through the 2024 election. The administration ultimately requested $60 billion, but Congress could not reach a deal before the end of last year — doing anything more in a fraught election year may now be little more than a pipedream, the aide said.
“We are out of money,” said a US military official stationed in Europe. “The administration was able to do some magic [but] we’re getting down to the last of it.”
Said one source familiar with Western intelligence, “Basically everything depends on Biden getting reelected, doesn’t it?”
Continued Western support for Ukraine is critical, US and Western officials argue, even as the battle lines have remained largely static over the last several months following a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive to retake territory seized by Russia.
Still, in the short term, US intelligence officials don’t believe a drop-off in US funding will have a major battlefield impact for Ukraine. Russia is struggling to regroup, which buys Ukraine some time, people familiar with the assessments said. But in the longer term, a lack of US aid could allow Moscow to regain momentum by ramping up its weapons supply and taking advantage of support from Iran and North Korea, one of the people said.
US officials have also considered the impact that a pullback of US support could have on other allies, particularly the message it sends about the US not having the political will to support allies and partners long term. Another concern is that Europe, which is already at the bottom of the barrel of its weapons and ammunition supplies, follows the US lead and begins to withdraw some aid.
More immediately, an end to US funding for Ukraine could limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct long-range strikes into Russian-occupied Crimea and the Black Sea —strikes that have been supported by Western weapons, including US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS.
If that pipeline were to dry up, US officials believe that Ukraine could lose its ability to conduct some of its most high-profile operations, a person familiar with US intelligence assessments told CNN. Ukraine’s strikes on Russia’s Black Sea fleet last fall, which forced Russia to withdraw many of its ships from Sevastopol in occupied Crimea, have been seen as a particularly effective use of the Western-provided long-range missiles.
Ukraine is expected to spend this year working to bolster its defense industrial base and rebuild its forces in anticipation of even more fighting in 2025, the US official said— a strategy that Russia is likely to focus on as well.
“That’s why continued Western support is so critical, as this next year will be when everything is done that will decide how 2025 and possibly beyond play out,” this person said.
Another attempt at a major counteroffensive by Ukraine, with the goal of splitting the Russian forces at the southern occupied city of Melitopol, is likely still at least two years away, said the US military official stationed in Europe, and US and Western officials do not expect either Ukraine or Russia to make major battlefield gains in 2024.
Both sides are “too exhausted in terms of troops and equipment to see huge moves in 2024,” this person said. The Ukrainians have discussed 2025 being “a more feasible option in terms of what they can generate to start another offensive,” the military official said.
Still, Russia has continued to try to force Ukraine into submission with huge barrages of missile and drone attacks targeting Kyiv and other major cities across the country, spreading Ukrainian air defenses thin. Ukraine is also struggling to recruit new troops, especially in the wake of a grueling attempted counteroffensive that cost thousands of lives.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a news conference last month that his military had proposed mobilizing an additional 450,000 to 500,000 men to join the war, but that he had not yet authorized the plan because it will cost Ukraine billions.
“The mobilization of an additional 450,000 to 500,000 people will cost Ukraine 500 billion hryvnia [$13 billion] and I would like to know where the money will come from,” Zelenskyy said. “Considering that it takes six Ukrainian working civilians paying taxes to pay the salary of one soldier, I would need to get 3 million more working people somewhere to be able to pay for the additional troops.”
This is not where the Biden administration hoped to be on the two-year anniversary of the conflict, with the possibility of a second Trump administration looming.
Administration and congressional officials began discussing last year how to channel as much aid to Ukraine as possible before January 2025, sources familiar with the talks told CNN.
“Not only is it important that the monies get appropriated, but that they get disbursed before the election, as any FY24 funds still waiting to be spent can get blocked by Trump,” the US official said.
At one point last fall, some more hawkish members of Congress privately estimated that Ukraine would need as much as $100 billion to get through 2024, the congressional aide said. The White House ultimately settled on a $61 billion request for 2024, around $7 billion more than it requested for Ukrainian military aid for 2023.
A congressional aide familiar with the discussions said that the longer negotiations over the supplemental drag on, the less likely it is to be approved.
“We’re in the middle of an intense election cycle, where taking a tough vote like this in the shadow of presidential and down-ballot elections is a nonstarter for a lot of people,” the aide said. “So for the hawks among us, frontloading is the way to sustain support through what is going to be a politically intense year on the home front.”
Meanwhile, senior US officials have been working for the last year to come up with a legal case for seizing and transferring to Ukraine the roughly $300 billion in Russian Central Bank assets held in the West, CNN previously reported. Those assets were frozen after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
The rare maneuver would require buy-in from US allies in the Group of 7 advanced economies, as well as an act of Congress to give the president the authority to seize Russian assets held in the US.  With Congress still fighting over the supplemental and how to avoid a government shutdown, it is unclear how soon that bill will come to a vote.
In the near term, Ukraine may be able to hang on, albeit in a stalemate, without US support, a Western intelligence source said. But that would still be a significant loss not only for Ukraine, but also for the US’ standing in the world, this person said.
“It shows [Russia] they were able to take territory and shows other nations they can take territory by force,” this person said. “The whole point here is to show that in today’s day and age, major powers cannot just go and take territory by force.”

(Reuters) -Contenders for the Republican presidential nomination will face off in the second contest of their nominating process on Tuesday in New Hampshire, while Democrats compete there on the same day in a battle expected to be significantly less competitive.
The New Hampshire primary comes eight days after Iowa's Republican caucuses, which former President Donald Trump dominated. His competitors will be eager to prove their candidacies are still viable despite Trump's nearly 30-percentage point victory in the Republicans' first nominating state.
Here are some key facts about the primary:
WHEN IS IT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
The New Hampshire primary will take place on Tuesday with the precise hours dependent on the voting location. Unlike in Iowa and some other states, which rely on a relatively complicated ""caucus"" system, voters in New Hampshire cast their ballots much as they would during any other vote.
On the Republican side, 22 delegates to the Republican National Convention are up for grabs and will be awarded on a proportional basis. While that is a tiny portion of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, the state has traditionally played an outsized role in the nominating process because of its early spot on the calendar.
For Democrats, 33 delegates will be sent to the Democratic National Convention from New Hampshire, but their vote won't be bound by the primary results after a dispute over the timing of the vote. That means the New Hampshire primary will serve purely as a barometer of support for the Democrats in the race.
The national Democratic Party moved its first 2024 contest to South Carolina, which is significantly more diverse than New Hampshire's nearly 90% white population, to better reflect the party. But New Hampshire state law requires it to host the first primary, and the Republican-controlled state government declined to make any legislative change to its primary date.
WHO WILL BE ON THE BALLOT?
Trump, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are all on the ballot in New Hampshire. DeSantis and Haley placed second and third in Iowa, respectively.
DeSantis, facing exceptionally tough odds in New Hampshire, has opted to spend much of the the lead-up to the state's primary in South Carolina, where the next major Republican nominating contest takes place on Feb. 24. Haley is a former South Carolina governor.
The main Democratic candidates on the ballot are U.S. Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota and self-help guru Marianne Williamson. Democratic President Joe Biden is running for reelection but will not be on the ballot because of the primary date dispute. Some of his supporters, however, have launched a write-in campaign on Biden's behalf.
WHO IS WINNING IN THE POLLS?
According to polling and analysis website 538, Trump leads the Republican field in New Hampshire with 47% of likely primary voters planning to cast a ballot for the former president. Haley is in second with nearly 34% support, and DeSantis trails in third place with about 5% support.
The Northeastern state is well-known for its relatively moderate, libertarian-minded brand of Republicanism. Moreover, the primary in New Hampshire is ""semi-open,"" meaning voters who are not registered with any party can participate, which can help candidates perceived to be centrists.
Biden is winning handily among Democrats, though the polling has been extremely inconsistent, with support for Phillips, his closest competitor, landing anywhere between the mid-single-digits and the upper 20s depending on the pollster. The fact that Biden supporters will need to write his name on the ballot adds another element of uncertainty.
WHY IS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY IMPORTANT?
On the Republican side, most political analysts agree that New Hampshire presents Trump's competitors with their best opportunity to notch a victory - or at least a close second. This is particularly true of Haley, who has gained significant momentum in the state in recent months.
If Haley fails to mount a spirited challenge to Trump, the former president could emerge as the presumptive Republican nominee to take on Biden in the November general election. If Haley does well, she will likely retain enough donors and interested voters to present a credible challenge in the subsequent weeks.
Even if Trump loses, his competitors face an uphill battle. The former president leads by roughly 30 percentage points in South Carolina. Nationally, Trump holds a 37-point lead, according to the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.
New Hampshire represents an opportunity for Biden's Democratic challengers to prove there is appetite among voters to replace the party's incumbent. Biden has dedicated most of his energy to South Carolina, which is home to his party's first fully sanctioned contest and where support from the state's Democrats helped him secure the 2020 nomination.

The 2024 election marks the start of a new Democratic Caucus process.
Unlike the Republican Party, the Iowa Democratic Party did not host an in-person presidential preference contest, opting instead for mail-in ballots listing incumbent President Joe Biden, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, Marianne Williamson, and an option for ""uncommitted.""
Requests for these cards were opened on Nov. 1, 2023, through a Google form on the party's website and by mail. The Democratic party sent out the cards on Jan. 12 but were not accepted in person at the caucuses. The presidential preference cards must be postmarked by March 5, a deadline that aligns with Super Tuesday, meaning the presidential primary starts in South Carolina.

Johnson County Democrats still gathered at 13 locations across the county to elect central committee members who will serve for two years, representing their precinct and the Democratic Party.
Johnson County Democratic Party chair Ed Cranston said the new process has made voting more inclusive not only for Johnson County Democrats but also across the state.
""What we've done this year is we made it possible for really every Democrat in the state of Iowa to request a Presidential Preference card,"" Cranston said. ""All they have to do is fill it out and mail it in, so it's much more inclusive; the delegates this year are not attached to a candidate in the past, as opposed to years in the past.""

About 50 registered Democrats arrived at Iowa City West High to participate in the reinvented festivities.
Carolyn Shultz, of Iowa City's 9th precinct, remembers attending the caucuses with her parents when she was young. She remembers her first caucus in 2004. This year's caucus is the third she has participated in as a registered voter, where she was serving as a volunteer.
She said she has mixed feelings about the new process.
""I came out as a volunteer because I felt like some of the people who volunteered might not want to because of the weather,"" Schultz said. ""I have mixed feelings about caucuses, but it sounds like it was one hell of a negotiation to figure out what to do.""
The new format was welcomed with open arms by other Democrats, noting how it eliminates competition seen at previous caucuses.

For democratic party members like Pat Bauer, the caucus is an opportunity to build unity.
""I'm a big fan of political parties fulfilling very important functions,"" Bauer said. ""It's not a spectator sport. You have to get involved. It's a great way to meet people and get involved, serve on the central committee, and go to the county convention. You'll make contacts and get to know people.""
Democrats in Johnson County are remaining hopeful of the 2024 election despite former President Trump winning the Republican Caucus,
""Biden has already beaten Trump once, and he has a lot of options under his belt with incumbency advantage,"" said Shultz.
Cranston believes local interest will help carry the Democratic party through the November election. He says the registered voters invest time to learn about pressing issues and how to best see the country forward.
Cranston said the party has prepared for the coming year.
""Johnson County has a strong turnout for Democrats. Democrats across the state really turn out to see the candidates and share Iowa issues with them,"" Cranston said. ""We really care about politics here, and we've been doing a pretty creative campaign this past year. Our view is that there is no off year.
There was no major election last year, and we used that time to do listening tours, where we're listening to swing voters, and folks that maybe are no party folks that have not voted for a Democrat and some time.""

908,0CVMX1YH0Y_I0MGA3WZXZ2V95T,Can Trump be stopped? Key questions ahead of New Hampshire after DeSantis drops out of race,By STEVE PEOPLES,_,20240121,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/trump-haley-desantis-new-hampshire-election-2024-9938e39139ec214e4b239c633c645fc5,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Donald Trump’s effort to march to the Republican presidential nomination faces perhaps its greatest challenge on Tuesday when voters in New Hampshire hold the first-in-the-nation primary.
With Ron DeSantis ending his 2024 campaign and endorsing Trump on Sunday, the primary becomes the first one-on-one matchup between Trump and Nikki Haley.
The former president enters the contest emboldened by his record-setting performance in last week’s Iowa caucuses. But New Hampshire has a more moderate political tradition and primary rules that allow unaffiliated voters to participate in the race. Trump-backed MAGA candidates have struggled here in recent years.
Haley, the former U.N. ambassador and onetime South Carolina governor, is hoping to capitalize on those vulnerabilities, especially now that she is the only major candidate left in the GOP primary aiming to defeat Trump outright. DeSantis, even before dropping out altogether, had effectively surrendered New Hampshire to focus instead on South Carolina’s Feb. 24 primary. But he did have supporters in New Hampshire who now must decide what to do.
A Haley victory would usher in a more competitive phase of a primary that Trump has so far dominated. A Trump win, however, could create a sense of inevitability that he would become the GOP nominee for the third consecutive time.
What to know about New Hampshire’s presidential primary

Don’t forget Democrats have a primary, too. President Joe Biden is not on the ballot, having made South Carolina the first formal stop on the Democratic primary calendar. But New Hampshire is sticking to tradition and hosting its own Democratic primary anyway.
Here’s what we’re watching for on Tuesday:
If Haley can’t beat him in New Hampshire, she may not be able to stop him anywhere else, even in her home state of South Carolina.
The one-on-one fight between Trump and Haley is exactly what Trump’s Republican critics have been clamoring for. Haley appears competitive and enjoys support among moderate voters and independents. She’s also earned the backing of popular New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.
Still, Trump remains the favorite.
Sensing a knock-out blow, the former president has called in his growing army of prominent supporters in recent days to help demonstrate his strength. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Trump’s former opponent, endorsed Trump at a New Hampshire rally over the weekend. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Ohio Sen. JD Vance stumped for Trump on Saturday before an appearance from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.
A significant number of New Hampshire Republicans insist they will never support Trump. And without a competitive Democratic primary in the way, many left-leaning unaffiliated voters could decide to support Haley. But that doesn’t change the fact that Republican primary elections are typically decided by Republicans, and Trump’s grip on the base appears stronger than ever.
Still, New Hampshire loves a comeback story (just ask Bill Clinton), so we wouldn’t rule anything out.
DeSantis was seen as a distant third-place finisher in New Hampshire even before ending his campaign Sunday.
The Florida governor visited the state for the first time as a major 2024 primary candidate in June. After his 30-point drubbing in Iowa, where DeSantis had committed most of his time and resources, he surrendered New Hampshire before a single vote was cast. DeSantis actually spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, which hosts its primary election in five weeks.
But dismal poll numbers don’t mean DeSantis had no support at all in New Hampshire. With him having aimed for the most conservative factions in the GOP coalition and then endorsing Trump, it’s possible his formal departure adds votes to the former president’s vote totals. Could that be the difference between Trump managing a narrow victory over Haley or garnering a clear majority that he then uses to declare the nomination a done deal before Haley gets her home-state shot at him?
Publicly and privately, Democratic leaders have repeatedly acknowledged that they fear Haley much more than Trump in a prospective general election matchup against Biden. We’re about to find out whether Republican primary voters agree.
Haley has spent months telling voters that, without Trump’s chaos and political baggage, she would be better positioned to defeat Biden in November. That argument didn’t help her much in Iowa, where she finished just behind DeSantis.
She’s betting that voters in swing-state New Hampshire will place more value on her longer-term political appeal. Sununu, New Hampshire’s popular GOP governor, has been at Haley’s side for weeks reminding voters of Trump’s dismal record in national elections ever since he entered the White House.
It’s unclear if the message has resonated.
If it doesn’t, it’ll be because Trump has effectively convinced Republican voters that he — not Haley — is the most electable general election candidate. That’s a risky bet, given his extraordinary legal problems, the attack he inspired on the U.S. Capitol and his demonstrated record of alienating suburban voters in successive elections.

Biden’s unpopularity is no doubt muddying the issue.
Still, New Hampshire voters have an opportunity to cast a strategic vote Tuesday based on the one issue that seems to matter more than all else in today’s politics: the ability to beat the other side.
The first primary of the Republican presidential contest takes place in New Hampshire on Tuesday, marking the first traditional style election of the year. (Jan. 18)
The end result may be tied most to who actually shows up to vote on Tuesday.
Iowa saw one of its lowest turnouts in recent history in last week’s caucuses. Low turnout elections typically favor the candidate with the strongest support among the party’s base. And in 2024, that’s Trump.
But Haley, with arguments about Trumpian chaos and electability, has been trying to appeal to independents and less-ideological moderate Republicans and independents.
New Hampshire law allows unaffiliated voters to participate in either party’s nomination contest. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the GOP primary, although voters had an opportunity to change their registration before an October deadline.

Haley needs a large turnout, driven by those unaffiliated voters, to have a chance.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David M. Scanlan predicted that 322,000 voters would participate in the GOP primary, which would be a record high. On the Democratic side, he’s expecting just 88,000 given there’s virtually no competition.
It may not be the headline, but New Hampshire Democrats are voting for their presidential nominee as well. As much as Biden’s team wants you to think they don’t care about the outcome, they’re paying attention.
Biden won’t be on New Hampshire ballot, of course.
He’s avoiding New Hampshire altogether after pushing the Democratic National Committee to award the nation’s opening primary to South Carolina, a much more diverse state that’s set to vote on Feb. 3. Furious about Biden’s decision, the “Live Free or Die” state ignored the president’s wishes and will host an unsanctioned Democratic primary anyway.
There are several lesser-known Democrats on the ballot, including Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and progressive activist Marianne Williamson. Eager to demonstrate Biden’s strength despite his absence, the president’s allies in the state have been encouraging voters to write in Biden’s name.
The outcome will have no bearing on the number of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination. But an underwhelming finish, even in a write-in campaign, would represent an unwanted embarrassment as Biden tries to improve his political standing heading into the fall campaign.

910,3IW9WCJ5VH_IMYYAQMDW49H8AQ,"DeSantis drops out of presidential race, leaving Trump and Haley to face off in New Hampshire","By STEVE PEOPLES, THOMAS BEAUMONT and HOLLY RAMER",_,20240121,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ron-desantis-250c8ed4b49843350e258f0c2754c8ba,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign on Sunday, ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump.
The decision leaves Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary. This is the scenario Trump’s foes in the GOP have long sought, raising the stakes for this week’s contest as the party’s last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.
But as some Trump critics cheered, DeSantis nodded toward Trump’s primary dominance — and attacked Haley — in an exit video he posted on social media.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone.
He continued: “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”

Haley spoke at a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as DeSantis announced his decision.
“He ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” she told a room packed with supporters and media. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.“
DeSantis’ decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa, marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Trump’s supremacy in the Republican Party. After months of contentious exchanges, Trump struck a more conciliatory tone late Sunday during a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, calling DeSantis a “really terrific person.”
“I also look forward to working with Ron” to win the general election, Trump said.
DeSantis entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $130 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses — which he had vowed to win — by 30 percentage points to Trump.
DeSantis’ allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.
The Florida governor notified top donors and supporters of his decision through a series of phone conversations and text messages between senior campaign officials to top donors and supporters on Sunday afternoon, according to two people who received such communications. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversations.
DeSantis had returned to Florida by then after a roller-coaster weekend that included stops in South Carolina ahead of an event in New Hampshire Sunday evening that was ultimately canceled. The campaign also canceled a series of national television appearances earlier in the day, blaming the cancelation on a miscommunication with DeSantis’ super PAC.
DeSantis was physically worn after spending weeks on the campaign with little, if any, time off, even as he stormed across frigid Iowa and New Hampshire, often without a winter coat.
He ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Trump given his popularity in the party despite the deeply personal feud between them.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,” said DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida’s governor, which ends in January 2027.
The endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for DeSantis, whom Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.
For Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staffers, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy. Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality, and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.
DeSantis’ team joined Trump in attacking Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape. Some doubt Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head matchup between Trump, would benefit from DeSantis’ decision.
“She will not be the nominee,” key DeSantis supporter Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told AP. “She will not be the president of the United States.”
Trump had already shifted his focus to Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after DeSantis’ announcement, the former president’s campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Haley to win New Hampshire.
“Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire — there are only two options,” wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.
“Option A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” they wrote. “Option B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARRASSED in her home state of South Carolina,” which votes on Feb. 24.
“Now, for some important advice,” they continued. “Choose wisely.”
Trump himself addressed DeSantis’ departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.
“We just got some word that one of our opponents, very capable person, is dropping out of the race — Ron DeSantis. And Ron is dropping out and, in doing so, he endorsed us,” Trump said to cheers, before a “Trump!” chant broke out in the room of volunteers.
Asked if he would be using the nickname “Ron DeSanctimonious”: “I said that name is officially retired,” he said to loud cheers.
At roughly the same time not far away, DeSantis’ dejected supporters gathered privately in the Manchester restaurant where he had been scheduled to speak.
Rep. James Spillane, of Deerfield, said he had initially backed Trump, switched to DeSantis and will now vote for Trump.
“I had a suspicion this morning, and I had talked to some friends of mine saying the way I was hearing things shake out, I thought this was going to happen, and I was right,” he said. “Unfortunately, DeSantis is not going to be able to make it forward. However, in the future, hopefully we can have a viable way forward in 2028.”

Asa Hutchinson endorsed Nikki Haley on Saturday, days before she tries to take on frontrunner Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primary.
Hutchinson is a conservative whose opposition to Trump became central in his longshot bid for the GOP primary before he dropped out Tuesday.
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Hutchinson said: “Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.”
Hutchinson added: “Go @NikkiHaley in New Hampshire.”
Haley’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

After finishing third in the leadoff contest in Iowa earlier this month, Haley has been looking to appeal to independent and unaffiliated voters in New Hampshire’s Jan. 23 primary to garner a strong finish and turn the race against Trump into a two-person contest.
Hutchinson dropped out after finishing sixth in the caucuses.
His backing comes a day after another of their former rivals in the GOP presidential contest, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, endorsed Trump. Another former candidate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also backed Trump.
Haley last weekend won the support of former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who had fueled speculation that he was preparing for his own third-party bid.

917,P0XRJ16NY8_GUQRE10MX85H47N,Lauren Boebert switched districts in a bid to stay in Congress. Winning over voters won’t be easy,By JESSE BEDAYN,_,20240121,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lauren-boebert-district-colorado-republican-election-58cf21682012023f1362a01932909d36,"LAST CHANCE, Colo. (AP) — Fleeing a tough reelection bid in the district where she lives, Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert is moving from the mountains to the plains, in the hopes of finding conservative pastures green enough to salvage her place in Congress.
To win, she’ll have to convince a new swath of voters that her brand of white-hot, far-right political activism — built on divisive one-liners and partisan ferocity in the U.S. House — is more needed in Washington than the home-grown Republicans she now faces in the primary.
While Boebert’s new district voted for President Donald Trump by a nearly 20 percentage point margin in 2020, more than double the margin in her old district, and some Republican voters are already admirers, others are greeting her with hands-on-hips skepticism.
“She feels she is a better candidate than the ones that we have,” said Robin Varhelman, seated behind a desk at the cattle auction she owns in Brush. “She’s gonna have to explain to people why.”
Varhelman, flanked by the massive head of a bull named Big Red she used to rope, with a cap reading “USA Trump” hanging from its right ear, said she wasn’t sure if Boebert made the switch for the good of the state or her own survival.

After Boebert eked out a victory by just 546 votes in 2022, her home district moved from Republican-leaning to a toss-up for 2024 — threatening the GOP’s already threadbare control of the U.S. House.
The narrow margin in Congress leaves both major parties fighting fiercely for every available seat in 2024. Boebert’s move to the new district, where she’ll have to take on at least nine other Republicans for her party’s nomination, probably gives the GOP a better chance to win both.
That’s part of her reason for switching, she said in a phone interview, but she gave another reason for jumping into a race that’s already considered safely Republican: “There is need for my voice in Congress.”

After attacking the Democrat who nearly upset her in 2022 as the beneficiary of outside money, Boebert has become the outsider and will have to live down the “carpetbagger” label that her new opponents are already lobbing her way.
Boebert’s abdication came after a video surfaced last year of the congresswoman vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater, which rattled even devoted supporters as she barreled toward an election rematch against Adam Frisch. The Democrat she nearly lost to in 2022 had received triple her campaign donations in this year’s race, benefiting tangibly from her disruptive profile, which grated on donors far beyond state and district borders.
“I can read the tea leaves,” Boebert said. “I don’t want the left to have a chance to buy the seat from us, and their only argument is me.”
Number crunchers, political experts and the National Republican Campaign Committee generally agree that Boebert’s exodus will give Republicans a better chance to retain that district — though newly elected NRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson said the organization had no hand in the decision.
Frisch said he’s “taking a bit of a victory lap” after Boebert’s retreat, and is plugging ahead with the same bipartisan platform, buoyed by at least $7.7 million in his campaign coffers. Frisch is expected to face Jeff Hurd — a mild-mannered conservative in the old GOP tradition, who said his goal is “making local headlines, not national headlines.”
In Boebert’s new district, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has endorsed her candidacy, and the NRCC is treating her as an incumbent. Less happy with the switch is Republican state Rep. Richard Holtorf, now one of her opponents.
“By Lauren Boebert district shopping and becoming a carpetbagger so she can keep her office in D.C., she has now become part of the swamp,” he said.
Whether Boebert will join the ranks of American politicians who have relocated and won remains unclear.
That road is littered with many who “could never quite convince voters that they were in this for something other than their own ambition,” said Christopher Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, who wrote a book on American politicians who’ve picked up and moved races.
Boebert does have some things working in her favor — she’s not leaving Colorado, she’s a known conservative gladiator on national issues such as immigration and reducing the national debt, and she’s a dedicated acolyte for Trump, whose popularity among rural Republicans remains high.
Rancher Dawn Whitney, who attended one of Varhelman’s recent auctions, said Boebert’s flag-bearing for conservative, Christian and agrarian values is already enough to earn her vote.
“Ranchers and farmers are pretty much the same everywhere,” said Whitney, her calloused hands busy at a word search puzzle as the auctioneer chanted.
“As long as she is country related, I think she’ll be fine,” said Whitney, who cited a well-worn reason voters cling to Boebert: Rural residents often feel their political power slipping and see an outspoken champion in Boebert.
“She don’t back down,” she said.
Still, Boebert is joining a race that is practically guaranteed to elect a Republican anyway, said Galdieri. In effect, that means she’s pushing aside “homegrown options” to run in a safer district.
“Voters notice that,” he said.
While some voters — even if they chafed at Boebert’s style — weren’t as miffed that she changed districts, the June Republican primary is where her opponents can do the most damage. Along with Holtorf, she’ll face Mike Lynch, minority leader in Colorado’s House of Representatives.
“I was a fan of Lauren Boebert when she first got there,” he said. “And then I think, for lack of a better term, she drank the Kool-Aid and became what she was fighting.”
Boebert’s retort is unwavering.
“If there’s anyone who takes on the swamp, it’s me,” she said. “I’m the only candidate in this race who’s actually done the work.”
Nodding to part of the challenge ahead, she added, “I’m excited to meet people and learn more about the nitty gritty local issues.”
While a segment of the new district’s voters is in a more urban center south of Denver, the region stretches across Colorado’s prairie east of the Rocky Mountains — where some folks’ great-grandparents ate dinner beneath tablecloths during the Dust Bowl. A half-century ago, grandparents wrestled their calves out of blistering winter chills, just as their descendants were doing this week, and as their own children will do as long as things hold steady.
Though Boebert might be escaping tough electoral odds, voters in the new district hold tight to the traditional values borne from that history — the same values that Boebert stepped on in the groping episode at a musical production of “Beetlejuice” in Denver.
That embarrassment was memorable enough to transcend district lines.
“I don’t really care either way what she does, but she’s definitely got to get some sh— together, getting thrown out of a theater,” said Mark Moorman, a Republican who bid at auction on a bull the size and weight of a small car.
Before she switched districts, Boebert had apologized up and down Colorado’s 3rd district as part of her last-ditch strategy against Frisch. She’d undertaken a local press tour and grassroots boot camps geared to emphasize her work on local issues.
Now, on new turf, “that’s totally out the window,” said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics in Denver. “She’s the national politics candidate. That is her weakness; that is her strength. She kind of has no choice.”
It’s the difference between Republican voter Debbie Spear — “She’s going to have the same target on her back wherever she goes, here, there, Texas. We don’t need that, what is she going to bring more than the candidates we have?” — and the passerby at a ranching store nearby, who shouted out: “The girl from Rifle? Hell, yeah.” ___

933,M6JSQIS91F_31SOXP78Y4GAFAP,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis drops out of the presidential race, endorses Trump",By Jeongyoon Han,"Published January 21, 2024 at 2:18 PM CST",20240121,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-21/florida-gov-ron-desantis-drops-out-of-the-presidential-race-endorses-trump,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 3:38 PM ET
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose hardline right-wing policies in his state garnered much public attention and made him an early favorite for the 2024 presidential race, suspended his bid for the Republican nomination on Sunday in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
DeSantis also endorsed former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a more favorable outcome — more campaign stops, more interviews — I would do it,"" he said. ""But I can't ask our volunteers to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.""
DeSantis then proceeded to urge voters to support Trump, arguing that he is ""superior"" to President Biden.
""He [Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form or warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
DeSantis' exit from the Republican presidential nomination field creates a path for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the only conservative alternative to Trump's candidacy left in the race. Trump and Haley will square off in the New Hampshire GOP primary on Tuesday.
At an event of her own in New Hampshire on Sunday, Haley announced the news of DeSantis' decision to cheering supporters.
""He ran a great race,"" she said. ""He's been a good governor and we wish him well.""
But Haley quickly pivoted the focus back to the race on Tuesday. ""It's now one fella and one lady left,"" she said, referring to the race between herself and Trump for the GOP nomination. ""All the fellas are out except for this one, and this comes down to what do you want.""
DeSantis came in second place in the Iowa GOP caucuses, according to results from The Associated Press, garnering 21.2% of votes, behind Trump, who won 51.0% of the vote. Haley placed third, at 19.1%.
There have been real questions about DeSantis' campaign after his distant second-place finish in Iowa. He pledged to continue and focus on South Carolina, but his campaign and super PAC supporting him, which had spent tens of millions supporting him, has spent nothing on campaign ads since Iowa.

DeSantis' main campaign message was that he would be better at delivering the same kinds of policies that Trump would be in favor of, because he doesn't have the same baggage that Trump carries from his numerous indictments and federal charges. He vowed to rid the country of ""wokeism,"" a term he often used to criticize liberal policies, win the presidency by a wide margin, and deliver on issues that Republicans care about — much like how he says he has in Florida.
""Donald Trump is running for his issues, Nikki Haley is running for her donors' issues, I'm running for your issues, your family's issues, and solely to turn this country around,"" DeSantis said in a video posted shortly before the Iowa caucuses began on Jan. 15. ""I'm the only one that's beaten the left on issue, after issue, after issue.""
DeSantis was elected to Congress in 2012, to represent Florida's 6th Congressional District, and came to national focus in recent years — namely, for how he's governed Florida. He became a favorite among conservatives for his policies in the state, ranging from attacks on gender-affirming care, to banning diversity and equity initiatives in public colleges, resisting public health measures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sending migrants who had crossed the border illegally to progressive states.
While DeSantis tried to carry his conservative record as governor into his presidential campaign, there were two things standing in his way: Trump, whose broad support among conservatives across the country remains unmatched; and DeSantis himself.
From the start, the DeSantis campaign was plagued with complications and personnel issues. DeSantis announced his campaign on a livestream with Elon Musk on X, formerly known as Twitter, only for the event to be riddled with embarrassing technical malfunctions.
More recently, a watchdog group filed a legal complaint about the structure of the Florida governor's super PAC, which had already gone through a series of leadership resignations. A top strategist in the super PAC also resigned following a Washington Post piece that detailed the PAC's internal troubles.
DeSantis looked to establish strong momentum in the early contests in the nation, campaigning in all of Iowa's 99 counties. He picked up the endorsement of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical Christian leader Bob Vander Plaats, who had a record of endorsing past candidates who went on to win the Iowa GOP caucuses.
But after the caucuses in the Hawkeye state concluded, DeSantis split his focus between the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, and the upcoming contest in South Carolina.
Toward the end of his campaign, DeSantis began to throw harder jabs at Trump himself. During a visit to New Hampshire in December, DeSantis said he thought Trump wouldn't accept the results of the contests.
""If Trump loses, he will say it's stolen no matter what, absolutely,"" he told reporters. ""He will try to delegitimize the results.""

She has previously avoided lashing out at the former president, but Mr Trump's attacks have become more personal as his commanding lead in the polls has grown.
Mr Trump is leading with 50% of likely Republican voters in the state, with Nikki Haley trailing far behind.
On Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisdropped out of the race altogether.
With his campaign faltering, Mr DeSantis admitted he had no path to victory - setting up a two-horse race in New Hampshire. And he endorsed Mr Trump.
In last week's Iowa caucus, Mr Trump dominated Ms Haley and Ron DeSantis.
But even with that decisive win and a clear lead in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Mr Trump has gone on the attack against Ms Haley.
His criticisms appear to have convinced her to turn up the heat on the former president.
Mr Trump went after his former UN ambassador at a campaign rally over the weekend, but he seemed to confuse her for another political foe - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - when speaking about the Capitol riot.
On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Ms Haley seized on the slip up and struck back at the former president, saying that his ""mental stability will probably continue to decline"".
""No matter what it is, chaos follows,"" she added. ""In some cases he [Mr Trump] causes it. In some cases he doesn't... he's like a magnet to it. What happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired.""

Watch: Trump's big win in Iowa, and the battle for second
The former UN ambassador also blasted her onetime boss as soft on undemocratic leaders, alleging he did not hold Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and China's Xi Jinping accountable.
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Ms Haley said on CBS. ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
Characterising Mr Trump as a mayhem and temper-fueled candidate appears to be a new counter deployed by Ms Haley. It comes after he has ramped up personal insults on her in recent days.
On Friday, for example, Mr Trump took to social media to refer to Ms Haley as ""Nimbra"", a misspelling of her birth name Nimarata, and to baselessly suggest she was ineligible to serve as president or vice president in the US.
The jab against the US-born Ms Haley - whose parents emigrated to the US from India in the 1960s - was reminiscent of the false birther attacks Mr Trump deployed against former President Barack Obama.
Ms Haley responded to the baseless claim by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Mr Trump is ""clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums"".
Her decision to fight back against Mr Trump - something she has been loath to do on the campaign trail - may have come too late in this primary, however.
While Ms Haley appeared to have some momentum a few weeks ago, polls released before Mr DeSantis quit showed Mr Trump dominating ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Trump led with 55% support among likely Republican voters, compared to 36% for Ms Haley and just 6% for Mr DeSantis.
A separate poll, from CNN, had Mr Trump with 50% support, compared to 39% for Ms Haley and 6% for Mr DeSantis.
The former president's lead has prompted Haley campaign officials and political allies to temper and downplay expectations for New Hampshire after previously expressing optimism.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who has campaigned for Ms Haley, told NBC News that she ""doesn't have to win"" in his home state. He claimed that any momentum from this week's race offers an ""amazing opportunity to turn this around"".
Additionally, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney repeatedly declined to offer a prediction during an on-the-record briefing with Bloomberg News, telling reporters only that Ms Haley needs ""incremental progress"".
""I know everyone wants us to put a number on it,"" she said. ""We have never done that. We never will.""
Mr Trump's campaign has also received a boost from the endorsements of two former opponents for the Republican nomination, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.
Ms Haley also received an endorsement from a former rival, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who never earned much support and ended his bid for the Republican nomination last week.
""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years,"" he said in a post on X. ""Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.""
Still, Ms Ankney said that ""beating Donald Trump is not easy"" and appeared to push for a longer view of the campaign.
""He is a juggernaut,"" she said of Trump. ""But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress until we are the last man, or woman, standing against him.""

Watch: Highs and lows of Ron DeSantis's presidential bid
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Donald Trump.
He quit ahead of the Republican primary election in New Hampshire, where he was polling in the single digits.
Mr DeSantis was once considered a strong contender for the party's nomination - but on Sunday he said he did not ""have a clear path to victory"".
Nikki Haley, Mr Trump's last remaining challenger, said she was the ""only one"" able to beat US President Joe Biden.
Ms Haley will go head-to-head with Mr Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the second in a series of state-by-state contests to pick a Republican nominee for the November general election.
In a nearly five-minute long video on X, formerly Twitter, released on Sunday afternoon, Mr DeSantis said his campaign had ""left it all out on the field"".
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favourable outcome - more campaign stops, more interviews - I would do it,"" he added, as he ended his seven-month campaign.
The Florida governor said he was endorsing Mr Trump, who is the clear frontrunner after winning the first contest in Iowa with 51% of the vote. Mr DeSantis said it had become clear that a majority of Republican voters ""want to give Donald Trump another chance"".
He acknowledged ""disagreements"" with the former president, but said Mr Trump was ""superior"" to Mr Biden, who is almost certain to be the Democratic nominee in November's general election.
""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge,"" Mr DeSantis said.
There were loud cheers when Mr Trump made his first comments about Mr DeSantis's withdrawal and endorsement to a room in New Hampshire full of supporters on Sunday afternoon.
Later, addressing an audience at a rally, Mr Trump described his former opponent as a ""really terrific person"", adding: ""He ran a really good campaign, it's not easy.""
Mr DeSantis had presented himself as the Republican candidate who could deliver Mr Trump's populist agenda without the drama or baggage.
But one of the speakers at the event, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, referred to him as ""diet Trump"". And several supporters of Mr Trump told the BBC they liked the Florida governor but felt this was not the right time for him.
Lynne Mason, 60, said she thought Mr DeSantis's campaign was ""a little weak"" and she had ""expected more from him"". Mr Trump, she added, was the ""only person at this time who can save this country"".
BethAnne Tatro, another local backing Mr Trump, agreed. ""I think that President Trump has proven, from being in office previously, that he can do this again and get things back on track.""
After Mr DeSantis' announcement, the Trump campaign called on all Republicans to rally behind Mr Trump, slamming his former UN Ambassador as ""the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement"".
Mr DeSantis also took a swipe at Ms Haley, calling her a member of ""the old Republican guard of yesteryear - a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism"".
Ms Haley, a former South Carolina governor, responded by insisting she was the conservative candidate - the ""only one"" - who could beat Mr Biden.
""There's two people in this race,"" she told CNN in New Hampshire. ""That's what we wanted all along, and we're going to keep going.""
Mr DeSantis narrowly finished ahead of Ms Haley in last week's Iowa caucuses with 21% of the vote, compared to her 19%, both well behind Mr Trump.
At the time, Mr DeSantis framed the second-place finish as a victory, but it was a major disappointment after he had spent the bulk of his time and resources courting its conservative evangelical voters.
His departure from the race allows Mr DeSantis to avoid an embarrassing potential third-place finish in New Hampshire to Ms Haley, who has focused far more of her resources in the state.
But a person familiar with Mr DeSantis' election night plans in New Hampshire was completely caught off guard by the news of his exit.
The source told the BBC the campaign had just confirmed plans with them on Saturday for their election night celebration this coming Tuesday.
Chris Ager, the state committee chair of New Hampshire's Republican Party, told the BBC that ""the race has been moving toward a one-vs-one between Trump and Haley for a while"".
""This makes it so,"" he added.

Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley has questioned rival candidate Donald Trump's mental fitness after he appeared to confuse her with former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a campaign speech on Friday.
Like many in his party, Trump has blamed Pelosi for the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, arguing she deliberately left the building under-protected despite his offer to deploy the National Guard for enhanced security.
The presidential frontrunner ""mentioned me multiple times in that scenario,"" Haley told supporters at a campaign event in Keene, New Hampshire, on Saturday. ""They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he's talking about Nancy Pelosi.""
""The concern I have is - I'm not saying anything derogatory - but when you're dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this,"" she explained.
Trump ""made a pretty apparent gaffe last night,"" Haley's campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, agreed during a Bloomberg News event on Saturday, referring to the former president's apparent confusion of one of his chief Democratic nemeses with the woman he appointed to serve as ambassador to the United Nations.
Speaking at Friday's rally, Trump accused his political enemies of having ""destroyed all of the information"" from January 6 ""because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security."" He insisted that ""we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard, whatever they want. They turned it down.""
Trump has previously claimed he warned Pelosi about the huge crowds poised to descend on Washington DC to protest the certification of then-president-elect Joe Biden's victory. The ""Stop the Steal"" protest turned violent after police clashed with demonstrators, leaving four people dead.
At 77, Trump is just a few years younger than his chief rival, incumbent leader Biden. He insisted on Saturday that he had ""aced"" a recent cognitive test, while his senior campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, downplayed the Haley/Pelosi mix-up, calling it a ""distinction without a difference - it's Nikki and Nancy"" in comments to reporters.
Trump handily won the Iowa caucuses earlier this month and continues to dominate the party's nominating contest with a double-digit lead in most polls. Haley, however, has seen her poll numbers surge with support from Republican power brokers who don't want to see Trump return to the White House, elevating her to second place ahead of New Hampshire's Tuesday primary vote.
The former South Carolina governor has called for ""mental competency tests"" for aging politicians in a dig at both Trump and Biden. The latter's own abundance of incoherent ""gaffes"" have senior Democrats concerned about his chances of winning - and surviving - a second term.

Russia blames Ukraine for the attack in Tekstilshchik. Ukraine has not commented on the event and the Russian claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press.
Russia-appointed head Denis Pushilin said that the area had been hit by 155 mm caliber and 152 mm caliber artillery, and that the shells had been fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west. He also confirmed that emergency services continued to work at the scene.
Reuters news agency photographs and video taken at the scene showed crying people, some of whom said they had lost their relatives, and bodies lying on blood-soaked snow in the area.
In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry called the attack 'a barbaric act of terrorism' committed by Ukraine, adding it was carried out 'with the use of weapons supplied by the West.'
Russia also condemned the attack as ""a treacherous act against the civilian population,"" saying, ""These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means.""
During its almost two-year invasion of Ukraine, Russian airstrikes and heavy shelling on the sovereign nation have killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine's east and south that Russia claimed to have annexed in late 2022 in a move condemned as illegal by most countries in the U.N. General Assembly. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.
Drone attack - massive fire
Outside St. Petersburg, Russia, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at the Ust-Luga port after two explosions there, which according to local media, were caused by Ukrainian drone attacks, causing a gas tank to explode.

Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek, 165 kilometers (102.53 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, said, in a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, that the fire was the result of an ""external influence"" and that the blaze had paused operations at the port.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of Russia's Kingisepp district where the port is based, said in a statement that there were no casualties, but that the area had been placed on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg Sunday morning, but that they were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. The Associated Press could not independently verify the reports.
The Russian Ministry of Defense did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. The ministry said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia's Smolensk region, and that two more had been shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed that a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
Ground war stalemate
Russian forces also seized the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
Ukrainian forces confirmed the report but called the capture of the village a ""temporary phenomenon.""
The fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces along the roughly 1,500-kilometer front line has remained static throughout the winter.
Zelenskyy-Trump
Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed concern over the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House and said he considers the former U.S. president's claims that he could stop Ukraine's war with Russia in 24 hours ""very dangerous.""
FILE - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with international media in Riga, Latvia, Jan. 11, 2024.
In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News that aired Friday, Zelenskyy invited the former president and front runner for the Republican presidential nomination to visit Kyiv, provided Trump delivers on his promise in a way that can satisfy Ukraine.
""Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come,"" Zelenskyy said.
The Ukrainian leader voiced concern over a potential Trump presidency, in which Trump's idea of a negotiated peace in Ukraine might involve Ukraine making major concessions to Russia.
Trump has repeatedly stated that he is well-positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for almost two years, saying he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
Throughout his political career, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Zaporizhzhia power plant - mines
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi warned Saturday that mines had been replanted around the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, just months after a team of international inspectors reported the area had been cleared of mines.
IAEA Denied Access to Parts of Russia-Controlled Ukraine Power Plant
In a statement on the agency's website, Grossi cautioned that mines in the plant's buffer zone, between its internal and external fences, go against the agency's safety standards.
The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Petro Kotin of Energoatom, called the alleged re-planting of mines ""another crime"" by Russian forces who have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early weeks of the war.
The IAEA has repeatedly expressed concern the war could cause a potential radiation leak from the facility, which is one of world's 10 biggest nuclear power stations.

The tally also includes 760 casualties from the past day.
Russia has also lost a number of vehicles and equipment in the fight, according to the report, including 11,466 armored fighting vehicles, 11,862 vehicles and fuel tanks, and 6,181 tanks. Russia has not commented on the latest numbers.
Dozens were killed or injured Sunday in shelling on a market on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk in Russian-occupied Ukraine.
Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-installed mayor of Tekstilshchik, said the shelling came from Ukraine.
Elsewhere Sunday, a fire erupted at Novatek, a Russian liquefied gas producer on the Baltic Sea. No casualties have been reported.
The cause of the fire was not immediately clear, but drones were reported to have been detected in the area.

""[Trump] is going to make decisions on his own, without ... I'm not even talking about Russia, but without both sides, without us,' Zelenskyy said. ""If he says this publicly, that's a little scary. I've seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that's really making me a bit stressed.""
Trump has repeatedly stated that he is well-positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for almost two years, saying he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
Throughout his political career, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
During a campaign rally in Georgia just days after Russian tanks moved into Ukraine, Trump described Putin as a ""smart"" political player and expressed admiration for Russia's swift takeover of a vast, ""great piece of land' at the cost of what he suggested were relatively minor sanctions.

In a Telegram update Saturday, Kotin said the situation at the plant ""will remain fragile and dangerous as long as the Russians remain there.""
The IAEA has repeatedly expressed concern the war could cause a potential radiation leak from the facility, which is one of world's 10 biggest nuclear power stations.
The plant's six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.
Russia has been in control of the site since 2022 and is refusing to allow IAEA experts access to some areas of the plant.
'Such access is needed to monitor nuclear safety and security,' the IAEA statement said.
Russia's crackdown
Russian lawmakers have prepared a bill allowing for the confiscation of money and property from people who spread 'deliberately false information' about the country's armed forces, a senior member of parliament said Saturday.
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the measure would also apply to those found guilty of what he described as other forms of betrayal such as 'discrediting' the armed forces, calling for sanctions against Russia or inciting extremist activity.
'Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, who betrays it, must face deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country, at the cost of their own property,' Volodin wrote on Telegram.
Meanwhile, at the election headquarters of President Vladimir Putin, the wife of a Russian soldier delivered an emotional appeal Saturday for her husband's return from the front, a defiant gesture in a country where open criticism of the war is banned.
'Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has issued a decree that my husband has to be there [in Ukraine.] I'm interested to know when he will issue a decree that my husband has to be home,' Maria Andreyeva said as campaign workers looked on.
Andreyeva became involved in a heated exchange with a woman who told her that Russian soldiers in Ukraine were defending the motherland, and she should pray for them.
'So, what's next? The Ministry of Defense has spent its money, now we need to squeeze everything out of our guys, get the last life out of them? So that they come back to us just as stumps?' Andreyeva questioned.
'Will they give me the stump? What will I get back? A man without legs, without arms, a sick man? Don't you know what's happening there?"" she asked.

Polls show that Trump holds a commanding lead over all other Republican candidates, while no major Democratic figure is challenging Biden for his party's nomination.
However, questions about Trump's legal difficulties and both candidates' ages lurk in the background. Trump faces 91 felony charges, with at least one criminal trial expected this year. And health issues could affect either Trump, 77, or Biden, 81.
What would happen should either of them be forced to drop out of the race because of health, legal or other reasons? The answer depends on when such a scenario occurs.
Between January 15 and party conventions
States hold caucuses and primary elections between January 15 and June 4, 2024. The two candidates who win the most delegates will officially become their parties' nominees during the conventions. The Republican National Convention will be July 15-18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Democratic National Convention will take place August 19-22 in Chicago, Illinois.
Both Trump and Biden are expected to be nominated by their respective parties. But should one drop out between the start of the caucus-primary season and his party's convention, some states may extend candidate filing deadlines and primary dates to allow more people into the race, depending on when it occurs.
Such extensions are more likely to happen with Democrats, as Biden has no significant competitor. His challengers, Representative Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson, lack name recognition and already do not qualify to be on the ballots of several states.
""They would want there to be a semblance of the primaries,"" said John C. Fortier, a research fellow focusing on elections and continuity of government at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It would be very short notice, but they would get to go before the people,"" he told VOA.
Even with processes in place, there may not be time to change the names on the ballots, and primary voters may end up seeing the name of a deceased or incapacitated candidate when they vote. With early voting allowed by some states, a candidate who dropped out might already have collected votes.
In that instance, states may enact emergency changes in laws to allow delegates to switch their votes to a new candidate during the convention. To win at the nomination, a Republican candidate needs at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates, and a Democratic candidate needs 1,969 out of 3,936.
""It may not be someone who is currently in the race,"" said Michael Thorning, director of structural democracy at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. ""It might be someone that the convention determines is the best standard bearer for the party and the person most likely to win in the general election,"" he told VOA.
Between conventions and Election Day
Each party has its own set of rules should its candidate drop out during this period, but in essence it would replace the candidate's name on the presidential ballot. Emergency changes to some state laws may be required.
""There is a technical process where not the whole convention but a smaller group of people who lead the party, people who are really not known to Americans, can make that decision to put someone else as the nominee,"" Fortier said. He added that the parties would likely need to make an appeal to the American people and explain to them why the new candidate has legitimacy.
While Vice President Kamala Harris could be asked to be the top of the Democratic ticket, for example, it's not required by law.
""The running-mate status at that point does not confer any guarantee that they would accede to the presidency,"" Thorning said.
Again, there may not be time to replace the name of the former candidate on the ballots, and that candidate may already have votes because of early polling.
Between Election Day and Electoral College meeting
After questions or challenges about election results are settled, electors in each state will meet on December 17 to select the president-elect and vice president-elect.
Should Trump or Biden die or become incapacitated during this time, his vice president-elect would not automatically be the replacement, as provisions of the presidential line of succession law do not yet apply.
The replacement process during this period is essentially the same: Electors of the president-elect would vote for a new candidate. There is no federal guidance on the process, and some states have their own rules on how electors vote.
The vice president-elect would be a logical choice but not one guaranteed by law.
If the electors cannot agree on a new president-elect, under the 12th Amendment, the House of Representatives would elect the president, and the Senate would elect the vice president, in a procedure known as ""contingent election.""
Until Congress appoints a new president-elect, under the 20th Amendment, the vice president-elect becomes acting president.
Between Electoral College meeting and congressional certification
It's not clear what would happen if a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated between the December 17 meeting of electors and the January 6 counting and certification of electoral votes in Congress.
Between congressional certification and Inauguration Day
According to the 20th Amendment, the vice president-elect would be inaugurated as president on January 20, 2025, if the president-elect dies or is incapacitated after Congress certifies the election result.
In each period, there is the potential for a legal and political crisis, particularly if the election result is contested as it was in 2020. With Democrats holding a slim majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House of Representatives, figuring out who will become the next president could become an extremely messy process that drags on in the courts.
And as the country witnessed during the siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, it could again turn bloody."

Also Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced on X, formerly Twitter, that he was ending his Republican presidential campaign ahead of the primary, failing to meet expectations that he would emerge as a serious challenger to Trump.
A new CNN poll Sunday showed Trump with 50% of the prospective New Hampshire vote, easily topping the 39% figure for Nikki Haley, his one-time ambassador to the United Nations, and 6% for DeSantis. The survey results were in line with recent polling in the state by other news organizations.
Trump won last week's caucuses in the reliably Republican midwestern farm state of Iowa, collecting more than 50% of the vote, easily doubling the vote for both DeSantis and Haley, who also is a former governor from the southern state of South Carolina.
Trump and Haley traded barbs throughout the weekend, while DeSantis visited South Carolina and made a return trip to New Hampshire before ending his run for the White House.
The South Carolina party primary is more than a month away. But Trump attempted this weekend to diminish Haley's standing in her home state. An array of South Carolina officials who endorsed Trump traveled to New Hampshire, more than 1,300 kilometers (about 807.8 miles) away, to speak on his behalf.
""To the people of New Hampshire,"" Trump told supporters at a rally, ""All you need to know about Nikki Haley is that every globalist, liberal, Biden supporter and 'Never Trumper' is on her side - and virtually every single leader ... in her home state of South Carolina is on our side. We have almost everybody.""
Republican presidential candidate former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks during a campaign event in Derry, New Hampshire, Jan. 21, 2024.
Trump has also suggested that somehow Haley, who was born in the United States to Indian immigrants, is not American enough. He has repeatedly referred to her on his Truth Social media platform as ""Nimbra,"" an apparent intentional misspelling of her birth name, Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. When she married Michael Haley 26 years ago, she adopted his surname and has used it professionally since then.
Trump is trying the reclaim the White House after losing his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, with polls showing both are favored to win their parties' nomination for a rematch that many U.S. voters say they do not want but one that appears inevitable.
Haley has claimed that at 77, Trump's mental acuity is declining, and contended that neither he nor the 81-year-old Biden should lead the country.
In a speech over the weekend, Trump blamed Haley by name four times for the lack of security at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when 2,000 Trump supporters stormed into the building to try to halt congressional certification of Biden's victory.
Trump never corrected himself but apparently was referring to another political nemesis, former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Haley has never served in Congress and says she was in South Carolina at the time of the riot at the Capitol.
""If you look recently, there have been multiple things: I mean, he claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I'm assuming he meant World War III,"" Haley said. ""He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I'm the one that kept security from the Capitol on January 6. I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6.""
""Don't be surprised if you have someone that's 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline,"" Haley said Sunday. ""That's just human nature.""
Haley claimed that Trump is ""just not at the same level he was at 2016,"" when he won the presidency. ""I think we're seeing some of that decline."""

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis shut down his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Sunday, endorsing the party's frontrunner, former US president Donald Trump, just two days before residents of New Hampshire were scheduled to vote in the country's second primary.
DeSantis announced his exit from the race in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter), accompanying the footage with a quote from former UK prime minister Winston Churchill that left the door open to another run: ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.""
Acknowledging there was no ""clear path to victory"" following his second-place finish in Iowa, where he lost to Trump by some 30 points, DeSantis reasoned that Trump was a better choice for commander-in-chief than incumbent President Joe Biden - or the next Republican runner-up, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis explained, insisting, ""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome -more campaign stops, more interviews - I would do it.""
The Florida governor is term-limited, meaning he will be leaving the statehouse in January 2027 - just in time for another run at the Oval Office.
Former biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also endorsed Trump after suspending his own presidential campaign earlier this month, having finished fourth with 8% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.
Trump has not revealed his choice of running mate for 2024, and some X users speculated that DeSantis was angling for the job by minimizing his differences with the reality TV star turned politician while attacking his strongest Republican competitor Haley, whose platform he described as ""warmed-over corporatism.""
The Republican frontrunner's eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., had put DeSantis - along with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and one-time Republican candidate Ben Carson - forward as a potential vice presidential pick last week. The elder Trump did not explicitly rule out the possibility when asked about it last year.

The port will provide China with a direct gateway to the region and its valuable resources, including soy, corn, and copper.
Majority-owned by Chinese state-owned company Cosco Shipping, the port will be the first controlled by China in South America. It will also be able to accommodate the largest cargo ships that can travel directly to Asia, cutting the journey time by as much as two weeks.
In an interview with Reuters, Juan Mathews Salazar, trade minister of Peru, said, ""The Chancay mega port aims to turn Peru into a strategic commercial and port hub between South America and Asia.""
The new port is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has enabled Beijing to win new economic allies and gain leverage in political forums, finance, and technology.
Full construction of the port began in 2018 at Chancay, some 50 miles north of Lima, and its first phase is set to be completed in November 2024.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is expected to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru that month, could inaugurate the mega port.
Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager for Cosco Shipping, which holds a 60 percent stake in the port, said, ""It is part of China's new Silk Road.""
The remaining 40 percent stake in the port is owned by the local mine company Volcan.
The project would accelerate regional development, said Jose Adriano da Silva, a farming entrepreneur from Brazil's western Acre state who visited the port.
Clemente Baena Soares, Ambassador of Brazil to Peru, who also visited Chancay in September, said, ""It is an opportunity for grain and meat production, especially from Rondonia, Acre, Mato Grosso and Amazonas, to go to Asia through the port of Chancay.""
""Brazilian businesses are delighted with the possibility of not using the Panama Canal to take their goods to Asia,"" he added.
China surpassed the U.S. on trade in South and Central America under former President Donald Trump, and under President Joe Biden, the gap has widened despite attempts to reverse it."

Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has countered claims that his possible reelection to the White House poses an existential risk to the American way of life, telling supporters in the US state of New Hampshire on Saturday that it is Joe Biden's 'incompetence' that represents the real threat to democracy.
Trump was speaking in Manchester ahead of primary elections beginning on Tuesday that could further cement his status as the likely GOP candidate to challenge presumptive Democratic nominee Biden in November.
But after being accused earlier this month by Biden of being ""willing to sacrifice democracy,"" the former US president turned the tables on his political rival, saying that Biden's incapacity for the job is a clear and present danger to the United States.
""He is a threat to democracy,"" Trump said, his comments delivered under a giant sign reading: 'Biden attacks democracy.' He added: ""We have to get him out. You know why he is a threat to democracy? A couple of reasons, but you know the first reason? He's grossly incompetent.""
It is an accusation that Trump has repeated on several occasions throughout his bid to return to the White House. In October, he blamed the Hamas attack on Israel on a ""deadly combination"" of Biden's ""incompetence, radicalism, and weakness.""
Trump, who faces 91 charges in a range of criminal cases as he campaigns for the nation's highest office, also accused Biden's administration of ""weaponizing"" the justice system against him. He added that Biden's efforts to do so are being enabled by his ""protectors"" in the ""fake news"" media.
The comments appeared to be a reference to claims made by Biden in Pennsylvania earlier this month in which he said that Trump intends to uproot democracy to ensure he wins the election.
""Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is what the 2024 election is all about,"" Biden said on January 5. ""Donald Trump's campaign is all about him, not America, not you. Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power.""
Meanwhile, GOP-nomination candidate Nikki Haley, whom polling suggests trails Trump by around ten percentage points in New Hampshire, openly questioned her Republican opponent's mental fitness, following comments in recent days in which Trump appeared to mistake her for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
""When you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do it,"" Haley said on Saturday.

Once a nation built on the foundation of meritocracy, where the most qualified people - regardless of race, creed or gender - rise to the top, America is now satisfied to fill positions based on quotas.
US identity politics has been coming under heavy scrutiny of late, following a highly publicized scandal involving three female presidents of leading US universities - Dr Claudine Gay of Harvard, Liz Magill of UPenn, and Dr Sally Kornbluth of MIT. The issue at hand was their refusal to say, amid the hostilities between Hamas and Israel, that calling for genocide on their campuses violated college rules and encouraged harassment.
Following their testimony before Congress, the presidents quickly fell under the laser focus of the internet and it was Harvard's Claudine Gay, the first non-white person to serve as president of the private university, who attracted the most criticism. And not without cause. It was discovered that Gay had plagiarized dozens of passages in her dissertation work, a serious offense that put the spotlight on DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) hires and on whether Gay had been awarded her lofty position not due to her academic credentials but rather due to the color of her skin, and to her sex.
Only weeks after a lengthy debate on whether Gay was qualified to preside over America's most prestigious university did she tender her resignation - although returning to her position as a member of the faculty while keeping her whopping $900,000 yearly salary.
This is certainly not an isolated case of DEI thrusting questionable candidates into top jobs, especially as many states now legally mandate the controversial policy. One need only consider the second most powerful position in the US government, the vice presidency, to see where America is heading in a handbasket. It's not an inside secret that Kamala Harris was a diversity hire; Joe Biden admitted as much on the campaign trail. ""If I'm elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country, and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a, pick a woman to be vice president."" Later, Biden was even more specific: ""Preferably it will be someone who was of color and/or a different gender,"" he said.
Now let it sink in: Biden chose a woman of color who was polling at 1% during the Democratic race to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. Certainly, there were other potential candidates with better qualifications he could have chosen.
As it became known what a total disaster Harris has been in her position of power, just one step away from the Oval Office, she brushed aside the mounting criticism as merely the result of snipy reporting and systemic racism. She told her dwindling supporters that ""the news coverage of her would be different if she were any of her 48 predecessors, whom she has described as all white and male,"" the New York Times reported. Yet, considering how liberal the media in the US is, clearly the negative attitude towards Harris is even worse than she realizes.
Who else has been granted a golden elevator ride to the top based on DEI? Look no further than Rachel Levine, the deputy health secretary, who is a transgender woman. While Levine may be qualified to fulfill her duties - after all, she was named as one of USA Today's women of the year in 2022 - how many other equally (or superior) candidates were overlooked simply because they didn't check the critical boxes?
Or how about Pete Buttigieg, who is currently serving as the 19th US Secretary of Transportation. Formerly the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (population 103,453), Buttigieg, 42, who came out as gay in 2015, was lifted out of relative obscurity when he ran as a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In the dog-eat-dog world of US power politics, such an astonishing rise to the top is almost unheard of, and only so much can be attributed to Buttigieg's intelligence and articulation to explain such a leap over dozens of other more qualified contenders. How much of Buttigieg's overnight success was based largely on his sexual orientation will never be known, but suffice it to say that Democrats were actually fretting at one point that the former mayor ""was not gay enough"" for their liking.
Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration, overseen by Buttigieg's Transportation Department that just unveiled its new 'Diversity and Inclusion' program to hire people with ""severe intellectual disability"" and ""psychiatric disability"" just days after an in-air disaster nearly occurred when a door blew off a Boeing 737 Max, causing more scrutiny about the rush to inclusivity.
""Targeted disabilities are those disabilities that the Federal government, as a matter of policy, has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring,"" the FAA's website read. ""They include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.""
The FAA doesn't specify what range of positions these diversity hires will fill, only implying in a reply to Fox News that, like any other employees, they ""must meet rigorous qualifications that of course will vary by position."" Still, critics of the move are worried that emphasis on DEI policies could make flying less safe. These include Elon Musk, who tweeted ""Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety?""
The failure of the woke radicals to read the room, however, was never more conspicuous than when the advertisers at Anheuser-Busch chose the transgender social-media influencer Dylan Mulvaney to sing the praises of Bud Light, thus wiping out a huge segment of its working-class, beer-consuming contingency. Mulvaney was clearly not the right 'man' for the job.
Or consider the detrimental effect that DEI policies are having in the field of medicine, where medical students, instead of spending as much time as possible learning their demanding trade, are being forced to learn about previously unknown topics, like ""implicit bias"" and ""White privilege."" This is yet another way that DEI is helping to downgrade the workplace.
""There is a finite amount of time in residency training to mold a competent surgeon from a fumble-fingered intern,"" Dr Richard Bosshardt wrote in a recent article for the National Review. ""To assume that we can continue to turn out excellent surgeons and simultaneously burden surgical education with the degree of time-consuming indoctrination in anti-racism and DEI demanded by the ACS tool kit is, at best, foolish and futile, and, at worst, dangerous to our patients.""
A person may be absolutely qualified for any job regardless of their race, gender or sexual orientation. However, what is happening in the US is that many people who are lacking in the necessary qualifications are getting an unjustified career boost because their lifestyle(s) check one or more of the required boxes. Or they are being unnecessarily compelled to learn the new mantra of wokeness instead of concentrating on the basics of their field. Either way, the US campus and workplace is slow to understand that instead of working to eliminate discrimination, DEI policies are now the primary cause of it. Reducing the pool of applicants for jobs is not only a gross insult to the 'American way' but also promises to strip the workplace of its professionalism. Americans need better.

In a video message on social media platform X, DeSantis said that he is ending his White House bid after an underwhelming performance in Iowa, adding that there was no clear path to presidential success for his campaign.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favourable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it, but I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" DeSantis said in the message.
He added, ""Winston Churchill once remarked that success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. While this campaign has ended, the mission continues down here in Florida. We will continue to show the country how to lead"".
The Florida Governor also endorsed Donald Trump, stating that despite his 'disagreements', the majority of Republican primary voters want to give him another chance.
He also said that the country can't go back to the politics being represented by his rival and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
""I am proud to have delivered on 100 per cent of my promises and I will not stop now. It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance...While I have had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear,"" he said in his address.
He added, ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honour that pledge. He has my endorsement, because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear or repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""Notably, DeSantis finished a distant second at the Iowa caucuses, but still fell well short of Trump, winning just 21 per cent support to that of Trump's 51 per cent. He was widely expected to fare poorly in New Hampshire, where former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is seen as the most competitive rival to the former president, The Hill reported.
A CNN poll released on Sunday found Trump with 50 per cent support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stood at 39 per cent.
DeSantis stood at just 6 per cent in the poll, below the 10 per cent minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party's rules.
The Florida governor launched his official bid in May with the support of a number of GOP campaign veterans in his campaign apparatus and super PAC.
DeSantis had been seen as the most viable Trump alternative after cruising to re-election as Florida governor during last year's midterm elections. His victory was in sharp contrast to how other Republicans performed around the country, including many who had been endorsed by Trump, as per The Hill. (ANI)"

DeSantis, 45, endorsed Trump in a video posted to the X social media site.
DeSantis had been widely seen as a top contender for the 2024 Republican nomination and a natural heir to Trump due to his combative style and deeply conservative views. Early in 2023, he led several head-to-head polls against Trump.
But the Florida governor's support has been declining for several months, due to a flawed campaign strategy, his seeming lack of ease with voters on the campaign trail and Trump's so far unshakeable hold on much of the party's base.
The end of DeSantis' bid means that former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, is now the last Republican in the race with a shot - albeit a long one - of denying Trump the nomination. The winner of the Republican nominating contest will take on President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, in the general election in November.
More than 70% of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, according to most opinion polls. That put DeSantis in a position where he had to appeal to voters who still admired Trump, as well as those who passionately disliked him.
DeSantis failed on both counts. He never successfully articulated to most Trump supporters why he was a better option, while Republicans looking to ditch the former president split their votes among multiple candidates. Haley, in particular, has emerged as the favorite among moderate Republicans as the field has consolidated. Where DeSantis differed from Trump on policy, it was almost always to stake out a more conservative position. He signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida in April, which he eventually embraced on the campaign trail, even as it made some donors and moderate Republicans wary.
DeSantis opposed additional U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and took punitive actions against the Walt Disney Co. after the company spoke out against Florida legislation that limited discussion of gender and sexuality in classrooms.
The Disney fight was one that pro-business critics within the party said DeSantis didn't need to wage.
While many major donors threw their support behind DeSantis early on, they began to rebel as early as the summer.
Robert Bigelow, who gave millions to the super PAC fundraising group backing DeSantis, told Reuters in August he was cutting off funding, turned off by the governor's uncompromising position on abortion.
Campaign errors
DeSantis' troubles began before he ever entered the race.
In March, when Trump was indicted in New York on charges he conspired to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, the former president received a significant bump in the polls as Republicans rallied around him. Many of them believed Trump's claims that law enforcement officials were targeting him to keep him out of office.
Several DeSantis allies say the governor waited too long to become a candidate, finally throwing his hat into the ring in May, more than six months after Trump had done so. That left DeSantis open to blistering attacks by Trump, while the governor himself did little to defend himself, insisting he was not a candidate.
When DeSantis did formally launch his White House run in May 2023, it was a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter, now known as X, an inauspicious start for a campaign predicated on the governor's executive competence.
The campaign then overhired, burning through cash at a rapid rate. DeSantis let go of some 38 staffers in July and ousted his campaign manager in August, sowing a narrative of internal chaos that proved hard to shake.
He outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size, but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.
The campaign and the PAC, known as Never Back Down, came to distrust one another. A series of back-to-back departures of senior staffers from the PAC in November and December created a sense of turmoil that furthered the narrative that the governor's campaign was mortally wounded.

Former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley does not have the capacity for high level politics, Donald Trump told supporters at a campaign event in New Hampshire on Friday. The former US president questioned his Republican rival's ability to deal with world leaders such as Russia's Vladimir Putin or China's Xi Jinping.
While former South Carolina governor Haley seeks to consolidate her second place in the race for the GOP presidential ticket ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Trump said she is not ""tough enough"" for the job.
""She's not presidential timber,"" he stated at a campaign event in Concord. ""Now when I say that, that probably means that she's not going to be chosen as the vice president.""
Trump currently holds a commanding lead in the race to challenge the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, in November's election, according to polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight.
He currently holds more than 66% of Republican support, the website said on Friday, placing him significantly ahead of second-placed Haley (12.3%) - who, in turn, is 1.2 percentage points ahead of Florida governor Ron DeSantis.
""I know her very well,"" Trump added of Haley, whom he appointed as US ambassador to the United Nations in 2017. ""She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough. And she wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job.""
Trump added: ""She's not going to be able to deal with President Xi. She's not going to be able to deal with Putin.""
Haley, meanwhile, has on several occasions distanced herself from seeking the vice presidential nomination. ""I am not running to be vice president,"" she said in Iowa last month. ""I don't play for second. I've never done it in my life. I'm not doing it.""
""I think that he [Trump] is not going to even have to worry about picking a VP,"" she said separately to Fox News. ""I know that I will in six months.""
Somewhat bizarrely, Trump - who has frequently questioned Biden's mental acuity on the campaign trail - appeared to mix up Haley with former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in an extended statement in New Hampshire on Friday regarding the January 6, 2021 riots at the US Capitol.
""Nikki Haley is in charge of security [at the Capitol],"" Trump incorrectly said. ""We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guards, whatever they want [to quell the riots]. They turned it down. They don't want to talk about that.""
The Biden campaign posted the video clip to social media late on Friday, saying of the gaffe: ""A deeply confused Trump confuses Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley multiple times.""

1171,4ACYTRNDB7_35H0TMRRDNVLVRK,Trump goes all in on attacking Nikki Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,"By Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:29 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/trump-haley-new-hampshire/,"Former President Donald Trump spent the three-year anniversary of his White House departure trying to sweep away the few remaining Republican obstacles to his third consecutive nomination, hammering former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and warning supporters against complacency two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester, “because we have to send real unity as a message.”
But over more than 90 minutes, Trump delivered the vengeful message that he has made the focus of his campaign, moaning about the lost 2020 race; defending the January 6, 2021, rioters; pushing again for the Supreme Court to declare him and all presidents immune from prosecution; mocking President Joe Biden; and, with the most gusto, lashing out at Haley, his former UN ambassador and the candidate closest to him in Granite State primary polls.

Even before he spoke, Trump’s campaign beamed its message on a big screen above the stage with rotating slides attacking Haley over supposed ties to “Democrats, Wall Street & Globalists” and her positions on Social Security and other hot-button issues.
When he took the microphone, Trump kept up the barrage.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to run the radical Democratic campaign operation she’s running,” Trump said, referencing his rival’s appeal to some centrist and anti-Trump political groups and donors. “What the hell kind of Republican candidate is that?”
After running through a laundry list of policy criticisms, most pointedly Haley’s campaign pledge to raise the retirement age for younger people, delaying their access to Social Security payments, Trump jabbed back at Haley over her suggestion that he is too old to be president again – which followed an incident in which Trump confused her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it,” Haley, 52, said earlier Saturday of Trump, 77, at a rally in Keene, New Hampshire.
Trump shot back at the rally, claiming he’s recently taken a “cognitive test,” which he “aced,” before promising to “let you know when I go bad.”
After finishing third in Iowa behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley’s campaign is on the line in New Hampshire. A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters there support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley has the support of a majority — 58% — of registered undeclared voters, but the former president is backed by 67% of registered Republicans.

Granite State voting rules — and their potential to help Haley — were a frequent target for Trump on Saturday night, as the former president groused over the potential for those who don’t consider themselves Republicans or typically vote for the GOP to cast ballots in its presidential primary.
But he added a false flourish to that case, telling the audience that Democrats, too, can take part on the Republican contest. They cannot.
“Registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary, and registered Republicans cannot vote in the Democratic primary,” New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan told CNN earlier this week after Trump leveled a similar charge.
Trump also looked ahead to the next major clash in the race: South Carolina. It’s Haley’s home state, where she was twice elected governor, but Trump leads there in the polls and among influential GOP leaders – a handful of whom showed up in New Hampshire.
“We could be in our home state, but we chose to come up to New Hampshire for a reason,” Rep. Russell Fry said. Gov. Henry McMaster invoked the Spice Girls – really – to tell voters “what we want, what we really really want” is Trump.

“We’re going to be there in three weeks, so you know what I’m doing,” Trump said of his guests, adding, “I’m kissing ass.”
Again, it was Trump’s desires that took centerstage.
He repeated his contention that all US presidents, beginning with him, should have immunity from prosecution. This relatively new line of argument comes as Trump awaits a ruling from a federal appeals court regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In the meantime, he’s argued presidents should never face legal consequences for their actions.
The court hearing the claim has expressed skepticism, but Trump is continuing to make his case in public. On Saturday night, he invoked President Harry Truman’s use of the nuclear bomb in Japan in 1945 as a case study.
“Look at Harry Truman,” Trump said. “He wouldn’t have done, if you think Hiroshima, not exactly a nice act but it did end the Second World War probably, right? Nagasaki. He wouldn’t be doing that; he said, ‘I don’t want to do that because my opponents will indict me.’”
The US dropped atomic bombs on both cities toward the end of the war, killing at least 150,000 in Hiroshima alone, according to some estimates. Though the morality of the decision has been debated, no one sought to bring legal charges against Truman.
Trump had much less to say about DeSantis. He even made a point of noting how little he’d spoken about the Florida governor (before proceeding to mock his height at the prompting of a supporter). He had more kind words, though, for Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban.
“It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” Trump said of the strongman, happily reciting the nice things that Orban has recently said about him.

1172,4YDWOLVNR7_23WRH34SESRROJ5,What voters in New Hampshire have to say about Nikki Haley and Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary,"By Arit John and Jeff Zeleny, CNN","7 minute read Updated 4:52 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-voters/,"Danielle Brown voted for John McCain in the 2000 New Hampshire Republican primary and for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary eight years later. On Tuesday, she intends to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to send a clear message to both parties.
“We need to have some new ideas and a new, younger generation coming in,” Brown, an undeclared voter, said as she clutched a Haley 2024 yard sign freshly autographed by the candidate. “Haley is energized. I think she can do a lot for our country.”
Brown is a voter stuck in the middle, one of thousands of undeclared and independent residents who make up a plurality of the Granite State’s electorate and a critical part of Haley’s coalition. Her chances in New Hampshire – and by extension, the fate of her campaign – likely hinge on how many independents vote for her in the state’s primary Tuesday.

As of Friday, 344,335 voters in New Hampshire were registered as undeclared, making up nearly 40% of the electorate.
Haley’s campaign is targeting Republicans and undeclared voters from the suburbs to the seacoast, advisers said, particularly in precincts where Trump underperformed other Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu. Though former President Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, he lost the state in the general election in both 2016 and 2020.
A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley is backed by a majority – 58% – of registered undeclared voters, but the former president has the support of 67% of registered Republicans.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon, was backed by just 6% of New Hampshire GOP voters in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would have needed to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
A win in New Hampshire could offer Haley’s campaign the momentum, and donor money, necessary to compete in South Carolina on February 24 and the Super Tuesday states voting on March 5.
A loss, however, might hasten the speed at which the Republican Party coalesces around Trump.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who ended his own presidential bid in November, became the latest former candidate to endorse Trump at a rally in Concord on Friday. Haley dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that Trump was lining up “Washington insiders” despite vowing to drain the swamp.
“But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do,” Haley said.
As Trump campaigns in New Hampshire, the former president is trying to keep Republicans in line – and out of reach for Haley.
“Nikki Haley in particular is counting on the Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Portsmouth on Wednesday.
His rallying cry is false. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and the deadline for registering as a Republican or undeclared voter was October. Undeclared voters have the option to choose either a Democratic or Republican primary ballot on Election Day.

Greg Moore, a senior adviser for AFP Action, the political network backed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that has thrown its resources behind Haley, said Friday that the group’s data shows the former governor’s base includes conservative voters. AFP Action, which endorsed Haley in November, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire, Moore said.
“I think some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump,” Moore said. “I know that’s not true.”
What the former president may not know is that Haley’s rallies and town hall meetings in New Hampshire last week were filled with voters like Susan Rice of Rochester, who twice voted for Trump.
Rice, who owns a yarn business in New Hampshire and Maine, was invited to the White House in 2018 during the Trump administration for an event to showcase small-business leaders. She said she believed it was time for the country to move on.
“I’m a staunch Republican and I have been my entire life,” Rice said. “I think it’s time to have a woman as a president. I like her foreign policies and I like the fact that she has a good understanding of our southern border and what she wants to do for that.”
She said she was exhausted by Trump and excited by Haley’s potential to rebuild the Republican Party.
“I don’t necessarily worry about the court cases,” Rice said. “But it’s the baggage, and honestly, sometimes what comes out of his mouth and – how do I put this diplomatically – the name-calling, the putting other people down.”
Michael Lewis, a Hollis resident, said he supported the way Trump approached the economy, the border and America’s relationship with NATO, but he couldn’t vote for a presidential candidate “whose age is past life expectancy.”
He also expressed doubts that Trump will still be eligible to run for president in the general election.
“I think the sequence is there’s campaigning, then there’s the [Republican National] Convention, then there’s going to be the conviction of Donald Trump,” Lewis said. “There’s going to have to be an alternative. I think she’s the answer.”
Still, while some former Trump voters are open, even eager, to vote for Haley, the former president’s base in New Hampshire remains strong.
“MAGA is not going to be with her,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday.
That was the sentiment at the Saddle Up Saloon in Kingston on Friday afternoon, where GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio rallied a few dozen Trump supporters. In interviews, attendees mentioned several criticisms Haley’s rivals have leveled against her foreign policy views and her conservatism.
Sylvia, a Nashua voter at the event who declined to give her last name, said she would sit out the general election if Trump made Haley his running mate.
“She’s a RINO, she’s a war monger,” she said, using the acronym for “Republican in name only.” “I’m not for her at all.”
Bill Jackson, an 86-year-old from Hampton who plans to vote for Trump, said he believed Haley has support only among elitists and echoed the former president’s comments about Democratic crossover votes.
“She’s pro-war. She’s also pro-immigration, illegal immigration,” he said. “I mean, she said we’ve got to treat these people as equals. No, we don’t, they’re illegally coming into this country.”
Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have tried to paint Haley as weak on border security. Haley has responded by saying securing the border would be a top priority of her administration. She has characterized herself as a conservative and said her advocacy for a strong US foreign policy is meant to prevent war.
On the trail, Haley has expanded on the pitch she started making on the night of the Iowa caucuses – that she is the best chance voters have of preventing both Trump and President Joe Biden from winning a second term. She has highlighted polls that show her beating Biden in a general election by a wider margin than the GOP front-runner, and argued that she would help Republicans down ballot win House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
A Marist poll released Friday found Haley running near-even with Biden, 47% to 44%, in a New Hampshire general election matchup, while Trump trailed Biden by 7 points.
Haley has also sought to draw comparisons between Trump and Biden, from their ages to the amount of government spending they approved in office, and said both presidents come with “baggage.”
Her revamped stump speech also pushes back more aggressively against the Trump campaign’s characterization of parts of her record, including her position that the retirement age needs to be raised for people in their 20s and 30s. In a recent ad, Trump’s campaign incorrectly claimed Haley wants to limit Social Security for current beneficiaries.
Haley noted that Trump supported raising the Social Security age to 70. Trump supported raising the Social Security age in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” but wavered on whether to cut entitlements since running for president in 2016, CNN’s KFile reported last year.
“If he’s going to lie about me, we’re going to tell the truth about him,” Haley said in Hollis on Thursday. “You’re going to see a lot of things said, but at the end of the day it’s the drama, and vengeance, and the vindictiveness that we want to get out of the way.”
The message resonated with Nancy Protzmann, an undeclared voter who attended the Hollis event and said she’s long been looking for a candidate to back against Trump. As she left the venue, she said she plans to request a Republican ballot and vote for Haley.
“I will do anything in my power to make sure that Trump does not become our next president,” Protzmann said. “But I liked what she said – and I don’t want Biden either.”
Asked whether her decision was intended to be more of an affirmative vote for Haley or a roadblock for Trump, she said ideally both.
“I hope it will be a launching pad for her, because I do think she would be a good president,” Protzmann said. “And I certainly hope it will help block him.”

1174,77GCPLCH1T_O8VEFL51MC4T6AN,Opinion: Our possibly short national nightmare,"Opinion by Richard Galant, CNN","12 minute read Updated 9:19 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/trump-biden-new-hampshire-column-galant/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
On August 9, 1974, the only unelected vice president in American history took the presidential oath of office at a White House ceremony. It was the day after President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.
“My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Gerald Ford said.
“Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.” In words that sound almost foreign to our ears in the 21st century, Ford added, “As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.”
Last week the true-crime docuseries that shot to the top of the list of Netflix shows in the US was “American Nightmare.” But it wasn’t that kind of nightmare, or Gerald Ford’s one, that presidential candidate Nikki Haley invoked Monday after her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
“Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,” the former UN ambassador said. She was referring to polls showing that the majority of Americans don’t want a rematch between President Joe Biden and the president he defeated in 2020, Donald Trump.
When the results of the New Hampshire primary are reported Tuesday, we’ll have a better sense of whether anyone can stand in the way of that dreaded rematch. If not, it won’t be as protracted a “national nightmare” as the two-year-long Watergate scandal that put Gerald Ford in the Oval Office. This year’s election is on November 5 — and the inauguration is only one year away. Though, depending on your point of view, the real nightmare could begin after the swearing-in.
Haley is walking a tightrope, trying to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status among Republicans without alienating his MAGA base. “There’s an outside chance she can pull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump’s perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “But there’s another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control… If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP’s second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.”

Haley has been wary of directly going after the former president’s many vulnerabilities, while obliquely arguing that the nation can’t risk having a president in or nearing his 80s and that “chaos follows” Trump, whether or not it is his fault.
“Her ability to build momentum over the course of the primary showcases her political talent and ability to attract college-educated Republicans tired of having to explain away their support for a president whose hair-trigger social media posts verge into the unhinged,” wrote Patrick T. Brown.
Daniel McCarthy isn’t buying into the idea that Haley has momentum: “Former President Donald Trump’s easy win in Iowa on Monday confirms that there really is no race for the Republican nomination this year. With a deep freeze discouraging turnout, the caucuses provided a hard test of voter enthusiasm. Trump’s rivals failed it.”
“A measure of the former president’s insurmountable strength within the party is that he not only beat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, he also overcame all of the institutional powers backing them — some of the most formidable interests in the GOP.”
On the Democratic side, Biden isn’t even on the ballot Tuesday and isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire, due to a dispute between state and national party officials over the primary’s timing.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a low-profile 54-year-old legislator from Minnesota, is running in New Hampshire, SE Cupp noted, and is polling more strongly there than around the nation. It’s a longshot, Cupp noted, but “if Biden’s poll numbers keep going in the wrong direction, if voters feel taken for granted or even overlooked by Democrats, if a symbolic win in New Hampshire gives voters a reason to look more closely at Dean Phillips, well he might give Biden a run for his money.”
Karen Finney is the great-great-great-great niece of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and great-great-great granddaughter of a freed slave from Virginia.
“Walking through the door of my grandmother’s home in North Carolina,” Finney wrote, “it was impossible to miss a portrait of Lee proudly displayed on the wall. At mealtimes, during what occasionally felt like indoctrination, she would admiringly describe our famous ancestor, ‘the General,’ as a benevolent slave owner and noble warrior.”
“As she explained it, Lee valiantly fought an unjust ‘War of Northern Aggression’ in defense of ‘states’ rights,’ often referred to as ‘The Lost Cause.’ The South had been defeated, my grandmother insisted, only because the Northern army had more resources and slavery really wasn’t so bad.”
In Finney’s view, the Lost Cause is the backdrop for Trump’s suggestion that the Civil War could have been “negotiated,” the rewriting of history in school curriculums under Florida Gov. DeSantis’ administration and Haley’s struggle over the question of whether America is, or ever was, a racist country.
“Beyond absurdly omitting slavery as the root cause of the War, she made matters worse while trying to clean up her comments during a recent CNN Town Hall, saying she just assumed that slavery was a ‘given’ since all children learn about it in school in the South.”

Trump’s remark that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of Americans evokes the words of Adolf Hitler in “Mein Kampf,” author Paul Moses pointed out. But he added that the concept goes further back — to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century.
In 1914, the year Edward Alsworth Ross became president of the American Sociological Association, he published a book warning that immigrants, Moses wrote, “would act on Americans’ standards for cleanliness, morality and education ‘like a slow poison.’ A nation that relies on immigration to maintain its population ‘deserves the extinction that surely awaits it,’ he wrote…The prejudice beneath Ross’ opinions was obvious, but his ideas were mainstream and respectable — he was considered a progressive reformer…”
“But Ross came to regret the implications of his ideas about supposedly superior and inferior races, writing shortly after World War II that ‘we never imagined the theory being made a hinge for German aggression to turn on.’ That’s what the phony claims of eugenics led to — Hitler’s ‘Final Solution,’ which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. It’s certainly worth having vigorous debates about immigration laws, but those who’ve been indifferent to or even supportive of Trump’s increasingly clear turn toward racist, eugenic ideas should confront what they’ve enabled.”
Republicans describe the immigration surge at the US southern border as an “invasion” that presents a national security threat. Yet, John Avlon wrote, Trump and some members of the House GOP, want to tank an emerging compromise in the Senate that would couple border security measures with aid to Ukraine.
“Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more threats from his far-right flank, who have been signaling that they will balk at any border security bill until a Republican is president.
“Right-wing resistance is entirely consistent with a Trump-ified GOP that is more willing to demagogue an issue than actually deal with it.”

Trump sat in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday while E. Jean Carroll testified in support of her defamation case against the former president. Last May, she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation when a jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her. Now Carroll is seeking at least $10 million in additional damages for Trump’s 2019 comments about her allegation.
As Danielle Campoamor wrote, “Carroll found herself facing down not only a man found liable for assaulting her, but also a former president and current presidential frontrunner — an unprecedented example of the power dynamics survivors face. While a victim of sexual assault receives death threats, her assailant receives endorsements and secures the Iowa caucus.”
“During Carroll’s testimony, Trump repeatedly shook his head, according to CNN reporters inside the courtroom, and could be heard ‘loudly saying things’ such as ‘it’s false,’ ‘she’s gotten her memory back,’ and, according to Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley, that the lawsuit is ‘a witch hunt’ and a ‘con job.’”
When the judge threatened to oust Trump from the courtroom, the former president said, “I would love it.”
The chaotic court proceeding is just one example of why the Supreme Court should clear the way for allowing television cameras at Trump’s forthcoming election subversion trial, argued Robert C. Gottlieb. “Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue to impugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display during Wednesday’s court proceedings will undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.”
“The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.”
The narrative of fast-worsening inequality over the past half century has been challenged in a new study by economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They used data to show that, compared to the 1960s, the pre-tax income of the top 1% has increased only by 2.6% and after accounting for taxes, the share of income going to the super-rich “hasn’t budged at all,” wrote Jordan McGillis. The study disputes a 2018 finding by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman that the top 1% has seen its share of national pre-tax income go from 12% to 20% since the 1980s.
McGillis says there’s something else going on that tends to exacerbate inequality. Among rich Americans, marriage rates remain high, but they’ve plummeted for less affluent people, creating more single-person households with lower levels of income. “This cleavage makes possible what the Brookings Institution’s Melissa Kearney describes as “two-parent privilege,” an emerging phenomenon through which well-off couples transmit educational and economic advantages to their children. Viewed from this angle, it should not surprise us that many Americans think the rich are galloping ever further ahead.”
Elise Gould and Josh Bivens have a different take. Using Social Security Administration data, they found that the “share of earnings for the bottom 90% fell 9.7 percentage points between 1979 and 2022, while the share of earnings for the top 5% grew 8.8 percentage points. The very top — the top 0.1% of wage earners — nearly tripled its share of total earnings from 1.6% in 1979 to 4.6% in 2022… All of this straightforward data on earnings clearly shows a huge rise in inequality of pay in the US economy.”
The US and the UK struck back at the Houthis, the Yemeni insurgent group that is targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but the lingering question was about how effective such a series of strikes can be. “We think of war as a last resort,” Elisabeth Kendall, head of Cambridge University’s Girton College told Peter Bergen. The Houthis “think of it as a way of life.”
“The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets,” Kendall said.
CNN Opinion senior editor Sheena McKenzie interviewed Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital, and asked him about the future for Palestinian children amid the war in Gaza.
“There is no future for them,” he said. “How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?”
“The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.” (Hear more from Sheena McKenzie on the Tug of War podcast.)
There is a lot of talk but very little real debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict on US college campuses, wrote Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University.
“Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who ‘Stand with Israel’ and those seeking ‘Justice for Palestine.’… Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.”
“The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.”
“It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority.”

When Holly Thomas was 12, she “received a large — unsolicited — Estee Lauder makeup sampler for Christmas. The box felt like a totem of my impending maturity, recognition that I would soon be allowed access to an as-yet out-of-reach club. I gave it pride of place on my bedroom table (swiftly rebranded as a “dresser” with the help of a soon-to-be filthy sarong), and before too long I was regularly being sent out of class, cheeks burning, to wash my contraband mascara off.”
“It wasn’t a particularly edifying phase, but neither was it very consequential. Today however, skin care is a far more serious business. Gone are the days of teens aimlessly browsing random drugstores by day and smudging their pillows with iridescent bronzer by night. Now, kids don’t just know how to cleanse properly, they’ve taken to beauty products with unprecedented zeal. Absurd though it sounds, that fervor is acutely ominous,” Thomas wrote.
“Dermatologists report children as young as nine, many of whom already maintain elaborate at-home skin care regimes coming to their offices for cosmetic consultations. Teens who’ve barely exited puberty are obsessing over the alleged ‘preventative’ anti-aging properties of Botox, and the internet is teeming with youngsters pleading for solutions to their ‘wrinkles.’ The fretting and groupthink involved bear all the hallmarks of a classic youthful infatuation. But this one comes with sinister undercurrents less familiar to the adults who went before them.”
“The most worrying thing about today’s skin care craze isn’t just that the financial and emotional buy-in are completely out of proportion to the “need” being addressed. They may set kids up for lasting damage. And thanks to the misinformation soup of social media, the gnarly, anxiety-provoking call is coming from inside the house.”"
1176,7KG78W70B0_P7IIT9F8B263L25,DeSantis ends 2024 presidential campaign and endorses Trump,"By Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:58 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/desantis-ends-2024-campaign/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who entered the Republican presidential primary as Donald Trump’s greatest threat, announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president.
His announcement, made in a video posted on X, comes after a disappointing second-place finish in last week’s Iowa Republican caucuses.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it, but I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,” DeSantis said.
He then touted his support for Trump: “While, I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.”
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement, because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,” he said.
His departure leaves former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the lone Trump alternative in the race but without much time to consolidate support and catch up to the front-runner.
DeSantis’ decision came after days of conversations with donors. It became clear over the weekend that there was neither the rationale nor the financial support to continue his candidacy.
DeSantis and his wife Casey made the decision Sunday afternoon, surprising many of his rank-and-file staffers and supporters.
DeSantis called top donors personally and told them that he had woken up that morning and decided there was no path to winning and it was time to get out, two Republican donors with knowledge of the calls told CNN.
DeSantis told the donors that there was no reason to waste his time and money staying in the race. DeSantis said there was no path to victory with Trump in the race, recalling how he kept hearing from attendees at his events that, “if it wasn’t for Trump, I would vote for you.”
The two sources said DeSantis knows he is young and if he is to have a chance at winning the GOP presidential nomination in 2028, he needed to endorse Trump.
It’s a devastating blow to the promising career of a once-rising GOP star, and his failure to reach the lofty expectation of his candidacy has already sparked a wave of second-guessing from close allies and advisers. Some believe DeSantis took too long to attack former President Donald Trump. Others think his team underestimated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
More yet remain convinced that there was nothing DeSantis could have done to wrestle the party from Trump’s loyal and sizable followers.
“DeSantis has run the playbook to a T,” Steve Deace, a well-known conservative radio commentator and supporter of the Florida governor, told CNN in recent weeks. “It’s just as simple as: when they started indicting Donald Trump, people weren’t ready to move on from him. And for DeSantis, it wasn’t quite his time.”
For his part, DeSantis has blamed his performance on a host of challenges, including Iowa’s weather, conservative media’s loyalty to Trump and the unprecedented barrage of negative ads against him. One thing he hasn’t faulted was his main pitch to voters – his record of accomplishment in Florida – which he continued to feature in speech after speech until his final moments as a presidential candidate.
Last week’s outcome in Iowa proved an especially devastating blow. DeSantis had once vowed to win the state, then predicted he would perform well, claiming his ground game would reveal itself as a secret weapon. He instead finished nearly 30 points behind Trump and barely edged out Haley for second place, sapping his credibility along with the enthusiasm for him.
DeSantis vowed to fight on, but after Iowa, it was increasingly clear to many around him that his campaign had run its course.
Trump can now take credit for upending the political futures of three of the most prominent and promising Republican politicians in his adopted home state: DeSantis, former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (the latter two of whom he bested in the 2016 Republican presidential primary).
It is unclear what is next for DeSantis, who, at age 45, has three years remaining in his second term as governor before he is term-limited. In recent weeks, DeSantis has planted the seeds for a potential 2028 bid, claiming that some Trump supporters have already encouraged it.
“They were coming up to me saying, ‘We want you in 2028, we love you, man,’” the governor recently told reporters.
DeSantis had an inauspicious start on the path to White House contender. It wasn’t until his third term in the US House in 2017 that he began to make a name for himself as a loyal defender of Trump on Fox News. On the website then known as Twitter, Trump called DeSantis “a true FIGHTER!”
With Trump’s backing, DeSantis won the Florida governorship in 2018. DeSantis then spent the next four years charting a path distinct from his one-time ally. He found his lane as an unabashed and willing culture warrior who broke from the medical community during the coronavirus pandemic and dove into national controversies over immigration, education and LGTBQ issues, earning fawning media coverage from right-wing outlets along the way.
By the time of his 19-point reelection victory in 2022 – when a GOP red wave fizzled elsewhere and many Trump-backed candidates flamed out – a presidential campaign was all but certain. Republicans looking to move on from Trump saw a resume straight out of central casting: blue-collar roots, Little League star, a college athlete at Yale, Harvard law degree, Navy veteran and a photogenic young family.
Beyond that, DeSantis at that point had never lost a race.
“DeFuture,” declared the New York Post, the tabloid published by conservative media mogul Rupert Mudoch, the morning after the midterm election, with DeSantis and his wife Casey, a top confidant, splashed across the cover.
But DeSantis slow-walked his entrance into the race – there was first a book to sell and a legislative session to oversee – and, once in, he struggled to match those lofty expectations. More critically, DeSantis failed to convince other Republican presidential hopefuls that he and Trump stood alone atop the GOP and spent the 2023 summer running against a crowded field instead of the former president.
The campaign trail proved a challenging environment for DeSantis, who had grown accustomed to holding court and chastising media from behind a lectern. His political foes gleefully elevated his stiff and awkward interactions with voters. In eight months as a candidate, he struggled to articulate a coherent rationale for his candidacy and focused more often on his past accomplishments as a governor than his ideas for the future.
His campaign was also beset with cost overruns and shakeups that dogged him throughout the summer. A small group of loyal but inexperienced advisers in Tallahassee regularly clashed with the veteran GOP operatives who commanded his super PAC, led by strategist Jeff Roe. By the time Iowans caucused, the super PAC, Never Back Down, was on its fourth CEO, had undergone an exodus of staff and advisers and was no longer running ads.
Still, DeSantis remained a viable candidate until the voting started, a testament to a relentless appetite for campaign stops and media appearances. In Iowa, for example, he visited all 99 counties and had earned the support of the state’s popular Republican governor, Kim Reynolds.
But it was clear in the days after the Iowa caucuses, when he appeared tired and sounded dejected, that the grind of the campaign had taken its toll. DeSantis maintained, though, that he had no regrets about running.
“If I had been sitting on the sidelines, and Republicans end up losing in 2024, people then would have said, ‘Oh, well, you had the opportunity to do something, and you didn’t,’” he said in a recent interview. “So, any one can sit there and carp on the sidelines – get in the arena, and fight for what you believe in.”

1193,I89055GN9V_9Z67GXU8UJMUM7H,‘Very dangerous’: Zelensky on Trump’s claim he could end Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours,"By Andrew Carey and Victoria Butenko, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:12 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/europe/zelensky-trump-end-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/,"For the first time, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed publicly unequivocal concern over Donald Trump’s suggestion he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day if he returns to the White House.
Speaking to Britain’s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner’s boast as “very dangerous” – on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.
Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump’s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a “political message.”
But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, “makes me really quite stressed.”
Trump’s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”
Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, “They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.”
Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.
At Davos earlier this week, responding to a similar question from a journalist, the Ukrainian leader answered rhetorically, wondering how Trump would respond if Putin rolled through Ukraine - in a scenario where Trump removed all US support - and began threatening NATO members with invasion.
It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.
By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.

Ukraine’s ability to negotiate toward that result has been significantly weakened, at least in the short term, by the failure of the summer counteroffensive.
Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: “Nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.”
Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.
Turning to address the camera, he said, “Please, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.”
“Maybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,” Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer."
1194,ICEC76V0RG_5CUKDCW42UAWCNJ,"In South Carolina, Ron DeSantis prepares a last stand – and a way out","By Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:26 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/ron-desantis-south-carolina/,"With most of the political world closely watching New Hampshire this weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead spent Saturday 900 miles away in South Carolina, laying the groundwork for his presidential campaign’s last stand.
“I’m asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,” DeSantis told supporters at a Florence restaurant. “I’ll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida. I will always be a candidate that you can be proud of. As president, I will get the job done.”
In a marker of the confusion surrounding his unclear path forward, DeSantis’ campaign late Saturday was still scrambling to figure out which state their candidate would appear in on Sunday. The scheduling fluctuations resulted in DeSantis abruptly canceling plans to appear Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His campaign quickly chimed in publicly to end speculation about his political future to note that DeSantis will appear in New Hampshire on Sunday.

Yet, even as he soldiers on, DeSantis increasingly sounds like a candidate wrestling with his relevancy. In the days following his distant second-place finish in Iowa, DeSantis has lashed out at Fox News, bemoaned the money spent against him, blamed cold weather and “very low” enthusiasm for his performance, trivialized the sway of the Hawkeye State Republicans who endorsed him, conceded former President Donald Trump’s edge going forward, admitted his media strategy failed, and for the first time suggested what it would take for him to end his White House bid.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he said Friday night. “The minute I don’t, then I’m not just going to do this just for my health.”
His public journey through the seven stages of grief comes as his Republican rivals have all but dismissed his candidacy as an afterthought.
Trump recently predicted on his social media site that DeSantis “will SOON be out of money and dropping out of the race for President.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was “no longer focused on” DeSantis after Iowa.
“He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” she said. “He’s invisible in New Hampshire. He’s invisible in South Carolina. We’re focused on Trump. That’s the key.”
DeSantis, though, is intensely focused on Haley in South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. In appearances around the Palmetto State this week, DeSantis has contended she’s not conservative enough for the state and has asked the audience to list her accomplishments. He has asserted no one can.
Fourth-grade teacher Regina Wasiluk took issue with that suggestion. She showed up to DeSantis’ Lexington event to defend Haley’s record on education when he once again queried his crowd.
After a brief exchange, DeSantis shut her down.
“This isn’t your show, ma’am,” he said.
Wasiluk said after the experience she wouldn’t vote for DeSantis if he’s the GOP nominee.
“I was very upset that I didn’t bring my phone so that I can share it with other people who feel the same way that I do,” she said.
South Carolina’s February 24 primary is still more than a month away and comes after the Nevada caucuses. But coming just nine days before Super Tuesday, when the race expands into a national contest, the state typically turns into “the graveyard of a lot of campaigns and the booster rocket to at least one,” said the state’s GOP chairman, Drew McKissick.
“This is your last chance to be able to focus on one state at a time,” McKissick said. “After that, you’ve got to be on the air and on the ground in half a dozen to a dozen states at one time. That’s cost prohibitive, time prohibitive and manpower prohibitive.”
Still, DeSantis’ campaign is not setting expectations for a win here or even a second-place finish. Instead, it appears singularly focused on playing spoiler to Haley on her home turf. The theory behind the strategy is Haley would drop out if she can’t manage a strong performance in the state she once led, though she has given no indication that is the case. The Florida governor is moving much of his campaign here to carry out that mission.
DeSantis himself is not setting expectations, either. He told reporters Saturday, “I’m not a political pundit,” when asked his end goal in South Carolina and whether there’s a district he thinks he can win.
“We’re here. You saw the folks. We get great reception,” DeSantis said, referencing a large crowd at the Myrtle Beach event. “As this thing turns, you know, we’re gonna be in a good situation.”
But DeSantis has stopped short of the scorched-earth offensive it may take to damage Haley. His remarks across three stops Saturday largely touched on familiar themes – his accomplishments in Florida, the scourges of a “woke” culture and the urgency to change course as a country – none of which moved the needle for him in Iowa and New Hampshire.
One attendee in Myrtle Beach asked DeSantis why he hasn’t gained traction from Republicans in 2024 given his track record in Florida – a sign of the skepticism from voters that accompanies worsening odds.
“I got to break through a lot of clutter out there in ways that other candidates don’t,” DeSantis contended. “There’s other candidates that get elevated, and I got to break through the clutter.”
Unclear is how much firepower DeSantis will have to “break through the clutter.” DeSantis’ campaign and supporting super PACs have not aired an ad outside of Iowa since mid-November, and the Hawkeye State did not deliver the result for him that could have led to a fundraising bonanza.
Meanwhile, Haley’s campaign is preparing to launch a $4 million media buy in South Carolina beginning the day of the New Hampshire primary, her campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, told reporters Saturday. Americans for Prosperity Action, which is supporting Haley, also has about $2.3 million booked in the state, according to AdImpact.
Also missing since getting thrashed in Iowa is the swagger of the candidate who once cosplayed as a “Top Gun” pilot to drive home the point he will “never back down from a fight.” DeSantis appeared tired touring his third state this week while keeping up a schedule badly battered by winter storms. Asked by a voter Saturday in Myrtle Beach whom he’d pick as a running mate, DeSantis listlessly batted away the question with a blunt assessment of his standing in the GOP race.
“It’s presumptuous,” he said. “I’ve got eight delegates. Trump’s got 20. You gotta get there.”
A visit to South Carolina four days before New Hampshire votes would seem to necessitate punting on the Granite State – where Trump and Haley are in a heated fight and he is at risk of not reaching the 10% vote threshold needed to earn delegates in the state. Yet, as DeSantis arrived in South Carolina, he published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Journal in which he urged voters to support him.
“Support me in the coming New Hampshire primary,” he wrote, “and I will embody the live free or die spirit as your next president.”

1197,MGFK3HK4NG_CSL94LA7W3XDSNZ,"If the New Hampshire primary results match latest polling, only one question will be asked","Analysis by David Chalian, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:47 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/new-hampshire-haley-trump-primary-campaign/,"If the New Hampshire primary results come in on Tuesday night looking like the final CNN/UNH poll results released Sunday, there is going to be one question hanging over the race for the Republican presidential nomination: Is this race over?
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has said plainly that “the road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated that he intends on competing for delegates at least through the month of March.
But it is hard to imagine how Haley and DeSantis continue to fund their campaigns at a competitive level, never mind convincing Republican voters and power brokers that there is a rationale to continue onward following sizable back-to-back victories for former President Donald Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire where the former president collects a majority of the votes and the delegates.
There has never been a non-incumbent Republican candidate for president who has won both Iowa and New Hampshire. In fact, in modern presidential campaign history — since the Iowa caucuses have served as the official kickoff, followed by the New Hampshire primary — the two people who have won both contests outright were Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry, both of whom went on to become their party’s nominee.
In the new CNN/UNH poll, one finding stands out as a particularly telling element in this race: When likely GOP primary voters were asked for their overall opinion of the candidates, Trump’s favorability rating was in a different stratosphere than that of his competitors.
Trump scores a 56% favorable rating from likely Republican primary voters, compared with a 36% unfavorable rating. That is a net positive 20 points favorable advantage for the former president.
Haley and DeSantis are both underwater. More GOP primary voters have an unfavorable view of them than have a favorable view of them.
The relentless hammering on DeSantis by Trump and his allies for the better part of the last year and their more recent attacks on Haley have had their intended effect — more negative ratings for Trump’s two foremost rivals.
But the strategic decision by DeSantis and Haley to sharpen their criticisms of Trump only at the very end of these contests is also on display here.
The ever-present concern that attacking Trump directly would push away some of the very voters Haley and DeSantis spent much of 2023 trying to attract has left Trump’s popularity with Republicans largely unscathed, if not improved.
Perhaps there was no way for any candidate to truly chip away at Trump’s incredible bond with the majority of Republican voters, but it is also clear that not having attempted to do that for the entire year before the voting began leaves these non-Trump candidates with very limited options for a path forward."
1210,TCYS66GBMK_B8UTAHFKJBQNJLK,CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire,"By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:50 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/new-hampshire-primary-poll-trump-haley-desantis/,"The race for the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary appears to be former President Donald Trump’s to lose, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire following Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa’s caucuses last week.
Trump holds 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stands at 39%. Both have gained supporters since the last CNN/UNH poll in early January – when Trump held 39% to Haley’s 32% – as the field of major contenders has shrunk. Both Trump and Haley now hold their highest level of support in UNH polling on the race since 2021. But Haley’s sharp gains since late last summer have not been enough to catch Trump, as the gap between them has once again widened to double digits.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president. He stood at just 6% in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
For Trump’s opponents, New Hampshire has long appeared to be the place in the early primary calendar that offered the best shot at knocking him off track in his bid for a third straight GOP presidential nomination. It was the only early state where polls consistently found Trump without majority support, and where voters often showed the most openness to his rivals. But this latest survey suggests that Trump’s popularity within the GOP base and the commitment of his supporters outweigh the appeal of his challengers.
New Hampshire’s traditional independent streak and more moderate pool of likely primary voters, when compared with other states whose nominating contests land ahead of Super Tuesday, are part of why some Trump rivals fixated on the state as the place to stand out. And Haley has won over those groups.
She holds 58% support among those who are registered as undeclared (New Hampshire’s term for independent voters) and plan to vote in the GOP primary, and 71% support among those who consider themselves ideologically moderate. She also stands ahead of Trump among voters who hold college degrees (50% Haley to 38% Trump). But each of these groups on its own makes up a minority of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire: 47% are registered undeclared, 33% are at least college graduates and just about 3 in 10 describe themselves as moderate.
Trump has largely consolidated his support among the larger flip sides of each of those groups. He has the backing of 67% of registered Republicans, 71% of conservatives and 55% of those who do not have a college degree. And among Trump’s supporters, 88% say they have definitely decided to support him compared with 74% of Haley supporters who are similarly locked in. That translates to 45% of the electorate being firmly decided Trump supporters, compared with just 30% who are equally decided Haley backers.
With just a few days to go before Tuesday’s primary, about 1 in 5 likely Republican primary voters overall say they have not yet locked in their choice. That group broadly backs Haley as of now: 51% support her, 28% supportTrump and 14% say they support DeSantis.
Broadly speaking, New Hampshire’s likely Republican primary voters expect Trump to win on Tuesday (70% say they think he will carry the day, though just 36% of Haley backers feel that way), and more say they would be satisfied were he to become the party’s presidential nominee than would feel that way about Haley or DeSantis (61% say they would be either enthusiastic or satisfied should Trump win the nomination, compared with 54% each saying the same about Haley or DeSantis).
And Trump continues to be viewed more favorably than either Haley or DeSantis within the primary electorate: 56% have a positive view of Trump, compared with 36% who feel that way about Haley and 28% about DeSantis. He is the only remaining candidate to have maintained a net positive favorability rating throughout the past year, while Haley ends the campaign for the Granite State in negative territory.
The state’s Republican primary electorate also has a broadly positive outlook on what Trump actually did as president. Looking back on his first term in office, 70% of likely Republican primary voters say that he did more to help the country than hurt it, while 28% say he did more to hurt and 2% that his time in office didn’t make much of a difference.
The survey asked whether Trump would attempt – and whether he would succeed at – six things he’s talked about doing during the campaign: building a wall along the US border with Mexico, appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” President Joe Biden and his family, dismantling the “deep state,” repealing Obamacare and replacing it with another health care law, bringing the war between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and reimposing a travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries.
Majorities in the GOP electorate say that if he wins, Trump would likely succeed in accomplishing four out of those six: building the wall (71% say he would definitely or probably succeed in doing so), ending the war between Ukraine and Russia (59%), reimposing the travel ban (56%) and appointing a prosecutor to go after the Biden family (53%). Far fewer see Trump as likely to succeed at dismantling the deep state (39%) or repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (34%).
Most New Hampshire residents agree with likely Republican voters that should Trump win the presidency, he is at least probably going to accomplish reimposing the travel ban (58%), appointing a special prosecutor to go after the Biden family (56%) and building the wall (52%). But there are deep partisan divisions in views on his prospects for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia; 71% of Republicans feel he will at least probably succeed in that effort, compared with 33% of independents and 8% of Democrats; 79% of Democrats say that Trump is unlikely to even try to bring the war to an end. And few of any partisan stripe feel he’s likely to repeal and replace the ACA (26% overall).
There is also a notable partisan divide over the chances that Trump will try or succeed in appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family. Nearly all Democrats think he will at least try (90%) compared with about two-thirds of independents and Republicans (63% each). Democrats are also most apt to say it is at least probable that he will succeed (64% say so), with only about half of Republicans (51%) or independents (47%) saying the same.
About two-thirds of likely primary voters on the Democratic side say they plan to write in Biden (63%). Biden did not file to be a candidate on the state’s primary ballot because the primary is in violation of the Democratic National Committee’s rules for the nomination process, but supporters have mounted a write-in effort on his behalf. Nearly all likely Democratic primary voters are aware of that effort; 91% said they had heard that Biden would not be on the ballot before taking the survey. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips holds 10% support in the poll, matching his high mark in CNN/UNH polling on the race, and author Marianne Williamson has 9% support, with 11% saying they would support someone else.
Nearly all Biden backers, 92%, say they have definitely decided to support him, compared with just 28% of those who are supporting another candidate. Most in the Democratic primary electorate say they would be at least satisfied with Biden as their party’s nominee (70% say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied), but enthusiasm for Biden among Democratic primary voters (31%) is lower than enthusiasm for Trump on the GOP side (46%).
Still, just 46% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that Biden would give the party its best chance to win in 2024, while 39% say someone else would give Democrats a better chance, and 15% say they’re not sure. There is little agreement among those who say someone else would be better around who that might be. Phillips is most frequently mentioned at 28%, but a wide range of other names also emerge.
Most likely Democratic primary voters say that in Biden’s time as president he has done more to help the country than hurt it (71% help, 16% hurt, 11% hasn’t made much difference).
But neither Biden nor Trump is seen by most New Hampshirites as helping the country during their respective presidencies. Overall, 55% of New Hampshire adults say that Trump hurt the country as president, and 51% say that Biden has. There isn’t much overlap between the two groups. Only 8% total say that both men did more to hurt than help, just 1% that both of them did more to help, 41% say that Trump helped and Biden hurt, 35% that Trump hurt and Biden helped, and 10% that Trump hurt while Biden hasn’t made much difference.
The CNN New Hampshire poll was conducted online January 16-19 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Results among the full sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults drawn from a probability-based panel have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. Likely Republican and Democratic primary voters were identified through survey questions about their intention to vote. Results among 1,210 likely Republican primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Results among 838 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

She served as governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
As we approach New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary on Tuesday, America’s democracy is more challenged than at any point during my lifetime. The threat of a second term for Donald Trump means that our country’s fundamental values and electoral system itself are on the ballot in 2024.
Despite the attempt to change the primary calendar, Granite Staters on Tuesday will write in President Joe Biden precisely because of our passion for citizen-led democracy and our commitment to protecting the future of our country.
This year, President Biden’s name will not be on the primary ballot over a dispute with the Democratic National Committee, which voted to change the date of the New Hampshire primary. It decided to disqualify the state from receiving any delegates after determining that South Carolina should be the first primary — but that has not stopped Granite Staters from organizing a write-in campaign and continuing our engagement with the democratic process.
Since its inception, the New Hampshire presidential primary has helped strengthen our democracy and elect better presidents. The “all-hands-on-deck” spirit of our state means we participate in town meetings, volunteer for our community and elect a 424-member volunteer citizen legislature to serve a population of 1.4 million.
Our commitment to civic participation is in part why the people of New Hampshire helped create the modern primary — Granite Staters were among the first in the nation who decided that instead of selecting party delegates in the backrooms, all voters across the state should have a say. We helped wrestle nominating contests from the grips of party bosses, holding our first in the nation primary — where voters choose party delegates — for the first time in 1920. In 1952, voters started directly selecting their preferred presidential nominee.

The New Hampshire primary has always helped strengthen our democracy. In our polarized political moment — where social media, algorithms and some partisan politicians sow discord and drive more Americans to the extremes — it has become challenging for voters to sort truth from misinformation. In order to help bridge this divide, voters need the opportunity to engage with candidates face-to-face and in real time.
In other larger states, campaigns are won and lost by massive ad buys or flashy rallies where candidates may never come face to face with a question from a voter, but the small size of our state provides candidates the opportunity to do things differently. Our primary provides an ideal proving ground for candidates to have direct, person-to-person interactions with the people who they wish to serve.
In our state, candidates can travel in just an hour or two from our largest cities that grapple with challenges like homelessness to our rural communities where the lack of high-speed internet continues to hold back families and the economy.
Successful candidates in our primary have to be prepared to win one conversation at a time, talking to voters of all ages, backgrounds and — particularly in a state where independents are a plurality of voters — all political stripes. Because New Hampshire’s government requires an unusually high degree of citizen engagement, direct access to elected officials is routine for most Granite Staters and we are not easily swayed or impressed by slick advertising or large entourages.
Related article Opinion: Trump’s Iowa win shows the Republican nomination is no contest
In our state, candidates who expend shoe leather and spend time listening have a shot against those who start the contest well known or with big war chests, which is why it is critical that New Hampshire goes first. It is also important to note that New Hampshire is not the only early state; while our state continues to grow in its racial diversity, especially among young people, the group of early primary states has strong racial and geographic diversity.
New Hampshire’s person-to-person style of campaigning also forces candidates to answer direct questions from the voters. Just last month we were reminded how skilled Granite Staters are at holding candidates to account when Nikki Haley was pressed about what was the cause of the American Civil War and she refused to say that it was caused by slavery. She later backpedaled her comments and said “of course the Civil War was about slavery.” These direct questions that get to the heart of a candidate’s character are just one of the ways that our primary helps produce stronger nominees.
In this time of polarization, having a primary that places a premium on direct conversations between candidates and citizens is invaluable; it is not only how citizens can hold candidates to account, but it gives us a chance to see how democracy works at its best. It bridges divisions and helps us see the priorities and heartaches that we have in common. New Hampshire’s commitment to empowering citizens — and in treating those who would lead us as “citizens in chief” — has made our first in the nation primary indispensable and our democracy stronger.
Granite Staters’ commitment to democracy is why we will continue to hold our primary and why we organized a write-in campaign to support President Biden.

The dangers of another Trump presidency are clear. As just one example, at a rally last November in Claremont, Trump echoed fascist dictators by calling his political opponents “vermin,” and he has continued to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
President Biden, on the other hand, is committed to protecting our democracy and to working on behalf of the American people — regardless of political party — to deliver results. At a time when many believed that bipartisanship was impossible, President Biden has demonstrated that our democracy can work, passing bipartisan legislation to lower costs, invest in manufacturing here at home and rebuild our infrastructure.
There are those who suggest that — given the DNC’s wrongheaded decision to forego New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary — Granite Staters should stay home, or refuse to vote for President Biden. We’re not going to do that. I know that New Hampshire Democrats and many independents will join me in writing in President Biden’s name on Tuesday because we understand the importance of this election for our country. We have long known that staying on the sidelines is not an option and we will put our country first."

She paired an orange and black bomber jacket with a bright yellow beanie, and loose-fitting jeans. Other guests appeared to be dressed in similarly eclectic manners.
During the live taping of the show, Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che roasted the likely 2024 presidential nominees from both parties over their ages. Biden is 81 and Trump is 77.
'Guys I don't know if we should do this election,' said Jost. 'It's honestly starting to feel like elder abuse.'
'We should tell Trump and Biden that they both won' and then essentially send them out to pasture, he joked.

'It's not a great sign that President Biden's campaign is a bigger emergency than climate change.' he said.
Jost detailed two moments on the campaign trail from last week.
Biden claimed to have had his picture taken with Congresswoman Deborah Ross at an event in North Carolina. She was, in fact, not at the event.
The gaffe was reminiscent of the tangibly awkward moment in 2022, when the president asked Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, a Republican from Indiana, to stand up. Walorski had tragically passed away in a car accident the month prior.
On the campaign trail in New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump seemed to sub rival Nikki Haley's name into a thought about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
'By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley … did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it?
'All of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security, we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down,' he said.
Trump and Biden are currently their respective party's presumptive nominees for the Oval Office.
Biden, despite a rocky first term and ongoing criticism about his old age and mental abilities, is not seriously being challenged by anyone inside the Democratic establishment for the nomination
That led Haley to question Trump fitness to serve as president, while Trump hit back at Haley's concerns.
Trump and Biden are currently their respective party's presumptive nominees for the Oval Office.
Biden, despite a rocky first term and ongoing criticism about his old age and mental abilities, is not seriously being challenged by anyone inside the Democratic establishment for the nomination.
Trump is facing several challengers, though the list has winnowed significantly and voting has only occurred in one state.
It is not remotely clear that either Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis have a path to the nomination, but the three will continue to duke it out in New Hampshire on Tuesday, followed by Nevada and South Carolina."

During an appearance on the Patrick Bet-David's podcast last week, Beck revealed that Trump - the presumptive Republican nominee - called him to ask his opinion on his VP pick.
'I said Vivek,' Beck told the four podcast hosts, adding the former president asked him to explain his answer and said: 'That's the No. 1 response from everybody I've asked that question.'
Last week, Ramaswamy suspended his presidential campaign the night of the Iowa caucus and immediately endorsed Trump. He has since appeared alongside the former president at campaign events in New Hampshire, where primary voters will cast ballots Tuesday.
Trump says he's heard from most people he's asked that he should choose Vivek Ramaswamy (left) as his VP pick
Conservative pundit Glenn Beck said he told Donald Trump to pick Ramaswamy as his VP because he will defend the Trump message and carry it on in 2028
Beck explained he told Trump that Ramaswamy will be an effective surrogate for his campaign and its message, as well as being a skilled attack dog and defender of Trump's record and vision.
'He can defend you, he's right in your pocket,' said Beck. 'Some of his ideas are really, really good,' and he 'connects with the youth.'
'People are excited about something fresh and different,' he said of Ramaswamy, also making the case that young voters who supported Joe Biden in 2020 are not supporting the president anymore but haven't moved into Trump's camp yet. Vivek, he argued, may appeal to those voters.
Finally, Beck told the former president, 77, that Ramaswamy is someone who could potentially carry on his White House legacy, once he's termed out for good.
'In 2028, when you can no longer run, you continue for another eight years, and you get the credit for bringing this new fresh face in,' he said.
Beck noted Trump remained coy about where his own head is regarding his ultimate pick for his ticket partner.
'Well. We'll see,' Beck said was Trump's closing thought during their conversation.
At present, Vivek remains a strong odds-on pick for the veep slot, but currently ahead of him on US betting markets are South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, whose name has floated around Trump-world since early in his first term, and House GOP Chairwoman Elise Stefanik.
Noem is the current favorite, according to oddschecker.com, but the situation is dynamic and the primary is long.

Trump has reportedly seen New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as an up and coming star and has been impressed by her consistent loyalty
Last week, Trump spent Tuesday night with businessman and former rival Vivek Ramaswamy in New Hampshire - just one night after he won the Iowa caucus by 30 points and Ramaswamy suspended his campaign and immediately endorsed Trump.
Ramaswamy, 38, a charismatic multi-multi-millionaire, came in a distant fourth in the Iowa caucuses, behind Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.
After Ramaswamy pledged to help him beat President Joe Biden, Trump seemed to suggest that there was much the successful entrepreneur could do for his campaign.
'He's going to be working with us and he'll be working with us for a long time,' Trump said, as many in the crowd chanted for Ramaswamy to become the vice presidential nominee.
'He's a fantastic guy,' Trump said. 'He's got something that's very special because he started off with a zippo and he ended up very strong.'
'He did a great job. I was actually surprised when he called because he was doing well. And it's an honor to have his endorsement,' Trump added.
On Monday night, Trump was complimentary of Ramaswamy during the Trump campaign's victory celebration.
'I also want to congratulate Vivek because he did one hell of a job. He came from zero … that's an amazing job,' Trump said.
Later Trump commended Ramaswamy on Truth Social for endorsing him.
'Thank you Vivek, a Great Honor!' wrote the presumptive Republican nominee.
Trump and Vivek embrace at a campaign event in New Hampshire one day after the Iowa caucus, which Trump handily won. Ramaswamy dropped out after a fourth-place finish and immediately endorsed the former president
At a Mar-a-Lago dinner back in December, Trump reportedly called Stefanik a 'killer,' citing her loyalty and saying he's been impressed
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is also making her case for the ticket partner gig and Team Trump is reportedly listening.
At a Mar-a-Lago dinner back in December, Trump reportedly called Stefanik a 'killer,' citing her loyalty and saying he's been impressed.
'Stefanik is at the top,' said longtime Trump backer and 2016 chief strategist Steve Bannon, according to CNBC.
'If you're Trump, you want someone who's loyal above all else,' said one GOP operative. 'Particularly because he sees Mike Pence as having made a fatal sin.'
Stefanik is campaigning with Trump ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary but declined to comment when asked about the VP job.
But, during a recent Meet the Press interview, she certainly didn't say no.
'Well, I, of course, would be honored to serve in any capacity in a Trump administration,' Stefanik said.
Stefanik became the first member of Republican leadership to offer her endorsement of Trump's reelection bid, before the former president has even formally announced a run himself.
'Republican voters determine who is the leader of the Republican Party and it's very clear President Trump is the leader of the Republican party,' Stefanik said in a statement.
'I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President in 2024. I fully support him running again,' the New York Republican said."

About an hour into his campaign event at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, a man in the crowd yelled at the former president: 'He's a dictator.'
'Get him out,' Trump said as security surrounded the man and removed him from the arena.
'Now we know that politics is getting serious,' Trump quipped. He has joked he would be a dictator for 'only one day' if he's elected for a second term to the White House in December.
A second man, dressed in a white KKK outfit, was removed from the rally site before he could get down into the crowd. A Daily Mail photographer captured him trying to enter and being removed by security near the arena entrance.
With four days to go until New Hampshire's primary, Trump spoke to his MAGA faithful for nearly two hours. He doubled down on his attacks on Nikki Haley, bringing in a group of lawmakers from her home state of South Carolina who have endorsed him, and got in some taunts at Ron DeSantis, quipping 'I think he's gone.'

He also hit back at Haley for questioning whether he is 'mentally fit' to be president after he appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing Haley of being in charge of security in the Capitol on the day of the January 6th insurrection.
'I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago. Is that possible?,' Trump said.
He also said he took another cognitive test in New Hampshire and 'aced it.'
He spent the early part of his rally doubling down on his attacks on Nikki Haley, bringing in a group of lawmakers from her home state of South Carolina who have endorsed him, and got in some taunts at Ron DeSantis, quipping 'I think he's gone.'
In addition to slamming his rivals, he called Joe Biden the 'worst' president in U.S. history and ran through his laundry list of campaign promises, including protecting the Southern border.
'I'm desperate to get your vote,' Trump told the crowd.
He targeted Haley the hardest. The former governor of South Carolina has seen some movement in the polls as she campaigns in New Hampshire even though Trump still leads by double digits.
'Almost every politician from South Carolina is endorsing me. How do you do that if you're governor?,' Trump swiped at Haley, who served as governor of the state for six years.
He then brought out South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and a slew of other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. Joining them were the state's Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry.
'You know what I'm doing? I'm kissing a**,' Trump said, noting South Carolina was the next primary in the Republican presidential contest.
McMaster told the cheering crowd the officials the group was there 'for one reason.'
'You've heard this, those great philosophers, the Spice Girls. Tell us what you want, what you really really want. Well, that's what we're here. To do to tell you what we in fact want, what we really really want' is Donald Trump, he said.
After the rally, Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller told reporters that Haley needs to drop out of the race and support Trump. He said polls show she has no where to go to win the nomination.
'There's nowhere for Nikki Haley. There's recent polling shows that she is down by 39 points in South Carolina,' Miller said, pointing to the South Carolina officials who had endorsed Trump. The state's Senator Tim Scott had endorsed Trump on Friday.
'There's nowhere for Haley to come. So after President Trump wins on Tuesday, Nikki Haley needs to drop out.'
The man was removed by law enforcement from Trump's rally

Trump, meanwhile, spent the evening on the attack and brought up some of his old complaints, including his false charge the 2020 election was stolen from him and that he was a victim of government witch hunt with the legal cases against him.
He took multiple hits at DeSantis, who is trailing in the polls and left New Hampshire to campaign in South Carolina. DeSantis also canceled his scheduled appearances on the Sunday morning political shows.
'I haven't even mentioned the name of Ron DeSanctimonious yet — I think he's gone,' Trump said as the crowd roared.
Someone in the crowd yelled 'loser.' 'You did not just say that,' Trump joked back as the audience laughed.
But he continued on, saying of DeSantis: 'I think he is going to be out pretty soon based off what I'm hearing.'
He accused Haley of wanting 'to turn liberal voters into Republicans for about two minutes while they vote and then go back to being liberal voters.'
Trump has repeatedly accused Haley of courting New Hampshire Democrats to vote for her in the Republican primary.
'Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to fund a radical Democrat campaign operation that she's running,' he said.
'The Radical Left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley for one reason because they know she's very easy to beat. She's gonna be very easy to beat. She's down,' Trump said.
More voters in New Hampshire identify themselves as 'unaffiliated' - or Independent - than they do Republican or Democrat.
Those 'unaffiliated' voters can choose which party's primary they want to vote in and Haley has been courting that group hard.
Voters can also switch their affiliation if they want to change which contest they vote in - however the deadline to do that was in October, meaning there are no more switches allowed.
Ahead of the October deadline, about 3,500 Democrats in New Hampshire switched their party registration to unaffiliated, meaning they can vote in the Republican contest should they choose.

Trump told his crowd of devoted supporters they need to come out in droves for him on Tuesday.
'We need big margins because we have to send real unity as a message. Because with real unity they won't be able to cheat,' he said.
The former president also referenced his immunity battle with the Supreme Court. Trump is arguing he should be immune from prosecution on charges that he plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 election because he was president at the time.
'So a president has to be given immunity and this has nothing to do with me,' he told his rally. 'This has to do with every single president. As an example when Biden gets out , I'm that guy has got a list to go after. But you have to give a president immunity.'
He argued President Harry Truman would have never have dropped an atomic bomb without immunity.
But he also bragged about his prosecutors, saying: 'Every time the radical left Democrats boxes communists and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor.'
Trump also made an unusual move in his rally. He endorsed Rep. Dean Philips, who is challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, in New Hampshire's Democratic primary.
'I think Democrats should vote for the Congressman just to send a signal,' he said of Phillips.
He then touted his own endorsement, noting of Phillips: 'He just picked up a lot of votes by the way.'"

The Florida Governor, widely considered the future of the Republican party and initially the favorite to take down Trump, announced he was suspending his campaign in a surprise video Sunday afternoon.
It followed mounting speculation that donors were fleeing and his campaign was struggling to find a path to make a dent in Trump's huge polling lead.
Trump said he was 'honored' by DeSantis' endorsement and called for Republicans to 'rally' behind the former president's 2024 White House bid.
DeSantis came second in the Iowa caucuses and largely avoided campaigning in New Hampshire so he could focus on South Carolina – the home state of 2024 candidate Nikki Haley.
But the writing was on the wall when the campaign fired half its staff, big-money backers were increasingly frustrated with his war on 'woke' and top brass were at each other's throats.
DeSantis channeled Winston Churchill in his farewell video and called Haley a 'repackaged form of warmed-up corporatism'.
His final warning was for Republicans not to go 'back to yesteryear' and confirmed he would support Trump, the opponent who has mocked and humiliated him for the last year.

Trump endorsed DeSantis in his 2018 bid for governor in Florida, using his coattails to help earn him the Republican nomination and eventually the win
'We don't have a clear path to victory,' DeSantis said in the video posted to X announcing his departure from the race. 'Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.'
Now the Republican primary is down to a two-person race with only former President Trump and his once-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley vying for the nomination.
'I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race,' Haley said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday afternoon. 'He's been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.'
Despite repeatedly bashing Trump for refusing to debate in the primary cycle and taking several hits from the ex-president calling him 'Ron DeSanctimonious', the governor decided to endorse his former rival.
Trump said during an unannounced stop at his New Hampshire campaign headquarters that after DeSantis' announcement on Sunday he has 'officially retired' the 'DeSanctimonious' nickname.
Throughout the campaign, Trump called DeSantis a 'traitor' for deciding to run for president in 2024 after the former president's endorsement is what led him to clinch the Republican nomination for governor in Florida in 2018.
'It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,' DeSantis said. 'They watch his presidency gets stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.'
He added: 'Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.'
'I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.'
The pledge in question is what the Republican National Committee (RNC) required all candidates to sign, vowing to support the eventual nominee if they wanted to participate in their four primary debates last year. Trump never signed the pledge and refused to show up for the debates.
'[W]e are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates,' Trump's campaign wrote in a statement Sunday afternoon. 'It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.'
'Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement,' the statement said, adding: 'She represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans.'
DeSantis' young family joined him for most of his time campaigning. Pictured: Ron, Casey, Madison, six, Mason, five, and Mamie, three, appear together on stage at a campaign event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Saturday, January 20 – the day before Gov. DeSantis dropped out of the race

After no guidance was sent for events on Sunday or Monday ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, speculation began to swirl over where DeSantis had landed after his Saturday swing.
The announcement of the end of his campaign was filmed in Florida, where it is now known he returned to after holding his last 2024 campaign event in South Carolina on Saturday.
Moments after the video went live, guidance was sent canceling DeSantis' meet and greet in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday evening.
DeSantis' campaign vehemently denied to DailyMail.com on Sunday any rumors that could emerge detailing DeSantis' plans to drop out – but just hours later, the governor released a video on X ending his bid.
'Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,' DeSantis said in a four-and-a-half video on his exit from the campaign. 'Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward.'
'If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,' he continued. 'But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources.'
It appeared that DeSantis would stay in the race until after South Carolina in hopes that Haley would do poorly in her home state and drop out.
But instead, he chose to exit before New Hampshire could weigh-in on Tuesday.
'[Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear – a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism – that Nikki Haley represents,' he said in slamming the former president's only remaining GOP contender.
DeSantis' launched his campaign in a disasterous Twitter Spacces event before CEO Elon Musk rebranded the website to X. Instead of starting off with the anticipated 'historic' social media announcement, the app experienced a series of glitches that wouldn't let the event kick-off
DeSantis' final days in the race had him frantically trying to figure out where his message might best resonate after he lost Iowa to Trump by 30 points.
After completing the 'full Grassley' in Iowa by traveling to all 99 counties and receiving the endorsement of the state's popular Gov. Kim Reynolds, DeSantis still couldn't turn ou the vote for a win in the caucuses on January 15.
The day after the Iowa caucuses DeSantis flew to Greenville, South Carolina to get a jump start in the fourth primary contest state in hopes voters would turn against Nikki Haley there.
After the quick South Carolina stop, DeSantis flew back to New Hampshire later that day before CBS News broke on Wednesday that the governor planned to leave the Granite State - possibly for good - to again campaign in South Carolina all weekend.
That trip, however, ended up lasting one day – with three events. It concluded with headlines on how DeSantis sparred with a fourth grade teacher over Haley's education record as governor.
On Sunday, instead of campaigning in South Carolina, DeSantis was expected to fly back to New Hampshire. But after canceling appearances on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's State of the Union in the process, it became clear something else was afoot.
Hours later on Sunday morning he dropped out of the race and canceled remaining events."

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) dismissed concerns over how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis might perform in New Hampshire in Tuesday's primary election, noting that there were 'never high expectations' in the first-in-the-nation state.
For weeks the DeSantis campaign has assured the governor plans to stay in the race through at least after the South Carolina primaries in late February.
But strategists have now determined that the Florida Governor is hoping Haley will perform poorly in South Carolina, drop out and turn the primary into a two-person race between DeSantis and former President Donald Trump.
'We never had high expectations for New Hampshire anyway,' Rep. Massie told Fox News Sunday. 'And Nikki's exploiting, you know, a quirk of their primary, which is that undeclareds – i.e. Democrats – can vote in a Republican primary.'
Rep. Thomas Massie, a top surrogate for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said Sunday that 'the real fight is in South Carolina' in downplaying concerns over how the 2024 hopeful will perform on Tuesday
Gov. DeSantis is in New Hampshire campaigning but some have criticized the campaign over spending more focus on South Carolina – specifically after he flew directly there after Iowa's caucuses earlier this month
Along with left-leaning independent voters who plan to cast their ballot for Haley, there is a mass write-in campaign from Democrats who are looking to put Joe Biden's name down during Tuesday's primary election.
Haley is polling second in New Hampshire, with other surveyed earlier this month putting her within single-digits of Trump – and one poll showing them in a tie with 40 percent each.
Two polls released on Sunday from Suffolk/Boston Globe and CNN put Trump in first by about 20 points, Haley in second and DeSantis in third with 6 percent support among Republican New Hampshire voters.
'You know, I'll be going to New Hampshire later today,' Massie said. 'But the real fight, I think, is in South Carolina. And that's where Nikki Haley, I think, stumbles'
'She's going to miss expectations and not even win her own state,' the DeSantis surrogate predicted.
DeSantis' team is banking on Haley doing poorly in her home state of South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011-2017 before joining Trump's administration.

South Carolina is holding the fourth Republican primary contest on Saturday, February 24 – almost exactly a month of the New Hampshire primary election. The Palmetto State is the last of the early primary states for Republicans and could be a make-or-break moment for DeSantis and Haley.
Candidates are expected to turn attention to Nevada after New Hampshire for the primary and caucus there before heading back to South Carolina.
Then 15 states will all vote in their respective primaries on March 5, 2024 in what is known as Super Tuesday."

But on Saturday, he was given internal polling data that showed he had no chance of winning the state and would finish far behind former President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with discussions.
His aides canceled appearances on the Sunday morning shows as they debated what to do next.
And on Sunday afternoon, the Florida governor formally pulled the plug on his 2024 campaign.
'I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources, if we don't have a clear path to victory,' he said.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis surprised many by stepping away from New Hampshire to campaign in South Carolina over the weekend. He is seen here carrying his daughter Mamie while his eldest daughter Madison yawns and his son Mason watches ahead of an event in Myrtle Beach
The decision took donors and staff at a super PAC backing DeSantis by surprise.
They were traveling to New Hampshire as part of the last push before voters in the state made their decision.
But his prospects there were bleak.
A poll published Sunday morning found he was on course for just six percent of the vote, behind Trump on 50 percent and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on 39 points.
He was already digesting difficult numbers from South Carolina, where he had hoped to get his campaign back on track and where he campaigned at the weekend.
'I think that was the reason for the timing,' said a source familiar with discussions.
A second source close to the DeSantis camp told DailyMail.com: 'They were struggling to explain what the path to the nomination would even look like. That's how bad things were.'
The announcement came hours after Trump had delivered his own South Carolina show of strength.
Standing on stage before thousands of people at an arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump was joined by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster; Pamela Evette, the state's lieutenant governor; Alan Wilson, the state's attorney general; South Carolina House Speaker Murrell Smith; and Curtis Loftis, the state treasurer.
Recent polls showed DeSantis on only five or six percent in New Hampshire, finishing a distant third to former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley
DeSantis posed for selfies with supporters in Myrtle Beach Saturday
They were joined by three U.S. congressmen from the state: Reps. Russell Fry, William Timmons and Joe Wilson.
It was designed to try to knock Haley from the race, demonstrating her lack of support in her own state. It may have also reminded DeSantis of the uphill struggle he faced.
When it came, the decision took DeSantis world by surprise.
'We had people heading up to New Hampshire as this was happening,' said a staffer at Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis.
With the South Carolina primary not until February 24, he said donors were probably getting anxious about the financial outlay needed to even be competitive.
'They were probably looking at the prospect of having to pay everybody through South Carolina or let people go,' he said.
'That's still a month away. And so that was probably a big factor.'
DeSantis had once been seen as the next big political star of the Republican Party.
New Hampshire holds its Republican primary on Tuesday, the second contest in the race
DeSantis' decision leaves Trump opposition to coalesce around Haley, but she faces an uphill battle to rein in the clear Republican frontrunner
He won a crushing reelection as Florida governor in November 2022. But he delayed launching his campaign until May, effectively giving Trump a six-month headstart.
His operation was bedeviled by internal turmoil, and constant headlines about tension between his campaign and Never Back Down.
Senior personnel were reshuffled and staff laid off as he struggled for traction in the polls.
Dan Eberhart, one of his donors, said his biggest problem was going up against Trump.
'I'm not shocked,' he said about Sunday's announcement. 'I think Trump is a generational figure and normal politicians struggle to get the oxygen to compete against him.'
Eberhart said he heard the news while en route to New Hampshire.
'He doesn't want to come in third against Nikki Haley,' he said. 'And it's all about preserving 2028 viability.'
Poll after poll showed that DeSantis was the second choice of many Trump supporters but simply could not lure support away from the former president.
And among attendees at Trump's Manchester rally on Saturday evening, many said they wished DeSantis had stood aside for Trump.
'If he would have just waited four years ... ' said Steven Apfel, 30, who accused DeSantis of disloyalty by challenging Trump.
'He was like the heir apparent and why he did that just goes to show how he's part of the establishment.'"

The Granite State governor and top campaign surrogate also questioned whether Trump is mentally fit to serve another White House term after he appeared to confuse Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
New Hampshire voters are heading to the polls Tuesday, January 23 for the first-in-the-nation Republican primary election following Iowa's caucuses earlier this month.
Nikki Haley is looking to perform better in New Hampshire after a disappointing third-place finish in Iowa with 19.1 percent of the vote.

A few polls earlier this month put Haley within one-digit of Trump and one even put them in a dead tie with 40 percent each. Sununu says this is already a big feat with Trump's massive lead and hold over GOP voters and says even coming within the former president in Tuesday's election would be a massive win.
'Is this make or break for her to stay in this race?' NBC Meet the Press host Kristen Welker asked Sununu during a Sunday morning interview.
'No, no. She doesn't have to win,' Sununu replied. 'I mean, look, nobody goes from single digits in December to 'you absolutely have to win' in January. I think that's a media expectation that's being set out there.'
'The fact that it can happen at all, right? Trump said he was going to run the table and win all 50 states. And everyone said, 'Yep, it's a done deal.' It's not a done deal,' he added. 'She's challenging him here, and now she, again, gets to go to her home state where she's won a lot before, she knows how to do it on the ground.'
He said that Haley has a while until the primary in South Carolina, where she served as the first female governor from 2011-2017 before joining Trump's administration as his Ambassador to the United Nations. She has not ruled out running on the 2024 ticket as Trump's vice presidential candidate.
Sununu claims that in the weeks before South Carolina, Haley can make up ground even if she doesn't perform well in New Hampshire or Nevada.
'Nikki's going to have a lot of time to build on the momentum she's already created,' he insisted.
In an argument against Trump's candidacy, Sununu said he agrees with Haley when saying Trump is no longer fit to serve as president.
'Is Donald Trump mentally fit to serve as president?' Welker asked.
'Look, whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump, either one get off the teleprompter, they can barely make a cogent point,' Sununu replied.
She pushed: 'So is Trump mentally fit? You're saying he's not?'
'Not in that moment, he sure as heck wasn't,' Sununuy said. 'I mean, look, the point is you have two nearly 80-year-olds fighting this thing out. That's not what America wants. That is a great example of – this is not Donald Trump, the disruptor of 2016.'
'This guy has lost his fastball. You know, that's a great example of it,' the New Hampshire governor said. 'We always want to go forward in America, right? We always want that next generation. Neither of these guys represent the next generation.'
During a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire on Saturday, Trump touted his mental fitness
During a rally in New Hampshire, Trump appeared to confuse Haley with Pelosi in talking about the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.
'By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley – did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything. Deleted it, destroyed all of it – all of it – because of lots of things,' Trump said to thousands of his supporters.
'Like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered her 10,000 people – soldiers, National Guard soldiers – whatever she wanted.'
It appears Trump meant to reference Pelosi, who was House Speaker at the time of the riots at the U.S. Capitol and who the former president has repeatedly blamed for being in charge of security that day.
Haley tried to downplay her criticism of Trump, but did say that the latest gaffe is proof the 77-year-old is not fit to serve any longer.
'I'm not saying anything derogatory, but when you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this,' Haley said Saturday while campaigning in New Hampshire.
'I wasn't even in DC on January 6. I wasn't in office then,' she added. 'They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he was talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.'"

A caller to 911 early Monday morning sounded the alarm about a fire and a person trapped inside the Washington DC landmark.
'It was quickly determined there was no emergency,' a fire service spokesperson said. The bogus call was traced to a fake number. President Joe Biden spent the weekend at Camp David and wasn't present at the time.
The brazen hoax, directing crews to such a beloved and historic property, highlighted the scale of America's rising swatting incidents — which by some counts has exploded fivefold in recent years.
An LAPD swat team arrive at the scene of an armed robbery. Prank 'swatting' calls make cops less able to respond to real emergencies
The Education School Safety Network says hoax calls about mass shooters have become the most frequent violent problem faced by America's schools
Selena Gomez, Tom Cruise, Miley Cyrus, Ashton Kutcher, and other celebrities have been targeted in swatting hits that stretch back to the start of the 2010s.
But, in America's toxic political atmosphere, trouble-making callers are nowadays more likely to call out gun-toting cops to the home of a government official or decision-maker.
Recent targets have included Republican Senator Rick Scott, House representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Brandon Williams, and a prosecutor and judges involved in the cases against former president Donald Trump.
'Last month, criminals attempted a 'swatting' on my home in Florida,' Scott wrote in a statement on Wednesday.
It was a 'despicable act of cowardice, clearly intending to terrorize my family and inflict fear and violence,' he added.
Scott and his Alabama counterpart Tommy Tuberville this week unveiled a bill to amend the federal government's criminal hoax statute and establish strict penalties for swatting.
The Preserving Safe Communities by Ending Swatting Act, as it is known, could land hoax callers behind bars for up to 20 years, if their misdeeds led to serious injuries.
'This is happening around the nation, not just to elected officials, but also to hundreds of Jewish institutions,' Scott said. 'It's sickening, dangerous and we must stop it.'
Swatting is a dangerous criminal hoax where a false report of an emergency, crime, mass shooting, imminent bombing, or kidnapping is made to police with the goal of luring them to a target location.
The goal is typically to cause the deployment of a heavily armed police unit — often referred to as SWAT teams because of the 'special weapons and tactics' they use against armed adversaries.
Law enforcement is frequently advised falsely there is a threat inside a home, putting those inside the property in danger during a heavy-handed response.
Swatting attempts have increased in recent years as a form of online harassment and often target celebrities, political figures and internet livestreams.
Swatting has been on the FBI's radar for nearly two decades, and gained notoriety after high-profile celebrities were targeted in the early 2010s.
Studying what was then a 'new phenomenon' in 2008, FBI researchers said swatters were motivated by 'bragging rights and ego' rather than making money.
House Republican firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene says she's been a swatting victim eight times
Selena Gomez (pictured), Tom Cruise, Miley Cyrus, and Ashton Kutcher are among the celebrity victims of swatting
But those motivations have evolved over time.
Some swatters nowadays make bogus calls because they foster personal or political grievances and want to disrupt operations at a targeted school, college, house of worship or business.
Others seek to divert law enforcement resources away from other crimes, or have worked out some way to make money from a hoax.
Kevin Coffey, an LAPD detective-turned-safety consultant, says swatting has become a modern-day scourge that amounts to 'digital terrorism.'
'These digital hoaxes are turning others' lives upside down, and even, in some cases, causing deaths,' Coffey told Fox News.
For some, swatting is a way to settle scores amid heated debates over abortion and other issues, he said.
They want to 'take revenge on political individuals, people in the government, celebrities, and even journalists and people active in their communities, and law enforcement has to respond in force at full capacity,' Coffey added.
Swatting calls have had fatal consequences, after tactical units show up at homes with their fingers on triggers.
Wichita police erroneously shot and killed 28-year-old Andrew Finch at his front door in December 2017.
The call had been made over a row about an online video game.
Mark Herring, 60, died from a massive heart attack after police swarmed his home in Sumner County, Tennessee.
Schools in southern Florida have suffered a spate in disruptive swatting calls in recent weeks
Democrat Chuck Schumer calls swatting 'dangerous, disturbing and downright terrifying'
In June, the FBI launched a national database to track swatting incidents following a push from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
The New York Democrat called the attacks 'dangerous, disturbing and downright terrifying.'
Watchdogs have reported alarming rises in the number of swatting attacks.
The Secure Community Network, which monitors anti-Semitic attacks, in December recorded what it called a 'staggering' 199 swatting calls and bomb hoaxes targeting Jewish facilities in a single 24-hour period.
They were linked to the outrage over Israel's tough response to Hamas's bloodbath raids into southern Israel in October, the group said.
The group recorded more than 449 such attacks throughout 2023 – a more than fivefold increase on the 83 incidents in 2023.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, wants tougher jail terms to deter would-be swatters
Swatting had become a 'major concern for the safety and security of the Jewish community in North America, the group's national director Michael Masters said in a statement.
At the same time, the Education School Safety Network, warned that hoax calls about mass shooters had become the most frequent violent problem faced by America's schools.
The group counted 446 such false reports in the 2022-2023 school year — a more than fivefold surge on the 69 such incidents during the 2018-2019 school year.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said it was clear that 'swatting calls are on the rise.'
Politicians should get behind the draft Republican bill to put swatters behind bars for decades.
'Stricter penalties act as a deterrent,' Johnson said."

Among Republican voters in the first-in-the-nation state, 55 percent say they support former President Trump, which is 19 percentage points more than those who say they support former United Nations Ambassador Haley (36 percent).
Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has fallen to a far-distant third with only 6 percent support, according to the Suffolk poll commissioned by NBC10 Boston and the Boston Globe.
The results follow Haley's disappointing third place finish in the Iowa caucuses on January 15 where she earned 19.1 percent. The caucus yielded Trump a massive 51 percent victory and DeSantis a second place finish with 21.2 percent.
A New Hampshire Republican primary poll shows Nikki Haley 19% behind Donald Trump among GOP voters in the state – but 1% ahead of the former president among independent voters
Haley is hoping to see a better outcome in the more moderate state of New Hampshire, where voters express they are less wooed by Trump's MAGA agenda and DeSantis' 'anti-woke' ideology.
A few previous polls had Haley within one-digit of Trump – and an American Research Group survey taken January 12-15 showed them in a dead tie with 40 percent each. One January 4-8 poll from University of New Hampshire Survey Center/CNN showed Haley just 7 percent behind Trump.
The latest, however, shows Haley falling behind by nearly 20 points after her third-place finish in Iowa.
Independent voters might be Haley's saving grace in the primary election on Tuesday as they show to be the wildcard, the Suffolk/NBC/Boston Globe poll reveals. Independent voters are allowed to vote in the primary and cast their ballot for whoever they choose.
Many who lean left claim they will write-in President Joe Biden's name on Tuesday's ballot.
Donald Trump took a commanding victory in the Iowa caucuses with 51% of the vote, but is less popular in the more left-leaning state of New Hampshire
Haley, after coming in third in Iowa, is looking to pick-up a win in New Hampshire
Among Republican voters, Haley is 19 percent behind, but when independent voters were polled, she was actually ahead of Trump by 1 point.
Forty-five percent of the 217 independent voters surveyed say they will cast their ballot for Haley while 44 percent say they will go for Trump.
Only 5 percent say they would vote for DeSantis.
The polling in Iowa proved to be pretty accurate, with Trump winning by dozens of points against Haley and DeSantis, as well as biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, both of whom have since dropped out of the race.
Ramaswamy has since backed Trump, as has Sen. Tim Scott, who dropped out of the 2024 Republican primary in mid-November."

Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign did not get off to a good start.
The 45-year-old candidate, dubbed 'DeFuture' of the Republican Party, tried to launch his 2024 bid in May by showing off his next-gen tech savvy - with a Twitter Spaces session.
And then the app crashed.
The debacle got a good laugh from his senior citizen rivals, former President Donald Trump, 77, and President Joe Biden, 81.
'Glitchy. Tech issues. Uncomfortable silences. A complete failure to launch. And that's just the candidate!' a spokesman for Trump gleefully said. Biden chimed in with, 'This links works,' which led people to his campaign's donation site.
For the next eight months, the DeSantis campaign was plagued with problems - including chatter that he was awkward on the stump, was secretly wearing high heels and was bleeding money from his donors.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday he was leaving the presidential race after eight months. He endorsed former President Donald Trump on his way out the door
In May, the 45-year-old candidate tried to launch his 2024 presidential bid using Twitter - but the app crashed
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis laughs during an Iowa camapign stop in the lead-up to his official presidential campaign announcement in May. DeSantis' awkward demeanor on the campaign trail became one of the prevailing narratives of his failed 2024 campaign
Even before the official launch, DeSantis had to contend with some strange anecdotes in the press about him.
The Daily Beast reported in March that four years before, during a private plane trip between Tallahassee and D.C., DeSantis dug into a pudding cup - literally - using three of his fingers to consume the treat.
'He would sit in meetings and eat in front of people,' a former DeSantis staffer told The Daily Beast, 'always like a starving animal who has never eaten before ... getting s*** everywhere.'
Once he started actively campaigning, he immediately got branded as awkward, robotic and aloof.
One DeSantis staffer, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com in June that their boss had to be told 'when to smile.'
'He just needs to chill out a bit and be less stiff,' another source said. 'He always looks awkward and needs to get out and meet more people.'
Early on, DeSantis had impressive fundraising totals, but by July he had cut a third of his staff, 38 aides in total.
In turn, DeSantis' super PAC took over hosting most of the governor's campaign events.
In October, podcaster Patrick Bet-David informed DeSantis that there was a viral TikTok video airing out a conspiracy theory that he had hidden heels inside the cowboy boots he often sported at campaign events
The 2024 presidential hopeful had to contend with rumors that he was wearing hidden high heels in his cowboy boots. Politico Magazine later ran a story bolstering this claim
DeSantis - like Sen. Marco Rubio before him - also had to slap down rumors that he was wearing hidden high heels.
In October, podcaster Patrick Bet-David informed DeSantis that there was a viral TikTok video airing out a conspiracy theory that he had hidden heels inside the cowboy boots he often sported at campaign events.
TikTok user Spamellina had sketched the shape of a high heel over the photo of DeSantis in his boots and then shared a picture of a pair of women's wedged boots for comparison.
'No, no, no those are just standard, off the rack Lucchese,' DeSantis said in defense, name-dropping a popular cowboy boot brand.
Politico Magazine later ran a story quoting three expert shoemakers who bolstered the hidden lifts claim.
The dig stuck, with Donald Trump Jr. mocking him for it on the stump in Iowa last week.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at his Iowa caucus results party on Monday. He lost to Trump by 30 points in the Hawkeye State after his campaign and super PAC spent a combined $150 million
On Saturday, DeSantis headlined three events in South Carolina in an attempt to take votes away from Nikki Haley in her home state.
DeSantis' final days in the race had him frantically trying to figure out where his message might best resonate after he lost Iowa to Trump by 30 points - at a cost of $150 million, between his campaign and his Never Back Down super PAC.
One estimate had that at $6,400 a vote.
In Iowa he had traveled to all 99 counties - dubbed the 'full Grassley' - and received the endorsement of the state's popular Gov. Kim Reynolds - but almost lost his second place status to Haley, who wasn't focusing heavily on the state.
The day after the Iowa caucuses DeSantis flew to Greensville, South Carolina to plant a flag there, with the thinking that if Haley lost South Carolina he could turn the GOP primary into a two-person race versus Trump.
At the same time, his super PAC started laying off staff.
He flew back to New Hamsphire later that day and on Wednesday CBS News broke that he planned to leave the Granite State - possibly for good - to again campaign in South Carolina all weeekend.
That trip ended up lasting one day - with three events - and concluded with headlines on how DeSantis dressed down a fourth grade teacher over Haley's education record as governor.
DeSantis was unable to say where in South Carolina he could win - nor could he point to a Super Tuesday state where the campaign could put its focus.
On Sunday, instead of campaigning in South Carolina, DeSantis was expected to fly back to New Hamsphire - cancelling appearances on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's State of the Union in the process.
Instead he returned to Florida, where he filmed the video announcement that he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Trump, kicking Haley a final time on his way out.
'He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,' DeSantis said, speaking to the camera."

Trump, 77, previously accused Pelosi, who was speaker at the time, of being in charge of security on the day of the insurrection. Daily Mail relied on video clips to report on Haley's remarks after she banned Daily Mail from covering her campaign after its exclusive report that Haley falsely denied cheating on her husband when she was accused of engaging in two extramarital affairs during her 2010 South Carolina gubernatorial campaign.

Haley has ramped up her crticism of Trump with only four days to go until New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
But the former president continues to hold a double-digit lead in the polls. The latest poll by the Boston Globe and Suffolk University shows Trump with 53%, Haley  with 36% and Ron DeSantis with 7%.
Additionally Senator Tim Scott endorsed Trump on Friday night, becoming the latest party official to back the former president. Scott is from Haley's home state of South Carolina and she appointed him to his seat when she was governor.
Trump plans to taunt Haley more with his support from her state. At his rally in Manchester on Saturday night, he hosted South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and a slew of other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. Also appearing are U.S. Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry.
But the former president raised eyebrows when he spoke at a rally in Concord, New Hampshire on Friday. Trump repeatedly referred to Haley being responsible for security during the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.
'By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they — do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it,' Trump claimed, without substantiation.
'Because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security — we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guards, whatever they want. They turned it down. They don't want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people.'
Haley repeatedly jumped on his gaffe at her campaign stops in New Hampshire on Saturday.
'When you’re 80, that’s what happens. You’re just not as sharp as you used to be,' she said. 'We need to know that the person that’s going to be in this office has the stamina to be at the top of their game.'
President Joe Biden's reelection campaign pounced on the gaffe, posting a clip of Trump's comment on X and remarking: 'A deeply confused Trump confuses Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley multiple times.'

Trump has long blamed Pelosi, a top Democrat, for the events of January 6, when a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol and attempted to stop the certification of Biden's election win.
Pelosi's office has denied those claims, saying that she had no more responsibility for Capitol security than did then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican.
A spokesperson for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com on Saturday morning.
At his event in Concord on Friday, Trump spent much of his speech disparaging Haley, and said he would 'probably' not select her as a running mate.
'She is not presidential timber,' Trump said. 'Now when I say that, that probably means that she's not going to be chosen as the vice president.'
'I know her very well. She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough. And she wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job,' Trump said. 'She's not going to be able to deal with President Xi. She's not going to be able to deal with Putin.'
Ahead of Tuesday primary election in New Hampshire, Trump has stepped up his rhetorical attacks on Haley, his main challenger in the Granite State, where an open primary format gives independent voters an influential say.

On his Truth Social platform, Trump lashed out at Haley on Friday, mocking her birth name in racially charged taunts.
Trump repeatedly referred to Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India by way of Canada, as 'Nimbra,' and apparent misspelling of her given name.
Haley, the former South Carolina governor, was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa.
Since childhood, she has always gone by her middle name, 'Nikki.' She took the surname 'Haley' upon her marriage in 1996 to Michael Haley.
Trump called Haley 'Nimbra' three times in the same post on Friday, and said she 'doesn't have what it takes.'
Trump's post was an escalation of recent attacks in which he referenced Haley's given first name - though he previously misspelled it 'Nimrada'.
He has also falsely suggested she is ineligible for the presidency because her parents were not US citizens when she was born in 1972. Haley, a US citizen at birth, meets the Constitution's citizenship requirements for the presidency.
Haley has dismissed Trump's latest attacks as proof that she threatens his bid for a third consecutive nomination.
'I'll let people decide what he means by his attacks,' Haley told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday when asked about Trump´s false assertions that her heritage disqualifies her from the Oval Office.

'It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.
'Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement. From higher taxes, to decimating Social Security and Medicare, and to open borders, she represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans.
'It’s time to choose wisely.'
DeSantis , widely considered the future of the Republican party and initially the favorite to take down Trump, announced he was suspending his campaign in a surprise video announcement Sunday afternoon.
It followed mounting speculation that donors were fleeing and his campaign was struggling to find a path to make a dent in Trump's huge polling lead.

DeSantis came second in the Iowa caucuses and largely avoided campaigning in New Hampshire so he could focus on South Carolina – the home state of 2024 candidate Nikki Haley.
But the writing was on the wall when the campaign fired half its staff, big-money backers were increasingly frustrated with his war on 'woke' and top brass were at each other's throats.
DeSantis channeled Winston Churchill in his farewell video and called Haley a 'repackaged form of warmed-up corporatism'.
His final warning was for Republicans not to go 'back to yesteryear' and confirmed he would support Trump, the opponent who has mocked and humiliated him for the last year.
'We don't have a clear path to victory,' DeSantis said in the video posted to X announcing his departure from the race. 'Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.'
Now the Republican primary is down to a two-person race with only former President Trump and his once-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley vying for the nomination.
'I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race,' Haley said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday afternoon. 'He's been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.'
Despite repeatedly bashing Trump for refusing to debate in the primary cycle and taking several hits from the ex-president, the governor decided to endorse his former rival.
Throughout the campaign, Trump called DeSantis a 'traitor' for deciding to run for president in 2024 after the former president's endorsement is what led him to clinch the Republican nomination for governor in Florida in 2018.
'It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,' DeSantis said. 'They watch his presidency gets stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.'
He added: 'Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.'
'I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.'
The pledge in question is what the Republican National Committee (RNC) required all candidates to sign, vowing to support the eventual nominee if they wanted to participate in their four primary debates last year. Trump never signed the pledge and refused to show up for the debates.

After no guidance was sent for events on Sunday or Monday ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, speculation began to swirl over where DeSantis had landed after his Saturday swing.
The announcement of the end of his campaign was filmed in Florida, where it is now known he returned to after holding his last 2024 campaign event in South Carolina on Saturday.
Moments after the video went live, guidance was sent canceling DeSantis' meet and greet in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday evening.
DeSantis' campaign vehemently denied to DailyMail.com on Sunday any rumors that could emerge detailing DeSantis' plans to drop out – but just hours later, the governor released a video on X ending his bid.
'Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,' DeSantis said in a four-and-a-half video on his exit from the campaign. 'Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward.'
'If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,' he continued. 'But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources.'
It appeared that DeSantis would stay in the race until after South Carolina in hopes that Haley would do poorly in her home state and drop out.
But instead, he chose to exit before New Hampshire could weigh-in on Tuesday.
'[Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear – a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism – that Nikki Haley represents,' he said in slamming the former president's only remaining GOP contender.
DeSantis' launched his campaign in a disasterous Twitter Spacces event before CEO Elon Musk rebranded the website to X. Instead of starting off with the anticipated 'historic' social media announcement, the app experienced a series of glitches that wouldn't let the event kick-off
DeSantis' final days in the race had him frantically trying to figure out where his message might best resonate after he lost Iowa to Trump by 30 points.
After completing the 'full Grassley' in Iowa by traveling to all 99 counties and receiving the endorsement of the state's popular Gov. Kim Reynolds, DeSantis still couldn't turn ou the vote for a win in the caucuses on January 15.
The day after the Iowa caucuses DeSantis flew to Greenville, South Carolina to get a jump start in the fourth primary contest state in hopes voters would turn against Nikki Haley there.
After the quick South Carolina stop, DeSantis flew back to New Hampshire later that day before CBS News broke on Wednesday that the governor planned to leave the Granite State - possibly for good - to again campaign in South Carolina all weekend.
That trip, however, ended up lasting one day – with three events. It concluded with headlines on how DeSantis sparred with a fourth grade teacher over Haley's education record as governor.
On Sunday, instead of campaigning in South Carolina, DeSantis was expected to fly back to New Hampshire. But after canceling appearances on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's State of the Union in the process, it became clear something else was afoot.
Hours later on Sunday morning he dropped out of the race and canceled remaining events."
1393,WRXC9GISP9_3H4HL7TGEI3Q6QL,"Ron DeSantis flounders after cash-strapped campaign fired half its staff, top brass were at each other's throats and big GOP donors fled over his war on woke",Sophie Mann For Dailymail.Com,"Published: 19:12 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 14:38 GMT, 22 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989213/Ron-DeSantis-Donald-Trump-Nikki-Haley-Republican-GOP-campaign.html,"Ron DeSantis' campaign is over - a stunning fall for a man once believed to be a serious challenger to Donald Trump.
The announcement, confirmed in a statement, comes after a disappointing 18 months during which from the Florida Republican suffered several missteps.
Last week, the popular conservative was rejected by Iowa's Republican voters in favor of another Trump nod - a result that, while not unexpected, still stung for a campaign that sunk most of its resources into the state only to come up short.
It also left him uncomfortably close to a third-place finish following a campaign filled with gaffes - including viral videos of the governor laughing, and a decision to announce his bid on Twitter, before being met with glitches and technical problems.
The campaign has also hemorrhaged staff as well as donors, whom sources earlier in the day claimed had been put off by DeSantis's insistence to push against the woke.
In a video released Sunday, the 45-year-old conceded that he and his remaining staffers '[no longer] have a clear path to victory,' and are thus calling it quits.
Hours earlier, several current and former DeSantis staffers painted a bleak picture of the current state of his campaign.
One former adviser to a DeSantis super PAC told NBC News: 'When they decided to do the Twitter Spaces launch, maybe then at that point, I knew they were stupid.'
The once shiny and hopeful idea of a DeSantis campaign was at its peak in the weeks after his astounding 20-point win in the state of Florida in November 2022 - the presidential campaign never came together as well as it seemed like they might at that time
Now, days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where DeSantis is expected to come in third (of the three remaining candidates), former supporters are hoping for a quick end to the campaign
Despite the struggles, DeSantis - until Sunday afternoon - had maintained until the end that he was going to win Iowa.
He toured the whole of the state meeting with voters, and even earned the endorsement of both the state's very popular governor Kim Reynolds, as well influential evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats.
But his retail politics play, which has often been rewarded by Iowa voters, did not pay off for the 45-year-old father of three in the notorious purple state.
The New Hampshire primary, meanwhile, had been slated for this week - though DeSantis - who in recent months had bet big on Iowa - had all but ignored it.
'We haven't spent very much money here,' he told Fox News last week, before reports surfaced Sunday that the politician was mulling how to go about a graceful exit.
'Nikki Haley is spending an inordinate amount of money here,' he added at the time, before theorizing that Trump appeared to be benefitting from his big win in the battleground state.
That momentum, he conceded, looked to be poised to carry onto the next caucus stop in New Hampshire, where DeSantis would likely again placed behind not only Trump, but surprise runner-up Nikki Haley.
Not settling for third of three, DeSantis' team looked poised to instead focus on South Carolina, a state that loves Trump and where Haley served as a governor for six years, though those plans now look to be a thing of the past.
Likely making the decision after becoming faced with the abject reality that he cannot beat Trump, his only remaining hope - that something will knock the frontrunner out of contention - also appears to be a fool's errand.
Hours before his announcement - where he stoically told followers that he is 'suspending my campaign' - pne supporter told NBC that DeSantis, echoing statements he has long said publicly on the campaign trail, 'believes there are multiple scenarios where Trump wouldn’t be the nominee.'
But Trump is lively and charismatic - perhaps metrics in which DeSantis fell short.
However, at 77, he is also somewhat long in the tooth - a fact that had provided the Florida politico some semblance of hope, given his rival's candidacy, at least by comparison, was inherently risky and unpredictable.
More importantly, the former president also remains in serious, ongoing legal trouble - though, as the landslide result from Iowa last week suggests, that doesn't seem to be stopping him from snagging the nomination.
That said, due to the uniqueness of the situation - as well as the lack of precedent - a conviction in one of his five criminal cases could potentially stop him from accepting the nomination.
DeSantis, as a result, had painted himself as the strong alternative to the frontrunner if he, for some reason, becomes unavailable due to his legal woes.
Needless to say, it is not how things were supposed to shake out for the man who won the formerly purple state of Florida by 20 points in a 2022 reelection following a successful first-term, and seemed poised to give Trump a serious challenge.
DeSantis has gone head-to-head with Nikki Haley and eked out a win over her camp in Iowa, but whether he can beat her in her own home state of South Carolina remains to be seen

DeSantis, some speculate, is hanging on for now because of the potential that Trump could drop out due to unforeseen circumstances involving his age or legal troubles
One month after his unprecedented win in Florida, polls showed DeSantis beating both Trump and Biden in potential election cycle matchups.
At the time, support seemed to be waning for Trump after what had been another tough election cycle for Republicans - at least those outside the state of Florida.
DeSantis was positioned as the heir apparent to Trump's Republican party, but the odds that Trump was really going to back down never seemed very high.
There was a moment when DeSantis was eating into Trump's numbers so significantly, that a convincing argument could clearly be made, and was made to major backers, for his candidacy.
But he would wait another six months to officially declare his run for office. Momentum had already been lost, and a glitchy, underwhelming campaign rollout on Elon Musk's newly revamped Twitter spaces was a bad omen for what was to come.
'A total failure to launch,' is how one former DeSantis adviser described it.
'This thing blew up on the launch pad,' he continued. A fitting metaphor given the announcement was hosted by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who certainly has experience with such things.
It was not long after the messy May 2023 start that troubled brewed amid the ranks of the DeSantis campaign and super PAC.
Personality clashes would launch thousands process stories that became a central theme of the media's coverage of the DeSantis camp, and the fighting never really worked themselves out.
NBC reports that finances at both the DeSantis campaign and Never Back Down were mismanaged to varying degrees. But, poor decisions led to several cycles of boom and bust hiring and firing activity that became a highly reported bad look.
Ron and Casey DeSantis (left) put almost all of their campaign eggs into the Iowa basket, and came up tragically short
Trump, who DeSantis once looked like he may be a real threat to, is cruising toward the Republican nomination
And then came the money problems.
According to the NBC report, once momentum began to stall inside the campaign - which was almost immediately - DeSantis began struggling to directly fundraise for his team.
Notably, Citadel founder Ken Griffin, who had previously backed DeSantis' political efforts, edged away from the campaign reportedly due to the governor's focus on 'culture war' battles.
DeSantis tends to come down on the side of social conservatives, which may have been a problem for him during this primary cycle.
'Losing Ken was big,' a donor told NBC. 'And the bigger problem was it sent a signal to others.'
The day DeSantis put rumors about his exit to bed, morale at his HQ was reportedly as low as it had ever been.
Staffers said they weren't sure when the road will end for their fearless leader - telling the outlet they were hoping it would be sooner rather than later - and that came on Sunday.
'It’s done. He’s not going to win it. If you are serious about not wanting Trump to be the nominee, as much as it pains me to say this at this point, I think all the energy goes to Nikki Haley,' said one former Never Back Down, DeSantis's SuperPAC, operative.
'I’m just really tired of all the infighting.'"

Fox News’ Bret Baier caught up with former President Donald Trump in Bedford, New Hampshire on Saturday to discuss the 2024 presidential race ahead of Tuesday’s highly anticipated primary in the state.
The 2024 frontrunner discussed beating GOP rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who came in second, and former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who came in third in the Iowa primary.
Trump hit back at Haley after she questioned the former commander-in-chief’s mental capacity after he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally this week.

""She’s just trying to get a little nasty because she came in third place. She wanted to come in second. And she wasn’t even that close, actually, to second. You know, I have to give that to Ron De-sanctimonious,"" Trump said, referring to his penchant for coming up with nicknames for his opponents. Most recently, Trump referred to Haley – the daughter of Indian immigrants – as ""Nimbra,"" referring to her birth name of ""Nimrata.""
FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY SAYS IT'S ‘ABSOLUTELY’ POSSIBLE FORMER PRESIDENT IS CONVICTED
Haley earned 21,085 caucus votes, or just under 20% in Iowa, putting her behind second-place finisher Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had 23,420 votes, or 21.2%. Trump trounced all of his challengers, winning an outright majority at 51%, with 56,260 votes in a historic caucus victory that resoundingly confirmed his frontrunner status.
That frontrunner status was further cemented later Sunday when DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump.

Responding to Haley’s assertion that Trump’s political indictments have become a liability on the campaign trail, Trump dismissed them as ""Biden indictments.""
""He is bad for democracy … He is very dangerous,"" Trump said of his Democratic rival in the White House. ""He can’t win fair and square. The guy can’t put two sentences together.""
Trump also took shots at Fani Willis, the Fulton County District Attorney who was accused of having an improper romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to prosecute the election interference case against the former president.
""They did this. This is all political stuff, and it’s a very bad thing for our country,"" Trump said. ""And remember, that goes the other way too. If a Republican gets in … they can do the same thing to a Democrat.""
On the question of a potential pick for vice president, Trump said: ""There’s no rush to that.""

Critics mocked Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., over his ""delivery"" of his endorsement during a rally for former President Trump on Saturday and said they were ""embarrassed"" for him.
""We need a president who understands the American people are sick and tired of being sick and tired, we need,"" Scott said as the crowd responded, ""Donald Trump.""
""Senator Tim Scott endorses Donald Trump and uh, the delivery was a choice,"" CNN reporter Omar Jimenez posted to social media. Jimenez joined ""CNN This Morning"" on Saturday and said the Trump campaign wanted to play up Scott's endorsement.
""It's quite the delivery,"" Jimenez said. ""Now, remember that Nikki Haley was the person who appointed Tim Scott to the Senate, and so this happening, of course, in the way that it did is a major blow to the former South Carolina governor. And they easily could have chosen to do this before the South Carolina primary.""

Others took issue with Scott's words, where he appeared to quote civil rights activist Fanie Lou Hammer, who famously said, ""I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.""
""I hope Fannie Lou Hamer's ghost haunts him terribly for the rest of his natural life,"" Franklin Leonard, who founded The Black List, wrote on social media.

""And that's why I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States, President Donald Trump.""
Fox News Digital has reached out to Sen. Scott's office for comment.
Following the rally, Scott said in a Fox News interview that ""it's time for us to unite our party so that we make sure that the only target we're talking about is firing Joe Biden. Our country can't take four more years. I'm not sure we could take ten more months. The best way for us to get rid of Joe Biden as our president is to unite our party now behind Donald Trump.""
Scott was criticized after endorsing the former president by fellow Republicans, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who has endorsed GOP candidate Nikki Haley.
""Tim Scott actually just looked in the camera and said ‘Donald Trump’s going to unite the country.’ Not even Donald Trump believes that statement,"" Sununu told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto.
""Nobody thinks Donald Trump’s united the country,"" he said.

Ron DeSantis suspends his 2024 presidential campaign after a disappointing Iowa performance and endorses former President Trump. (DeSantis Campaign)
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race and endorsed former President Trump two days before the New Hampshire primary.
The Florida governor announced his decision to suspend his campaign in a social media video on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday afternoon.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,"" DeSantis said in the video. ""But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.""
""Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" said DeSantis, who was a distant third in the single digits in the latest polls in New Hampshire.

DeSantis highlighted that he's had ""disagreements"" with Trump but believes that the former president is a better leader than Biden.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis continued. ""They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.""
DeSantis noted that ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.""

Trump, who along with his allies spent months fiercely attacking DeSantis, told Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman that he was ""very honored to have his endorsement.""
""I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country,"" Trump said.

And Trump, who for months had used the derogatory nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" on the campaign trail, said he wouldn't be using that nickname going forward.
""No, that name has been officially retired,"" Trump told Fox News Digital.
The Florida governor also took a chance to criticize former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is a former two-term South Carolina governor and the other remaining major contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.
TRUMP RUNNING MATE SPECULATION SOARS AS FORMER PRESIDENT CONSOLIDATES SUPPORT
DeSantis said he endorsed Trump ""because we can't go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
""The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over,"" he added.

Haley, speaking at a campaign stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, told the crowd, ""I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor. And we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.""
And in a statement, Haley noted that ""so far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not. We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road. New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision.""
A signal that the end was near came on Saturday night when DeSantis canceled two major Sunday talk show appearances. His campaign said at the time that the interviews were canceled to allow the governor to travel back to New Hampshire from South Carolina, where he was stumping on Saturday.
The DeSantis video was posted on Sunday afternoon, a couple of hours before the governor was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. That stop was canceled and there was no word on whether DeSantis would fly to New Hampshire to join Trump ahead of Tuesday's primary.
DeSantis, 45, finished in second place in last week's Iowa caucuses with 20.1% of the vote, but he only narrowly defeated Haley and came in 30 points behind Trump, who achieved a record-breaking and commanding victory in the low-turnout Hawkeye State contest.
DeSantis' departure from the race comes after his campaign went ""all in"" on Iowa, betting that a strong ground game, events, visits to all 99 counties and endorsements from top Iowa Republicans would propel him to a strong showing leading into elections in New Hampshire and South Carolina.
But his distant second-place finish, while it slightly exceeded expectations in the final polls, was seen as a major disappointment, considering all the time and resources he spent in Iowa.

The Democratic National Committee, taking aim at the Florida governor, charged that ""Ron DeSantis pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA agenda that both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are still running on, and now he is the latest member of the GOP to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.""

DeSantis, who was convincingly re-elected to a second term as Florida governor 14 months ago, was once the clear alternative to Trump in the Republican White House race. Multiple polls showed DeSantis leading Trump early last year before he entered the race, but he faltered out of the gate with a glitch-riddled social media campaign announcement.
The governor was backed by the big-spending aligned super PAC Never Back Down. However, after a series of campaign setbacks over the summer and autumn, and after getting hammered by constant attacks and negative ads from Trump and his allies, DeSantis saw his support in the polls erode.
Dan Eberhart, a top DeSantis donor, bundler and surrogate, told Fox News Digital that ""Ron DeSantis ran into a bump and the bump was named Trump.""
""This wasn’t about money. The campaign insists they had enough money to get to Super Tuesday. I think this was about data and polling and Gov. DeSantis being realistic about whether or not Trump was beatable,"" Eberhart said.
And he added that ""more importantly, I think this was about 2028, and DeSantis doesn’t want [a] 5 to 8% showing in New Hampshire on his record. Let’s face it, he’s the Republican voters' de facto second choice, and he’s Trump voters’ second choice, and so he’s decided to get out and govern Florida.""

Ralph Norman, R-S.C., tells ‘Fox News Sunday’ that former President Donald Trump knows she is a ‘serious threat.’
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley says former President Donald Trump is in mental ""decline"" and is no longer as competent as he was in 2016.
Haley made the statement during a Sunday morning appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" with host Margaret Brennan. Brennan asked Haley whether she saw evidence of Trump declining mentally when she served in his cabinet as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
""If you look recently there have been multiple things,"" Haley said. ""He claimed Joe Biden was gonna get us into World War II. I'm assuming he meant World War III. He said he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama.""
""Don't be surprised. If you have somebody that's 80 in office. Their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature,"" Haley said. ""If you look at Joe Biden, he's very different than he was two years ago. Are we really going to go into a situation where we have wars around the world, and we're trying to prevent war, and we're gonna have someone who we can or can't be sure is gonna get confused?""

Haley is rallying support in New Hampshire and South Carolina coming off a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses earlier this month. Trump won the caucuses with an overwhelming lead over any of the candidates, followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Haley has argued that Iowa had poor turnout due to record low temperatures, with much of the state having been in below-zero weather on Election Day.

""You look at Iowa. I mean President Trump won a state of three million people with 56,000 votes. We had a very low turnout in Iowa. We’re going to have a really good turnout in New Hampshire,"" Haley told reporters on Friday.
Trump defended himself during a rally with supporters in New Hampshire this weekend, arguing he is more mentally fit than ever.
""I don't mind being 80, but I'm 77, that's a big difference,"" he said. ""I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago.""

MSNBC contributor Jennifer Rubin said Saturday that the mainstream media tried to make Donald Trump seem ""not so bad,"" and claimed the media ""cleaned up"" his rhetoric to normalize him.
Rubin, a Washington Post columnist, responded to MSNBC host Ali Velshi, who said ""people don’t even want to watch clips of Donald Trump on our shows,"" citing feedback they received. Velshi added that Trump has been treated as a ""quirky abstraction,"" rather than a threat to democracy.
""Well, I think two things are going on. One, this speaks to how badly the mainstream media has covered him. They have normalized him, they have cleaned up the rhetoric so he sounds in a clip or he reads in print much more coherent than he actually is. It’s only very recently that the mainstream media has been reporting on his really shocking totalitarian claims. But of course, he’s been this way all along,"" Rubin said.
""And I think because they have done such a bad job, because they have made an effort to treat the Republican Party like the Democratic Party, this notion that he’s not so bad, that he’s just kind of a cartoon character has set in. And that’s on the mainstream media, that’s on the failure to be honest and to side with truth rather than having this false balance,"" she continued.

MADDOW DERIDED FOR REFUSING TO AIR TRUMP'S ‘UNTRUTHS’ AFTER VIDEO OF HER DEBUNKED CLAIMS GOES VIRAL
Rubin also said Trump's supporters were part of a ""fascist cult.""
""Let's be honest, there are a lot of them, but a lot of them does not mean that they are behaving logically or rationally. To the contrary, we’ve seen in other fascist regimes, that millions of people, sometimes even a majority of the country, becomes intoxicated with an authoritarian figure, and these people are utterly irrational,"" she continued.
MSNBC's Rachel Maddow told viewers that they would not air Trump's speech after he was projected to win the Iowa caucuses.
""The reason I’m saying this is, of course, there is a reason that we and other news organizations have generally stopped giving an unfiltered, live platform to remarks by former President Trump,"" Maddow said. ""It is not out of spite, it is not a decision that we relish, it is a decision that we regularly revisit. And honestly, earnestly, it is not an easy decision.""

She went on to claim that airing Trump's ""untrue"" statements live on television hurts MSNBC's brand.
""But there is a cost to us, as a news organization,"" Maddow said, ""of knowingly broadcasting untrue things. That is a fundamental truth of our business and who we are. And so, his remarks, tonight, will not air here live. We will monitor them and let you know about any news that he makes.""

JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins ‘Fox News Sunday’ to weigh in on the new poll revealing that Trump is leading Haley by 19% in New Hampshire.
Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance argued 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley would likely be unable to survive Democratic attacks if elected the party's nominee, saying she's ""the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on.""
""Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn't faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced. And frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience,"" Vance told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday.""
Bream aired a clip of her asking New Hampshire voters who they supported ahead of the Granite State's primary on Tuesday, with one woman explaining she's voting for Haley because she has ""no baggage."" Vance, who is serving as a surrogate for the Trump campaign, pushed back that Haley does have ""baggage,"" but Democrats have not attacked her, as they have Trump, in recent years.

""I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she's the low baggage candidate. In reality, she's the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she's the nominee,"" Vance said, adding that Haley ""won't be"" the nominee.
TRUMP MAINTAINS MASSIVE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DAYS AHEAD OF FIRST PRIMARY: POLL
""But if she is [the nominee], she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years, and I don't think she'll survive, and I certainly don't think she'll win the presidency through it. That's why we need to elect the guy who's shown some resilience. That's why we need to nominate Donald Trump,"" he said.
Trump solidified himself as the Republican frontrunner for 2024 last week, when he handily won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. He is now focusing on the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.

Trump has 55% support among those likely to vote in the primary, compared to Haley's 36% support and DeSantis' 6% support, a Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 poll found.
Bream cited the Suffolk poll, as well as a CNN poll that found Trump has 50% support to Haley's 39%, and noted to Vance that many voters in New Hampshire are undeclared, but vote in the GOP primary.
TRUMP SAYS NIKKI HALEY 'HAS NO CHANCE' AHEAD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY: 'MAGA IS NOT GOING TO BE WITH HER'
""There are a couple of newspaper editorials today endorsing Nikki Haley, telling people if you're independent get out, ‘save the country and vote in that GOP primary.’ I mean, that's a substantial group of people here. How concerned are you about them showing up and not choosing President Trump on Tuesday?"" Bream asked.

Vance responded that liberals who recently moved out of Massachusetts to New Hampshire would ""never"" vote for a Republican nominee – whether they be Trump or Haley - and are instead ""trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump"" and his primary race.
""I think a lot of them are going to vote for Donald Trump and also liberal… many of them from Massachusetts who are moving to New Hampshire, they're never going to vote for a Republican nominee, even if it's Nikki Haley,"" Vance said.

A former U.S. attorney suggested on Friday that Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis is likely conceding some allegations levied against her are true after she used race to defend a colleague she is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with.
""We've seen now it's an attack on the people who were questioning or raised the issue for further investigation, and I think that sounds a lot to me like maybe a concession that some of the allegations in the motion must be true,"" Michael Moore said of Willis' recent remarks on CNN, where he serves as an analyst.
Court documents filed earlier this month say Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade, her alleged romantic partner, to prosecute former President Trump in Georgia's election interference case and benefited financially from the relationship in the form of lavish vacations that the two went on using funds his firm received for working the case.
Willis was recently subpoenaed to appear in court as part of Wade's divorce case. A new filing from her attorney claims Wade's estranged wife conspired with interested parties to ""annoy, embarrass,"" and ""oppress"" Willis.
""Because the parties agree their marriage is irretrievably broken, there is no information that Willis could provide that would be relevant,"" the filing said in part.

Moore, a Democrat who was appointed by President Obama in 2010 and served until 2015, told CNN that while he does not think the allegations on their own will be ""completely destructive"" to the case against Trump, it is a ""real optics problem"" for Willis.
He noted that it is more likely the judge will make ""short work"" of the issue and will likely ask Willis to state if the allegations are accurate.
""I think the question is whether or not she hired somebody who was not experienced, does he, in fact, have a felony prosecution background to be handling this type and this magnitude of a case,"" he said.
Moore was then asked whether Willis could be prosecuted for honest services fraud and the federal racketeering statute after Wade was allegedly paid around $650,000 so far in the case.
He said that he thinks any prosecution of Willis would be ""far down the road"" but took particular issue with claims that she paid Wade 10 times as much as she paid another special assistant. Moore stressed that these disparities would have to be explained.
""No judge wants the courtroom to become a circus. The problem with these kinds of allegations is it has a tendency to make a case a circus as opposed to the facts of the case,"" he said.

Willis on Sunday appeared to use race to defend Wade during a speech in an Atlanta church, saying, ""All three of these special counselors are superstars. But I'm just asking god, is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges. But no one questions their credentials.""
Moore said he does not believe her comments are helpful in getting her motion passed to squash the subpoena.
""To see in a case like this where she makes the allegations, he's been questioned because he may be an African American male, it misses the mark. I don't think you can use race as a sword to attack somebody, clearly, nor do I think you can use it as a shield to hide behind to say, simply because you may be African American, that your activities are beyond any inquiry, especially when these allegations are made. I think that's the line she's crossed,"" he said.
Moore added that her ""attack"" made it more likely that some of the allegations may be true.
Moore previously said that Willis should step away from the case amid the allegations. He suggested that if they are true, they would challenge the integrity of the proceedings.
""Cases are not lost because of some 'Matlock' moment, some moment like you see in 'My Cousin Vinny,' where suddenly somebody finds the evidence. Cases die by the death of 1,000 cuts. This is a cut on the case,"" Moore told CNN on Sunday.

Trump's co-defendant, Michael Roman, accused Willis and Wade of having an ""improper"" and ""clandestine"" affair at the same time appointments were being made for the 2020 election interference case.
Roman was a former official on Trump's 2020 campaign and argued about the integrity of the case being compromised because of the affair, asking last week for the charges to be dropped.
The filing also calls for the entire district attorney's office, including Willis and Wade, to be disqualified from prosecuting the case.
Moore said he would tell Willis to step away from the case.

""I really think that in this type of case, with these allegations, this case is bigger than any one prosecutor,"" Moore added. ""And I think, probably, to preserve the case and to show that what's of most importance to her is the facts of the Trump case, opposed to her political career.""
News broke that Trump was indicted by Willis in August, and he pleaded not guilty to charges related to allegedly attempting to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, including violation of Georgia's anti-racketeering law.

As support for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in New Hampshire's upcoming Republican presidential primary appeared to dwindle in recent polling, a surrogate for DeSantis on Sunday waved off the polls, saying ""the real fight"" would be hashed out in the South Carolina primary.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" and was asked whether the two new polls showing DeSantis trailing former President Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was the reason why the governor canceled a round of appearances on the Sunday show circuit.
""We never had high expectations for New Hampshire anyway,"" Massie responded. ""And Nikki’s exploiting a quirk of their primary, which is that undeclareds, i.e. Democrats, can vote in a Republican primary.""
""The real fight, I think, is in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""And that’s where Nikki Haley, I think, stumbles. She’s going to miss expectations and not even win her own state.""

Two new polls released Sunday morning show DeSantis in a distant third behind Trump and Haley in New Hampshire.
A University of New Hampshire/CNN poll showed Trump at 50%, Haley grabbing 39% support and DeSantis trailing in the single digits with 6%.

Meanwhile, a daily tracking poll released by Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 in Boston showed Trump edging up to 55%, while Haley stood at 36% and DeSantis at 6%.
The new surveys indicate that Haley took majority support among independents, who are known as undeclared voters in New Hampshire. Independents can vote in either major party's contest, and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary.

1445,SE79X1J8MX_VXRB90RZE78WNFZ,Lawyer in Trump defamation case won't introduce 'Access Hollywood' tape ahead of possible testimony,By Anders Hagstrom Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 8:44am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawyer-trump-defamation-case-wont-introduce-access-hollywood-tape-possible-testimony,"Piers Morgan says a potential Trump 2024 win would be 'one of the great comebacks' in political history on 'One Nation.'
The infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape will not be presented to New York jurors tasked with considering a defamation case against former President Donald Trump leveled by writer E. Jean Carroll.
Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, revealed that the jury would be presented with neither the tape nor two other women who accused Trump of abuse. The revelation means Trump's testimony in the case is likely to arrive sooner than expected, possibly Monday, one day before the Republican primary in New Hampshire.
Kaplan argued that she wants the trial to remain ""focused"" on Carroll's accusations, not Trump's other alleged sex crimes.
The new trial comes after a federal jury in New York City decided last year that Trump was not liable for rape but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president has been ordered to pay Carroll $5 million.

Carroll, 80, alleged that Trump raped her at the Bergdorf Goodman department store across the street from Trump Tower in Manhattan sometime in 1996. According to Carroll, the two had a chance run-in at the store, where Trump was shopping for a gift for ""a girl."" She said he asked for her advice, and the two shopped together before he pushed her into a dressing room and assaulted her.

Trump denied the claim repeatedly, leading Carroll to sue him for defamation, arguing that his denial had harmed her reputation.

Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Mn, blasted President Biden as ""unelectable and weak"" during a campaign event in New Hampshire, where Biden is set to skip the first Democratic presidential primary this week.
Phillips is challenging Biden in the Democratic primary, and New Hampshire represents his top opportunity. Biden chose to skip the state's primary entirely after New Hampshire declined to give up its first primary slot to South Carolina.
While Biden supporters are organizing a write-in campaign to prevent Phillips from securing a win, he still says he hopes to secure upward of 20% of the vote.
""Sadly it's going to demonstrate that our incumbent president is unelectable and weak and I think it's going to show this country that there's a candidate here who can actually do here what has been promised for generations,"" Phillips told reporters at a campaign event.

MANCHESTER, N.H. – With two days to go until New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, two new polls indicate former President Donald Trump remains the commanding front-runner, with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley behind by double-digits, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis a distant third.
Trump, who is running a third straight time for the White House, stands at 50% support in a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll released Sunday morning.
Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration, grabbed 39% support. And DeSantis, once the clear runner-up to Trump in most polling, was at 6%.
Trump's 11-point lead over Haley in the new survey is up from a seven-point advantage in the previous UNH/CNN poll, which was conducted earlier in the month.

Meanwhile, the former president grabbed 55%, according to a daily tracking poll released Sunday morning by Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 in Boston.
The former president's support edged up two points from Saturday's tracking poll.
Haley stood at 36%, with her support unchanged from the previous day. And DeSantis pulled in 6% support, edging down a point over the past 24 hours.
Both polls were conducted entirely after Trump scored a convincing victory in Monday night's low-turnout Iowa caucuses, the first contest on the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

A poll from Saint Anselm College that was also conducted after the Iowa caucuses also indicates Trump with a lead in the mid-teens over Haley and DeSantis in single digits in New Hampshire.

Meanwhile, a new survey released Friday from Marist College indicates Haley performing better against President Biden than either Trump or DeSantis in hypothetical general election matchups in November in New Hampshire, which is a key battleground state.
The survey indicates Haley edging Biden by three points, while the president tops Trump by seven points and DeSantis by nine points. Haley repeatedly emphasized on the campaign trail that she would perform better against Biden in the general election than Trump would fare against the president.

But the former president's campaign appeared to be tempering expectations.
""A win is a win,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters ahead of the rally. ""A win by five, a win by six, a win by seven.""
And LaCivita argued that Haley should end her campaign if she doesn't win on Tuesday, saying ""she should drop out.""

But Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney told reporters on Saturday that they're moving full speed ahead to South Carolina, which holds the next major contest in the GOP presidential nominating calendar, on Feb. 24.
Ankney said Haley will hold a large event in her hometown of Charleston, South Carolina on Wednesday, the same day that the campaign will launch a $4 million statewide ad blitz.
The Suffolk University poll questioned 500 likely Republican presidential primary voters in New Hampshire on Friday and Saturday, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
The UNH/CNN survey was conducted January 16-19, with 2,348 New Hampshire adults questioned. The poll's overall sampling error is plus or minus two percentage points.

The UNH/CNN survey also polled the state's Democratic presidential primary.
Sixty-three percent of those likely to vote in the Democratic contest said they would write in President Biden's name, with Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota at 10% support and self-help author Marianne Williamson at 9%.
With New Hampshire holding an unsanctioned Democratic presidential primary, the president declined to place his name on the ballot.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis promised voters in 2020 not to date any of her subordinates, according to newly unearthed footage.
The footage, first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, shows Willis saying it would be ""inappropriate"" for her to have a relationship with one of her staffers. Willis is now being accused of an improper relationship with one of her prosecutors, whom she is also accused of overpaying.
""I will certainly not be choosing to date people that work under me,"" Willis said on the ""The Patricia Crayton Show"" in April 2020.
""We are at a place in society where things happen in people’s relationships – husbands and wives sometimes, there are outside relationships. I don’t think that that’s what the community is concerned about. Although there might be a moral breaking in that,"" she continued.

""There’s nothing I can say on it other than that it is distracting, it is certainly inappropriate for the No. 1 law officer in this state, and it really, really saddens me.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed concern over the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House and said he considers the former U.S. president's claims that he could stop Ukraine's war with Russia in 24 hours ""very dangerous.""
In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News that aired Friday, Zelenskyy invited the former president and front runner for the Republican presidential nomination to visit Kyiv, provided Trump delivers on his promise in a way that can satisfy Ukraine.
""Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv,"" said Zelenskyy. ""If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come.""
The Ukrainian leader expressed concern over a potential Trump presidency where Trump's idea of a negotiated peace in Ukraine might involve Ukraine making major concessions to Russia.
""[Trump] is going to make decisions on his own, without ... I'm not even talking about Russia, but without both sides, without us,"" Zelenskyy said. ""If he says this publicly, that's a little scary. I've seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that's really making me a bit stressed.""
Trump has repeatedly stated that he is well-positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for almost two years, saying he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
Throughout his political career, Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
During a campaign rally in Georgia just days after Russian tanks moved into Ukraine, Trump described Putin as a ""smart"" political player and expressed admiration for Russia's swift takeover of a vast, ""great piece of land"" at the cost of what he suggested were relatively minor sanctions.
Agency warns of mines
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi warned Saturday that mines had been re-planted around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, just months after a team of international inspectors had reported the area had been cleared from mines.
In a statement on the agency's website, Grossi cautioned that mines in the plant's buffer zone, between its internal and external fences, go against the agency's safety standards.
The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Petro Kotin of Energoatom, called the alleged planting of mines as ""another crime"" by Russian forces that have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early weeks of the war.
In a Telegram update Saturday, Kotin said the situation at the plant ""will remain fragile and dangerous as long as the Russians remain there.""
The IAEA has repeatedly expressed concern the war could cause a potential radiation leak from the facility, which is one of world's 10 biggest nuclear power stations.
The plant's six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.
Russia has been in control of the site since 2022 and is refusing to allow IAEA experts access to some areas of the plant.
""Such access is needed to monitor nuclear safety and security,"" the IAEA statement said.
Lawmakers propose bill confiscating property
Russian lawmakers have prepared a bill allowing for the confiscation of money and property from people who spread ""deliberately false information"" about the country's armed forces, a senior member of parliament said Saturday.
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the measure would also apply to those found guilty of what he described as other forms of betrayal such as ""discrediting"" the armed forces, calling for sanctions against Russia, or inciting extremist activity.
""Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, who betrays it, must face deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country, at the cost of their own property,"" Volodin wrote on Telegram.
Wife calls for husband's return
Meanwhile, at the election headquarters of President Vladimir Putin, the wife of a Russian soldier delivered an emotional appeal Saturday for her husband's return from the front, a defiant gesture in a country where open criticism of the war is banned.
""Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has issued a decree that my husband has to be there [in Ukraine.] I'm interested to know when he will issue a decree that my husband has to be home,"" Maria Andreyeva said as campaign workers looked on.
Andreyeva became involved in a heated exchange with a woman who told her that Russian soldiers in Ukraine were defending the motherland, and she should pray for them.
""So, what's next? The Ministry of Defense has spent its money, now we need to squeeze everything out of our guys, get the last life out of them? So that they come back to us just as stumps?"" Andreyeva questioned.
""Will they give me the stump? What will I get back? A man without legs, without arms, a sick man? Don't you know what's happening there?"" she asked.

Early in 2023, he led several head-to-head polls against Trump.But the Florida governor's support has been declining for several months, due to flawed campaign strategy, his seeming lack of ease with voters on the campaign trail and Trump's so far unshakeable hold on much of the party's base.The end of DeSantis' bid means that former US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, is now the last Republican in the race with a shot - albeit a long one - of denying Trump the nomination.

He never successfully articulated to most Trump supporters why he was a better option, while Republicans looking to ditch the former president split their votes among multiple candidates. Haley, in particular, has been emerged as the favorite among moderate Republicans as the field has consolidated. Where DeSantis differed from Trump on policy, it was almost always to stake out a more conservative position. He signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida in April, which he eventually embraced on the campaign trail, even as it made some donors and moderate Republicans wary.DeSantis opposed additional US military assistance to Ukraine and took punitive actions against the Walt Disney Co. after the company spoke out against Florida legislation that limited discussion of gender and sexuality in classrooms.The Disney fight was one that pro-business critics within the party said DeSantis didn't need to wage.While many major donors threw their support behind DeSantis early on, they began to rebel as early as the summer.Robert Bigelow, who gave millions to the super PAC fundraising group backing DeSantis, told Reuters in August he was cutting off funding, turned off by the governor's uncompromising position on abortion.DeSantis' troubles began before he ever entered the race.In March, when Trump was indicted in New York on charges he conspired to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, the former president received a significant bump in the polls as Republicans rallied around him. Many of them believed Trump's claims that law enforcement officials were targeting him to keep him out of office.Several DeSantis allies say the governor waited too long to become a candidate, finally throwing his hat into the ring in May, over six months after Trump had done so. That left DeSantis open to blistering attacks by Trump, while the governor himself did little to defend himself, insisting he was not a candidate. When DeSantis did formally launch his White House run in May 2023, it was a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter, now known as X, an inauspicious start for a campaign predicated on the governor's executive competence.The campaign then overhired, burning through cash at a rapid rate. DeSantis let go of some 38 staffers in July and ousted his campaign manager in August, sowing a narrative of internal chaos that proved hard to shake.He outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size, but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.The campaign and the PAC, known as Never Back Down, came to distrust one another. A series of back-to-back departures of senior staffers from the PAC in November and December created a sense of turmoil that furthered the narrative that the governor's campaign was mortally wounded.

1781,80OTZVUXP9_JYFDEOB1PU2ZJKV,Donald Trump kicks out protester and claims his mind is 'stronger than ever' in rant,Chiara FiorilloNews Reporter,"17:56, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-kicks-out-protester-31933465,"Donald Trump, the former US president, booted out a protester who labeled him ""a dictator"" during his rally in New Hampshire.
The 77-year-old responded to the heckler by telling security: ""Get him out."" He then quipped that he would only be a dictator for ""only one day"" if he gets re-elected in December. Another man, dressed in KKK attire, was also removed before he could mingle with the crowd.
Trump has often questioned President Joe Biden's mental sharpness due to his age. Defending his own cognitive abilities, he boasted about acing a dementia test while he was president.
""I don't mind being 80, but I'm 77. That's a big difference,"" he said, adding: ""I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago.""
Trump was joined at a rally by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. US Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry also appeared on stage with Trump.

""Almost every politician from South Carolina is endorsing me,"" Trump announced. The South Carolinians encouraged voters to support Trump in New Hampshire before the contest moves to their state next month.
""If you do that and you win by a big margin here, we'll finish the job in South Carolina,"" said Murrell Smith, the speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives.
This is another setback for Haley, who hopes her appeal among independent and unaffiliated voters will give her a strong enough finish in New Hampshire to turn the race into a two-person contest against Trump.
At another campaign event, Trump went on a puzzling tirade, claiming he's being indicted by 'Democrats, communists, Marxists, and fascists' in New York. He told his cheering fans: ""I'm being indicted for you,"" and said he was ""proud"" to be sued.
""I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you. Our enemies want to take away my freedom because I'll never let them take away your freedom... and in the end, they're not after my freedom, they're after your freedom,"" Trump rambled, trying to drum up support for his claim that all his legal troubles are 'witch hunts.'""
Trump also posted on Truth Social yesterday morning to remind people about a ""BIG REALLY TONIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE."" Trump has been leading in the polls, with Haley, a former South Carolina governor, seeming to be his strongest competitor.
Trump further tweeted, ""Nikki 'Birdbrain' Haley is losing BIG in the polls against Crooked Joe. I am beating him all over the place. She is WEAK ON THE BORDER, I AM THE STRONGEST BORDER PRESIDENT, EVER. That's all you have to know!!!

Considered once a major rival to Trump in the Republican primaries, DeSantis made the announcement that he's out of the running for the 2024 presidential election just two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Initially seen as a contender who could challenge Donald Trump, the conservative Floridian was defeated by Nikki Haley at the Iowa caucus and is currently trailing her in New Hampshire polls.
While Trump and Haley are busy fighting for supremacy in New Hampshire with numerous rallies and campaign events, DeSantis decided to bypass it and head for South Carolina - though things didn't go as he planned.

Campaign finance records reveal that MAGA Inc. spent over $23 million on advertisements against DeSantis, while the super PAC supporting Nikki Haley, the former U.N. Ambassador, put substantial efforts into defeating DeSantis in Iowa, as NBC reported.
DeSantis announced his withdrawal from the race in a video posted on X, previously known as Twitter, accompanied by a quote from Winston Churchill: ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" - Winston Churchill

In the newly released video, DeSantis opened up about his campaign and why he decided to join public service. He said government spending is sky-high and it's time to bring it down, whilst also protecting ""America's children from being indoctrinated.""

His rival Nikki Haley, on the other hand, has plunged a lot of time and cash into a New Hampshire campaign, attracting so much attention that Donald Trump spent all morning badmouthing her over Truth Social, the conservatives' own version of Twitter. However, DeSantis skipped this key primary opting to focus on South Carolina instead.
But even with the money and effort channeled into South Carolina, their top politicians have already pledged support to Trump well before their primary vote.
Over the weekend, leaders like McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette journeyed to New Hampshire joining Trump at a rally. Sen. Tim Scott, who hails from South Carolina too, backed Trump at another event in New Hampshire the previous night.
Despite the funds splashed by Trump's campaign and being labelled 'DeSanctimonious' - slurs thrown by his opponents which seemed to have derailed his once-intimidating political career.
The ambitious governor had entered the 2024 presidential race with several plus points in his bid against Trump, and early primary polls did suggest DeSantis was in a pretty robust position to take on just that.
He and his supporters gathered a political fortune of over $100 million, and he had a notable record on issues that matter to many conservatives, such as abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.

Just an hour after DeSantis left, leaving Trump and Nikki Haley to fight it out, Trump, who didn't like DeSantis and spent loads to beat him, said he was ""honored"" that DeSantis supported him when he left the race.
Trump's team said: ""With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump's victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates.""
They also said: ""It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.""

Even though Trump often calls DeSantis 'DeSanctimonious,' he took the high road and accepted the support nicely - for now.
When asked if he thought he'd win after DeSantis dropped out, Trump just shrugged and smiled while everyone cheered 'USA! USA!'
DeSantis shared a video saying he's done with his campaign but even though he and Trump don't always agree, Trump would be better than Joe Biden.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis shared on X, previously known as Twitter.
Earlier, it seemed like Trump had foreseen his rival's departure in a post on Truth Social. ""I should get 100% of the vote because it is a CAUCUS,"" Trump penned, before using the chance to criticise his opponents. ""After looking at the Polls, Ron and Nikki both dropped out. Then, off to South Carolina, where we will WIN BIG!""
Trump's messages can sometimes be hard to understand. He was suggesting that DeSantis and Haley would quit after the next primary - which almost came true when DeSantis announced he'd be leaving before the New Hampshire primary, backing Trump instead.
DeSantis was always trailing behind Trump in the polls, but his hopes were likely dashed after the Iowa caucus. After coming third, DeSantis chose to skip campaigning in New Hampshire and head to South Carolina - but things didn't go as planned.
Despite the effort and campaign in South Carolina, their main political leaders have already endorsed Trump, well ahead of their primary.
On Saturday, McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette were among the South Carolina leaders heading to New Hampshire to appear with Trump at a rally there. Sen. Tim Scott, another South Carolinian, endorsed Trump at a New Hampshire event on Friday night.
Between the money spent by Trump's campaign and earning the nickname 'DeSanctimonious' - his opponent's attacks seem to have derailed the once intimidating politician.

Trump proclaimed on social media that the New Hampshire primary win was all but definite before looking ahead to the next primary scheduled in Nevada.

While Trump's messages are occasionally difficult to decipher, it looks like Trump is predicting his opponents will drop out after the next primary - which turned out to be almost accurate, as Ron DeSantis announced today that he'd be dropping out before the New Hampshire primary, and endorsing Trump.

The former president then spent the rest of the morning issuing a series of tweets insulting his opponents and claiming that 'disloyal' Haley can't win.
""Fox has given up on DeSanctimonious, but fighting like hell, one last chance, to save Birdbrain (""I will never run against President Trump, he was a GREAT PRESIDENT""). It won't happen, she doesn't have what it takes. Also, very Disloyal!!!"" wrote Trump on Truth Social, hours before DeSantis dropped out.
While Haley has focused her campaign in New Hampshire on a variety of promises for the conservative legislature, she's been polling well in the state. But Trump managed to find a variety of polls where he was ahead.
""BIRDBRAIN HAS BEEN LYING ABOUT THIS, AND MANY OTHER THINGS, FOR WEEKS. SHE CAN'T BEAT THE DEMS,"" Trump wrote over a graphic poll that showed Trump polling over Joe Biden at 49 percent, and Biden out-polling Haley by just two points.

Clapping back at Trump's campaigning, Nikki Haley has been heard questioning whether Trump is mentally capable of serving as president again after he repeatedly seemed to confuse her with former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a campaign speech.
As she campaigned in Keene, New Hampshire, Haley referenced Trump's speech the night before, in which he mistakenly asserted that Haley was in charge of Capitol security on January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building seeking to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden continued to post about Haley anyway, continuing with the message: ""Haley can't win!"" All of the polls Trump posted have him beating everyone by several points.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Sunday found that a majority of registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary - 67% - said they planned to vote for Trump. But a majority of those registered as undeclared - 58% - said they support Haley.
The poll, taken Tuesday through Friday, also found more registered Republicans in the state view Haley unfavorably (47%) than favorably (31%). Trump, meanwhile is viewed favorably by 76% of registered Republicans and unfavorably by just 16%."
1841,7WGVGL49MU_GGNQD2ME2MYKEP1,Only Voters Can Truly Disqualify Trump,_,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/trump-section-3-sovereignty.html,"Intense debate has accompanied the decision by the Supreme Court to review the decision by Colorado’s highest court to bar Donald Trump from the state’s primary ballots based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment — about the precise meaning of the word “insurrection,” the extent of Mr. Trump’s culpability for the events of Jan. 6 and other legal issues.
I’m not going to predict how the Supreme Court will rule, or whether its ruling will be persuasive to those with a different view of the law. But there’s a critical philosophical question that lies beneath the legal questions in this case. In a representative democracy, the people are sovereign, and they express their sovereignty through representatives of their choice. If the courts presume to pre-emptively reject the people’s choice, then who is truly sovereign?
The question of sovereignty was central to the purpose of the 14th Amendment in the first place. The Civil War — unquestionably an armed insurrection — was fought because of slavery. That was the reason for the war.
But its justification was a dispute over sovereignty, whether it resided primarily with the people of the individual states or with the people of the United States, who had established the Constitution.
The answer was settled on the battlefield, but it was ratified through the 14th Amendment, which defined who is a citizen of the United States and established that the “privileges or immunities” of same supersede any state laws that might abridge them. From now on, there would be no ambiguity: Under the Constitution, the people of the United States are sovereign, and this sovereignty supersedes the sovereignty of the people of the individual states whenever the privileges and immunities of the former are in conflict with the will of the latter.
Section 3 of that amendment was similarly enacted in order to secure federal supremacy. Rebel officers might well have retained strong popular support in the former Confederate states, but Section 3 prevented the rebellion from being continued by electoral means. The people of South Carolina might prefer to be represented by former rebels, but the people of the United States, whose sovereignty trumps South Carolina’s, forbid it.
Whose sovereignty, though, trumps the people as a whole?
Donald Trump is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination for president and has a close to even-odds chance of winning the general election. That would seem to have no bearing on his eligibility to run. If a majority of the country wanted Barack Obama or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Selena Gomez to be president, it would be out of luck. The Constitution renders them ineligible: Mr. Obama has already been elected twice, Mr. Schwarzenegger was not born a U.S. citizen and Ms. Gomez is under 35 years old.
For that very reason, though, those individuals aren’t likely to run — and if they did try to run, their ineligibility would be manifest, recognized by everyone. Similarly, former Confederate officers and officials, by serving in the Confederacy, had explicitly declared themselves insurrectionists. Congress passed a broad amnesty in 1872 to lift the penalties associated with the involvement of most in insurrection, including that imposed by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment; some individuals not covered by the amnesty petitioned successfully for the restoration of their civil rights, and in other cases the prohibition was simply not enforced. But the essential fact of participation in the insurrection was not in dispute.
The situation with Mr. Trump could not be more different. An overwhelming majority of his party, and apparently about half of the country as a whole, considers him to be eligible to be president again. Moreover, these voters believe this even though, as President Biden said recently, “we saw with our own eyes” what happened on Jan. 6.
I count myself among those who consider Mr. Trump to be manifestly unfit to serve in any office ever again because of his actions on that day, even if he is not held criminally liable. But being unfit is not the same thing as being ineligible. What makes the Colorado Supreme Court — or any court — believe that it has a privileged understanding of those events that is beyond the capacity of the public to discern?
Perhaps the public is misinformed, or refuses to let itself be accurately informed, even at this late date, about what happened. The need for expertise and deliberation is why we have a representative democracy; the people do not act directly to make laws, but act through their representatives.
It’s notable in that regard, then, that impeachment — the remedy the Constitution provides for a president who violates his oath of office — does not involve the courts but the people, acting through their representatives. And the court of the people already had the opportunity to weigh in on Mr. Trump’s culpability for the events of Jan. 6. He was impeached an unprecedented second time by the House of Representatives for his actions on that day. But in the trial that followed in the Senate, Mr. Trump was acquitted.
That does not mean he is innocent. But it does mean that the Colorado Supreme Court has, in effect, declared that it outranks the Senate, and can overrule that body’s decision.
Some Republican senators, including the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, effectively asked the courts to do just that during the impeachment debate. Arguing that they had no authority to try a president whose term had ended, they refused to consider the facts of the case. But this was not a principled view. The Senate had already voted separately on the question of jurisdiction, and a majority determined that they did have the ability to try a president whose term had ended. Once that question was settled by the Senate itself, senators who thought Mr. Trump was guilty, including those who voted the other way on the jurisdictional question, could vote their consciences on the matter at trial.
Since the senators still voted to acquit, it must be because they did not think he was guilty, or did not deserve punishment for his guilt. Or, reflecting gross cowardice, perhaps they did not want the responsibility for convicting him, and preferred the courts to shoulder that responsibility instead.
That’s precisely what the Colorado Supreme Court has decided to do. But in so doing, it has usurped the proper prerogative of the people. It is saying, in so many words, that the people’s representatives got it wrong in the impeachment trial, and the people themselves are incapable of seeing what is in front of their eyes. Therefore the court must save the people from the possibility of making a catastrophically wrong decision.
Democracy cannot be saved in this fashion, not even from the threat of a demagogue with contempt for the rule of law. It can be saved only by democratic means. If the people’s representatives failed to do their duty, as they did in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial, the last line of democracy’s defense is the sovereign people themselves. At the point that we cannot trust them, democracy is dead already.

1846,C25HDCX67Q_8LMCSVUM6FJC7PV,Dean Phillips Floats a No Labels Bid if 2024 Is Trump vs. Biden,"By Reid J. EpsteinReporting from a Dean Phillips campaign stop in Nashua, N.H.","Jan. 20, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/us/politics/dean-phillips-no-labels-biden.html,"Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, a Democrat running a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden, said on Saturday that he would consider running on the ticket of No Labels, a centrist group exploring an independent bid, if it appeared the general election would be a rematch between Mr. Biden and Donald J. Trump.
In an interview, Mr. Phillips publicly articulated for the first time the circumstances in which he would accept the No Labels presidential nomination, and said he was in regular communication with Nancy Jacobson, the group’s chief executive. Democratic allies of Mr. Biden have been alarmed by No Labels, worrying that any candidate it runs could siphon votes from him.
“People are criticizing them because they believe whomever they offer on their ticket will hurt Joe Biden,” Mr. Phillips said after a town-hall event at a senior center in Nashua, N.H. “That’s false. If they put someone at the top of the ticket who could actually drive votes from Donald Trump, every Democrat in the United States of America should be celebrating it. They haven’t made that determination.”
Mr. Phillips has a long relationship with Ms. Jacobson and No Labels from his tenure in the group’s congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, an organization that promotes policies with bipartisan support. He said he had told Ms. Jacobson he would not discuss running as the No Labels candidate “at this time.”
But Mr. Phillips did say he would consider running as the No Labels candidate if polling suggested that Mr. Biden would lose in November to Mr. Trump.
“It would have to be a Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch that shows Joe Biden is almost certain to lose,” Mr. Phillips said. “That is the only condition in which I would even entertain a conversation with any alternative.”

1857,O6DY8OEB2D_RBINCIM50SC6687,Haley Picks Up Endorsement of New Hampshire’s Largest Newspaper,By Neil Vigdor,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/union-leader-endorses-haley.html,"The Union Leader, New Hampshire’s largest newspaper and one that reliably picked Republicans for a century before the rise of Donald Trump, endorsed Nikki Haley on Sunday in the Republican primary.
“Of course, we can’t talk about Nikki Haley without addressing the elephant in the room and the rather old donkey hiding in the White House,” it wrote, alluding to Mr. Trump and President Biden — though making no mention of Mr. Trump by name.
The newspaper did not endorse Mr. Trump in the previous two cycles, either.
In the 2016 Republican contest, it backed then-Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey — but later retracted its endorsement when Mr. Christie, who dropped out of the race after a poor showing in New Hampshire, endorsed Mr. Trump.
Then in the 2016 general election, for the first time in more than 100 years, it did not endorse a Republican, instead choosing Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee.
And in 2020, it endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. instead of Mr. Trump, who had previously called the newspaper’s publisher a “lowlife” in a television interview.
“Nikki Haley is an opportunity to vote for a candidate rather than against those two,” the endorsement reads, again referring to Mr. Trump. It called Ms. Haley a “candidate who can run circles around the dinosaurs from the last two administrations, backwards and in heels.”"
1859,UQ39M32WIB_FSNL2S3UYMMXBP2,Overturning ‘Chevron’ Can Help Rebalance the Constitutional Order,_,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/supreme-court-chevron.html,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case that could go a long way toward fixing some of the systemic dysfunction in American government. The case, which revisits a judicial doctrine known as the “Chevron deference,” has been widely described as a conservative effort to limit government. But that’s not entirely correct. The case is better understood as a key part of the effort to restore the proper balance of power among the three branches of government.
If you took high school civics, there is a good chance you’ve heard the phrase “coequal branches of government.” It’s such a common formulation for America’s separation of powers that it’s easy to slide into the false belief that each branch of government is equal in authority to the others.
But if you read the Constitution, you’ll quickly see that while each branch of government has some power to check the others, one branch is plainly supreme. The government can’t spend one dime unless it’s appropriated through Congress. Impeachment gives Congress the power to fire not only the president but also any member of the Supreme Court. Only Congress has the power to declare war.
Even if the president takes the exceptional step of vetoing a bill it has passed, Congress has the power to override that veto. And the Constitution gives Congress immense power over the federal judiciary. Congress defines the number of judges and justices, sets their compensation and defines the full extent of their jurisdiction.
Not only is Congress the most powerful of the three branches of government, it’s also the branch closest to the people. Members of the House and Senate are elected by popular vote, and members of the House run for election every two years. By contrast, no American ever votes for a single federal judge — let alone a Supreme Court justice — and the Electoral College distances the presidency from majority rule to such an extent that the last two Republican presidents entered office having failed to win the popular vote.
And indeed there is a compelling logic in the most powerful branch also being the branch closest to the people. It builds popular support for public policy, and it provides Americans with the crucial sense that they are participants in American democracy, not mere observers of the machinations of a distant government elite.
But by now you most likely see the problem. Congress is not performing its constitutional tasks. It’s a broken institution that contains too few genuine lawmakers and far too many would-be activists and TV pundits. Time and again, it has proved incapable of compromise or of accomplishing even the most basic legislative tasks. It’s been 27 years since it even passed a budget on time. And that barely begins to capture the current level of dysfunction, with a razor-thin House Republican majority consistently held hostage by a mere handful of MAGA extremists.
As Congress has shirked its duties, presidents and the courts have filled the power vacuum. Presidents have used the power of their executive agencies to promulgate new regulations without congressional involvement. Executive agencies publish 3,000 to 4,500 new rules per year, and these regulations have a substantial impact on the American economy. Compounding the problem, courts have ratified that presidential power grab by enacting a series of judge-made rules that require federal courts to defer to the decisions of executive agencies.
The most important of those judge-made rules is called “Chevron deference,” named after the 1984 Supreme Court case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The case involved a highly technical dispute over the meaning of the term “stationary source” under amendments to the Clean Air Act. Congress did not define the term, so the E.P.A. defined it for itself. The question at issue was whether the court should defer to the agency’s interpretation or interpret the statute itself.
The court chose to defer to the E.P.A., and it established a default rule of deference going forward. If the statute an agency administers is “silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” the majority held, “the question for the court is whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”
The justification for Chevron deference is compelling, at least on the surface. Agencies regulate some of the most complex businesses and industries in the United States. They possess a level of expertise that’s clearly beyond the capabilities of Congress. Why not defer to their determinations? Isn’t that simply wise?
But what might be wise in specific, highly technical circumstances can be very problematic when adopted as a general rule, as the Chevron doctrine has been. Chevron disrupted the constitutional order by effectively giving the president the power to make, interpret and enforce laws acting solely through his administrative agencies. It injected the presidency’s lawmaking abilities with steroids.
This is not the way the United States was intended to function. It magnifies the power of the president beyond recognition, diminishes democracy, raises the stakes of presidential elections to destabilizing levels and puts immense pressure on the president to maximize his rule-making authority. Just as bad, it encourages congressional inaction and incompetence. If the agencies can take over when Congress is silent or ambiguous, it diminishes the necessity for Congress to speak clearly. It’s much easier to punt the hard decisions to the president, and then heckle (or cheer) from Fox News or MSNBC.
How have we seen this dynamic play out? Three consecutive administrations — Obama, Trump and Biden — have attempted radically different immigration reforms through executive action rather than through legislation. We’ve also seen the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations enact or propose divergent rules and regulations on sex discrimination under Title IX. We’ve witnessed President Biden attempt to forgive student loans and mandate workplace vaccinations through executive action.
These policy disputes and policy shifts have very little to do with “agency expertise” and everything to do with presidential ideology. The language of Title IX or of federal immigration statutes isn’t changing, but the ideological commitments of the president do, and the president is then using his rule-making authority to alter the law. The same law shouldn’t mean wildly different things based on the whim of a president.
Wednesday’s oral argument signaled that America may be on the verge of a welcome restoration of proper constitutional order. The case is called Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, and the facts are both simple and representative of how the Chevron doctrine distorts American law. The plaintiffs are fishing companies that are challenging a federal rule that requires them to pay the cost for federal observers who board their boats and observe their compliance with federal fishing rules.
The plaintiffs aren’t challenging just the rule itself; they’re also challenging Chevron deference, arguing that it is “at odds with the basic division of labor in the first three Articles of the Constitution.” Unfortunately, much of the commentary around the case has been simplistic and reductive, casting the case as merely another Republican effort to limit government power.
But it’s not that simple. After all, some conservative jurists, including most notably Antonin Scalia, agreed with Chevron. In 1989, Scalia wrote that “broad delegation to the executive is the hallmark of the modern administrative state.” He said the nation was “awash in agency ‘expertise.’”
Yet the question at issue in Loper Bright — like the questions at issue in many of the administrative law cases that fall under Chevron — has nothing to do with special agency expertise. Congress is perfectly qualified to determine who should bear the cost of fishery observers.
The question isn’t how much power the government should possess, but rather who should possess it. And it’s far from clear to me that it’s inherently “conservative” or “Republican” to say that Congress, the most democratic branch of government, should possess more power than the president. Indeed, a number of conservatives adhere to a theory of presidential power called the “unitary executive” that often means the opposite, increasing executive authority at the expense of Congress.
Moreover, reversing Chevron wouldn’t end executive rule-making. Nor would it block Congress from explicitly granting agencies a degree of discretion based on agency expertise. It would instead roll back the president’s extraordinary dominance. Do we really want to maintain a system that enables a man like Donald Trump to eclipse both Congress and the judiciary?
Americans feel alienated from their government for good reason. Democracy feels more distant because it is more distant. Decades of congressional failure have diminished congressional power and placed it in the hands of presidents and their army of unelected administrators. We need to reverse bad precedent. Regardless of whether one is for big government or small government, we should all be for democratic government, and that — at the very least — requires Congress to do its job.

Ramaswamy earlier this week announced that he was leaving the Republican presidential race and endorsing Trump.
In an interview with Fox News on Friday about a possible job in a second Trump administration, the 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur said: ""There are a lot of ways to drive change in this country, inside and outside government.” 	 “For the last few years, I’ve been doing it through the market,” The Hill quoted Ramaswamy as saying.
Ramaswamy, who campaigned as the most Trump-friendly, ""America first"" alternative in the Republican field, just one day after ending his presidential campaign gave a passionate speech and asked voters to vote for Trump.
""We are in the middle of a war in this country,"" Ramaswamy said, portraying a country divided between ""those of us who love the United States of America and a fringe minority who hates this country and what we stand for."" 	 ""And right now we need a commander in chief who will lead us to victory,"" he said.
Trump, who had accused him of ""deceitful campaign tricks"" and not being ""MAGA"", soon returned the favour by praising Ramaswamy.
Make America Great Again or MAGA is an American political slogan and movement popularised by Trump during his successful 2016 presidential campaign and is used to refer to his political base.
""I've been a friend of his even though we were competing against each other,"" Trump said. ""But I was a friend of his and we got along and ... I kept saying, 'Why is he running? He keeps calling me a great president.' But he's a fantastic guy, a very smart guy. He's got some tremendous ideas."" 	 ""He's going to be working with us for a long time,"" Trump said Tuesday after some in the crowd chanted ""VP, VP, VP."" 	 The race for the Republican presidential nomination makes its next stop in New Hampshire, where Haley is 11.4 points behind Trump, according to a poll average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill.

1981,9F9HDES81Z_7Y7VZF0FP806P2O,Trump’s campaign trail runs via the courthouse – and he’s fine with that,David Smith,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/trump-trials-election-campaign,"Monday night: Des Moines, Iowa, celebrating victory with supporters over beer and popcorn. Tuesday morning: Manhattan, New York, on trial for defaming a woman he sexually abused. Tuesday night: Atkinson, New Hampshire, campaigning for the US presidency. Wednesday morning: court in New York again.
Donald Trump, the former US president and frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024, has intertwined his political and legal calendars until they are all but indistinguishable. At rambunctious campaign rallies, he plays the victim and rails against a biased justice system. In sombre courtrooms, he creates a spectacle that guarantees airtime and fundraising to fuel his run for the White House.
The jarring juxtaposition seems to be working.
Trump’s 91 criminal charges across four cases did not stop him winning 98 out of 99 counties in Monday’s frigid Iowa caucuses, and interviews with his support base showed they accept his narrative of politically motivated prosecutions. He is leading opinion polls in New Hampshire and looks poised to become the Republican standard bearer.
“The court appearances are his campaign,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “He’s spending much less time than the other candidates in the key states. He’s not spending as much on TV advertising. He’s doing all kinds of things that candidates for president usually don’t do because he’s got an ace card that none of the others have.
“This has convinced not just his supporters but in a broad-based way the whole Republican party that he’s being oppressed, that Joe Biden is using the judicial system to try and put a stake in the heart of his toughest challenger for November. And they buy it.”
Trump’s recent court appearances have been voluntary, not obligatory, at a time when his Republican rivals are crisscrossing states in search of votes. Last week the 77-year-old former reality TV star showed up for a hearing in Washington DC to hear his lawyers argue that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. A day later he was in Des Moines, Iowa, for a Fox News town hall.
The duelling schedule evidently did him no harm in Iowa, where he romped to victory over the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, by nearly 30 percentage points, more than twice the biggest winning margin ever achieved by a Republican. During his speech in Des Moines, Trump nodded to his legal tribulations: “I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they’re using that for election interference.”
The following morning, he was in a Manhattan federal court – again by choice – to watch the selection of a jury that will decide whether he should pay damages for defamatory comments he made in office about the writer E Jean Carroll. Last year a jury concluded that Trump sexually abused her in a department store in 1996 and defamed her in 2022.
That evening he headed to Atkinson, New Hampshire, for a campaign rally where he boasted about his win in Iowa but told supporters: “If I didn’t get indicted all these times and if they didn’t unfairly go after me, I would have won, but it would have been much closer. I tell you, I don’t know if I would have made the trade. I might have just liked the position we’re in right now.”
Come Wednesday, it was back to New York and the Carroll case. This time Trump was animated, shaking his head at testimony he disliked, passing notes to his lawyers and speaking to them while jurors were in the room.
He was scolded by Judge Lewis Kaplan after a lawyer for Carroll complained that he was grumbling about the case so loudly that jurors could hear him. When the judge threatened to expel him, Trump retorted: “I would love it.” The judge admonished: “I know you would. You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.”
Outside the courtroom, the Republican frontrunner then held a press conference, describing the trial as “rigged” and Carroll as “a person I never knew”. He complained that Kaplan, a Bill Clinton appointee, was “a nasty judge” and a “Trump-hating guy” who was “obviously not impartial”.
Somehow he had made the case about himself rather than his victim. Maggie Haberman, author of Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America, told CNN: “He showed up for her testimony and so instead of us talking about her testimony we are talking about the fact that he was making noises, he was overheard whispering to his lawyer.”
She added: “He would have liked to have gotten thrown out because he would then claim he was a victim. It’s heads he wins, tails the other side loses.”
Trump was not in court on Thursday so he could attend his mother-in-law’s funeral in Florida. He will soon head back to New Hampshire to hold rallies ahead of Tuesday’s primary election, where he could in effect seal the Republican nomination. As endorsements from senior Republicans pour in, it seems that the party has made a collective decision to carry the legal baggage of a man who now openly brags that he has been indicted more often than Al Capone.

Charlie Sykes, editor of the Bulwark website and a former conservative radio host, said: “He’s going to have a courtroom campaign because Donald Trump relishes the idea of being the martyr. He thinks that being associated with these trials will actually help him in the polls and so far he’s not wrong. Every time he’s been indicted, he’s gone up.”
But Sykes believes that Trump’s decision to attend the trial involving E Jean Carroll could be a mistake as he pivots to general election voters. “How many Americans actually know about this case? There’s been such a firehose of indictments, hearings, charges. Now Donald Trump himself has decided that he is going to draw attention to a case that he’s already lost, that has found him liable for sexual assault.
“It’s hard for me to imagine any swing voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia or Milwaukee hearing for the first time about this case and thinking, yeah, this is the guy that I want to support for president.”
Anna Greenberg, a senior partner at polling firm GQR, also sees limitations in Trump’s gameplan. She said: “He saw that when he got indicted he got a major boost, and you saw it in the primary polls, and so he may be thinking if I engage with these trials against me and I rail and I attack, that’s going to continue to give me some kind of benefit.
“I think he already got the benefit. I don’t think there’s any additive benefit for him but I think there’s a real downside for him, which is that’s how he’s spending his time and not out on the campaign trail and doing the campaigning.”
Trump has pleaded not guilty in four state and federal criminal cases, including two claiming he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. This week his lawyers filed paperwork in another case – over his allegedly illegal retention of sensitive classified documents – arguing that intelligence agencies were politically biased against Trump.
Some observers fear that the scorched earth approach poses a far-reaching danger to civil society and American legal and political structures. Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, added: “Donald Trump is waging a concerted campaign to de-legitimize the justice system in America.
“He is trying to discredit not just prosecutors, but also judges and juries and the entire process of legal accountability and the damage is going to be long lasting and it’s going to be profound.”"
1988,BIFCTZEE3V_4DO1K0CJOR47CQ8,Biden abortion ad marks campaign shift to emphasize reproductive rights,Edward Helmore,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/biden-abortion-ad-campaign,"The Biden re-election campaign rolled out a new campaign ad on Sunday, signaling a shift in emphasis to reproductive rights that the White House hopes will carry and define Democrats through the 2024 election cycle.
The campaign ad, titled Forced, is designed to tie Donald Trump directly to the abortion issue almost 18 months after his nominees to the supreme court helped to overturn a constitutional right to abortion enshrined in Roe v Wade, which would have turned 51 this week.
Dr Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother of three tells the camera her story about traveling out of her state to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition, calling her situation “every woman’s worst nightmare”.
In Texas, she said, her choice “was completely taken away and that’s because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v Wade”.
The launch of the ad comes as anti-abortion activists descended on Washington DC this weekend. One event, the National Pro-Life Summit, activists came to celebrate anti-abortion activism in the US. At another, the March for Life, marchers called for advocacy against abortion rights.
Vice-President Kamala Harris is now being placed to the forefront of the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights, a position Biden has said he is not “big on” because of his Catholic faith, though he believes the landmark 1973 decision “got it right”.
On Monday, Harris will embark on a nationwide tour to focus attention on the administration’s efforts to protect the right of women to choose. Her tour will start in Wisconsin, where abortion rights propelled a Democratic victory in a key state supreme court election.
A statement from Harris’s office said the vice-president will “highlight the harm caused by extreme abortion bans and share stories of those who have been impacted in Wisconsin and across the country”.
“She will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care,” the statement added.
Democrats this year are hoping to emphasize that a second Trump presidency would establish new personal health restrictions.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager, said in a statement to The Hill.
On Sunday, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, told CBS Face the Nation that “it would be good” if Biden talked about abortion more than he does. “I know that one tenet of his belief system is that women and only women with their families and healthcare professionals are the one who know what decision is right for them.”
Asked if the president needs to take up that message more forcefully, Whitmer said: “I don’t think it would hurt. I think people want to know that this is president that is fighting … but maybe to use more blunt language would be helpful.”"
2003,HRGGTC03K4_T16M5CPR6324FM8,Jamie Dimon thinks Trump was ‘kind of right’ about a lot of things. What?,Robert Reich,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-defends-trump,"On Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum’s confab in Davos, Switzerland, Jamie Dimon – chair and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest and most profitable bank in the United States, and one of the most influential CEOs in the world – heaped praise on Donald Trump’s policies while president.
“Take a step back, be honest,” Dimon said. Trump “was kind of right about Nato, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China. He wasn’t wrong about some of these critical issues.”
What?
Mr Dimon, take a step back, be honest.
Kind of right about Nato? Trump wanted the US to withdraw from Nato – and may get his way if he becomes president again. This would open Europe further to Putin’s aggression.
Kind of right on immigration? Even the conservative Cato Institute found that Trump reduced legal immigration but not illegal immigration. Trump refused to grant legal status to children of immigrants born in the United States or who grew up in the US. He banned Muslims from the US, and when the Muslim ban was found to be unconstitutional, banned people from Muslim countries. He fueled the flames of nativism by describing poorer nations as “shitholes” and has used terms redolent of Nazism to describe foreigners as “poisoning the blood” of Americans.
Grew the economy quite well? In fact, under Trump the economy lost 2.9m jobs. Even before the pandemic, job growth was slower than it has been under Biden. The unemployment rate increased by 1.6 percentage points to 6.3%. The international trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce went up. The US trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was the highest since 2008 and increased 40.5% from 2016. The number of Americans lacking health insurance rose by 3 million. The federal debt held by the public went up, from $14.4tn to $21.6tn.
Tax reform worked? Trump’s tax cut conferred most of its benefits on big corporations and the rich, while enlarging the budget deficit. Giant banks and financial services companies got huge gains based on the new, lower corporate rate (21%), as well as the more preferable tax treatment of pass-through companies.
If not for the Trump cuts – along with the Bush tax cuts and their extensions – federal revenues would keep pace with federal spending indefinitely, and the ratio of the debt to the national economy would be declining.
Instead, these tax cuts have added $10tn to the debt since their enactment and are responsible for 57% of the increase in the debt ratio since 2001, and more than 90% of the increase in the debt ratio if the one-time costs of bills responding to Covid-19 and the Great Recession are excluded. Eventually, the tax cuts are projected to grow to more than 100% of the increase.
Right about China? As the Brookings Institution found, Trump’s China policy only made China less restrained in pursuit of its ambitions. Confrontation has intensified, areas of cooperation have vanished, and the capacity of both countries to solve problems or manage competing interests has atrophied.
Oh, and then there are the pesky matters of Trump’s seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, facing 91 criminal indictments, causing the US to be more divided than at any time since the Civil War, lying every time he opens his mouth, and planning to use the justice department for “vengeance” against his political enemies if elected again.
Why is Jamie Dimon – the most influential CEO in America – spouting these talking points in favor of Trump?
Because he thinks Trump has a good chance of becoming president, and Dimon wants to be in his good graces.

Asked which candidate would be better for his business, Dimon said: “I have to be prepared for both. I will be prepared for both. We will deal with both.”
Dimon knows that his support for Nikki Haley irked Trump.
“Highly overrated Globalist Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMORGAN, is quietly pushing another non-MAGA person, Nikki Haley, for President,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social in late November. “I’ve never been a big Jamie Dimon fan, but had to live with this guy when he came begging to the White House. I guess I don’t have to live with him anymore, and that’s a really good thing.”
So now, Dimon – like Republican lawmakers across the US, like too many other leaders of American institutions – feels it necessary to cave into the integrity-crushing intimidation of a Trump administration, and lick Trump’s backside.
And when Dimon does this, you can bet many other CEOs and financial leaders will now follow his example.
At a time in American history when the most influential leaders of the US need to stand up loudly and clearly for the rule of law, for democracy, for decency, and against Donald Trump, Dimon is leading the charge in the opposite direction.
This is how fascism takes root and spreads.

Putin also thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for his invitation to visit as he met North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui who visited Russia last week, KCNA said citing a foreign ministry official.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy fears that if Donald Trump returns to the White House next year he could make unilateral concessions to Russia that override Ukraine’s interests and branded the former US president’s claims he could stop the war in 24 hours as “very dangerous”.
Zelenskiy has also spoken of putting together “new bilateral agreements” that will “reanimate” the system of international law. He added that new military packages will be delivered “in the coming weeks and months”.
Slovak prime minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that Ukraine was under the absolute control of the United States. The populist politician, who is against military aid to the war-torn country and opposes sanctions against Russia, also reiterated his opposition to Ukraine’s bid to join Nato. “Ukraine is not an independent and sovereign country,” Fico told public broadcaster RTVS. “Ukraine is under the total influence and control of the United States.” Slovakia is a member of both Nato and the European Union. Despite Fico’s criticism, it was only Hungary that vetoed the €50bn of aid that other EU members had voted to give Kyiv last December.
The UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported that Ukraine maintains a presence on the left bank of the Dnipro River and has continued to repel Russian attacks despite “logistical concerns”.
Russian lawmakers have prepared a bill allowing for the confiscation of money and property from people who spread “deliberately false information” about the country’s armed forces, a senior member of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin said on Saturday, Reuters has reported.
Russia has lost 375,270 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces claimed on Saturday. The number, which has not been independently verified, includes 750 casualties over the past day.
Russian troops have reinstalled mines along the perimeter of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which it occupies in the occupied Zaporizhzhia oblast, the International Atomic Energy Agency has said.
The wife of a Russian soldier delivered an emotional appeal for his return from Ukraine on Saturday at the election headquarters of Putin – it was a defiant gesture by Maria Andreyeva in a country where open criticism of the war is banned.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has referenced a quote from Winston Churchill in an interview with Le Figaro. Discussing the war in Ukraine, he said: “Give us the tools and we will finish the job.”
Romanian protesters have ended their blockade at the Porubne-Siret crossing along the Romanian-Ukrainian border the Kyiv Independent reported, citing the border guard service. Romanian farmers and truck drivers had been protesting against high business costs.
Russian forces launched seven Shahed-136/131 attack drones against Ukraine, four of which were shot down by Ukraine’s air defences, according to an update from the general staff.
Russia has accused Ukraine of being behind a drone strike that sparked a huge inferno at an oil depot in western Russia on Friday, the latest in a series of escalating cross-border attacks. Russian officials and news reports said four oil reservoirs with a total capacity of 6,000 cubic metres (1.6m gallons) were set on fire at the oil refinery after the drone reached Klintsy, a city of 70,000 people located about 60km (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border."
2039,W10WR653MP_5D7GBN20Q8AVKVE,Ron DeSantis drops out of Republican presidential race,Martin Pengelly,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/ron-desantis-drops-out-presidential-race,"Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor of Florida, has ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsed Donald Trump.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said in a statement posted on X. “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
DeSantis’s withdrawal in the days ahead of the New Hampshire primary follows a disappointing result in the Iowa caucus, where he finished second place but trailed Donald Trump by a large margin. In New Hampshire, his numbers were far behind former South Carolina governor Haley and Trump.
On Sunday night, Donald Trump set aside months of criticism of DeSantis and celebrated his onetime rival as his newest supporter.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Trump said. “He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.”
“He’s been a good governor and I wish him well,” Haley said at a campaign event on Sunday. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.”
DeSantis’s news was the culmination of a long, agonising decline.
As recently as spring 2023, the former navy lawyer and rightwing congressman was widely seen as the Republican most likely to stop Trump becoming the nominee for a third election running, in large part by attempting to offer harsh Trumpist policies without the attendant drama.
In November 2022, DeSantis cruised past the Democrat Charlie Crist to win a second term in Tallahassee. In his victory speech, he crowed: “We have embraced freedom. We have maintained law and order. We have protected the rights of parents. We have respected our taxpayers and we reject ‘woke’ ideology.”
Referencing Winston Churchill, a near-mythic figure on the American right, he went on: “We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the schools, we fight the woke in the corporations. We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die.”
He received a rapturous reception, supporters with an eye on 2024 chanting “two more years” and the New York Post branding him “DeFuture”, as speculation abounded that Rupert Murdoch was finally set to move on from Trump.
But despite formidable fundraising, a seemingly strong campaign structure, strong polling and a rising Republican star in his wife, Casey DeSantis, after a long run-in to a formal campaign declaration, little went right.
DeSantis’s hard-right agenda ran into trouble as he chose to take on Disney, a dominant employer in Florida, over its opposition to his “don’t say gay” policy regarding LGBTQ+ issues in schools. Generating a string of stories, scandals and lawsuits over book bans in school libraries, the subject continued to dog the campaign.
In May the launch of that campaign, a Twitter Spaces session with Elon Musk, descended into farce as the platform glitched and buckled. The event host, the donor David Sacks, claimed: “We got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.” Few observers agreed.
On the campaign trail in the months that followed, the governor came across as stilted and awkward. For a campaign focused on social media and the influencers who lurk there, the resultant string of mocking memes and threads could not have been in the plan.
Nor could a summer fiasco over bizarre campaign videos, posted to social media and featuring far-right, white supremacist, Nazi and arguably homoerotic imagery. A firing followed but the campaign’s image had taken another big blow, reports of fundraising problems appearing.
There was a scandal over an attempt to change history teaching in state schools, regarding the place of slavery in Florida’s past. There were attempts to troll Democrats on immigration, including sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-run states by bus or plane. That policy ended up in the courts as well.
As the polling gap to Trump grew, and as the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley steadily moved through the field, DeSantis sought ways to fight back.
In November he took the unexpected step of debating a Democrat other than Joe Biden. The Fox News-hosted contest with Gavin Newsom, the California governor, proved little more than a sideshow. Brandishing a map he said showed the spread of “human faeces” on the streets of San Francisco, DeSantis succeeded only in feeding more “poop map” memes.
DeSantis and Haley became more willing to attack Trump as the first vote neared, if still with the gloves kept on, even Trump’s lie about a stolen election in 2020 proving hard to simply disown. In Iowa, DeSantis picked up key nominations from the governor, Kim Reynolds, and evangelical leaders and eventually finished in second. But that still didn’t catapult his campaign into safe New Hampshire territory, and he dropped out before the numbers could prove just how far behind he might be.
Democrats celebrated the news on Sunday.
“As Democrats, we’ve been shouting from the rooftops that his strategy of waging culture wars on the backs of hardworking Floridians just to further his own ambitions was wrong for the state & would be disastrous for the nation,” said Fentrice Driskell, the lead Democrat in the Florida state legislature on Twitter/X.
Sarafina Chitika, spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: “Just like Trump, DeSantis ran a campaign pledging to ban abortion nationwide, rip away access to healthcare, and gut Social Security and Medicare, while embracing election deniers and whitewashing January 6. Whichever candidate wins the race for the Maga base will be left running on the same dangerous and unpopular anti-freedom agenda that voters will reject in November.”
For its part, the New Hampshire electorate did not seem too shaken by his last-minute announcement.
Two hours before an event he had planned in New Hampshire, there were no signs of the DeSantis campaign or his fans at The Farm Bar and Grille. A member of staff said they had found out from news reports that DeSantis wouldn’t be coming and said he had not yet pre-paid for the space.
“Nope, I’m about to charge him right now.”

2048,YQIXPBL05U_W77FEVTS633AFJZ,New Hampshire Republican primary: when to expect results and what they can tell us,Joan E Greve,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/new-hampshire-republican-primary-trump-haley-desantis,"New Hampshire voters are headed to the polls on Tuesday. After Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the Iowa caucus last week, his top rival for the Republican nomination – the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley – hopes to make a splash in the critical primary state.
But the Republican primary is not the only contest being held in New Hampshire on Tuesday. New Hampshire Democrats are moving forward with their own primary, one with a major asterisk: Joe Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot as the Democratic National Committee has said that the New Hampshire primary is “meaningless” after party officials moved to make South Carolina the first voting state.
Here is everything you need to know about the New Hampshire primary:
Polls will start closing at 7pm ET, and results will begin coming in shortly after that. In 2020, the first results were reported at roughly 7.30pm ET, but Democratic ballots may take longer to tabulate this year because of the expected large number of write-in votes.
Historically, the Manchester and Concord areas have reported results faster, while northern New Hampshire has been slower to count ballots. The Guardian will have several reporters on the ground in New Hampshire on Tuesday, and our live blog will share results and analysis as polls close, so stay tuned.
New Hampshire will hold the first primary election of the 2024 election cycle, while Iowa held the first caucuses of the Republican nominating contest. In a caucus, each voter is required to appear in person at a specific precinct location to cast a ballot, as the Guardian’s Martin Pengelly explained earlier this month.
A primary is much more straightforward, with polling locations across the state open for a set number of hours to allow voters to cast their ballots. Because of the relative ease of voting and the option for undeclared voters to participate in either party’s primary, New Hampshire generally sees higher turnout than Iowa.
In 2020, roughly 176,000 Iowans participated in the Democratic caucuses, while nearly 300,000 New Hampshire voters participated in the Democratic primary. The turnout gap is particularly notable considering Iowa’s population is more than twice the size of New Hampshire’s.
Two dozen candidates filed the necessary paperwork to appear on the Republican primary ballot in New Hampshire, but the overwhelming majority of votes are expected to be cast for Haley and Trump.
DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, just two days before the primary, after it was clear the downward trajectory of his campaign could not be revived in New Hampshire. He joined other candidates who had ended their presidential bids.
After their disappointing performances in Iowa, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson both dropped out of the Republican primary. Their names will still appear on the ballot, as will the names of other former candidates like the former vice-president Mike Pence and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott.
Yes, but it’s complicated. The Democratic National Committee voted last year to designate South Carolina as the party’s first primary state, while New Hampshire would have the opportunity to vote second.
The decision outraged New Hampshire Democrats, who insist they will not go along with the national party’s plan to rob them of their “first-in-the-nation” status. As a result, the New Hampshire Democratic party decided to hold its primary the same day as the Republican primary, in defiance of the DNC’s decision.
The DNC has criticized the New Hampshire primary as a sham, calling on the state party to “educate the public” that the contest “is a non-binding presidential preference event and is meaningless”. The New Hampshire attorney general, Republican John Formella, in turn sent a cease-and-desist letter to the DNC to compel the organization to stop making “false, deceptive and misleading” claims about the primary.
Because of the standoff, Biden’s name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, although many Democrats still plan to vote for him as a write-in candidate. Other long-shot candidates, including Minnesota congresswoman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson, will appear on the ballot and hope to capitalize on New Hampshire Democrats’ frustration with the change in the voting calendar.
Voters who are registered as a Democrat or a Republican may only vote in their party’s primary, but undeclared voters may choose to participate in either primary. There are already indications that Democrats and independents in New Hampshire plan to participate in the more competitive Republican primary, as thousands of voters changed their registration leading up to the deadline in October.
The presence of independent and Democratic voters in the Republican primary could dramatically affect the results. Haley in particular hopes that she can sway enough of those voters to chip away at Trump’s advantage with more hard-right Republicans.
Polls show that Trump remains well ahead of Haley in New Hampshire, although Haley has significantly narrowed the former president’s lead in recent weeks. According to the FiveThirtyEight average of New Hampshire polls, Trump is about 13 points ahead of Haley, but he was leading by 25 points last month.

Even though she finished third in Iowa, Haley had presumptively made the argument that the primary was “a two-person race” between her and Trump because of DeSantis’s low polling numbers in New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary late next month. After DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, Haley faces a new opportunity to consolidate the support of non-Trump voters and overtake the former president. But as the results of the Iowa caucuses showed, there may not be enough non-Trump voters left in the Republican party for Haley to pull off an upset.
Haley is looking to pick off some of DeSantis’s supporters to boost her performance in New Hampshire, but it seems more likely that those voters will migrate toward Trump’s camp, particularly after DeSantis endorsed the former president on Sunday. Like Trump, DeSantis has embraced the “Make America great again” philosophy, while Haley has called for a “new generational conservative leader” for the Republican party.
Given the political similarities between DeSantis and Trump, most of DeSantis’ supporters appear ready to back the former president. A CNN-University of New Hampshire poll conducted last week showed that 62% of likely Republican primary voters who named DeSantis as their preferred candidate said that Trump would be their second choice, compared towith 30% who said the same of Haley.
New Hampshire is generally whiter, older and wealthier than the rest of the nation. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, 90.5% of New Hampshire’s voting-age residents identify as only white, compared with 67.1% of all American adults who identify as such. Only 1.1% of New Hampshire residents over 18 identify as Black and 3.1% identify as Hispanic, while 12.3% of all American adults identify as Black and 14% identify as Hispanic.
New Hampshire also has a higher share of citizens over the age of 65, with 25% of its adult residents in that age bracket compared with 23.2% of all American adults. The median age of all New Hampshire residents is 43.3, which is older than the 39.0 median age for all Americans.
In terms of household wealth, 7.2% of New Hampshire adults report an income that falls below the poverty level, compared with 11.1% of all Americans whose incomes fall below that level. And while 94.1% of New Hampshire’s adult residents have at least a high school degree, 91.3% of all Americans over 18 can say the same.
Because of the demographics of New Hampshire, a number of critics have challenged the state’s early voting status. In its move to push the New Hampshire primary to a later date, the Democratic National Committee cited the racial diversity of other early states like South Carolina and Nevada to justify their prioritization in the voting calendar.
“This calendar looks like the Democratic Party, and it reflects the diversity of America,” the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, said last year."
2049,YWXXFR882I_BLVY012JCGH7KJ4,Why New Hampshire could be the last chance for Republicans to beat Trump,Adam Gabbatt,_,20240121,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-primary-donald-trump,"Brightly dressed in a red-and-white starry jacket, Melinda Tourangeau was waiting eagerly at Grill 603, a casual diner in small-town New Hampshire, for a US presidential candidate not named Donald Trump.
Tourangeau, 57, who lives in Milford, was “reluctantly forced to vote for Trump” in 2016 and 2020, she said. “I had to leave my morals at the door.”
But this time she is supporting Nikki Haley. “She has gone all over the state to meet people, and when she meets you, and when you meet her, you feel raised, you feel like you’re a better person after you’ve met her. And her platform is brilliant – clear, concise, cogent – and she intends to do everything she says. She’s the right candidate.”
Whether this is a minority view, or indicative of tectonic plates shifting among Republicans in New Hampshire, will be put to the test in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary election. It comes one week after Trump’s record victory over Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and Haley, an ex-US ambassador to the UN, in the Iowa caucuses.
For half the century, no candidate who won both Iowa and New Hampshire has failed to secure their party’s presidential nomination. Victory for Trump here would probably seal the deal and set up a rematch with Democrat Joe Biden in November.
But if Iowa played to Trump’s strengths among evangelical Christians and rural conservatives, New Hampshire is a different proposition. Its voters pride themselves on an independent streak – the state motto is “Live free or die” – and are generally wealthier, more educated and less religious. Both states are about 90% white.
Voters who are registered without a party affiliation make up about 40% of the electorate in New Hampshire and are eligible to cast a Republican primary ballot, which makes them more moderate than in Iowa. New voters can also register at the polls on Tuesday.
For Trump, whose authoritarian language, criminal charges and brash populism play less well among college-educated voters, this represents something of an away game. Even in the Iowa suburbs last week, he won only a third of the votes.
Haley has a more “Republican classic” image – less extreme on issues such as abortion, more hawkish on foreign policy – and has been barnstorming New Hampshire for months. Although her third place finish in Iowa blunted her momentum, and some opinion polls still show Trump well ahead in New Hampshire, others put Haley running neck and neck.
That makes Tuesday a make-or-break moment. EJ Dionne, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said at a panel discussion organised by the thinktank: “There is a road for her but it’s rocky, it’s rutted, it’s narrow and it runs along the edge of a cliff. She has to win New Hampshire, I believe, to have any chance of going on. I don’t think running Trump close in New Hampshire will really cut it any more, especially after running third in Iowa.”
Trump apparently senses the danger and has stepped up his attacks on Haley. At a rally in Concord on Friday, he told supporters: “All you need to know about Nikki Haley is that every corrupt and sinister group we’ve been fighting for the past seven years is on her side … Nikki Haley is backed by the deep state and the military-industrial complex. She’s never seen a war she doesn’t like.”
He has also resorted to his default tactic of using race and ethnicity as a political cudgel. In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump repeatedly referred to Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, as “Nimbra”. She was born as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa but has always gone by her middle name.
Asked about Trump’s false claim that her heritage disqualifies her from running from president, Haley told reporters: “I’ll let people decide what he means by his attacks. What we know is, look, he’s clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums, if he’s spending millions of dollars on TV. He’s insecure, he knows that something’s wrong.”
She has also been returning fire by making a case that, while Trump was the right choice for president in 2016, he is now too old and chaos follows him wherever he goes. She is seeking to thread a needle, appealing to independents as the more acceptable face of the Republican party while not entirely alienating Trump’s “Make America great again” base.
Such calculations have led her into trouble. Last month, when she was asked by a New Hampshire voter about the reason for the civil war, she did not mention slavery in her answer. Last week, in an interview on Fox News, she claimed: “We’ve never been a racist country.”
But even if Haley does pull off a stunning upset, she would then head into less favourable territory next month in Nevada and her home state of South Carolina. It is also difficult for any candidate to compete with the attention-grabbing spectacle of Trump, facing 91 charges across four cases, showing up in courtrooms even as he runs for president.
Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, predicts that he will win the New Hampshire primary. “There are some people who are hoping and praying and wishing that Nikki Haley can overtake him, which would be interesting, but again, fleeting in her success because she will go to South Carolina and lose by 30 points in her own home state. I cannot think of any example in political history where losing in your own home state by double digits has been a momentum booster.”

She added: “Some are looking at New Hampshire and thinking, well, depending on how Trump does, this could be indicative of his weakness in the general election. Perhaps. But there is a certain desire by the political media for a story and the horse race, and they’re looking for anything to write other than the inevitability of Trump, because once that happens, then people may tune out because they’re bored.”
DeSantis got about 21% of the vote in Iowa, 30 points behind Trump’s narrow majority and two points ahead of Haley. He had spent little time in New Hampshire, aware that his mini-Trump persona and joyless campaign were unlikely to gain traction with either the Maga base or independents. On Sunday, he abandoned his campaign entirely and gave his support to Trump, with an eye on another run in 2028.
Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster, told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute thinktank in Washington last week: “His appeal overlaps so much with Donald Trump. Even though he and Donald Trump have sparred a little bit throughout this race, it hasn’t got super nasty. And all of the polling I see, Nikki Haley’s favourables are not great-great but Ron DeSantis’s are still pretty great-great among Republican voters.
“Even though I don’t see a path for him – he’s going to get single digits in New Hampshire and go to South Carolina, I don’t know where this all ends – I do think I can see why he wants to stay in and be relevant as long as he can, because he does have a shot at being able to say: ‘I’m the second place guy if there is an in-case-of-emergency-break-glass situation.’”
Meanwhile Democrats are also holding a primary on Tuesday but Biden is skipping it because the state defies new Democratic rules he advocates. The president will not be on the ballot alongside nearly two dozen candidates but his allies in the state have mounted a campaign to get voters to write in his name. The result will have no bearing on the Democratic nomination but could deal Biden a symbolic blow.
Another tradition missing from the final week in New Hampshire is debates. Haley, angling to frame the primary as a battle between Trump and herself, had suggested that she would debate only if he was on stage. But the former president has skipped every debate so far and paid no price. Two televised debates for the final New Hampshire sprint were duly cancelled.
Indeed, Trump is already campaigning as if he were already in a general election against Biden, focusing his invective on border security and rising prices. At a rally in Atkinson, New Hampshire, this week he told supporters: “Our country is dying … And I stand before you today as the only candidate who is up to the task of saving America.” He promised to “make our country rich as hell again”.
There are also ominous signs of the Republican party coalescing around him, just as it did in 2016. Primary rivals Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota; Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur; and Tim Scott, a senator for South Carolina, all endorsed Trump after dropping out of the race. A constellation of senators, representatives, governors, and former White House and cabinet officials have done likewise, lending his nomination a sense of inevitability.
Back in Milford, despite all the criminal charges and his past conduct towards women, Tourangeau admitted that she would still vote for Trump if he is the Republican nominee come November, not least because of her retirement savings plan.
“I will have the sickest feeling in my stomach as I begrudgingly walk to the polls with my head down, and I will cast a vote for him,” she said. “But it’s only because my 401k will be bursting.”"
2058,5C2RCS4S7I_3DLB9OUK3E1CE9X,Allegations against Georgia prosecutors likely damaged case against Trump,Amy Gardner,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/21/fani-willis-nathan-wade-accusations-damage/,"Among friends and supporters of Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis, a common argument has taken root in response to allegations that a romantic relationship between her and the lead prosecutor on the election-interference case against Donald Trump should disqualify them both.
Even if the accusations are true, these allies say, there is no Georgia law requiring either Willis or Nathan Wade to be bumped from the case. They consider the controversy a distraction fomented by one of Trump’s co-defendants with a long record as a GOP opposition researcher. The case is too important, they say. It must go on.
In some ways, however, the damage may already be done.
After nearly two weeks of salacious headlines, Willis has still not denied or directly addressed the accusations. Trump and other critics have willingly filled that vacuum and amplified the most sensational claims. Regardless of what Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case, decides to do — and regardless of whether the accusations are true — Trump has found a new line of attack on the validity of the Georgia case and Willis’s decision-making that he is unlikely to abandon.
The allegations threaten to undermine public confidence in Willis’s prosecution of Trump. On one side, they have inflamed grievances among those who believe that Trump has been unfairly targeted by partisan prosecutors and courts. On the other, those who want Trump held accountable for his effort to reverse his 2020 defeat are scrambling to protect the case.
“Any objective observer who recognizes the strong public interest in knowing one way or the other whether a jury believes Donald Trump led a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election is going to be concerned about the impact of these allegations,” said Norm Eisen, a longtime Willis ally and advocate of the case who served as special counsel in the House of Representatives’ first impeachment of Trump.

Eisen told reporters Saturday that while there is no legal basis to disqualify either prosecutor, Wade should voluntarily step away from the case. The controversy is not going away, Eisen said, and threatens to delay the case against the former president, which must be avoided. He pointedly did not recommend that Willis step aside — a reflection of the stakes of the case against Trump.
“There is an overwhelming amount of evidence justifying the decision to prosecute Mr. Trump and his co-conspirators, including Mr. [Mike] Roman,” Eisen said. “The evidence is strong. The case is powerful. It’s very likely to lead to conviction, and we mustn’t lose time on the calendar given the paramount public interest in bringing that strong case to a speedy conclusion.”
A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to comment on Eisen’s remarks. Wade has not addressed the accusations against him, and his attorney has declined to comment on them.
Roman, a Trump co-defendant, alleged in a court filing nearly two weeks ago that Willis and Wade have been in an “improper, clandestine personal relationship,” and that Willis may have broken the law by hiring Wade as a special prosecutor and then allowing him to pay for “vacations across the world” with her unrelated to their work on the case. He called for the prosecutors to be disqualified and for the charges against him to be dismissed.
On Friday, lawyers for Wade’s estranged wife filed a motion in their divorce case that included credit card statements that appeared to show Wade had purchased airline tickets for himself and Willis to Aruba and San Francisco. It is unknown whether Willis paid him back.
Eisen acknowledged that it is unknown whether Willis violated Fulton County hiring policies or gift policies in appointing Wade, but he said those matters are not relevant to the criminal case.
Eisen’s remarks represent one of the first instances of a Willis ally acknowledging the potential damage that the allegations have brought to her and the case. Although he was quick to note that many facts remain unknown, he said it seems clear that the two have had a personal relationship, and that was “not wise.”
Another unknown is what would happen to the case if McAfee disqualifies Willis’s office. It would fall to a state prosecutors advisory council to find a new prosecutor, but it’s not certain that any would volunteer.
Eisen is one of the few Willis allies who has spoken publicly on the issue. In Atlanta, where Willis’s willingness to take on a former president has made her something of a local celebrity, friends and allies, along with many Georgia Democrats, have been silent on the accusations, some privately saying they are waiting to see what Willis says first.
Several Willis allies have said privately they were disappointed with her remarks last weekend at a historically Black church in Atlanta in which she described herself as “flawed” and “imperfect” but did not directly address the allegations. She defended her decision to hire Wade, calling him a “superstar” with “impeccable credentials.”
“The reason you’re still interested in this, and the reason people are still looking at this, is because it’s a drip-drip-drip and she hasn’t responded yet,” said Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who investigated whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
Some also criticized Willis’s claim during that speech that race is a motivating force in the controversy because she and Wade are Black.
The claims threaten to further energize Georgia Republicans, who have sought ways to disrupt the election-interference case since the August indictments, including through a newly formed state oversight commission that aims to punish “rogue” district attorneys for alleged misconduct.
More digging into Willis’s past is already underway. On Friday, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon circulated a 2020 video of Willis saying she would fire any employee who sleeps with a co-worker and promising not to date people “that work under me.”
So far, other key Georgia Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp and House Speaker Jon Burns, have fended off efforts by far-right lawmakers to use legislative powers to punish Willis and block the case.
“In Georgia, we will not be engaging in political theater that only inflames the emotions of the moment,” Kemp said in August about calls for a special session to impeach Willis and defund her office.
But the allegations against Willis and Wade threaten to unmoor that political protection from Kemp and other Republicans. Earlier this month, Kemp, who is expected to be a key witness against Trump, called the allegations against Willis “deeply troubling.”
“Evidence should be presented quickly in order for Judge McAfee to rule and the public to have confidence in this trial moving forward,” Kemp said.
Meanwhile, Burns said he would no longer oppose efforts to use the new state oversight board to target Willis, abandoning his earlier position. “The allegations against District Attorney Fani Willis are extremely troubling to say the least,” Burns said. “We need to let the process play out, but the public absolutely deserves transparency and the truth from the District Attorney about these serious allegations.”
Trump has seized on the allegations in campaign speeches and social media posts, referring to Willis and Wade as “the lovebirds.” On Friday, after the release of Wade’s credit card statements, the former president accused the prosecutors of targeting him “to ENRICH themselves and to live the Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous.” The scandal has dominated coverage on conservative-leaning media outlets and has prompted reporters to stake out Wade’s law office. An image of the special prosecutor, emerging from his office gripping a handgun, was published in the New York Post and later aired on Fox News.
Two Trump advisers said the former president’s team has watched the unfolding situation in Georgia with glee and say they expect Trump to continue the attack on Willis.
“It’s a gift to us,” one of the individuals said, requesting anonymity to speak about internal deliberations. The strategy, one of these people said, is to discredit the Georgia investigation and then use it to undercut and raise questions about the others. The Georgia case is one of four criminal prosecutions underway against Trump even as he marches toward the GOP nomination for president this year.
There is also a potential tangible reward to seeking to disqualify Willis and Wade: It could delay the trial, one person close to his legal team said. Inside Trump’s orbit, the Fulton County case has long been viewed as a less serious operation — but also perilous. If again elected president, Trump could select an attorney general with the power to drop the federal charges against him. He could also pardon himself if he is convicted in federal court. But he would have no pardon power if he or others are convicted in state court in Georgia.
One person close to Trump said aides are likely to lean on Kemp to apply pressure in the coming weeks. They are also privately heralding Roman, who has worked for Trump since 2016 on the campaign trail and at the White House, as a heroic figure.
Roman is one of the lowest-profile defendants in the election-interference case. Until recently, he had filed only a handful of court motions since the mid-August indictment alleging that Trump and 18 others illegally conspired to try to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss in Georgia.
That lack of activity had fueled speculation among close observers of the case that Roman might be among those targeted for a plea deal by Fulton County prosecutors, who have aggressively sought to flip some of those indicted in the case as they seek a conviction of Trump.
While Roman was among those offered a cooperation deal in early fall, he declined, according to a source close to the case who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.
Behind the scenes, Ashleigh Merchant, Roman’s attorney, had been chasing a tantalizing piece of courthouse gossip that she’d heard — including, she said, from staffers inside the district attorney’s office, whom she did not name — claiming that Willis and Wade were not just co-prosecutors but also romantic partners.
Merchant said in an interview that the rumor first came up in late August when she began investigating why Willis had hired Wade as a special prosecutor for the case. A longtime criminal defense attorney from Cobb County, Merchant had spent years as a Fulton County public defender, during which time she faced off against Willis in cases and knew her and many of the staff lawyers on her team well.
Merchant was also friends with Wade and had endorsed his failed campaign for a Cobb County Superior Court judgeship.
“I couldn’t believe it,” Merchant said of the rumor, adding that it seemed “sloppy” for Willis, who has a reputation of being a careful and meticulous prosecutor.
Merchant said she began filing open-records requests with the district attorney’s office seeking contracts and other documents tied not only to Wade but also the two other outside attorneys appointed to work on the case. And she said she began to talk to sources whom she declined to name — including those who allegedly claimed that it was “common knowledge” within the district attorney’s office that Willis and Wade were involved, an allegation that a spokesman for Willis has denied.
That these explosive allegations surfaced from Roman, a longtime Republican operative with a lengthy background in opposition research, has raised questions about whether Roman himself has been behind some of the digging that now threatens to upend the Georgia case. Merchant has not said how involved her client was in her investigation.
On Thursday, Willis alleged in a motion to quash a subpoena seeking to depose her in Wade’s contentious divorce case that Wade’s estranged wife, Joycelyn Mayfield Wade, was colluding with those who are seeking to disrupt the case.
Willis’s motion pointed out the close timing between the subpoena for Willis and Roman’s filing, as well as Merchant’s motion to unseal the divorce records — which all occurred within hours of one another on Jan. 8.
The motion, written by Cinque Axam, a lawyer representing Willis, accused Joycelyn Wade of “using the legal process to harass and embarrass” Willis and of “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”
In response, Andrea Dyer Hastings, one of Joycelyn Wade’s divorce lawyers, called Willis’s claims “an affront to the integrity of her office.” Her motion included Nathan Wade’s credit card statements.
“Contrary to Ms. Willis’s belief, [Joycelyn Wade] is not utilizing the deposition to harass her but rather to seek pertinent information from her husband’s paramour regarding her relationship with Plaintiff and the extent of the Plaintiff’s financial involvement in the same,” Hastings wrote. “These answers are relevant to the equitable division of the marital estate, dissipation of marital assets and the Plaintiff’s capacity to provide spousal support.”
Meanwhile, Merchant accused Willis of attempting “to create a conspiracy where none exists.”
“We filed Mr. Roman’s motion on the day it was due, January 8th,” Merchant said. “We believe her filing in Cobb County is just another attempt to avoid having to directly answer the important questions Mr. Roman has raised. She appears to be doing everything she can to avoid having to account for inconvenient and difficult facts.”
Merchant said she is planning to subpoena several witnesses to appear at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing McAfee has scheduled in response to Roman’s filing. Merchant said these witnesses will corroborate her client’s claims of misconduct by Willis and Wade.
But the first drama will come Monday, when Cobb County Judge Henry Thompson will hold a hearing in the divorce case to hear arguments on whether to unseal the divorce file and also whether Willis can be compelled to sit for a deposition in the case, which is likely to be videotaped and could eventually become public.

2059,5P2ROD9LSW_9JJ0XZ7I0VWAE9F,N.H.’s primary pushed the GOP to fix acid rain. Climate change is another story.,Michael Kranish,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/new-hampshire-primary-climate-change-acid-rain-republicans/,"CONCORD, N.H. — Thirty-six years ago, Republicans in the first-in-the-nation primary battled to prove they had the deepest commitment to the day’s most contentious issue: the acid rain poisoning New Hampshire’s lakes, rivers and forests.
George H.W. Bush promised to restore his party’s conservation ethic and curtail pollution. His top competitor, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, vowed to quickly pass an acid rain bill. The state’s voters and its Republican governor, Gov. John H. Sununu, had elevated the issue before the primary vote that helped propel Bush to the White House, where he followed through by signing legislation that has curtailed acidity in New Hampshire by 84 percent to date.
“This is one of the most significant environmental science and policy success stories of our time ... and New Hampshire is its birthplace,” Anthea Lavallee, executive director of the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, which supports the facility where acid rain research has been conducted, said at an environmental forum here on Thursday.
Now, however, as New Hampshire faces the much broader threat of climate change, Republican candidates in the state for Tuesday’s primary are barely mentioning the issue — and when they do, it is often to play it down.
Nikki Haley advocated pulling out of an international climate deal as President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations; she has said “man-made climate change is real, but liberal ideas would cost trillions and destroy our economy.” Trump calls climate change a “hoax.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he supports efforts to address the impact of hurricanes and flooding, but he rejects “the politicization of the weather.”
Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, the son of the former governor, said in an interview that he sees no comparison between dealing with acid rain and climate change.
“Climate change is a completely different story,” the younger Sununu said. “There’s a lot of politics behind that kind of socialistic approach, that green New Deal type stuff that costs trillions of dollars.”
But to environmentalists in both parties here, the analogy is clear: The bipartisan framework that significantly reduced acid rain is exactly what’s needed to deal with climate change.
The story of how New Hampshire conservatives once forced action on acid rain stands in stark contrast to the party’s environmental policies today and helps illustrate a seismic shift in party politics in America, with fewer chances for small early-primary states to effect radical change on major issues.
“There’s been almost no discussion” of climate change by Republican candidates in the state’s primary, said former U.S. senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who played a leading role in the 1990 Clean Air Act that dealt with acid rain. “People in New Hampshire do vote the environment aggressively. This is a state built around environmental protection.”
For years, New Hampshire residents were growing increasingly alarmed by the pollution causing mass die-offs of aquatic life in lakes and rivers and the deterioration of vast numbers of trees. The environmental devastation harmed everything from the forest industry to tourism, blotching a region known for its Currier and Ives landscapes.
As scientists scrambled to understand the exact causes of the phenomenon, they turned to the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a patch of the White Mountain National Forest. Gene Likens, who in 1963 was a 28-year-old scientist, led a team of researchers that eventually confirmed the acidity was caused by the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from Midwestern power plants, carried by air currents and deposited into the state’s lakes, rivers and forests. Likens’s team determined that a primary solution was to greatly curtail pollution from the coal-fired power plants and other sources.
Lawmakers in the state demanded action. By the early 1980s, 197 of 199 New Hampshire towns had voted in favor of regulating acid rain emissions, a remarkable standing for a state that had New England’s weakest environmental laws. Gov. John H. Sununu signed a state bill in 1985 requiring emission cuts, boasting of his “stringent acid rain control law.”
Three years later, the problem of acid rain took center stage in the New Hampshire primary, and candidates in both parties responded by vowing to take federal action. Dole warned there was no time to waste dealing with acid rain and was quoted in the New York Times saying, “We don’t have the luxury of waiting until we get details on the extent of the potential problem.”
Bush, then the vice president, was eager to define himself on the issue after the lack of action by President Ronald Reagan. With the elder Sununu serving as co-chair of Bush’s New Hampshire campaign, Bush vowed to reduce emissions. After winning the primary and the nomination, he sought to portray himself as a stronger defender of the environment than the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whom he criticized over the pollution in Boston Harbor. After a fall speech in which he once again vowed action on acid rain, Bush spoke of his “conservation ethic” and said, “I am an environmentalist, always have been.”
After Bush was elected president, and Sununu became White House chief of staff, he persuaded most Republicans in Congress to vote for the legislation to clean the air and curtail acid rain. The legislation capped emissions but allowed companies to trade credits primarily among coal-fired power plants, sparking innovation that reduced the cost. Known as “cap and trade,” the practice was embraced by Bush and other Republicans as a market-based solution.
While opponents predicted the legislation would be an economic disaster, it reduced acidity at much lower cost than expected, according to environmental scientists. Opponents calculated the legislation would cost $1,500 to reduce a ton of sulfur emissions, but the actual price ended up being about $15 a ton, Likens said.
Bush later said that “public servants have an obligation to try to leave the earth better than we found it,” as he told the Boston Globe in 2010. He recalled a friend had suggested he view “the environment as creation,” leading Bush to conclude, “It gives you a new appreciation for this issue and why it matters to Republicans and Democrats alike.”
Despite the success dealing with acid rain, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act mostly failed to address emissions that cause climate change, even though there were warnings about the issue at the time.
The result of both the success and the failure of that legislation is evident today at the Hubbard Brook research facility, a 7,800-acre site supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, where scientists conduct one of the country’s most extensive studies of air, water, soil and other parts of the ecosystem.
Hubbard Brook researchers have measured the 84 percent decline in acidity, according to Likens — a remarkable decrease from the peak around the early 1970s. But they have simultaneously documented that last summer, the site experienced the warmest temperature since measurements began in 1956, according to Lindsey Rustad, acting director of the Agriculture  Department’s  Northeast Climate Hub. The mean annual temperature increased by 3.6F (2C), which compares to an average global surface temperature increase of 2F (1.1C) over the same period, Rustad said.
For New Hampshire, Rustad said, the increased warming has meant longer growing seasons, warmer winters, less snow, shorter periods of lake ice and more heat waves.
“Climate change is unquestionably the biggest environmental crisis we’re facing right now,” Rustad said. “2023 was a warning.”
Climate change could be solved “just like we did with acid rain,” Rustad said.
But the political divide over that kind of action is evident on the campaign trail for this year’s primary in New Hampshire. Trump, the leading GOP contender in polls, pulled the United States out of the international climate change treaty — a move that Haley, one of his top rivals, had also backed as U.N. ambassador.
The Trump, Haley and DeSantis campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. Gov. Chris Sununu, who has endorsed Haley, said she did the right thing in backing the withdrawal from the climate accord because, he said, that agreement let big polluters such as China off the hook. Many New Hampshire residents, he said, are more concerned about the cost of heating their home than enacting new regulations.
The political climate — not just the ecological climate — has also changed significantly since his father was governor.
“George H.W. Bush did a great job of making sure that something got passed” on acid rain, the younger Sununu said. But he said climate change activists “have the extremist approach that the world is ending in 10 or 12 years, or whatever these folks have told us, and have massive policy changes or, or catastrophic events are going to happen, which, again, is an extremist approach.”
President Biden, who is not on the ballot in New Hampshire because he opposed it remaining the first primary, has strongly supported efforts to curtail climate change.
Sixty-one years after Likens led the discovery of acid rain, he appeared Thursday at the Youth Forum on Climate and Clean Energy, where he discussed how his experience can be translated into action on global warming. Despite what he called his discouragement over lack of political consensus on addressing climate change, Likens said he has to remain optimistic — especially given his own experience in the discovery of acid rain and then seeing the crisis fade into the background.
“It took 27 years from the discovery of acid rain in North America to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. It took another 34 years to today to reduce it to the near-background level that it is today,” he said. “It’s very rare that a scientist is there from discovery to reaction. It takes a long time. It’s not right, but it does.”"
2061,7KXKW1OM6W_G9G9HSLKT0RDI00,"When Reagan tried to undo affirmative action, corporations fought back",Julian Mark,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/21/ronald-reagan-affirmative-action-dei/,"President Ronald Reagan had been slowly chipping away at affirmative action since taking office in 1981, but it was six months into his second term that his administration saw its chance to deal it a decisive blow.
Reagan and his Cabinet viewed his resounding electoral victory against Walter Mondale in 1984 as a mandate to end the Lyndon B. Johnson-era policy requiring all government contractors to take “affirmative action” to end discrimination at their firms. By the mid-’80s, that meant some of the country’s largest companies — such as General Motors, IBM and Merck — had implemented robust affirmative action plans to hire women and people of color.
Reagan’s replacement order would have removed those requirements, a policy consistent with his push for deregulation and vision for a racially colorblind America. If all went according to plan, the new executive order would be viewed as the administration’s “landmark legacy,” writes legal historian Melvin I. Urofsky in his 2020 book “The Affirmative Action Puzzle.”
But after the plan leaked to the media, the effort unraveled.
Backlash came from civil rights groups, Democrats and Republicans — but also from corporate America. Many companies had adopted affirmative action plans and come to believe in them.
How the Reagan administration stoked fears of anti-white racism
“We will continue goals and timetables no matter what the government does,” said John L. Huck, chairman of Merck, the pharmaceutical giant. “They are a part of our culture and corporate procedures.”
Similarly, the National Association of Manufacturers told Reagan not to issue the order, arguing that “diversity in workforce participation produced new ideas in management, product development, and marketing,” according to Urofsky.
One 1985 survey of 128 Fortune 500 companies showed that 95 percent intended to keep their programs regardless of changes to the executive order. A year later, another survey showed that 9 in 10 planned to keep the programs; some would even expand them. According to one 1989 Harvard Law Review article, companies filed amicus briefs and sent telegrams to the White House opposing efforts to water down affirmative action.
All of this defied the White House’s expectations.
Reagan also received pushback from members of his Cabinet, as well as 126 Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who wrote a letter to Reagan calling affirmative action hiring goals and timetables an “essential tool in combating discrimination and … a necessary and proper response to the tragic legacy of historical discrimination which continues to plague our country today.”
Reagan never signed a replacement order, and Johnson’s affirmative action order has remained in effect ever since.
Nearly four decades later, corporate “diversity, equity and inclusion,” or DEI, efforts — an evolution of affirmative action — are again under intense pressure. This time, it’s not from the federal government, but rather from conservative activists emboldened by the Supreme Court’s June ruling striking down affirmative action in college admissions.
The ruling has fueled a tidal wave of reverse-discrimination complaints against Fortune 500 companies, including Meta, IBM and Amazon. In January, conservative activists hailed the resignation of Claudine Gay, Harvard’s first Black president, as a pivotal victory in their war against DEI, leaving some DEI professionals worried about the future.
But a recent survey and interviews with corporate lawyers suggest that companies are reacting in much the same way they did in the 1980s.
In a survey of more than 320 corporate executives by the employment law firm Littler Mendelson, 91 percent said the Supreme Court’s decision on admissions has not affected their prioritization of DEI. Moreover, 57 percent said they have expanded their DEI efforts over the past year, even as 59 percent said they have felt the rising backlash since the court’s decision.
“We’re seeing many employers maintain — or even double down on — their commitment to [DEI], even as backlash spikes,” said Jeanine Conley Daves, an attorney with Littler and member of the firm’s inclusion, equity and diversity consulting practice.
IBM, which has participated in affirmative action since the policy’s introduction in the early 1960s, is among those saying that its diversity efforts will continue, despite having been targeted directly.
In December, the technology company came under fire from conservatives when a recording was released of IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna stating that the company tied executive bonuses to diversity efforts. Soon after, America First Legal, a legal nonprofit run by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller, filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint against IBM, alleging that some of the company’s DEI policies violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination.
When asked about the incident in a Jan. 11 CNBC interview, Krishna stated the company’s commitment to DEI policies. “It’s very simple,” he said. “Always when there is stress … you should go back to one’s principles. IBM’s principle has been that we want to be an inclusive workplace where all employees can bring their whole self to bear.”
He noted that IBM promoted a woman to an executive role in the 1940s, long before the civil rights movement of the 1960s. “We intend to keep living by those principles,” he said.
To be sure, some companies are drawing back. Several prestigious law firms altered their diversity fellowships after being sued late last year, and other companies have made changes to their programs after being hit with complaints, according to reporting by Reuters.
In the Littler survey, 9 percent of respondents said the Supreme Court’s June decision prompted changes to how they approached DEI as well as a reduction in how much they prioritized it. And while 69 percent of respondents said their approach has not changed “in any way,” Conley Daves of Littler said in an interview that those companies may still be reviewing their policies to avoid litigation.
In addition to threatening to replace the Johnson affirmative action order, Reagan’s Justice Department ordered dozens of municipalities to pare down their affirmative action plans. It also slashed staff at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which monitored companies’ compliance with the Johnson order. And thousands of discrimination complaints were backlogged at the EEOC, which was then chaired by Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme Court justice. In June, Thomas, a vocal affirmative action critic, sided with the majority to overturn race-conscious admissions.
The time Clarence Thomas said affirmative action was ‘critical’ for society
In a 1986 radio address, Reagan rejected arguments that his administration had attempted to end affirmative action. Yet in the same address, he denounced the use of hiring quotas and minority hiring goals, and used a famous Martin Luther King Jr. speech to illustrate his point.
“We are committed to a society in which all men and women have equal opportunities to succeed, and so we oppose the use of quotas,'' Reagan said, according to a New York Times article published at the time. ''We want a color-blind society. A society, that in the words of Dr. King, judges people not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”
Harvard sociologist Frank Dobbin writes in his 2009 book “Inventing Equal Opportunity” that it was during the Reagan era that corporate equal-opportunity initiatives evolved to more closely resemble what’s known today as DEI. As the concept of “diversity” began to work its way into the corporate lexicon, companies started to argue that promoting a diverse workforce not only reduced legal exposure but was also good for business.
In an email to The Washington Post, Dobbin sought to distinguish between the Reagan era and the present, which he called “a very different situation.” The political resistance to affirmative action by conservative activists, he said, is far greater than it was in the 1980s, when much of the opposition was coming just from the White House.
“The big question in my mind is how business leaders will respond,” Dobbin said, noting that companies adopted calls for racial justice following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by announcing workplace diversity goals and publishing data on their progress.
“As some states outlaw spending on public DEI programs, I think we should be looking at whether companies stop publishing their data,” he said. “My guess is at the very least, many companies will stop making public pronouncements about their DEI activities.”"
2062,7O0NLM6DB7_UTZ41CDR1K1C6DY,Opinion Trump is not a colossus. And his party is a mess.,E.J. Dionne Jr.,"January 21, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/21/trump-gop-division-new-hampshire/,"The prevailing wisdom going into Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary sees Donald Trump as triumphant. But don’t mistake him for a colossus leading a mighty band. This view ignores the opportunism behind many of the endorsements he is winning and the sharp split between Republicans who want to govern and those who don’t.
Though there is certainly polarization between our parties, the primary cause of the deep distemper in American politics is the polarization within the Republican Party. Trump’s apparent dominance distracts from what the behavior of elected GOP politicians in Washington teaches us day after day: The party is a mess.
That doesn’t stop the Trump-Is-All-Powerful Industry from predicting he’ll go from strength to strength. Its argument is straightforward: Even if former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley wins New Hampshire, which she could, the obstacles in her way are formidable. In the next major battleground, Haley’s home state of South Carolina, Trump has a big lead. Haley’s problems only got worse on Friday when Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) announced his support for Trump.
Trump’s victory in the Iowa caucuses created the feel of a party falling in behind him. Telling were endorsements from Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), two politicians the vindictive front-runner repeatedly mocked, humiliated and slandered. On Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom Trump routinely referred to as “Ron DeSanctimonious,” dropped out of the race and endorsed his tormentor. So much for self-respect.
But even if the punditry proves right, the GOP is in no way cohesive or coherent. Just look at the Republican majority in the House, which can’t govern without Democratic help. Meanwhile, Senate and House Republicans are at odds on the most important foreign policy question of the moment: whether the United States will continue to stand up against Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.
In the House last week, Republicans were divided into almost perfect halves over whether to keep the federal government open until at least March: They voted 107-106 for a deal between House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). To get the supermajority he needed, Johnson required nearly unified Democratic support — 207 votes to 2.
In negotiations pairing help for Ukraine with enhanced border security, Democrats have given enormous ground on immigration, to the point at which Senate Republicans are reduced to begging their House comrades to accept a win.
Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), one of Trump’s most enthusiastic apologists, lectured his colleagues on reality: “To those who think that if President Trump wins, which I hope he does, that we can get a better deal — you won’t.”
If the Senate reaches a bipartisan deal and Johnson rejects it, he will be the reason Ukraine isn’t funded and the United States loses credibility around the world.
Even Trump’s big victory in Iowa belied the idea that Trump’s army would walk through fire for him. Many were plainly unwilling to ignore the bitter cold and icy roads on caucus night. Only about 110,000 of the roughly 750,000 registered Republicans in the state participated, down more than 40 percent from the 187,000 who joined the last competitive caucuses in 2016.
The divisions among those hardy voters were deep, pointing to President Biden’s opportunities to drive wedges into the GOP electorate. The entrance poll found that Trump drew just 37 percent among college graduates, compared with 67 percent among non-graduates. Caucus-goers split down the middle as to whether they considered themselves part of the MAGA movement (46 percent) or not (50 percent.). Three-quarters of the non-MAGA voters opposed Trump.
And 31 percent said they would not consider Trump fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime — a significant number, considering the loyalty to the GOP of the small minority willing to brave the elements.
Sure, Democrats have their divisions, too. Party loyalists range from the center to the left, and some of their loud fights doomed parts of Biden’s program in the last Congress. But what’s remarkable is how much they did pass with narrow House and Senate margins — and, in the case of the infrastructure and technology investments, with bipartisan support.
The difference is that Democrats want to govern because they believe government has a chance to do good. This means even the party’s most left-wing members will compromise to take a step or two forward even when they want to take four.
Republicans, on the other hand, are riven between those willing to govern — even, occasionally, with Democrats — and those who will be satisfied only if Trump is president. They presume this would allow them to roll over the left, the liberals and the moderates alike.
Failing to see the GOP as a party torn asunder allows Trump to seem stronger than he is. He uses this perceived supremacy to cow Republicans who hold the quaint view that governing in a reasonable and (small-d) democratic way is the point of getting elected. Is it just wish-casting to think New Hampshire might seize the opportunity to send them the message that it’s their duty to fight back?"
2063,ARDHH89I7J_PLALP62H4Y5IHUC,"Inside New Hampshire Gov. Sununu’s drive to stop Trump, boost Haley",Joanna Slater,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/new-hampshire-governor-primary-nikki-haley-sununu/,"BRETTON WOODS, N.H. — At a mountainside hotel in the middle of a snowstorm, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) bounded to the front of a packed room and explained how he intended to impede Donald Trump’s march to the Republican nomination.
“The other guy” — Trump — makes speeches to large rooms, then “gets in his little fancy plane and flies back to Florida,” Sununu said. But the current contest in the state will be “won on the ground” in a last sprint of retail politicking. That’s something the candidate Sununu has endorsed, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, understands “more than anybody.”
If there is any chance to challenge Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, it begins Tuesday in New Hampshire. For Sununu, the state’s popular governor, the contest represents a last-ditch effort to influence the future of the Republican Party, which he has repeatedly said should not include Trump, even if much of his party disagrees.
Sununu has emerged as Haley’s most vocal surrogate, campaigning with her across the state and lending his own appeal and local acumen to her cause.
If Haley has a strong showing in New Hampshire and in the next primary in her home state of South Carolina, Sununu said, it will be a “one-on-one race going into Super Tuesday.” Then, he said, “anything is possible.”
The scion of a political dynasty who has served as New Hampshire’s governor since 2017, Sununu is the rare conservative leader who has managed to win votes from Democrats. He has said he wants the Republican Party to be more “approachable” and “normal” — a goal that looks increasingly quixotic as long as Trump remains its standard-bearer.
In many ways, the contest in New Hampshire is a microcosm of the struggle of old-school Republicans like Sununu to wrest the party away from the darker, more polarizing vision of Trump.
The former president has been “a disaster for this party,” said Sununu, 49. If Trump becomes the nominee, he added, it will be nearly impossible to attract new voters, including young people and independents.
Trump has taken note, calling Sununu “a spoiled brat,” “the most overrated governor” and “unelectable.”
Sununu dismissed Trump’s jabs. “Every time Trump attacks,” Sununu said, “he’s afraid.”
Sununu has insisted that the campaign is about the party’s future, not his own, which at least temporarily may not center on politics. He is not running for reelection as governor in November. Last year he explored his own presidential bid but ultimately decided not to run, saying it was more important to defeat Trump.
But Sununu will remain a key voice in the debate over the party’s post-Trump future, said Jim Merrill, a Republican political consultant in New Hampshire. “The conversation about what comes next will continue,” Merrill said, although it will be put on pause if Trump becomes the nominee.
Sununu’s efforts on behalf of Haley, a former U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, echo those of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R). She backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over Trump in her state’s caucuses, only to watch him lose ignominiously.
Sununu has introduced Haley at rallies and been at her side during visits to venues ranging from a candy store to a drug rehabilitation center, recognizable in his blue, zip-up jacket bearing the words “Ski NH.” On Thursday, the two stopped by Robie’s Country Store, a century-old building on the Merrimack River that has been a destination for presidential candidates since the 1970s.
Amid a scrum of cameras squeezed next to shelves of jams and pasta, Sununu called Haley “my new best friend.”
Catherine Johnson, 64, shook hands with Haley and Sununu. His endorsement “made a huge difference” to the primary race, she said. Johnson is a Democrat, but she credited Sununu for his leadership during the coronavirus pandemic and voted to reelect him as governor even when all her other votes went to Democrats.
“He has this genuineness about him,” she said.
Robert Clark, a 76-year-old Republican from Manchester, said his top priority “is stopping Trump” from winning the presidency a second time because he believes Trump is “incompetent.”
But Clark wasn’t thrilled about his choices on the GOP side. Then last year, Sununu endorsed Haley — prompting Clark to give her a fresh look.
“She just seems to be a competent person,” Clark said at his doorstep on a recent morning as he spoke to a canvasser with Americans for Prosperity Action, the flagship political group of the Koch network that is supporting Haley’s bid.
“I wanted an alternative, and I guess when Governor Sununu put his support behind her, then I decided,” he said. (If the general election becomes a rematch between Trump and Biden, Clark said, he will support Biden).
Trump has tried to blunt Haley’s appeal with a fusillade of messaging on issue after issue, aimed at casting her as an opponent of his MAGA movement who can only prevail with the support of Democrats and independents (in New Hampshire, undeclared voters can vote in either party’s primary).
By Sununu’s count, he has done more than 100 interviews as part of a strategy to counter Trump’s megaphone. “Trump has his zealots, his cult — whatever you want to call it — on Newsmax and these stations that will fight for him tooth and nail,” Sununu said.
In interviews with The Washington Post, Sununu offered empathy for some of the other candidates, along with unvarnished opinions. He called Vivek Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after Iowa, a “misogynistic fool.” DeSantis got “better on the trail” but didn’t spend enough time in New Hampshire to earn Sununu’s endorsement. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who left the race before Iowa, had only one message and put all his focus on New Hampshire, Sununu said, describing Christie as “absolutely obsessed with being president.”
Sununu has been imbibing political strategy since childhood. His father, John H. Sununu, served as the sometimes combative governor of New Hampshire from 1983 to 1989. He then became chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush — the reward for helping Bush win the 1988 New Hampshire primary after what Sununu called a “see me, touch me, feel me” campaign, one much like Haley’s. The governor’s older brother, John E. Sununu, was a member of Congress from the state from 1997 to 2009, the last six years as senator.
After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the younger Sununu briefly attended film school before dropping out and walking the length of the Appalachian Trail from north to south (his trail name, a tradition among hikers, was “Fade Out,” a reference to his short-lived film career).
He worked as an environmental engineer in California before returning home to New Hampshire. He later ran a ski resort and won a seat on the state’s Executive Council before being elected governor in 2016. Even as his state trended more Democratic in national elections, he held on as a highly popular Republican.
Sununu has delivered on conservative priorities such as expanding charter schools and cutting taxes. He has vetoed attempts to tighten the state’s gun laws. In 2021, he signed into law a ban on abortions after 24 weeks but rejected calls to outlaw the procedure earlier in pregnancy, as many Republican-led states have done since the fall of Roe v. Wade.
Thomas Rath, a former Republican attorney general of New Hampshire, described Sununu as “an aggressive fiscal conservative with a smile” whose buoyant personality is hard to resist.
Sununu doesn’t take opposition personally, Rath added: Even after a disagreement, he’ll call you up the next day and make a joke. “Then you can laugh about who the Red Sox ought to have in left field,” Rath said.
Republicans tried to recruit Sununu to run for a Senate seat in 2022 against incumbent Maggie Hassan (D), but he turned them down. Sununu has no second thoughts about not running. Nobody ever says “I really regret not joining the circus,” he told the Boston Globe last year.
Sununu described his own possible presidential run with detachment. “I gave it six months and I’m like, I don’t want to do this,” he said in an interview last week. But he also faced ideological impediments that would have made it difficult to succeed in Republican primaries, including having described himself as “pro-choice.”
Running for president “would have been a great story and a fun ride, but it wasn’t right,” Sununu said. “I don’t need to pile on the me, me, me campaign to help myself anymore. It’s really got to be about the bigger picture.”
The bigger picture is the uphill battle to steer the party away from Trump. Yet Sununu says he will still vote for Trump if he is the Republican nominee. “There’s no question we’re better off without Biden in the White House,” he said.
Sununu jokes that after the November election, he’s going to put a suggestion box in the foyer of his office to solicit ideas for his future. But he’s leaning toward something in the private sector, maybe as an adviser to large companies. And perhaps some kind of media role to “keep my fingers in the political pie a little bit.”
Of course, if Haley pulls off an upset in the Republican race — and in the general election — all that could change.
After an event at an American Legion post in Rochester, N.H., Haley stayed to take selfies and speak with anyone who wanted to until there was no line left. Sununu shook hands, greeted people he recognized and gave an impromptu media briefing.
As the crowd thinned, Kathy Easler, 77, approached Sununu and asked if he would consider being Haley’s vice president. He demurred. “Washington is not a fun place,” Sununu said. “Nikki can handle Washington, she’s got the grit.”
Easler turned to find her granddaughter. She was not convinced by Sununu’s reluctance. “Hey, we’ve all heard them say no before,” Easler said with a knowing smile, then headed back out into the January night.

A day after receiving the endorsement of Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a former opponent, Trump on Saturday deployed an even larger show of support from South Carolina to try to undercut former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley here in New Hampshire and assert his dominance in the primary, which heads to the Palmetto State next month.
Standing before hundreds of people at a rally here, Trump was joined onstage by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster; Pamela Evette, the state’s lieutenant governor; Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general; South Carolina House Speaker Murrell Smith; and Curtis Loftis, the state treasurer. Reps. Russell Fry, William Timmons and Joe Wilson, all U.S. House members from South Carolina, also flanked the former president.
Trump introduced the officials, praising each of them and highlighting their rank in Haley’s home state. He emphasized that they had come to New Hampshire to support him because they “understand that I am the only candidate in this race who can save America from every single Biden disaster starting on Day One.”
“To the people of New Hampshire: All you need to know about Nikki Haley is that every globalist, liberal, Biden supporter and ‘Never Trumper’ is on her side — and virtually every single leader … in her home state of South Carolina is on our side. We have almost everybody,” he said after four of them, including McMaster, spoke on his behalf.
Trump joked that he had invited the South Carolina leaders to attempt to get in their good graces ahead of the state’s primary next month. “I’m kissing a--,” he said, laughing.
McMaster said that he and the South Carolina delegation were here to make the point that the majority of the people of South Carolina were with Trump — not the former governor.
“That’s why we are here. We are here for one reason: Those great philosophers, the Spice Girls, tell us what you want, what you really, really want. Well that’s what we’re here to do: to tell you what we in South Carolina want,” said McMaster, 76, quoting the British pop group’s song “Wannabe,” which was met with a standing ovation from the crowd.
“New Hampshire is for Trump. South Carolina is, too. We’ll see you at the finish line,” he said.
Haley on Saturday waved off Trump’s efforts to undermine her ahead of his rally with the delegation from her home state. When Haley was specifically asked about the decision by McMaster — who served as lieutenant governor during her time as governor — to come to campaign for Trump, she quipped in response: “I’m sorry, is that the person I ran against for governor and beat? Just checking.”
“Yet another nearly 80-year-old that’s trying to make an impact,” added New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R).
Haley argued that legislators in South Carolina were not backing her because, as governor, she forced their hand to back an ethics reform and called out their “wasteful spending.”
“There’s a reason there’s no love for me from the legislature in South Carolina,” she said during a campaign stop in Peterborough.
On congressional lawmakers backing Trump, she said she was not surprised because she is calling for more accountability from elected officials. There should be term limits and mental competency tests, and members should not get paid if they fail to pass a budget on time, she said. Haley on Saturday also questioned Trump’s mental fitness.
Haley’s odds of stopping or slowing his momentum lie here in the Granite State, where independent voters make up about 39 percent of the electorate. Haley’s lead among this bloc has narrowed in recent days, and she continues to trail Trump among Republican voters in polls.
At his rallies, Trump has repeatedly sought to diminish Haley’s résumé and said that he appointed Haley to become his U.N. ambassador to allow McMaster to become governor. McMaster was lieutenant governor at the time.
Trump’s move was similar to a strategy he deployed against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this summer when he was viewed as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary. Trump brought members of the Florida delegation who had endorsed him to the Iowa State Fair.
In a not-so-subtle mention of Haley on Friday, Trump noted when he first introduced Scott: “I’m running against somebody from his state.” The senator came on the stage energetic, drawing an enthusiastic reception from the crowd as he told them, “We need a president like Donald Trump.”
Scott’s endorsement comes after the U.S. senator ended his own presidential bid in November. During his campaign, Scott — dubbed the “happy warrior” by many of his allies — refrained from criticizing the former president directly, with the exception of Trump’s reluctance to endorse a 15-week abortion ban. Scott sought to draw a contrast with Trump primarily through his tone, offering an optimistic vision of the country going forward.
Haley acknowledged that it was a letdown to see Scott, whom she appointed to the Senate in 2012, come out in support of Trump’s bid for a second term.
“Was I disappointed? Of course I was,” she said at the Peterborough campaign stop.
Supporters at the Trump event were pleased to see leaders from the Palmetto State coming to New Hampshire on behalf of the former president — even if they weren’t familiar with everyone who took the stage.
“I say: The more, the merrier,” said Chris Levesque, 52, who attended the rally with his sister.
Gerry Blaisdell, 55, who waited for hours in the cold to attend the rally with her friend, said Trump was sending the right message by showing the widespread support he has beyond New Hampshire.
“The other side is going to come after him for as long as they can, so he needs this united front with him,” she said.

2069,JZO4XU3UJJ_0PXRYMV40H7RFWV,Elise Stefanik generates VP speculation as she campaigns with Trump,Marianne LeVine,"January 21, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/elise-stefanik-trump-vp-new-hampshire/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Standing in a packed room at the Trump campaign office here, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) delivered a quintessential Trumpian speech. She drew cheers from the crowd as she declared that “we need to build the wall.” She ripped “Bidenomics.” And she reiterated Donald Trump’s claims of a weaponized judicial system.
“They’re trying to remove President Trump from the ballot in multiple states; you see them, witch hunt after witch hunt,” she told supporters. “They’re doing it because they know that Donald J. Trump, President Trump, is going to win and beat Joe Biden.”
One person cheered “VP” as she finished her remarks. When she approached reporters, Stefanik echoed Trump again, asking attendees, “Trump supporters, are we ready to take questions from the fake media?” It was Stefanik’s second public appearance in the Granite State in less than 24 hours for Trump, as he and his allies are hoping for a decisive win Tuesday that will bring an early end to the Republican nomination process.
Stefanik, the No. 4 House Republican, symbolizes the shift of GOP officials in the Trump era. Once a Trump critic — a view for which she was celebrated among Republicans who had opposed his 2016 presidential bid — Stefanik has risen within the party over the years and fully embraced Trump. But her drop-in trip to New Hampshire, as well as visits from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), has prompted speculation beyond the state’s primary: Whom would Trump pick as his vice president if he becomes the nominee?
Stefanik's climb to GOP leadership, embrace of Trump come at personal cost
During Trump’s 2016 campaign, Stefanik said that his behavior toward women was “offensive” and “just wrong,” and that she would “absolutely oppose” some of his foreign policy. She defied Trump on several policies, including her party’s tax cut bill, and disagreed with his pledge to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.
But her view and approach toward Trump changed. Her evolution from moderate to MAGA began after Democrats sought to impeach him over his effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his rival, Biden. Stefanik thought the impeachment was a sham and was furious about how Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, led the effort, a sentiment widely shared by Republicans, according to numerous GOP aides and lawmakers who have spoken to her. It led her to become a fierce Trump defender in Congress and on conservative television. Trump embraced her as a “Republican star.”
When asked about being a potential choice for vice president in a phone interview, Stefanik responded: “I’d be honored to serve in the Trump administration in any capacity,” saying she’s “focused on being a surrogate.” Stefanik added that she is friends with other surrogates whose names come up as potential vice-presidential picks, adding that “we are showing a full-court press.”
Nikki Haley says being Trump’s vice president is ‘off the table’
Even as Trump seemed to suggest at a Fox News town hall in Iowa that he knew whom he’d pick, his campaign has tamped down speculation about whom it is eying for the vice presidency should Trump win the nomination.
“President Trump is focused on winning New Hampshire and securing the Republican nomination for president,” senior adviser Jason Miller said. “There will be a time and place for VP discussions, but that isn’t now. Anyone claiming to have some ‘inside scoop’ is, in fact, fake news.”
In the same interview with The Washington Post, Stefanik said her support for Trump “goes back a long way,” adding that she was proud “to be the leading voice” during the former president’s first impeachment. She and her aides noted ads from her Democratic opponent Mike Derrick in 2016 hitting her as the “only Republican woman from the Northeast to still support Trump” while quoting other Republicans who said they could not support him. At the time, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and then-Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), the other two GOP women elected to Congress in the Northeast, said they did not back Trump.
After GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) was removed from her leadership position in 2021 because of her constant criticism of Trump and the Republicans who defended him, Stefanik, who had become one of Trump’s most ardent allies even after his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, was elected by House Republicans to the position tasked with GOP messaging.
While Cheney had a more conservative voting record than Stefanik’s, she was ousted from her leadership position because she did not support Trump’s baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen.
Science is revealing why American politics are so intensely polarized
But Stefanik has since passed over opportunities to run for higher leadership positions. In part, she realized it would be a tough fight against other candidates for whip, but she also made the calculation, according to people close to her, that a senior leadership position was going to be politically risky in a slim majority.
Stefanik’s rise followed her turnabout in her view on Trump’s claims about stolen elections. In 2016, after Trump said he was concerned about “rigged” polls showing him trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, she said she disagreed with Trump, who beat Clinton. But when Trump falsely said the 2020 election was stolen, she supported some of his claims.
She falsely said that in Georgia, “more than 140,000 votes came from underage, deceased and otherwise unauthorized voters in Fulton County alone,” a claim refuted by Georgia election officials and given four Pinocchios by The Post’s Fact Checker. She signed on to a failed lawsuit filed by Texas’s attorney general that sought the rejection of the presidential vote in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, all of which were won by Biden. She voted against certifying Biden’s win in Pennsylvania.
Speaking recently on NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” she stood by her vote against certifying the Pennsylvania results, accusing the state of “unconstitutional overreach.” After the interviewer noted that Stefanik had said that the Jan. 6 rioters “must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she was asked whether she agreed with Trump’s statement that Jan. 6 was a “beautiful day” and that some of those who went to jail are “hostages.”
She responded by accusing NBC of being biased and said she believed that “Joe Biden will be found to be the most corrupt president in our nation’s history.” Pressed to answer the question, she responded: “I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages.” The Trump team loved the interview, according to two people familiar with their sentiments.
Jan. 6 ‘hostage’ comments fuel House GOP divisions in tough election year
As for the 2024 election, Stefanik has said she would not commit to certifying the results. “We will see if this is a legal and valid election,” she said.
In the interview with The Post, Stefanik said she speaks to Trump “frequently” and described her district in New York as “the story of the evolution of the Republican Party and the growing support for President Trump that we are seeing from hard-working families.”
Many of Stefanik’s colleagues on Capitol Hill see her as angling to become vice president. One vulnerable New York Republican, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter candidly, said: “She’s auditioning.”
Another vulnerable House member suggested Stefanik has a balance to strike between being in leadership and pursuing higher ambitions.
“I think when you’re in leadership, it can look like it’s annoying for rank and file,” that member said. “But if you’re in leadership and you’re thinking of higher office, you’re going to have to throw out there what gets people’s attention.”
For the past several cycles, Stefanik has focused on electing more Republican women. She is also now working to ensure Republicans from her home state win reelection. And she has been encouraging House Republicans to endorse Trump, telling them it will help motivate the GOP base.
The Early 202: The Republicans who aren’t endorsing Trump
Stefanik recently received praise from conservatives for her role in a congressional hearing with the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their handling of antisemitism on campus. Stefanik later took credit for the resignations of Harvard President Claudine Gay and Penn President Liz Magill.
Resignation at Harvard latest but not last salvo in GOP war on colleges
At a campaign event in Concord, N.H., last week where Stefanik also spoke, Trump praised the New York Republican for her committee performance, even as he mispronounced her last name in the speech: “That was such a beautiful delivery, did she destroy those three people.”
Voters attending Stefanik’s campaign event Saturday said she was among the candidates they would like to see join Trump on the ticket, along with tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and other members of Congress.
Marie Tontodonato, 68, of Hampton, N.H., described Stefanik as a “front-runner.”
“She supports Trump, and she’s been pushing for him in Congress and her home state; she’s just like one of us,” Tontodonato said. As for vice president, she would like to see “either her or Kristi Noem,” she said, referring to the Republican governor of South Dakota. “I’d like to see a woman. And Ben Carson. Those are my three picks.”

2071,LIRLWWM6N4_I8HB7TH0OI3VSEQ,Growing Oct. 7 ‘truther’ groups say Hamas massacre was a false flag,Elizabeth Dwoskin,"January 21, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/21/hamas-attack-october-7-conspiracy-israel/,"When she first heard about Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Mirela Monte was “appalled.” The South Carolina real estate agent and self-described holistic healer detests violence and is horrified by war and human suffering.
But as Monte read more in Uncensored Truths, a Telegram group with 2,958 subscribers active on foreign policy and the supposed perils of vaccination, her shock turned to anger. According to the forum, the news reports were wrong: Secretly, Israel was behind the massacre.
Monte now argues the Oct. 7 attack was a “false flag” staged by the Israelis — likely with help from the Americans — to justify genocide in Gaza. “Pure evil,” she said. “Israel is like a mad dog off a leash.”
The Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack is among the most well-documented in history. A crush of evidence from smartphone cameras and GoPros captured Hamas’s breach of the border — a strike Israel says left about 1,200 dead, the deadliest onslaught in the country’s history.
But Oct. 7 denial is spreading. A small but growing group denies the basic facts of the attacks, pushing a spectrum of falsehoods and misleading narratives that minimize the violence or dispute its origins. Some argue the ambush was staged by the Israeli military to justify an invasion of Gaza. Others say that some 240 hostages Hamas took into Gaza were actually kidnapped by Israel. Some contend the United States is behind the plot.
These untrue and misleading narratives have been seeded on social media, where hashtags and terms linking Israel to “false flag” — a staged event that casts blame on another party — tripled on services including TikTok, Reddit and 4chan in the weeks after the attacks, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit tracking disinformation.
It’s bleeding into the real world: Demonstrators have shouted the claim at anti-Israel protests and have used it to justify removing posters of hostages in cities like London and Chicago. At a November city council meeting in Oakland, Calif., multiple residents disputed the veracity of the attack.
“Israel murdered their own people on October 7,” said Christina Gutierrez, an analyst in the city’s housing department, where some in the crowd shouted “antisemitism isn’t real.” Gutierrez did not respond to requests for comment.
The phenomenon is worrisome to Jewish leaders and researchers who see ties to Holocaust denial, the attempt to undermine the genocide that killed 6 million Jews during World War II, a belief that has surged online. They also see parallels to many pernicious, internet-driven conspiracy theories with antisemitic tentacles, including the QAnon conspiracy theory, which alleges “globalists” — a reference, some say, to Jews — used the pandemic to control the world, and disinformation about the 9/11 terrorist attack, which some fringe groups falsely argue was perpetrated by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
Antisemitism was rising online. Then Elon Musk super-charged it.
“There’s a built-in audience that wants to deny that Jews are the victims of atrocity and furthers the notion that Jews are secretly behind everything,” said Joel Finkelstein, chief science officer at NCRI.
In Ukraine and other conflict zones, smartphones coupled with the velocity of social networks allow the public to witness events in real time, providing a sense of “ground truth” about far-flung incidents.
But social media is an equally potent tool for distortion — and the internet has a singular power to erase and twist history.
The head of International Relations for Hamas, Basem Naim, has falsely asserted that the group “didn’t kill any civilians” when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, calling the claim “Israeli propaganda.”  Such false claims are finding an audience in a variety of online spaces.
“So basically the Hamas attack was a false flag for Israel to occupy Gaza and kill Palestinians,” reads a recent post on the Reddit forum r/LateStageCapitalism. “Expected behaviour from nazi wannabes.”
LateStageCapitalism is a community of left-wing activists that bills itself as “A One-Stop-Shop for Evidence of our Social, Moral and Ideological Rot.” But the claim can be found elsewhere on the internet, including publications critical of Israel like Electronic Intifada and Grayzone, and in messaging groups like Monte’s Uncensored Truths, which previously had been focused on pandemic-related gripes about vaccines and conspiratorial ideas about “globalists” ushering in a so-called New World Order. Right-wing Holocaust deniers also have latched onto the claims.
All cherry-pick evidence — some factual, some highly distorted — to push misleading narratives.
Israeli citizens have accused the country’s military of accidentally killing Israeli civilians while battling Hamas on Oct. 7; the army has said it will investigate.  But articles on Electronic Intifada and Grayzone exaggerated these claims to suggest that most Israeli deaths were caused by friendly fire, not Hamas.
One Grayzone story quotes an Israeli helicopter pilot describing difficulty distinguishing between civilians and Hamas on Oct 7. But the account distorts his testimony, in which he describes in Hebrew the dilemma of facing so many terrorists, said Achiya Schatz, director of FakeReporter, an Israeli watchdog organization dedicated to fighting disinformation and hate speech online.
An Electronic Intifada article from November also argues that “most” Israeli casualties on Oct. 7 were perpetrated by the Israeli army, basing the story, in part, on a YouTube clip of a man who describes himself as a former Israeli general. The clip refers to these outsider observations as “a confession.”
Electronic Intifada executive director Ali Abunimah said in an email: “It would appear that the reach and success of The Electronic Intifada in debunking and exposing the kind of pro-Israel propaganda routinely published by the Washington Post is now causing enough worry that you have been assigned to do a hit piece, in which labels such as ‘far-left’ and ‘anti-Israel’ will be deployed in order to try to misdirect your readers from our careful, factual reporting.”
Two weeks after the Hamas attack, filmmaker Aharon Keshales and his wife were taking a Saturday walk in the Primrose Hill section of London when they saw a woman ripping down hostage posters on a local bridge.
The couple, who are Israeli, spoke to the woman, who said she was removing the posters because the people had not been kidnapped by Hamas, according to video of the encounter reviewed by The Post. Keshales said he and his wife told the woman that even Hamas has admitted taking hostages. The woman grabbed the posters and walked away, according to the video.
Keshales said the incident — which has now been repeated in several cities, according to other videos posted on social media — left him disturbed.
“Everyone takes a side in every conflict, and that’s okay. But to put it on Israel — that’s a lie,” he said. “Maybe it’s easier to lie than to say, ‘You got what you deserve.’ Maybe it’s psychologically easier than saying, ‘I hate you.’”
Influencers who question the Holocaust are also among those sowing doubt about Oct. 7.
“Despite how it can appear sometimes I don’t actually have an axe to grind with the Jews,” said Owen Benjamin, a comedian who embraces far-right and antisemitic content, in a November post on X. “It’s just the insane Holocaust narrative and fake war atrocities by shoved down our throats as Americans by israel needs constant pushback,” he wrote in apparent reference to the atrocities of Oct. 7.
The current conflict also is helping Holocaust deniers find potential new allies: neo-Nazis have shown up at pro-Palestinian rallies in several states, seizing an opportunity, analysts said, to push antisemitic tropes. And they’ve deployed conspiratorial rhetoric that appeals to different audiences: Dan Hanley, who runs an organization that claims there were no Muslim terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks, posted on X in November that the “Zionist Rothschild cabal et al was behind both the 9-11 and Oct. 7 false flags.”
Benjamin and Hanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Researchers warn that Oct. 7 conspiracy theories may follow a similar trajectory to Holocaust denial, which was waning before social media platforms propelled its resurgence a decade ago.
The election of former president Donald Trump — who fanned the flames of white nationalism with his defense of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville — along with lightly moderated tech services like Telegram, Discord and Gab, have given new life to Holocaust denial, said Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League. Mainstream platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which permitted such content under their policies until recently, have also played a role.
The platforms have enabled extremists to pitch their ideas to more people, replacing swastikas with more broadly palatable internet memes such as Pepe the frog.
This newer brand of antisemitism has led a generation of young people to dispute the Holocaust. One in five American adults under 30 say they agree the “Holocaust is a myth,” according to a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in the first week of December. More than a fifth say they believe that the Holocaust was exaggerated.
The long tail of Holocaust denial is a lesson in what may happen to Oct. 7, said Emerson Brooking, resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank — despite copious real-time documentation of the attacks. Extremists will draw people who are genuinely concerned about the atrocities in Gaza, where over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s invasion, down a rabbit hole of conspiracies and misleading information, he said.
“It’s generally indisputable that Hamas did something — the pro-Hamas camp can’t erase that entirely. But they can keep chipping away at it, and over time, you’re seeing a rewriting of history,” said Brooking, co-author of the book “Likewar: The Weaponization of Social Media.”
Erasures of historical memory by online tacticians are not confined to the Holocaust, researchers noted. In both Brazil and Argentina, right-wing groups have used disinformation campaigns to question settled facts about human rights abuses under the military dictatorships of the 1970s and ’80s. Popular YouTube influencers who support Argentina’s far-right President Javier Milei are increasingly arguing that the military’s torture and disappearance of tens of thousands of political adversaries during that period didn’t happen, according to Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group that recently asked Google to remove the content.
Finkelstein said that conspiracy theories about Oct. 7 are beginning to bleed into the tumult roiling U.S. universities over the war. On X, activists claim Jewish students and “zionists” are “staging false flag hate crimes” against themselves on college campuses. Grayzone called it a “contrived campus antisemitism crisis.”
While it’s reasonable to question the intentions and wartime tactics of Israel’s government, Finkelstein said, efforts to say Israel was responsible for Oct. 7 are part of a broader strategy by antisemitic extremists to undermine Jewish suffering.
“First you have to prove that your enemies aren’t really victims or oppressed,” he said. “If your enemies are victims or are oppressed, your worldview doesn’t make sense.”"
2076,U1912TN59P_4RPHPC42KR6F1B3,"Ron DeSantis ends presidential campaign, endorses Trump",Hannah Knowles,"January 21, 2024 at 3:04 p.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/ron-desantis-drops-out/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday ended his once-promising presidential campaign, which steadily deflated as he struggled to connect with voters and persuade Republicans to swap Donald Trump for a younger, more disciplined champion of his ideas.
As he departed the contest, DeSantis endorsed Trump, who had relentlessly attacked the Florida governor with demeaning nicknames and charges that he was disloyal. His exit came just two days before voting in New Hampshire’s primary, where Trump appears to be closing in on another victory that would underscore his unrivaled grip on the GOP.
DeSantis, 45, had seemed to many Republicans like the most viable challenger to Trump after the 2022 midterms, when the governor won reelection by a landslide. But he started to lose ground in polling even before his official campaign launch in May — via a glitchy live chat that neatly embodied the way his grand plans were going awry.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said in a video message he posted Sunday afternoon on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. “They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare to this day to attack him.”
He acknowledged “disagreements” with Trump — he spent the past year effectively calling Trump self-absorbed and ineffective — but suggested Trump’s remaining GOP rival, Nikki Haley, was worse. “We can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,” DeSantis said.
Even before DeSantis dropped out, Haley had emerged as the most viable challenger to Trump, polling closer to him in New Hampshire, where independents and moderate Republicans have given her a particular boost. But it’s not clear that she can pull off an upset, and she faces a tough road ahead. On Sunday she said DeSantis “ran a great race” and has “been a good governor.”
“Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” said Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina governor.
Trump’s campaign said in a statement it was “honored” by DeSantis’s endorsement and said “it is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump” against Biden.
DeSantis echoed Trump’s combative style and “America First” rallying cry while arguing he would be more electable, truer to conservative values and more effective at executing an agenda. He appealed heavily to the party base as someone willing to dig in on polarizing issues and go to battle with critics, the media and companies such as Disney. Struggling to make headway against Trump, he increasingly criticized the former president as “high risk” and “low reward” for the Republican Party.
But the second-term governor’s strategy fell flat as voters refused to leave Trump and even gravitated back to him, galvanized by outrage at the former president’s four criminal indictments. DeSantis alienated more moderate primary voters and donors who increasingly looked to Haley as a Trump alternative. Awkward interactions on the trail dogged DeSantis’s campaign, spawning viral videos and feeding his longtime reputation for aloofness.
A person deeply involved in DeSantis’s campaign, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely, said the campaign had a host of problems: no coherent message, warring advisers and a weak small-dollar donor program. DeSantis disliked courting donors and activists, this person said, and spent too much time on culture war issues. When he made adjustments, this person said, it was too late.
“At the end of the day, I don’t think any of it mattered with all the Trump indictments,” this person said. “It wasn’t a well-run campaign, but I don’t think the best-run campaign would have beaten Trump.”
DeSantis barely bested Haley for a distant second in Iowa, the state where he bet the vast majority of his time and resources. After Iowa, DeSantis confronted a difficult map with no obvious states to help him turn the tide.
And a sprawling operation that quickly amassed more than $100 million was plagued by infighting and distrust among different factions. DeSantis loyalists in Tallahassee clashed with the national consultants brought in to run a supportive super PAC — their tensions culminating in the late creation of a new group and the resignations and firings of top officials.
Ron DeSantis wanted to change the way campaigns were funded. Then the fights started.
Discussions about dropping out began last week as DeSantis’s team insisted he was staying in and turning his sights to South Carolina. The governor had told donors and allies he had enough money to get through South Carolina, whose GOP primary is Feb. 24, but senior staffers did not see a path to victory, according to a person familiar with the conversations. DeSantis was on track to post a single-digit percentage showing in New Hampshire, polls showed, which could have made his exit more embarrassing.
Most of DeSantis’s senior staff wanted him to drop out of the race, according to a longtime ally of DeSantis who talks to him regularly, who said the governor heard arguments that losses could further damage his brand. DeSantis is determined to still have a future in Republican politics, this person said, and didn’t want to be further damaged for 2028.
The Florida governor said he was resigned to the fact that Republican voters wanted to back Trump — and conservative news outlets and influencers were now against him. DeSantis told one adviser last week that he understood he would probably lose but was not ready to pull the cord.
“He wasn’t going to even break single digits in New Hampshire and had no path in South Carolina,” said a person close to the governor. “He was trying to tell everyone he was just going to hang out and wait for Trump’s legal challenges to play out, but that wasn’t feasible and he knew it.”
DeSantis returned to Tallahassee this weekend instead of campaigning in South Carolina through Sunday, as had been planned, according to several people familiar with his travel. His campaign had recently added a Sunday evening event in New Hampshire and tried to bat away speculation the end was near after the governor canceled morning TV appearances.
A GOP star for his strident opposition to coronavirus restrictions in Florida, DeSantis enacted an aggressive home-state agenda in the run-up to his campaign. He passed laws limiting discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in school, defunding college “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs and banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, among many others. He called Florida “the place where woke goes to die,” touting the GOP’s dominance in the state and his nearly 20-point margin of victory in 2022, which led the New York Post to nickname the governor “DeFuture.”
Despite the national buzz, some Republicans who worked with DeSantis in Florida harbored doubts that his success in the state would translate on a national stage. As governor, they said, DeSantis was effective but ruthless and insular, was unenthusiastic about the social aspects of politics and kept a small circle of trust that centered on his wife. Replacing his campaign manager in August, DeSantis chose a loyal aide from the governor’s office without campaign experience — a shake-up that one fundraiser panned as “rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”
Money was one of DeSantis’s big advantages when he entered the race. His campaign raised a formidable $8 million within 24 hours of launching. And more than $80 million left over from his gubernatorial reelection was transferred to his primary super PAC, Never Back Down, which took on many functions traditionally handled by campaigns and pushed the limits of legal restrictions on such an outside group’s ability to coordinate with their favored candidate. Never Back Down built a massive door-knocking program, took on some of his private plane costs and hosted many of DeSantis’s events, inviting him as a “special guest.”
But the campaign quickly ran into financial trouble after launching with a massive staff and setting expectations for fundraising too high. Layoffs commenced. The super PAC absorbed even more costs. Major donors were also backing away, some of them aghast at DeSantis’s signing of a six-week abortion ban or his statement to then-Fox host Tucker Carlson that the U.S. had no compelling reason to become “further entangled in a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine.”
Billionaire Ken Griffin, a top funder of DeSantis’s gubernatorial reelection, was initially expected to make a major contribution to the DeSantis effort. But he grew critical of the governor. The largest known contributor to Never Back Down, businessman Robert Bigelow, pulled back and said in August that DeSantis had gone too far to the right. Griffin was most angry about DeSantis’s position on abortion, and multiple entreaties from DeSantis advisers could not win his support for the governor, according to people familiar with the situation. Wall Street leaders close to him then gave to Haley.
Trump’s indictments — starting in late March — marked the start of a polling decline for DeSantis with voters who approve of the former president. In polling and focus groups, DeSantis backers and other Republicans found that many seemingly logical lines of attack on Trump were ineffective.
Still, DeSantis eventually ramped up his criticism of Trump, a former ally whose endorsement once helped DeSantis beat the establishment candidate in Florida’s 2018 gubernatorial race. He used the second GOP debate in September to assail Trump’s absence, calling him “missing in action.” On the trail, he lamented that “Trump views everything through the lens of him.”
DeSantis banked on a strong performance in Iowa, the first state in the GOP nominating calendar. He had championed causes important to the evangelical voters who dominate the Republican caucuses there, and tapped into the Christian social conservative networks that powered past winners in the Hawkeye State. His legislative priorities in Florida echoed the priorities of Iowa Republicans, who also passed a six-week abortion ban that got caught up in the courts.
Trump, meanwhile, had attacked prominent conservatives in the state, including Gov. Kim Reynolds (R). Reynolds, who grew deeply frustrated with Trump, initially said she was staying neutral but then took the unusual step of endorsing DeSantis in November.
“We need a leader who is looking forward and not backwards,” Reynolds said at the November opening of a DeSantis campaign office near Des Moines. “We need a leader who will follow through on his promises and has a record of following through on his promises.” The phrase “no excuses” became a sort of unofficial campaign slogan as DeSantis leaned into the idea that he could get things done where others, particularly Trump, had fallen short.
DeSantis fulfilled his early pledge to campaign in all of Iowa’s 99 counties, racked up legislative endorsements and moved much of his campaign staff there in the fall. Yet Trump maintained a large lead in Iowa and everywhere else.
“DeSantis would make the best president,” said DeSantis donor and surrogate Dan Eberhart. “Unfortunately, he didn’t run the best campaign.”
As DeSantis struggled, the divisions in his team grew and spilled out into public view. Close allies of the governor launched a new super PAC late in the fall, and campaign leadership gave the new organization its blessing to effectively take over advertising. Sidelined and instructed to focus on field organizing, Never Back Down saw repeated shake-ups in leadership.
Its CEO resigned. His replacement was fired less than two weeks later, along with two other senior officials, and the chairman of the group’s board — former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, a longtime friend of DeSantis’s — left, too. Scott Wagner, a Florida-based lawyer and college friend of the governor, took the helm and accused the fired officials of misconduct, prompting the group’s chief strategist, Jeff Roe, to join the exodus with a month to go before the Iowa caucuses. Roe alluded to Wagner’s comments and said they were false.
Trump’s team had taken particular delight in criticizing DeSantis — many of Trump’s former advisers had worked for the governor before falling out with him, and his team had a universal dislike for Roe.
For example, DeSantis had fired Susie Wiles, once his top aide, after he became governor in 2019 — and sought to persuade others to fire her as well, including Trump, the lobbying firm where she worked and the RNC.
In 2021, she took the helm of Trump’s operation when the former president was at the nadir of his political influence in the GOP. She has spent the past three years working to make him the GOP nominee. Late Saturday, as DeSantis canceled his events for Sunday, Wiles posted a two-word tweet, her first in months.
“Bye bye,” she wrote.

2081,XAF34NADPH_SD8RETBCDHM3WE8,"In Judge Kaplan’s court, Trump plays with fire",Shayna Jacobs,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/21/trump-carroll-judge-kaplan-witness/,"In the high-stakes world of presidential trials, there are no judges like Lewis A. Kaplan.
At 79, after decades on the bench, the senior judge is one of the most well-regarded legal minds in New York. And he has a unique history that makes Donald Trump’s courtroom behavior over the past week potentially dangerous for the former president of the United States.
Trump is on trial in a civil case as writer E. Jean Carroll seeks damages from Trump, who has been found liable for defaming her when he made disparaging remarks denying he sexually assaulted her decades ago in a department store.
Trump has claimed that he intends to testify in the case on Monday — which would probably produce a dramatic courtroom showdown. But it’s unclear whether Trump will really show up. For one thing, he has made similar claims in the past, then not appeared. For another, Tuesday is the New Hampshire primary, and Trump is again running for president.
If he does testify, legal experts said, his time on the witness stand could be something akin to a suicide mission.
Over the past week, Kaplan’s handling of the damages trial in Lower Manhattan shows how different a federal courtroom is from most other parts of public life — even state court, where Trump and his lawyers had more leeway to squabble with a judge overseeing a different civil trial in another New York courthouse over the past several months. Kaplan has not tolerated similar behavior, and Trump has railed on social media that the federal judge is “a totally biased and hostile person.”
The former president claimed that he only lost a previous lawsuit brought by Carroll over the sexual assault and a different set of defamatory comments because he didn’t appear in court personally. Kaplan oversaw that lawsuit, too.
See how Trump is is making his court appearances seem like campaign stops
In recent weeks, Trump has been attending more court hearings than he needs to, seemingly deciding that the best way to fight his legal critics — and win the GOP nomination — is to try to shout them down. He has spoken out of turn in the courtroom and denounced the proceedings.
Legal experts warn that if he does so on the witness stand in Kaplan’s courtroom, he could end up humiliated and threatened with contempt of court.
Robert Katzberg, a veteran New York white-collar criminal defense lawyer, said Kaplan is “the worst possible draw for Trump,” not because of any personal or political bias, but because of the type of judge he is.
“He’s really smart and takes no guff from either side. He expects lawyers to be professional and toe the line, and if they do not, holds them accountable,” said Katzberg, who is now consulting counsel for Holland & Knight.
“Even if you had the most pro-Trump judge in America overseeing the trial, Donald Trump should not testify. Multiply that by a million with Lewis Kaplan on the bench,” he said. “Given both his lack of any relevant facts as to the only issue remaining — the damages suffered by Ms. Carroll — and Donald Trump’s inability to control himself emotionally, he is begging not only to be debased before the jury, but contempt citations will be looming large.”
Kaplan’s history with contempt is unique among the federal judiciary. In 2019, Kaplan sought to persuade federal prosecutors to charge a lawyer, Steven Donziger, with criminal contempt of court after he refused to give access to his communications.
When prosecutors declined, the judge took the rare step of appointing a private law firm to prosecute Donziger. The attorney was ultimately convicted and served 45 days in jail after already having spent more than two years under house arrest.
In court last week, Kaplan dropped the hammer on Trump when the former president flouted the rules of courtroom behavior.
After being told that Trump, sitting at the defense table, was denigrating Carroll loudly enough for the nine-member jury to hear, Kaplan ordered him to cut it out.
“Mr. Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial,” the judge said, adding that Trump has a right to be in court, but “that right can be forfeited … if he is disruptive.”
Trump threw his hands up in an animated show of disapproval.
“I would love it! I would love it!” he said.
Kaplan said Trump appeared unable to control himself.
“You can’t, either!” the former president retorted.
Outside court, Trump has fired off a relentless barrage of social media posts about Carroll.
Inside the courtroom, Kaplan has chided Trump’s lead lawyer, Alina Habba, who has little trial experience, for not knowing proper procedures and rules.
One exchange, about a defunct New York restaurant, sounded more like a scene from a Marx Brothers movie than a “Law & Order” episode.
Habba asked Carroll whether she was a regular at a Manhattan restaurant called Elaine’s.
“Yes,” Carroll replied.
“It’s incredibly hard to get into, correct?” asked Habba.
“Not [hard]. You can get into Elaine’s,” she replied, at which point Kaplan jumped in to say: “Ms. Habba, it hasn’t existed for years, if I’m not mistaken. … That may be on account of its being closed.”
Kaplan is asserting more control over the proceedings in this trial than was seen in recent months in a nearby state courthouse, where trial judge Arthur Engoron was more permissive toward Trump and his defense team in a civil case involving allegations of business fraud.
In Engoron’s court, multiple lawyers for Trump raised objections simultaneously — something generally unheard of in federal court, which tends to be more staid and subdued.
Kaplan immediately shut down similar efforts last week.
“Let’s just get this clear for both sides right now,” he said Wednesday. “The first lawyer who says anything when a witness is on the stand says everything there is to be said for that side. This is not a tag-team lawyering.”
In addition to her legal role, Habba serves as a publicist for Trump. She is also a regular on the social scene at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home and private club, and joined Trump’s entourage at a UFC event in Las Vegas in December.
At the Carroll trial, Habba has repeatedly incurred the wrath of Kaplan for, among other things, not knowing or quickly forgetting how to question a witness or refer to exhibits.
She complained to the judge about this treatment, and about the limitations imposed on her questioning of Carroll, to no avail.
When the judge halted her questions about tweets, Habba bristled and said, “I can’t ask about them? With all due respect …” The judge quickly cut her off.
“All due respect,” the judge replied, “means that when I issue a ruling, you say next question.”"
2082,YW4V7IXS4K_EWO3L301NAQCCXN,Opinion Why the Supreme Court ought to punt on Trump’s eligibility,Jason Willick,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/21/supreme-court-trump-insurrection-case/,"Donald Trump’s Iowa caucuses romp raises the stakes in Trump v. Anderson, the Supreme Court’s review of a Colorado ruling disqualifying him from the state’s ballot. Soon after the justices hear the case next month, Trump could be the presumptive GOP nominee. The meaning of the 14th Amendment’s disqualification-for-insurrection clause will cease being an academic hypothetical and start being a question of whether states can, in effect, block an unfolding presidential nomination process.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court briefs have poured in. Most retread familiar legal ground, but an amicus brief filed Thursday by election law scholars Edward B. Foley and Richard L. Hasen, along with election lawyer Benjamin L. Ginsberg, makes a distinctive appeal: Whatever you do, the trio urges the justices, don’t punt on the question of Trump’s eligibility. Either rule that he is qualified for the presidency or rule that he is disqualified from it, full stop — don’t reverse the Colorado decision on “procedural or jurisdictional grounds.”
Otherwise, if Trump wins the election in November, Democrats in Congress could try to block the certification of his electoral votes next January, as some Republicans did for President Biden’s in 2021. That would risk “catastrophic political instability,” the brief plausibly warns. But it overestimates the Supreme Court’s ability to head off such instability. And it understates the risk from more judicial entanglement in the election than necessary. Deciding that insurrection is a question for Congress might actually be the most statesmanlike solution available to the justices.
Some background: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies certain officeholders who “engaged in insurrection” from holding certain offices in the future. Colorado says this applies to Trump because of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. The Foley brief urges the Supreme Court to pronounce whether Colorado is right or wrong on the merits. But there’s a separate, procedural question: Is the disqualification provision enforceable without further guidance from Congress? The 14th Amendment says Congress can enforce it “by appropriate legislation.” Congress has passed legislation disqualifying people criminally convicted of insurrection, but Trump hasn’t been charged with that crime.
The justices could thus order Trump restored to Colorado’s ballot because no congressionally authorized procedure was followed to disqualify him. A ruling along those lines would be agnostic on whether Jan. 6 was an insurrection. But it would stop state-level disqualifications of Trump and allow the 2024 election process to go ahead undisturbed.
It’s true that this wouldn’t end the matter if Trump wins in November. But Democrats in Congress could object to certifying a Trump victory no matter what the Supreme Court says. Let’s say the justices rule this spring in a 6-3 partisan split that Trump did not engage in insurrection in 2021. Would that change the minds of congressional Democrats, all of whom voted to impeach and convict Trump for insurrection in 2021?
Unlikely. Today, 81 percent of Democrats believe that Trump is disqualified from office, according to one poll. Some Democratic representatives would surely press that case after the election, and they could plausibly claim that congressional interpretation of the 14th Amendment supersedes the Supreme Court’s.
In any case, such turbulence in Congress, while distracting, would most likely resolve itself. It’s unlikely that Democrats would have enough votes to block Trump’s certification and create genuine ambiguity about “who is entitled to act as President and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces starting at noon on January 20,” as the Foley brief puts it. Congress can throw out electoral votes, the brief notes, only “if a procedurally proper objection is sustained by both the House and the Senate.” If Republicans control even one house of Congress, Democratic objections to Trump’s election would be guaranteed to fail.
The chance that Trump will win the presidency while Democrats win a majority in both houses is small. Republican Senate candidates tend to run ahead of Trump in swing states, and the last time voters elected a president of one party and a Senate and House controlled by the opposing party was in the election of Bill Clinton in 1996.
Even if Democrats did somehow sweep Congress despite a Trump victory in the electoral college, their margin would be narrow, and it’s unlikely that all Democrats in Congress would sanction reversing the voters’ presidential decision. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), for example, disagreed with the Maine secretary of state’s recent decision to remove Trump from the ballot. In other words, it might be rocky, but congressional procedures are probably adequate to handle the 2025 presidential transition without a direct Supreme Court pronouncement on Trump’s culpability, or lack of culpability, for insurrection.
And such a pronouncement would come at a high cost to the court. If the justices cleared Trump of insurrection, they would be essentially second-guessing Congress’s impeachment of the former president, who would use the opinion as an election-season talking point. The Supreme Court is already under liberal assault; a decision seen as vindicating Trump would turbocharge the attacks and increase the risk of a constitutional crisis under a Democratic president down the line. If the justices affirmed the Colorado decision, they would devastate the court’s standing within the GOP, which would see its voters stripped of the right to vote for their favored candidate in an unprecedented way.
The country is at a point where states are disqualifying a major-party candidate under the Constitution’s insurrection clause. That itself shows that instability is a real risk. But there is no procedural end run around this problem, which is fundamentally one of polarization and a loss of political legitimacy. The best course for the Supreme Court in those circumstances is probably to protect its own institutional interests and hope that the elected branches can heal themselves."
2088,0982V8V25F_ESO9UXIE27LCVVE,Opinion: Our possibly short national nightmare,"Opinion by Richard Galant, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 11:19 PM·14 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-possibly-short-national-nightmare-141909751.html,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
On August 9, 1974, the only unelected vice president in American history took the presidential oath of office at a White House ceremony. It was the day after President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.
“My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Gerald Ford said.
“Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.” In words that sound almost foreign to our ears in the 21st century, Ford added, “As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.”
Last week the true-crime docuseries that shot to the top of the list of Netflix shows in the US was “American Nightmare.” But it wasn’t that kind of nightmare, or Gerald Ford’s one, that presidential candidate Nikki Haley invoked Monday after her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
“Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,” the former UN ambassador said. She was referring to polls showing that the majority of Americans don’t want a rematch between President Joe Biden and the president he defeated in 2020, Donald Trump.
When the results of the New Hampshire primary are reported Tuesday, we’ll have a better sense of whether anyone can stand in the way of that dreaded rematch. If not, it won’t be as protracted a “national nightmare” as the two-year-long Watergate scandal that put Gerald Ford in the Oval Office. This year’s election is on November 5 — and the inauguration is only one year away. Though, depending on your point of view, the real nightmare could begin after the swearing-in.
Haley is walking a tightrope, trying to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status among Republicans without alienating his MAGA base. “There’s an outside chance she can pull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump’s perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “But there’s another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control… If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP’s second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.”
Haley has been wary of directly going after the former president’s many vulnerabilities, while obliquely arguing that the nation can’t risk having a president in or nearing his 80s and that “chaos follows” Trump, whether or not it is his fault.
“Her ability to build momentum over the course of the primary showcases her political talent and ability to attract college-educated Republicans tired of having to explain away their support for a president whose hair-trigger social media posts verge into the unhinged,” wrote Patrick T. Brown.
Daniel McCarthy isn’t buying into the idea that Haley has momentum: “Former President Donald Trump’s easy win in Iowa on Monday confirms that there really is no race for the Republican nomination this year. With a deep freeze discouraging turnout, the caucuses provided a hard test of voter enthusiasm. Trump’s rivals failed it.”
“A measure of the former president’s insurmountable strength within the party is that he not only beat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, he also overcame all of the institutional powers backing them — some of the most formidable interests in the GOP.”
On the Democratic side, Biden isn’t even on the ballot Tuesday and isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire, due to a dispute between state and national party officials over the primary’s timing.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a low-profile 54-year-old legislator from Minnesota, is running in New Hampshire, SE Cupp noted, and is polling more strongly there than around the nation. It’s a longshot, Cupp noted, but “if Biden’s poll numbers keep going in the wrong direction, if voters feel taken for granted or even overlooked by Democrats, if a symbolic win in New Hampshire gives voters a reason to look more closely at Dean Phillips, well he might give Biden a run for his money.”
Karen Finney is the great-great-great-great niece of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and great-great-great granddaughter of a freed slave from Virginia.
“Walking through the door of my grandmother’s home in North Carolina,” Finney wrote, “it was impossible to miss a portrait of Lee proudly displayed on the wall. At mealtimes, during what occasionally felt like indoctrination, she would admiringly describe our famous ancestor, ‘the General,’ as a benevolent slave owner and noble warrior.”
“As she explained it, Lee valiantly fought an unjust ‘War of Northern Aggression’ in defense of ‘states’ rights,’ often referred to as ‘The Lost Cause.’ The South had been defeated, my grandmother insisted, only because the Northern army had more resources and slavery really wasn’t so bad.”
In Finney’s view, the Lost Cause is the backdrop for Trump’s suggestion that the Civil War could have been “negotiated,” the rewriting of history in school curriculums under Florida Gov. DeSantis’ administration and Haley’s struggle over the question of whether America is, or ever was, a racist country.
“Beyond absurdly omitting slavery as the root cause of the War, she made matters worse while trying to clean up her comments during a recent CNN Town Hall, saying she just assumed that slavery was a ‘given’ since all children learn about it in school in the South.”

Trump’s remark that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of Americans evokes the words of Adolf Hitler in “Mein Kampf,” author Paul Moses pointed out. But he added that the concept goes further back — to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century.
In 1914, the year Edward Alsworth Ross became president of the American Sociological Association, he published a book warning that immigrants, Moses wrote, “would act on Americans’ standards for cleanliness, morality and education ‘like a slow poison.’ A nation that relies on immigration to maintain its population ‘deserves the extinction that surely awaits it,’ he wrote…The prejudice beneath Ross’ opinions was obvious, but his ideas were mainstream and respectable — he was considered a progressive reformer…”
“But Ross came to regret the implications of his ideas about supposedly superior and inferior races, writing shortly after World War II that ‘we never imagined the theory being made a hinge for German aggression to turn on.’ That’s what the phony claims of eugenics led to — Hitler’s ‘Final Solution,’ which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. It’s certainly worth having vigorous debates about immigration laws, but those who’ve been indifferent to or even supportive of Trump’s increasingly clear turn toward racist, eugenic ideas should confront what they’ve enabled.”
Republicans describe the immigration surge at the US southern border as an “invasion” that presents a national security threat. Yet, John Avlon wrote, Trump and some members of the House GOP, want to tank an emerging compromise in the Senate that would couple border security measures with aid to Ukraine.
“Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more threats from his far-right flank, who have been signaling that they will balk at any border security bill until a Republican is president.
“Right-wing resistance is entirely consistent with a Trump-ified GOP that is more willing to demagogue an issue than actually deal with it.”

Alice Driver: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s heartless war against migrants
Trump sat in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday while E. Jean Carroll testified in support of her defamation case against the former president. Last May, she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation when a jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her. Now Carroll is seeking at least $10 million in additional damages for Trump’s 2019 comments about her allegation.
As Danielle Campoamor wrote, “Carroll found herself facing down not only a man found liable for assaulting her, but also a former president and current presidential frontrunner — an unprecedented example of the power dynamics survivors face. While a victim of sexual assault receives death threats, her assailant receives endorsements and secures the Iowa caucus.”
“During Carroll’s testimony, Trump repeatedly shook his head, according to CNN reporters inside the courtroom, and could be heard ‘loudly saying things’ such as ‘it’s false,’ ‘she’s gotten her memory back,’ and, according to Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley, that the lawsuit is ‘a witch hunt’ and a ‘con job.’”
When the judge threatened to oust Trump from the courtroom, the former president said, “I would love it.”
The chaotic court proceeding is just one example of why the Supreme Court should clear the way for allowing television cameras at Trump’s forthcoming election subversion trial, argued Robert C. Gottlieb. “Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue to impugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display during Wednesday’s court proceedings will undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.”
“The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.”
The narrative of fast-worsening inequality over the past half century has been challenged in a new study by economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They used data to show that, compared to the 1960s, the pre-tax income of the top 1% has increased only by 2.6% and after accounting for taxes, the share of income going to the super-rich “hasn’t budged at all,” wrote Jordan McGillis. The study disputes a 2018 finding by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman that the top 1% has seen its share of national pre-tax income go from 12% to 20% since the 1980s.
McGillis says there’s something else going on that tends to exacerbate inequality. Among rich Americans, marriage rates remain high, but they’ve plummeted for less affluent people, creating more single-person households with lower levels of income. “This cleavage makes possible what the Brookings Institution’s Melissa Kearney describes as “two-parent privilege,” an emerging phenomenon through which well-off couples transmit educational and economic advantages to their children. Viewed from this angle, it should not surprise us that many Americans think the rich are galloping ever further ahead.”
Elise Gould and Josh Bivens have a different take. Using Social Security Administration data, they found that the “share of earnings for the bottom 90% fell 9.7 percentage points between 1979 and 2022, while the share of earnings for the top 5% grew 8.8 percentage points. The very top — the top 0.1% of wage earners — nearly tripled its share of total earnings from 1.6% in 1979 to 4.6% in 2022… All of this straightforward data on earnings clearly shows a huge rise in inequality of pay in the US economy.”
The US and the UK struck back at the Houthis, the Yemeni insurgent group that is targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but the lingering question was about how effective such a series of strikes can be. “We think of war as a last resort,” Elisabeth Kendall, head of Cambridge University’s Girton College told Peter Bergen. The Houthis “think of it as a way of life.”
“The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets,” Kendall said.
CNN Opinion senior editor Sheena McKenzie interviewed Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital, and asked him about the future for Palestinian children amid the war in Gaza.
“There is no future for them,” he said. “How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?”
“The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.” (Hear more from Sheena McKenzie on the Tug of War podcast.)
There is a lot of talk but very little real debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict on US college campuses, wrote Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University.
“Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who ‘Stand with Israel’ and those seeking ‘Justice for Palestine.’… Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.”
“The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.”
“It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority.”

When Holly Thomas was 12, she “received a large — unsolicited — Estee Lauder makeup sampler for Christmas. The box felt like a totem of my impending maturity, recognition that I would soon be allowed access to an as-yet out-of-reach club. I gave it pride of place on my bedroom table (swiftly rebranded as a “dresser” with the help of a soon-to-be filthy sarong), and before too long I was regularly being sent out of class, cheeks burning, to wash my contraband mascara off.”
“It wasn’t a particularly edifying phase, but neither was it very consequential. Today however, skin care is a far more serious business. Gone are the days of teens aimlessly browsing random drugstores by day and smudging their pillows with iridescent bronzer by night. Now, kids don’t just know how to cleanse properly, they’ve taken to beauty products with unprecedented zeal. Absurd though it sounds, that fervor is acutely ominous,” Thomas wrote.
“Dermatologists report children as young as nine, many of whom already maintain elaborate at-home skin care regimes coming to their offices for cosmetic consultations. Teens who’ve barely exited puberty are obsessing over the alleged ‘preventative’ anti-aging properties of Botox, and the internet is teeming with youngsters pleading for solutions to their ‘wrinkles.’ The fretting and groupthink involved bear all the hallmarks of a classic youthful infatuation. But this one comes with sinister undercurrents less familiar to the adults who went before them.”
“The most worrying thing about today’s skin care craze isn’t just that the financial and emotional buy-in are completely out of proportion to the “need” being addressed. They may set kids up for lasting damage. And thanks to the misinformation soup of social media, the gnarly, anxiety-provoking call is coming from inside the house.”

JD Vance argued 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley would likely be unable to survive Democratic attacks if elected the party's nominee, saying she's ""the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on.""
""Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn't faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced. And frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience,"" Vance told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday.""
Bream aired a clip of her asking New Hampshire voters who they supported ahead of the Granite State's primary on Tuesday, with one woman explaining she's voting for Haley because she has ""no baggage."" Vance, who is serving as a surrogate for the Trump campaign, pushed back that Haley does have ""baggage,"" but Democrats have not attacked her, as they have Trump, in recent years.

""I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she's the low baggage candidate. In reality, she's the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she's the nominee,"" Vance said, adding that Haley ""won't be"" the nominee.

""But if she is [the nominee], she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years, and I don't think she'll survive, and I certainly don't think she'll win the presidency through it. That's why we need to elect the guy who's shown some resilience. That's why we need to nominate Donald Trump,"" he said.
Trump solidified himself as the Republican frontrunner for 2024 last week, when he handily won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. He is now focusing on the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
While some polls, such as one published by American Research Group Inc., showed Haley and Trump tied for support, others have shown Trump with a stronger advantage over the former South Carolina governor.
HALEY TURNS UP THE HEAT ON TRUMP AS SHE TRIES TO CLOSE THE GAP IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
Trump has 55% support among those likely to vote in the primary, compared to Haley's 36% support and DeSantis' 6% support, a Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 poll found.
Bream cited the Suffolk poll, as well as a CNN poll that found Trump has 50% support to Haley's 39%, and noted to Vance that many voters in New Hampshire are undeclared, but vote in the GOP primary.
TRUMP SAYS NIKKI HALEY 'HAS NO CHANCE' AHEAD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY: 'MAGA IS NOT GOING TO BE WITH HER'
""There are a couple of newspaper editorials today endorsing Nikki Haley, telling people if you're independent get out, ‘save the country and vote in that GOP primary.’ I mean, that's a substantial group of people here. How concerned are you about them showing up and not choosing President Trump on Tuesday?"" Bream asked.
Vance responded that liberals who recently moved out of Massachusetts to New Hampshire would ""never"" vote for a Republican nominee – whether they be Trump or Haley - and are instead ""trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump"" and his primary race.
""I think a lot of them are going to vote for Donald Trump and also liberal… many of them from Massachusetts who are moving to New Hampshire, they're never going to vote for a Republican nominee, even if it's Nikki Haley,"" Vance said.
""They're just trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump. But I think Republicans really have to ask ourselves, do we want liberal suburbanites from Massachusetts to choose our nominee? Or do we want to choose our nominee as Republicans and independent-minded conservatives? I think if we choose our nominee, Donald Trump is going to win, and he's going to win handily,"" Vance added.

Ralph Norman, R-S.C., touted GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s ""youth,"" on Sunday and went after former President Trump’s age ahead of this week’s New Hampshire primaries, highlighting moments when Trump named Haley instead of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., while speaking about Jan. 6 during a rally over the weekend.
Norman, one of the few elected officials from South Carolina backing former South Carolina Gov. Haley, appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" stressing how Haley, at age 52, is 25 years younger than the 77-year-old Trump. ""His policies were great. What he did was great for the country, particularly with what Biden is doing now,"" Norman said of Trump, explaining why he's now supporting Haley instead. ""But it's time for a change – I think the youth – Nikki just turned 52. She's 25 years younger than Donald Trump.""
""I'm sorry,"" he continued. ""When you have a president, like, the pressures they're going to be facing, when you see what they're going to have to do to attract new talent into the Congress, in the Senate, you've got to go to work doing that. Nikki will do that. And, to the other big thing that people need to know, Donald Trump can only give you four years. It's like a football team can only play half of the game. It's going to take eight years to get this country straight. But Nikki's youth and the fact is, she can give eight years. And I would also make the argument is really three years, because the last year of a term is political, like you're seeing now. And President Trump is going to be tied up in, you know, legal fights.""
Norman argued that the only reason Trump is criticizing Haley now is ""because she's gaining in the polls and she, he knows, she is a serious threat. And it's a two-person race now.""
Trump has argued that with Haley as president, the country would see eight years of war and has called her a globalist.
TRUMP MIXES UP NIKKI HALEY WITH NANCY PELOSI AT NEW HAMPSHIRE RALLY

""That's just political talk,"" Norman said, noting how Trump chose Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""Donald Trump knows that. The same thing, you know, he got her confused yesterday with Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 6 with the National Guard. And I would say 25 years ago, he wouldn't have made that mistake, but he kept saying, Nikki Haley did this, you know, with the National Guard. He was talking about Nancy Pelosi. And that's another example of, you know, he wouldn't have made that mistake if he was younger.""
Trump, while referring to the crowds at a rally in Concord, New Hampshire, Friday, brought up Haley when mentioning the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.
""By the way, they never report the crowd on Jan. 6, you know, Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they did, you know, they destroyed all of the information and all of the evidence. Everything deleted it. Destroyed all of it. All of it because lots of things – like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard. So whatever they want, they turned it down. They don't want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people. But when I look over here, I am so honored. They said this is a quaint area, area of the state, but it's quaint. We got a lot of people in this room, this an all time record,"" Trump said, prompting applause.
Trump has long accused Pelosi of refusing National Guard support at the Capitol a day before the riot.
TRUMP: ALMOST EVERYBODY IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAS ENDORSED ME
Yet after the apparent mix-up, conservative voices on X championed the move.
""Trump just got the entire media to finally admit Nancy Pelosi was in charge of security on Jan 6,"" Jack Posobiec, senior editor of Human Events, wrote to his 2.4 million followers.
At another rally Saturday in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump stressed how, ""almost every politician from South Carolina is endorsing me,"" while surrounded by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and other senior statewide officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker, as well as U.S. Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry on stage.
Campaigning elsewhere in the Granite State on Saturday, Haley had gone after Trump's mental fitness, pointing to remarks he made on Friday.
""They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi,"" Haley said Saturday, as she campaigned in Keene, New Hampshire. ""He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario. The concern I have is – I’m not saying anything derogatory – but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this… We can’t.""
Speaking at a Bloomberg News forum on Saturday in Manchester, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney referenced Haley's remarks and said Trump ""made a pretty apparent gaffe last night."" ""It’s a distinction without a difference. It’s Nikki and Nancy,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said to reporters Saturday night. ""What’s the difference?""
At his rally Saturday night in Manchester, Trump said he took a cognitive test and ""aced it.""
A day earlier, Sen. Tim Scott, who ended his own 2024 bid in November and was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012, endorsed Trump over Haley in a rousing call-and-response speech of his own in New Hampshire. Since entering the race nearly a year ago, Haley has advocated for ""mental competency tests"" for older politicians, a swipe at both Trump and President Biden. At age 81, Biden has drawn increasing concern over his mental and physical fitness, even from members of his own party raising eyebrows about his public appearances.

2115,1CGWHCSK18_E1YDJF8ODL36CV7,Did Biden blunder with New Hampshire primary snub?,Frankie TAGGART,"January 22, 2024 at 12:58 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/did-biden-blunder-hampshire-primary-155808305.html,"With all eyes on Donald Trump's bid to lead Republicans back into the White House, Joe Biden's reelection push has slipped under the radar in an unusual start to his campaign.
After a dispute with officials in New Hampshire over scheduling, he will not be on the ballot when the state's primary kicks off the party's nomination process on Tuesday.
The quarrel threatens to leave the president in a theoretical third place among Democrat candidates, behind little-known gelato magnate Dean Phillips and low-polling self-help author Marianne Williamson.
""He is taking the Granite State for granted... He should be campaigning in New Hampshire, he should be showing up in front of voters,"" Phillips said at a debate with Williamson that Biden skipped.
""He should be on the ballot in New Hampshire, for goodness' sake. He's the president.""
Biden lost badly in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire in his bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 and was only rescued by strong support from African Americans in the South Carolina primary.
Once he was elected he effectively dethroned New Hampshire, along with fellow early nominating state Iowa, instructing the party leadership to place South Carolina ahead of both.
- Write his name in -
Iowa caved quietly but the move angered Democrats in New Hampshire, where first-in-the-nation status is a sacred cow, and the Republicans who control the state government in Concord ignored the directive in any case.
The Democratic National Committee responded by refusing to seat the state's delegates at the summer nominating convention in Chicago -- essentially denying New Hampshire its say.
Many grassroots Democrats worry that even though Biden is not on the ballot, his performance against Phillips and Williamson will be judged as a measure of his popularity.
So, despite their anger over Biden's snub, local activists have determined to ensure his supporters know they can write his name on the ballot.
Beneath a wintry Manchester sky, 20 or so hardy Biden supporters swaddled like Arctic explorers braved the biting cold Saturday to chant and wave banners that read: ""Ask me about writing in Joe Biden.""
They were even rewarded by a magnanimous cameo from Phillips, as the entrepreneur and US congressman came out of his nearby campaign headquarters to hand out coffee to his shivering opponents.
""We're all frustrated that (Biden's) not on the ballot,"" said Kathy Sullivan, 69, a retired lawyer from Manchester.
""But we put that aside because it's really important that Joe Biden beats Donald Trump in November.""
- Local frustration -
Dan Seferian, 62, a retired state government worker who had traveled with wife Colleen from Reading, Massachusetts, hit out at Williamson and Phillips for not getting behind the Biden reelection campaign.
""I think they should stand behind the party and the incumbent president. Phillips, he's is a young man. He could run in 2028. He should have waited his turn,"" he told AFP.
Some Biden aides have reportedly voiced concerns that the write-in effort could fall short, delivering an unnecessary defeat.
Democratic presidents seeking reelection typically garner around 80 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, and party strategists believe Biden needs to win somewhere around 60 percent to avoid humiliation.
""A win is a win, and I think we can deliver that,"" said New Hampshire state senator Donna Soucy, co-chair of the campaign.
""We've been working really hard on this write-in effort across the state, and I think voters today -- those of us that are out here bearing the cold -- are evidence of the enthusiasm for President Joe Biden.""
Soucy acknowledged the frustration with Biden but blamed party officials in Washington rather than the president himself.
""It's a little more complicated to express our support in this election but we're still going to do it because we're devoted to our president,"" she said.

2121,1J9AN3ZST5_IDC3AVQD0BDWMO3,Group Linked to Sam Altman Launches AI to Defeat Joe Biden,Sharon Adarlo,"January 21, 2024 at 8:30 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/group-linked-sam-altman-launches-113005955.html,"A super PAC with deep ties to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman launched an AI chatbot this week in a bid to deny President Joe Biden from winning a second term in office, The Washington Post reports.
The group, We Deserve Better, launched the Dean.Bot as an AI stand-in for Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who's running a quixotic campaign to challenge Biden in the Democratic primary.
Phillips has attracted the attention of Altman and other Silicon Valley elites, who say they're concerned about Biden's recent low poll numbers and his chances against former President Donald Trump, the likely winner of the Republican primary.
But tellingly, the formation of the super PAC to support Phillips occurred in early December, soon after Biden signed a sweeping executive order that seeks to regulate AI tech.
Altman and other AI proponents have said in the past that they want regulation and safeguards on AI, but that stance often changes when proposals become reality. For example, Altman earlier threatened that OpenAI would quit operating in Europe if certain AI regulations came to pass, and has also lobbied hard to water down those same regulations.
So it's interesting that a group with deep ties to Altman would launch an AI-powered chatbot to try to unseat Biden, who wants to curb AI technology. One of the founders of the super PAC, Matt Krisiloff, used to be an employee of OpenAI and apparently dated Altman.
Strikingly, OpenAI's ChatGPT once powered the chatbot, but now it relies on open source models, according to WaPo.
The Dean.Bot is clearly labeled as an AI chatbot and has disclaimers such as: ""Feel free to ask it anything, but please take answers with a grain of salt!""
If you ask him about any recent campaign controversy, the Dean.Bot, like any seasoned politician, passes the buck.
For example, the Phillips campaign quietly changed a header on its website that once read ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,"" The New York Times reports. It now reads instead ""Equity and Restorative Justice.""
This change comes after the Phillips campaign received an infusion of $1 million from Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager who's mounted a recent assault on DEI initiatives.
When you ask the Dean.Bot about the recent removal of DEI from the Phillips campaign website, the chatbot says that ""I must clarify that as a digital clone, I don't control the content of websites or make decisions about what is posted or removed.""
""However, I can tell you that my commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is unwavering,"" the chatbot continues. ""My actions and policies consistently reflect the importance of these principles in creating a fair and just society for all. If there have been changes to my website, they would be made with the intent to best represent my current focus and priorities in serving the people.""
As it stands, the Biden campaign probably shouldn't worry too much about the chatbot, because it's still pretty clunky when compared to dealing with a real flesh and blood human being, more an election year curiosity than anything else.
Beyond the chatbot being an avatar for a monied class who want to influence elections, though, it does feel like a prototype of how AI and tech may change politics going into the future.
Late last year, the campaign of Pennsylvania Democrat politician Shamaine Daniels ran a chatbot called Ashley to help in her phone banking efforts.
Both Dean.Bot and Ashley have been clearly labeled as AI chatbots, but they could be laying the groundwork for a reality in which bad actors can release chatbots that can lie or obfuscate rival politicians' policy platforms.
""I see this as a Pandora’s box problem,"" New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights' deputy director Paul Barrett told WaPo. ""Once we have AI versions of candidates chatting up voters, it’s a short step to bots used by political opponents to fool voters into thinking that politicians are saying things they never said. And soon, everyone gets so cynical about all of this fake communication that no one believes anything anyone is saying.""

2132,26DA2EBCZY_B3SL5SUHV8H17H4,5 reasons DeSantis’ presidential campaign collapsed before the GOP’s first primary,Max Greenwood,"January 22, 2024 at 6:55 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/5-reasons-desantis-presidential-campaign-215537175.html,"Once viewed as the strongest contender to former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis aborted his stumbling presidential campaign on Sunday, acknowledging that he had no path to the Republican nomination.
His announcement, by video, ended a campaign that was marred from the jump, beginning with a glitch-plagued announcement on the platform formerly known as Twitter and lasting another eight months, despite in-fighting and missteps.
Here are five of the biggest reasons his campaign collapsed:
DeSantis’ campaign and an allied super PAC, Never Back Down, went all-in on Iowa, betting that a strong showing in the first nominating contest would undercut Trump and project him forward. They assembed a massive door-knocking and voter outreach operation that was unrivaled in modern politics.
DeSantis himself campaigned in each of the state’s 99 counties — and went on to lose every one of them.
READ MORE: Republicans see narrow path for DeSantis through early primary states: ‘Iowa is crucial’
He tailored his message to the political appetites of an Iowa electorate, deploying anti-abortion rights rhetoric and a populist tone that cast him as a political outsider who could use the force of government to accomplish conservative policy priorities. His focus appeared to hobble his campaign in other important early-voting states, like libertarian-leaning New Hampshire.
Polling in the Granite State showed DeSantis performing notably worse than in Iowa prior to ending his campaign on Sunday.
From the outset, DeSantis’ campaign showed signs of internal struggles. Many of his top staffers had never worked on a presidential operation before, including his first campaign manager Genera Peck, who was removed from the post after less than two months on the job.
RELATED: Don’t know DeSantis’ campaign manager? Generra Peck would like to keep it that way
But instead of replacing her with an experienced campaign veteran, he instead elevated his chief of staff from the Florida governor’s office, James Uthmeier, who also lacked presidential campaign experience.
To fill gaps in his formal campaign operation, DeSantis leaned heavily on Never Back Down to handle key functions typically reserved for a candidate’s campaign. The super PAC was staffed by longtime political operatives like Republican strategists Jeff Roe and David Polyansky, a veteran of Iowa campaigns. Polyansky was eventually brought onto DeSantis’ team as deputy campaign manager.
The reliance on Never Back Down led to its own set of problems. Many of the group’s experienced operatives found themselves at loggerheads with members of DeSantis’ inner circle — and sometimes even the governor himself — over messaging strategies. Late last year, a group of DeSantis loyalists formed a new super PAC called Fight Right to handle TV ad spending.
Never Back Down also struggled with internal strife. Several of the group’s leaders and high-profile staffers either resigned or were fired in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, including CEO Chris Jankowski and Roe.
DeSantis put his governing record in Florida front and center on the campaign trail, preaching what he called the “Florida blueprint” to voters nationwide.
He boasted about his decision to reopen Florida’s economy early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, bragged about reducing the state debt and rallied supporters over his ongoing fight with Walt Disney World over the company’s special tax district in Central Florida.
Voters shrugged.
Steve Long, 60, of Ogden, Iowa said that he liked what he had heard about DeSantis’ record on education in Florida, but raised an issue that has been a persistent political headache in the Sunshine State.
“I heard that insurance is getting pretty expensive down there,” said Long, who was supporting entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy’s presidential campaign.
Jackie Sapp, 68, a retired school teacher from Kelly, Iowa said that she had considered supporting DeSantis, but ultimately decided to back former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. Sapp said that DeSantis wasn’t “real concrete on his main policies.”
“It seems like he attacks. But what are your ideas? How are you going to approach it? It’s always about ‘me, me, me.’ And I don’t want someone who’s ‘me, me, me.’ ”
From the outset, the biggest challenge facing DeSantis’ campaign — and those of virtually every 2024 Republican candidate — was how to loosen Trump’s vise-like grip over the GOP voter base.
Despite losing reelection in 2020 and facing numerous legal problems, Trump has consistently polled double-digits ahead of his nearest Republican rivals, prompting him to treat the primary, in some ways, as more of a coronation than a contest. Ultimately, convincing Republicans that it was time to move on from Trump proved too tall an order for DeSantis.
Throughout much of his campaign, he treaded lightly when it came to contrasting himself with the former president, who was once a key political ally of the governor. DeSantis’ argument hinged on the notion that he could accomplish the promises that went unfulfilled during Trump’s tenure in the White House.
In the final weeks of his campaign, DeSantis began to sharpen his criticism of Trump. He notably insisted that the former president is not “pro-life” during a nationally televised CNN town hall. On the trail, he repeatedly deployed the line that Trump was campaigning for president on “his issues,” while DeSantis was focused on voters’ issues.
David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist in Iowa, said that part of the challenge for DeSantis and the other candidates was that Trump’s supporters have stood firm with the former president and aren’t likely to abandon him. That means that the GOP nominating contest has simply been a race to determine who will run one-on-one against Trump, he said.
“The Trump vote is already there,” Kochel said. “The job of Iowa and New Hampshire is to answer the question of which candidate earns the right to take on Trump. And if that doesn’t get resolved, then Trump runs away as the nominee.”
DeSantis and his campaign bet that he could ascend nationally the same way he did in the state: by attacking reporters and stiff-arming most of the press, preferring interviews with friendly, conservative outlets. Last week, he admitted that he should have done more “corporate shows.”"

He also said earlier last year that Trump should drop out of the race after he was first indicted on criminal charges, saying that it would be a ""sideshow and distraction"" during the election.
Haley placed a narrow third in Iowa to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis but is polling second in New Hampshire to Trump who also won Iowa. Trump, however, won Iowa by 30 points and has a double-digital lead in New Hampshire.

Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign Sunday on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, ending a White House bid that failed to meet expectations that he would emerge as a serious challenger to former President Donald Trump.
DeSantis announced his decision in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The ambitious big-state governor entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $100 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses — which he had vowed to win — by 30 percentage points to Trump.
And now, DeSantis’ political future is in question after suspending his presidential bid after just one voting contest. The 45-year-old is term limited as Florida governor."

Ron DeSantis (R) dropped out of the Republican presidential primary Sunday, marking the end of a stunning rise and fall for a candidate once seen as the most formidable rival to former President Trump.
“Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on our way forward,” DeSantis said in a video message posted on X, a few hours ahead of an event he had scheduled in New Hampshire. “If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” the governor continued. “While I have had disagreements with Donald Trump such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.”
DeSantis went on to signal his support for Trump while hitting former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear. A repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
DeSantis had been seen as the most viable Trump alternative after sweeping to reelection as Florida governor during last year’s midterm elections. His victory was in sharp contrast to how other Republicans performed around the country, including many who had been endorsed by Trump.
The Florida governor launched his official bid in May with the support of a number of GOP campaign veterans in his campaign apparatus and super PAC.
But DeSantis was not able to gain traction against Trump, his one-time political ally. DeSantis’s campaign got off to a rocky start when its Twitter Spaces launch was plagued with technical glitches. And the governor faced criticism over his personality on the campaign trail, with critics labeling him as awkward.
Though he placed second in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, he still fell well short of Trump, winning just 21 percent to Trump’s 51 percent. He was widely expected to fare poorly in New Hampshire, where former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley (R) is seen as the most competitive rival to the former president.
Ahead of his exit from the GOP primary on Sunday, The Hill’s Decision Desk HQ average showed DeSantis coming in third place in New Hampshire with 7.2 percent and in South Carolina with 8.3 percent.
DeSantis’s exit from the race is likely to benefit Trump, who shares a base with the Florida governor. At a campaign event at Trump campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H. on Sunday prior to DeSantis dropping out, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said he would welcome DeSantis back into the Trump orbit.
“I remember the good old days when I was Ron DeSantis’s transition chairman and he and President Trump worked so well together,” Gatez, a top surrogate to Trump, told supporters.
“I hate when mom and dad fight,” he continued, receiving laughs from the crowd. “It turns out we might get Ron DeSantis back on side pretty soon and I would welcome that,” he said to applause.

Both candidates have seen an increase in support since the previous survey earlier this month, when Trump had the backing of 39% of voters and Haley registered at 32%, CNN reported. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stood at just 6% in the latest poll, below the 10% level of support that would be needed to win delegates in line with GOP rules.
Among voters who say they haven’t yet locked in a choice ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, 51% broadly support Haley, while 28% are behind Trump and 14% favor DeSantis. In Democratic polling, about two-thirds of likely voters plan to support Biden, according to the survey.
CNN said the poll was conducted from Jan. 16-19 from a sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

2155,33HHZJY1FK_O0F95Y79NTUKMDI,"By walking away from whistleblowers' suit, Ken Paxton keeps avoiding answering questions","John C. Moritz, Austin American-Statesman","January 21, 2024 at 9:04 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/walking-away-whistleblowers-suit-ken-120440843.html,"By saying he'll quit contesting allegations of corruption leveled against him by whistleblowers in a lawsuit, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sought to accomplish two things:
First, and perhaps most importantly, avoid — at least for now — having to publicly answer questions about the myriad accusations against him, which led to the Texas House impeaching him and ultimately the Texas Senate clearing him. And second, go back to calling his once-trusted top aides ""rogue employees,"" political pawns and whatever else he wants.
Paxton filed a motion Thursday saying he no longer wants to continue his court fight. He didn't admit wrongdoing; he just said he wasn't going to argue the point. But the next day, Travis County state District Judge Jan Soifer set a Feb. 1 date for the attorney general to sit for a deposition in the case.
If Paxton is allowed to walk away from the case with no further legal proceedings, he could deny his political adversaries the potential opportunity to see him admit to wrongdoing or to plead the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. At the same time, he's free to go back on the offensive and further cement his standing with the Texas GOP's conservative base.
Paxton's statement and the accompanying filing with the 250th District Court in Austin about him wanting to walk away from the long-running litigation contain no shortage of bombast aimed at the whistleblowers who leveled the accusations of possible criminal misconduct against him, including that Paxton used his office to help a political benefactor, and, in turn, that benefactor helped Paxton's alleged mistress get a job.
Paxton accused the whistleblowers of escalating a ""crusade"" against him and of seeking to ""sabotage"" his leadership as the state's top lawyer. But then, Paxton said in his recent motion that he ""hereby elects not to contest any issue of fact in this case.""
It's fair to ask why the three-term Republican is eager to fire broadsides against his adversaries on paper, but he is avoiding having to sit for questions from their lawyers, as the Texas Supreme Court ruled that Paxton would have to do if the litigation continues.
Paxton's official response, ostensibly, is that his walking away ""precludes further unwarranted expense"" to taxpayers for continued litigation and to have more time to file lawsuits and take other actions against the Democratic Biden administration.
Another plausible explanation is that answering questions under oath is a huge risk for anyone, but especially for a politician. If the whistleblowers' allegations are true, Paxton would have to admit to them in a deposition or perhaps on the witness stand. Or he could invoke the Fifth and stay mum. Neither would be a good look.

Another option would be to follow the playbook of former President Donald Trump, a Paxton ally. In some of the sundry court actions taken against him, Trump admits to nothing and he counterattacks with bombast and gusto. As much as they might hate to admit it, the former president's adversaries understand that it has been a pretty darned effective strategy — at least for him.
Paxton has sought to emulate Trump in the past. Recall that after the Texas House voted to impeach him on charges that mirrored those of the whistleblowers, the attorney general went before reporters and TV cameras to offer a Trumpian defense, calling the Republican House members who brought the charges corrupt and politically motivated.
But once reporters tried to ask him questions, Paxton tucked his chin to his necktie and walked away without saying another word. During the Senate trial, Paxton's lawyers invoked Trump's catchall response to any allegations of wrongdoing made against him: ""Witch hunt.""

Paxton has the right to testify in his own defense, but he has chosen not to. In fact, he scarcely attended his impeachment trial — reportedly opting to get a massage at a high-end Austin spa and resort instead of sitting through the first full day of the hearing. And he left it to his lawyers to take reporters' questions after the Senate acquitted him on all impeachment charges.
If Soifer's Feb. 1 deposition order stands, questions will be asked of Paxton. And he'll be under oath. It's an open question whether he'll be playing offense or defense when, and if, that time comes.

“2024 is going to be a very exciting year. I’m either going to jail, be president, or frankly, The Purge,” Johnson as Trump said, an apparent reference to the movie franchise where all crime is legal for a half-day out of the year.

""Fire Sale On All Ron DeSantis Merch Today!"": Gavin Newsom, Other Politicos And Celebrities Mock Ron DeSantis' Exit After A Faltering Campaign
In reality, Trump is expected to be in the courtroom Monday, the day before the Granite State primary, as he has been attending the second civil trial brought by E. Jean Carroll. A jury last year already found Trump liable of sexual assault of Carroll, and the latest trial is largely to determine damages.
The proceedings are just a prelude to a year in which Trump faces spending much of the presidential campaign in courthouses, with several criminal trials still scheduled even as his attorneys seek to delay them. So far, Trump has capitalized on the lack of camera access to court proceedings by giving lengthy statements to the media just outside the chambers, essentially running a big chunk of his campaign for the nomination in the halls of justice.
“This is the campaign, folks,” Johnson’s Trump said. “This is all there is — me yelling in courthouse lobby, standing behind a barricade like a Guatemalan family at JFK passenger pickup.”
In the skit, Trump also relished his Iowa caucus blowout, ribbing one of his rivals, Ron DeSantis, for his distant second-place showing. “He went to 99 counties but bitch couldn’t win one,” he said, while nicknaming the Florida governor “Ron DeStupid.” In reality, DeSantis canceled some network morning show appearances scheduled for Sunday, raising speculation that he may drop out, but his campaign says it was a scheduling issue before he returns to New Hampshire.
Johnson’s Trump then went to former rival Vivek Ramaswamy (“Dropped out of the race and has agreed to live in my suit pocket”) and current one Nikki Haley (“She thought I was done — but I am back in a big way. I’m back like Mean Girls.”)
The skit did make a bit of a reference to Haley’s line of attack on Trump today — that there are questions of whether he is mentally fit for office. At a rally on Friday evening, Trump mentioned Haley multiple times when he actually was referring to Nancy Pelosi.
“I am doing very well, cognitively doing great with cognitive,” Trump said in the skit. “I think I’m doing great. With cognitive, I’m more cognitive than ever.”
Johnson’s imitation often is spot on, especially when he drifts into Trump’s streams of consciousness and non-sequiturs, particularly those about random young celebrities. (“Mean Girls. Where’s Lacey Chabert? Left out of remake. So sad.”)
Later in the skit, he referred to the taped footage of him dancing with Jeffrey Epstein. “Boy is that some dark energy,” he said.
But then he claimed that he “wouldn’t be surprised if that footage is fake. Of course, it’s very real, but you have to think, in many ways, it could not be.”
“We’ve seen a lot of success saying things that did not happen,” Johnson’s Trump said. “I think we’ll continue to do that. It’s an innovation I am particularly proud of. Seems to be working very well. But I love this country and it’s traditions. That’s why I’m not doing any debates and barely doing elections.”

Ron DeSantis canceled his scheduled Sunday appearances on NBC and CNN.
Hours later, he dropped out of the race and endorsed former President Donald Trump.
The Florida governor had fallen behind both Nikki Haley and Trump.
GOP presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis canceled planned appearances on cable news channels Sunday morning, hours before officially ending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump
The Florida governor was scheduled to appear on both CNN and NBC ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday but canceled both, citing a ""last-minute schedule change,"" according to NBC's Kristen Welker.
""Gov. Ron DeSantis has pulled out of his #MTP appearance tomorrow morning due to what a person familiar says is a last-minute schedule change. Per his campaign, he will now hold an event in New Hampshire tomorrow evening. He is currently campaigning in South Carolina,"" Welker posted on X on Saturday evening.
But later Sunday, DeSantis announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a message to supporters. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
DeSantis also used a fake Churchhill quote in his speech.
CNN reports that Trump's campaign has been prepping for the announcement since Saturday.
The New Hampshire primaries will take place on Tuesday. The Republican primary in South Carolina will occur in late February. CNN previously reported the latter would likely be the ""last stand"" for the DeSantis campaign.
""I'm asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,"" DeSantis told voters in a restaurant in Florence, South Carolina on Saturday, according to CNN. ""I'll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida.""
Once considered a leading Republican presidential contender, DeSantis had fallen slightly behind candidate Nikki Haley and well behind the GOP frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, despite his multiple indictments. The Florida governor's performance at the Iowa caucus was disappointing and has fueled speculation that his days on the campaign trail are numbered.
""What we did in Iowa, we did make an impression,"" DeSantis said after the Iowa caucus. ""I had people come up to me saying, 'I love you, man. I'm gonna do Trump this time and do you next time.'""

2186,4GJG78PJUH_VJKLZOU27GBR3OY,"Nikki Haley says Trump tried to ""buddy up with dictators"" while in office",Kaia Hubbard,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 3:25 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-says-trump-tried-162908375.html,"Washington — Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, heading into a major test as she takes on Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primary this week, criticized the former president, in whose Cabinet she served, on Sunday for his relationship with ""dictators that want to kill us.""
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Haley told ""Face the Nation."" ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
The comments came as Haley has attempted to draw a line between her foreign policy chops and the former president's throughout her campaign, in recent days releasing a new advertisement about American college student Otto Warmbier, who was taken hostage by North Korea in 2016 and died soon after his release, that she said shows ""the contrast,"" while pointing to Trump's approach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Haley said Sunday that Trump's engagement with the North Korean leader ""goes back to a pattern,"" referencing Trump's positive statements about Chinese President Xi Jinping and what she called a ""bromance"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""When you've got wars all over the world now and the instability that we have, our goal is to prevent war and we can't do that by trying to buddy up with them,"" she said.
The moves come ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where Haley has staked much of her White House ambitions — hoping to make inroads with independents and moderates, especially after her third-place showing in Iowa. Polls suggest that the Granite State could be much friendlier to Haley, and she received the coveted endorsement of New Hampshire's largest newspaper, the Manchester Union-Leader. A storng finish could set Haley up for a possible boost in momentum heading into other early states like her home state of South Carolina.
Accordingly, Trump has ramped up his Haley opposition in recent days, fresh off of a decisive victory in Iowa, claiming that she's busing in Democrats for the primary.
Haley fired back at the claim in a social media post on Friday, noting that Democrats can't vote in the New Hampshire primary and haven't been able to change their registration for months.
""Another reason we need to move on from Trump: too many lies,"" she wrote.
Haley reiterated her pitch on Sunday that Americans don't want a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024, emphasizing that a Trump presidency would result in ""chaos.""
""No matter what it is, chaos follows him, rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him,"" she said. ""And so what happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos.""

Larry Hogan (R) said Sunday that GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley may still have a chance at clinching the Republican 2024 nomination despite former President Trump’s double-digit lead in the polls.
Hogan said on ABC’s “This Week” panel that the New Hampshire primary “sometimes really surprises us,” suggesting that Haley could come out with a win in the state. Hogan also endorsed Haley for the nomination last week and praised her for having the “momentum” to be the GOP’s best candidate next November.
“That’s the place where things happen that you don’t expect to happen. Look at Bill Clinton. Look at John McCain, and the fact that she’s only down 11 with a lot of momentum. It’s not going to look anything at all like Iowa,” Hogan said.
He also said a lot of independent voters will come out in support of Haley to stop Trump from securing the nomination because it is an open primary in which voters of all affiliations can cast a ballot.
“And I think what you’re going to see is a lot of independents. There’s no Democratic primary, independents that want to stop Donald Trump. This is the last line of defense. Republicans, the 50 percent of Republicans that don’t like Trump. Tuesday’s their day, so she got a couple more days. Let’s see what plays out,” Hogan said.
“But it’s not impossible for her. If she overperforms expectations, I think she rolls into South Carolina with a lot of momentum,” he added.
According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling averages, Trump is leading Haley by about 11 points with about 47 percent support. Haley has about 36 percent, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trailing with a distant 5.7 percent. The New Hampshire primary will be held Tuesday, just over a week after Trump won the Iowa caucuses.

DeSantis entered the race with lofty expectations, with many conservatives seeing him as a next-generation GOP figure.
But Trump has had a disciplined campaign, and DeSantis lost key support in many early-voting states.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday suspended his presidential campaign, a stunning fall for the conservative leader who had long been seen as the biggest threat to former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a message to supporters. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
""While this campaign has ended, the mission continues,"" he continued. ""Down here in Florida, we will continue to show the country how to lead.""
DeSantis, who entered the presidential race last May, sought to build on the national profile that he had built for himself as an immigration hard-liner and as a politician who had fought against COVID-19 mandates. After winning reelection in November 2022 in a 19-point landslide, DeSantis' profile exploded, and he was immediately viewed by many Republicans as the conservative who could go toe-to-toe against Trump and capture the GOP nomination.
In several polls taken before DeSantis entered the race, the governor actually polled ahead of Trump, which at the time revealed the vulnerable state that the former president found himself in politically after Republicans faltered in the 2022 midterm elections.
After DeSantis entered the race, he was competitive in the early-voting states, but as the summer and fall went on, his numbers slipped precipitously across the country. He staked his campaign on winning the Iowa caucuses, but Trump's standing in the state only strengthened by the end of last year.
Trump's myriad legal issues seemingly had the effect of boosting his polling numbers with GOP primary voters, which in turn iced out DeSantis as the leading alternative to the former president.
Trump would go on to win the Iowa caucuses, taking 51% of the vote to DeSantis' 21% share and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley's 19%. Despite campaigning in all 99 of Iowa's counties, DeSantis did not win a single county in the state.
DeSantis' exit from the race also comes two days before the New Hampshire primary, a contest where he was struggling for relevancy, with most his polling numbers mired in the single digits.
The governor in recent days had sought to pivot to the South Carolina Republican primary on Feb. 24, but with Trump riding high there and Haley have a sizable level of support in her home state, his pathway to continuing in the race became incredibly murky.

That’s obviously a considered decision, and there are more than enough not-very-veiled references to Trump and the MAGA “movement” to make clear that Toscano understands the symbolic importance of America’s homegrown would-be dictator to the phenomenon he’s trying to delineate.
For that matter, the notorious European political leaders of the 1930s with whom Trump is frequently compared — you know who I mean, the strutting Italian peacock and the little Austrian with the ‘stache — don’t play starring roles in “Late Fascism” either. That’s partly because Toscano is more concerned with political and philosophical theories of fascism and anti-fascism, with the backstage machinery, so to speak, rather than the actors facing the crowd.
But beyond that, it’s because Toscano’s central argument — as I read this admittedly challenging work — is that fascism should be understood as a “dynamic” or a “process” unfolding throughout recent history, not as a “singular event” associated with charismatic leaders, mass rallies and fashion-forward uniforms that emerged during a global economic crisis and then was defeated, only to resurface unexpectedly in the 21st century.
Toscano writes in his preface that he does not “intend ‘late fascism’ to operate like an academic brand,” meaning a trendy label embraced as an all-purpose explanation, à la “neoliberalism,” “late capitalism” or “globalization.” He may protest too much: “Late Fascism” is so loaded with moments of insight and illumination into the tormented historical, political and psychological roots of our current crisis that such an outcome may be inevitable.
Although Toscano never provides a single straightforward definition of what fascism is or isn’t, his thought and language are so precise and specific that he can’t be accused of flinging the term at every right-of-center political formation that contains elements of nostalgia. Until recently he was primarily known as a translator and scholar steeped in the work of European leftist titans like Alain Badiou, Georges Bataille and Antonio Negri. But with this book he stakes a claim as a major voice in the 21st-century renovation of Marxism, especially alert to the ways that the collision of racism, antisemitism and corporate capitalism have fueled a global mood of crisis and opened the door for a “late fascist” renaissance.
Toscano’s entire book can be read as a taxonomy of fascism, but he comes closest to a working definition in his discussion of German philosopher Ernst Bloch’s “Heritage of Our Times,” a “protean, fascinating and unsettling work” first published in 1935 but not available in English until 1991, which seems startlingly germane to the contemporary moment. Writing near the beginning of the Nazi regime, Bloch understood fascism as a “perverted utopian promise,” in Toscano’s phrase, with a strange relationship to time and history. That promise appeals most strongly to social groups who find themselves “somehow out of sync with the rationalizing present of capitalism,” offering them a fraudulent reactivation of “unfulfilled pasts and unrealized presents.”
That strikes me as an almost perfect description of Trump’s most loyal supporters: As reams of social-science research have confirmed, they are not necessarily poor or unemployed or economically struggling in any objective sense — but they clearly perceive themselves as “out of sync” with the dominant social order, and feel enraged or cheated out of something they cannot define but believe they deserve.
The problem for leftist opponents of fascism, as Bloch sees it (and as Toscano seems to agree), is that fascist ideology is not purely or entirely deceptive; it also contains fragments of “an old and romantic antagonism to capitalism, derived from deprivations in contemporary life, with a longing for a vague ‘other.’” To put that in more familiar terms, fascism is driven by mythic yearning — whether for an imaginary premodern “Aryan” folk culture or for America’s ahistorical lost greatness — and the rationalist counternarratives about economic progress or class conflict variously put forward by socialism and liberalism have a tough time competing with that.
There is an ironic contradiction within the MAGA version of fascist mythology, however, which few mainstream commentators have noticed. As Toscano writes, Trump’s movement is conspicuously driven by nostalgia for America’s postwar affluence, for “the ‘Fordist’ heyday of Big Capital and Big Labor (generally coded as male and white) … for a racialized and gendered image of the socially recognized patriotic industrial worker.” Yet that era of rising if unequal prosperity was fueled by progressive taxation, widespread union membership and an unprecedented explosion of government spending and social welfare programs, all of which are not just anathema to the MAGA creed but unimaginable under current political conditions. The Trumpian false utopia promises the benefits of social democracy, in other words, without compelling the ruling class to pay for them.
Bloch’s book is only one of the numerous little-known or underappreciated works that Toscano draws upon, although usual suspects like Hannah Arendt, Antonio Gramsci and Theodor Adorno certainly appear as well. He offers a powerful re-reading of 1970s work by Black radicals Angela Davis and George Jackson, arguing that they offer a prophetic understanding of fascism as a “differential” process, in which some groups effectively live in a police state while others experience a reasonably functional democracy. In a later chapter, Toscano resurrects another ‘70s radical, the Italian literary critic Furio Jesi, whose extraordinary insights into the “religion and mythology of death” in right-wing culture were entirely new to me.
Toscano’s understanding of fascism as a kind of mythic current — both in the liquid and the electrical sense — that runs below the surface of postwar society but is never entirely absent, leads to one of his most compelling and, no doubt, most controversial points: It is a comforting but dangerous delusion, he argues, to view liberal democracy and fascism as polar opposites, or to assume that we know where one stops and the other begins.
He attacks this question in a number of ways throughout the book, beginning with the observation that “our knee-jerk identification of fascism with a monolithic, bureaucratic state and its opposition to liberalism in all its forms” is misguided. Contrary to Arendt’s oft-quoted assertion that totalitarianism “aims at abolishing freedom, even at eliminating human spontaneity in general,” Toscano offers ample evidence that both German and Italian fascism defined themselves as forces of liberation, offering a project of “racial imperialism” based on a masculine-identified notion of freedom drawn from all those vague myths about the past and linked to the “authoritarian rebel” personality described by Erich Fromm, “who, on the basis of their inner strength and integrity, fight those forces that block their freedom and independence.”
It’s impossible to read that quotation without recognizing an early version of the MAGA conception of “liberty from so-called ‘medical totalitarianism,’ for and of property ownership, or as a marker of civilizational difference from migrants and their religions,” as Toscano puts it. When Italian fascism first came to power just over a century ago, he writes, it was not as a “totalitarian” fusion of political and economic forces but “as a particularly virulent strain of state-led anti-statism,” which is about as pithy a summary of the federal government during Trump’s (first) term as one could offer.
Toscano’s deeper point, although he doesn’t exactly put it this way, is that “democracy” and “fascism” exist on a continuum. They share the same fundamental conception of individual or “bourgeois” liberty, ultimately drawn from the likes of John Locke, Adam Smith and Edmund Burke (all of whom would no doubt be horrified by every aspect of 21st-century politics). It’s self-flattering nonsense to treat them as binary states of light and darkness, or to resort to idiotic metaphors about America’s sacred democracy teetering on the edge of a bottomless abyss.

I think many of us understand this on a basic level — I’ve written about it a couple of times myself — and feel more than a little squidgy about the relentless torrent of political and journalistic sermons urging us to embrace the last chance to save democracy from the red-hatted barbarians who will storm the gates if they can actually get off the sofa. (Which is exactly what we were told about the last election, not to mention the one before that, and also what we will be told about the next one.)
You don’t have to be an acknowledged Marxist like Toscano to look at the political reality created by Citizens United, the Federalist Society and the Electoral College (none of which can be blamed on Trump or his followers) and ask what democracy Joe Biden and his party claim to be defending. Fewer than one in five American voters live in a state likely to be contested in this year’s presidential election, and the widely dreaded rematch between Trump and Biden will probably be decided by the whims and grievances of 100,000 or so “swing voters” scattered across those states.
Furthermore, both Mussolini and Hitler first gained power through electoral victories, and only gradually subsumed the state apparatus to their purposes. Toscano points out that the Nazis never bothered to replace the constitution of the Weimar Republic, which theoretically remained in force right through 1945. That’s one of many occasions when he observes that the fascist reputation for ruthless efficiency and administrative competence is completely undeserved. (He also argues that the pop-culture presentation of Nazis as stylish, sophisticated and erotic is ludicrous projection.)
Donald Trump’s attempted coup of 2021, let’s remember, was scripted by lawyers who meant to contain it within the purported constitutional guardrails of democracy. In many respects they hoped to emulate the notorious Compromise of 1877, when a presidential election that was ultimately decided in Congress brought an end to Reconstruction, set democracy back by many decades and launched the Jim Crow era, in what could fairly be described as a capitulation to proto-fascist forces in the white South.
Whether the Capitol attack of Jan. 6 was part of that original script or was (more likely) an improvised response to its failure, that became the moment when it was acceptable for mainstream voices to label Trump’s movement as fascist. Toscano would argue that they were finally, and reluctantly, naming a tendency that was present in our politics long before Trump, and will be there long after he’s gone."

Asked in a Sunday interview how he could support “someone who falsely claims that the election was stolen over and over and over again,” Burgum said, “As you and I would both agree, free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy and in states like North Dakota, we’ve got 100 percent confidence in that happening.”
“But whether it’s 1960, the year 2000, 2016, there was concern raised by the Hillary Clinton campaign. In 2020.. This is something, as a country, that we’ve got to work hard to face..and I think we’re slowly —” Burgum continued.
Raddatz interjected, pointing out Burgum had said the election wasn’t stolen, yet was supporting a candidate who repeatedly asserted it was.
“Well, I – I know that we’ve got – certainly we’ve got irregularities. When we went through COVID, and we had these mail-out ballots, that creates all kinds of opportunities for mischief,” Burgum responded. “When you’re bailing out more ballots to a – in a state than there are registered voters, you know, I think we have… that’s a problem.
Raddatz shot back and asked, “Do you think the election was stolen now? Now when you look back.”
Burgum said he was “not saying that,” but rather the country needs to “look forward,” and ensure Americans’ confidence in elections.
“We know that the social media companies and the media companies have admitted that they suppressed stories leading into the – the November 2020 election, that they’ve admitted to all that. And so Americans lack confidence in this, and that’s why – that’s why we’ve got to make sure going forward that we have confidence,” Burgum continued.
Burgum endorsed Trump for president last week after dropping out of the presidential race last month. He has touted Trump for his policies on the economy, border, and energy, arguing the former president “can make a difference.”
The conversation between Burgum and Raddatz then shifted to Trump’s recent barrage of attacks on Haley.
Trump has come under fire for sharing a conspiracy theory on social media that Haley was ineligible to run for president and referred to her birth name, Nimrata. The former South Carolina governor, whose parents are from India, has noted she was born in Bamberg, S.C., and eligible for the White House.
Asked by Raddatz why Trump is doing this, Burgum said, “Well, I just…all I know is that I believe this election, the primary election is going to be over after Tuesday. President Trump is leading in all 50 states. We’ll be talking… tonight. I think that’s the time –”
Raddatz interrupted, “No, please answer the question, sir. Answer the question about why you think Donald Trump is doing that.”
Burgum said he thinks “it’s politics,” and pointed to attacks against Trump from the Biden campaign.
“He [Joe Biden] didn’t talk about the open border, where we’ve got a massive invasion and now we’ve had more fentanyl deaths than four Vietnams in our country under Joe Biden the last three years. No, he talked about attacking his opponent. That’s politics around the world and it’s politics in America,” Burgum said.
Raddatz then asked if Burgum believes this is the “kind of politics” Trump is using, to which Burgum referenced the “vicious things” previous White House hopefuls said about President Biden.
“This is all in the norm inside of – for north – for politics in our country. But once we agree as parties, we get behind candidates. The Democrats got behind Biden in 2020,” Burgum said. “I’m confident Republicans are going to get behind President Trump because they’re concerned about the direction that this – the world – the world is going and the direction the United States is going.”
Trump, Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will go head-to-head in New Hampshire this week as polling shows Trump with a lead over both the candidates. A polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with a 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State, while DeSantis trails far behind.
Trump easily won in Iowa last week, with DeSantis trailing behind him by nearly 30 points and Haley close behind.

Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.
By the time Ron DeSantis pulled up his anchor from Iowa on Jan. 15, it was pretty clear to anyone watching that the Florida Governor was likely enjoying the high-water mark of his bid for the White House. Sure, he came in second place in the lead-off caucuses. But he had done so with the backing of the state’s popular Governor, and boasted the top money haul of anyone running for the GOP nomination. Ultimately, though, DeSantis trailed former President Donald Trump by 30 points despite heavy spending: the DeSantis campaign spent about $3 million on ads and his super PAC dumped $35 million, essentially burning about $1,500 per eventual supporter in the state.
This was, as they say, a whole lot of money set on fire without a lot to show in the ash.
Put simply: there weren’t a whole lot of reasons for DeSantis to summon optimism as he wrapped his work in Iowa, a legitimate operation that saw him visit every one of the state’s 99 counties and win not one of them.
So, on Sunday, DeSantis bowed to the reality of the 2024 dynamic and suspended his campaign, effectively ceding the MAGA lane to its creator. His exit puts Trump one leg closer to a third nomination in eight years and perhaps within striking distance of another four years in the White House.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources when we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a video posted on social media, two days before the New Hampshire primary in which polling showed he was likely to come in a distant third. ""Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""
As he left the trail, DeSantis seemed resigned to falling in line for the good of the Republican Party. “Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,"" DeSantis said. ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.""
To say that DeSantis’ campaign is one of the worst in history is a stunning statement, but one that isn’t easily proven false. His launch via a glitchy Twitter rally—replete with server meltdowns, hard-right rhetoric, dodgy facts, and a cameo from Elon Musk himself—proved that the executive competence aura around DeSantis might be more hallucination than halo. Once officially a candidate, DeSantis proved an awkward fit for the hagiography that preceded him. Yes, DeSantis crushed his re-election bid months earlier, but what worked in Destin didn’t always translate to Des Moines.
The campaign itself oozed inauthenticity, and it was evident at every put-your-finger-in-the-air moment. DeSantis went to war on fronts as varied as inclusive corporate policies, diversity-focused coursework, college free speech, bathrooms and locker rooms, even Mickey Mouse’s self-governance at the Magic Kingdom. Availing himself as the quartermaster of the culture wars seemed like a good choice—until it wasn’t.
The Trump, But Less Bad pitch went only so far. They never crafted him as Trump, But Better. The candidate being sold didn’t match the hype, and voters knew it instantly. Money woes, staff infighting, strategy brawls, even wardrobe choices befell DeSantis’ orbit. While counting on Trump’s supporters to transfer their loyalty to him, DeSantis was careful not to lay too tough a case at his former ally’s feet. Somehow, he expected defections to happen automatically without any effort at persuasion. DeSantis understood Trump’s ability to turn on former friends without any compunction. DeSantis knew loyalty was not in Trump’s toolbox, so he didn’t count on lingering familiarity for any protection.
Ultimately, DeSantis couldn’t make the case why MAGA-styled Republicans would line up behind his facsimile when the original article was just as viable—at least for now. Polls showed an utter indifference to Trump’s looming legal challenges among Republicans, and Trump is not incorrect when he says every case and lawsuit brought against him only hardens his supporters’ resolve to have his back. From that reality, DeSantis never was able to ding Trump for realities that would have disqualified other candidates, those who are beholden to the rules of political gravity.
Every Republican dream candidate ultimately faces this sort of crash. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was supposed to have been a political behemoth who won three statewide elections in four years. No one was tougher than Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty had the policy knowhow and the national buzz to run a technocratic machine. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had the organization and the gold-plated name to deliver him the nomination. All flamed out. Bigly.
Since the Tea Party revolution of 2010, the Republican Party is looking for a nihilistic streak that found its personification in Trump. Everyone else trying to win under the old rules has been turned back and exiled. The candidates didn’t figure it out until it was too late in 2016. Ultimately, the fight came too late this cycle and with too little urgency behind it.
Which is why, the race now finds itself down to a two-person grudge match: Trump versus Nikki Haley, his one-time top diplomat to the United Nations. Trump is running as the original MAGA nihilist while Haley is pitching herself as an alternative to burning-it-all-down indulgence. It’s not much of a glamorous dichotomy, but it’s what Republicans are left with.

Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race and endorsed former President Trump two days before the New Hampshire primary.
The Florida governor announced his decision to suspend his campaign in a social media video on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday afternoon.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,"" DeSantis said in the video. ""But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.""
""Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" said DeSantis, who was a distant third in the single digits in the latest polls in New Hampshire.
THIS 2024 GOP CANDIDATE WAS TARGETED BY WAY MORE ATTACK ADS THAN ANY OTHER HEADING INTO THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS
DeSantis highlighted that he's had ""disagreements"" with Trump but believes that the former president is a better leader than Biden.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis continued. ""They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.""
DeSantis noted that ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.""
CHECK OUT THE LATEST POLL NUMBERS IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
Trump, who along with his allies spent months fiercely attacking DeSantis, told Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman that he was ""very honored to have his endorsement.""
""I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country,"" Trump said.
And Trump, who for months had used the derogatory nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" on the campaign trail, said he wouldn't be using that nickname going forward.
""No, that name has been officially retired,"" Trump told Fox News Digital.
The Florida governor also took a chance to criticize former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is a former two-term South Carolina governor and the other remaining major contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.
TRUMP RUNNING MATE SPECULATION SOARS AS FORMER PRESIDENT CONSOLIDATES SUPPORT
DeSantis said he endorsed Trump ""because we can't go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
""The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over,"" he added.
Haley, speaking at a campaign stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, told the crowd, ""I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor. And we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.""
And in a statement, Haley noted that ""so far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not. We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road. New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision.""
A signal that the end was near came on Saturday night when DeSantis canceled two major Sunday talk show appearances. His campaign said at the time that the interviews were canceled to allow the governor to travel back to New Hampshire from South Carolina, where he was stumping on Saturday.
The DeSantis video was posted on Sunday afternoon, a couple of hours before the governor was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. That stop was canceled and there was no word on whether DeSantis would fly to New Hampshire to join Trump ahead of Tuesday's primary.
DeSantis, 45, finished in second place in last week's Iowa caucuses with 20.1% of the vote, but he only narrowly defeated Haley and came in 30 points behind Trump, who achieved a record-breaking and commanding victory in the low-turnout Hawkeye State contest.
DeSantis' departure from the race comes after his campaign went ""all in"" on Iowa, betting that a strong ground game, events, visits to all 99 counties and endorsements from top Iowa Republicans would propel him to a strong showing leading into elections in New Hampshire and South Carolina.
But his distant second-place finish, while it slightly exceeded expectations in the final polls, was seen as a major disappointment, considering all the time and resources he spent in Iowa.
The Democratic National Committee, taking aim at the Florida governor, charged that ""Ron DeSantis pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA agenda that both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are still running on, and now he is the latest member of the GOP to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.""
DeSantis, who was convincingly re-elected to a second term as Florida governor 14 months ago, was once the clear alternative to Trump in the Republican White House race. Multiple polls showed DeSantis leading Trump early last year before he entered the race, but he faltered out of the gate with a glitch-riddled social media campaign announcement.
The governor was backed by the big-spending aligned super PAC Never Back Down. However, after a series of campaign setbacks over the summer and autumn, and after getting hammered by constant attacks and negative ads from Trump and his allies, DeSantis saw his support in the polls erode.
Dan Eberhart, a top DeSantis donor, bundler and surrogate, told Fox News Digital that ""Ron DeSantis ran into a bump and the bump was named Trump.""
""This wasn’t about money. The campaign insists they had enough money to get to Super Tuesday. I think this was about data and polling and Gov. DeSantis being realistic about whether or not Trump was beatable,"" Eberhart said.
And he added that ""more importantly, I think this was about 2028, and DeSantis doesn’t want [a] 5 to 8% showing in New Hampshire on his record. Let’s face it, he’s the Republican voters' de facto second choice, and he’s Trump voters’ second choice, and so he’s decided to get out and govern Florida.""

MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. The New Hampshire primary is just two days away. Can anyone stop the Trump steamroll towards the Republican nomination? We go now to former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is hoping to be the one to stop him. She's on the campaign trail in Derry, New Hampshire. Good morning to you.
NIKKI HALEY: Good morning.
MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, our CBS polling shows that you are the Republican candidate with the best chance at beating Joe Biden in a head-to-head race. And yet, Donald Trump is the party's frontrunner. Why do you think, Ambassador, that the Republican establishment isn't doing more to help you?
NIKKI HALEY: Well, I mean, this is what primaries are all about. This is about the fact that, you know, people get to decide which way they want to go forward. What I have said, as you can either pick more of the same, or you can go forward with the new generational leader. More of the same is, you know, the fact that you've got 70% of Americans don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch. More of the same as the fact that both of these presidents put us trillions of dollars in debt. And our kids are never going to forgive us for it. More of the same is the fact that we're gonna have two presidential candidates in their 80s. That's not what our kids want. That's not what we should want. You know, more of the same is the fact that we can't be a country in disarray and have a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. We've got to get a new generational leader. I'm making my case to the people of New Hampshire. New Hampshire sees it for what it is, they know that responsibility, and we're going to try and bring this home in two days.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well 26 Republican senators at this point and all of the House Republican leadership have lined up behind Donald Trump. Why? Are they afraid of him?
NIKKI HALEY: Not surprised at all. And I'll tell you why. You'll see a lot of the South Carolina legislature line up behind him too. And it's because I've never really taken care of elected officials. You know, I've forced South Carolina legislature, they had to show their votes on the record. I made them pass ethics reform. I vetoed half a billion dollars worth of their pet projects. You look at Congress, what have I done? I said I want term limits. I said that I don't think they should get paid if they don't give us a budget on time. I've talked about mental competency tests. I call out elected officials because I think they need to be accountable to the people. I call out Republicans and Democrats when they don't do the right thing. So it's not surprising that that set is going towards Trump because he's going to take care of them. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to take care of the taxpayers. I've always done that my entire career, and I'll keep on doing it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you win in North Carolina- and excuse me- can you win in South Carolina?
NIKKI HALEY: I won twice as governor.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you just laid out, the South Carolina establishment is lining up behind Donald Trump. I want to ask you about something--
NIKKI HALEY: -- I mean, I'll remind you I was a tea party governor at the time, so I didn't have the establishment when I ran for governor the first time. I ran against the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, and a very popular congressman and I still won. And so it's about being down on the ground with the people and I plan on doing that again.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Former President Trump on Friday, repeatedly and wrongly said that you were in charge of the January 6 security response at the Capitol, and he said your name four times. I want to play this for our viewers.
DONALD TRUMP: They never report the crowd on January 6, you know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley. You know, they- did you know, they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it. Because of lots of things like Nikki Haley, is in charge of security.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unclear what he's talking about as being deleted. But you said yesterday, hearing this made you question Donald Trump's mental fitness. Is that the first time you questioned his mental fitness?
NIKKI HALEY: If you look, recently, there have been multiple things. I mean, he's claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I'm assuming he met World War three. He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I'm the one that kept security from Jan- from the Capitol on January 6. I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6. But Margaret, you don't be surprised if you have someone that's 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature. We know that. What I'm saying is, first of all, you're talking about somebody who's only going to be in office four years. Secondly, you're talking about someone who continues to- I mean, look, I don't know if he was confused. I don't know what happened. But it should be enough to send us a warning sign that if you look, Joe Biden, he's very different than he was two years ago. Are we really going to go into a situation where we have wars around the world, and we're trying to prevent war, and we're going to have someone who we can or can't be sure that they're going to get confused?It's a real issue. That's not being disrespectful. It's just a fact.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think Trump's voters care about that? And when you worked in his Cabinet, did you ever question his mental fitness?
NIKKI HALEY: When I worked in his Cabinet, I called him out if he was doing something wrong, I mean, I would show up, I pick up the phone and say ""you can't do this. Instead, you could do X, Y, or Z,"" you know, so I always told him what I thought was in the best interest of the country when I was in his Cabinet. But this is different. I mean, we're seeing he's just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we're seeing some of that decline. But more than that, what I'll say is, focus on the fact that no matter what it is, chaos follows him. Rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Does he cause it?
NIKKI HALEY: -- and America's tired. In some cases, he causes it. In some cases, he doesn't. But regardless, he's like a magnet to it. And so what happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired, and they're worried. I mean, kids right now in their 20s, they don't know if they're ever going to be able to afford a home. They don't know how this debt is gonna get paid down. They don't know if they're gonna find a job. You see people living- 60% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. People talk about the economy that Donald Trump had us in, it was good, but he put us $8 trillion in debt in just four years. That's not what you do.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about an ad that you have released that includes video and testimony from the mother of Otto Warmbier, who was an American student from the University of Virginia, who was taken prisoner in North- North Korea and died, as you know, after the Trump administration did bring him home. Pundits say national security does not matter to voters. Why do you think this story is one you need to tell?
NIKKI HALEY: I think this really does show the contrast. So I worked with Cindy and Fred Warmbier. They're amazing people. And I will tell you as a parent, no parent wants to see their child returned to them the way they saw Otto returned. This was a happy, smart kid, he went to North Korea. And I mean, the thugs in North Korea tortured him and returned him back in a state that- that is unconscionable. And the difference is I told Fred and Cindy, speak up, get loud, make sure I will help you, let's partner. We're gonna call North Korea out. I passed the largest set of sanctions against them in a generation by pushing China and Russia to do it. But what did Trump do? Instead, he talked about love letters going back and forth to Kim Jong-Un Cindy would contact me she was so upset. And he went and said, ""Oh, but Kim said that he wasn't aware of any torture that happened to Otto."" All you had to do was look at Otto when he was returned back to his parents. But this goes back to a pattern. I mean, we saw this over and over again. It's not just that he congratulated China's President Xi, a dozen times after China gave us COVID. He congratulated the Chinese Communist Party on their 70th anniversary. We don't congratulate the Communist Chinese party. I remember at the United Nations, I had to sit him down and tell him to stop this bromance with Putin. I mean, you can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us. Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference. And when you've got wars all over the world now, and the instability that we had, our goal is to prevent war. And we can't do that by trying to buddy up with them.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about clarifying your position here, because you've spoken about the complexity of the abortion, abortion issue personally for you. And you've said there's no national consensus, so there won't be a federal law. But you've also said if there were one passed, if it were six weeks, it was 15 weeks, or it was restrictions after 20 weeks, which you signed when you were governor, that you'd be okay with that. When we spoke yesterday to Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, she said that you would sign a national abortion ban. Would you?
NIKKI HALEY: You know, it's so interesting, because this is a- you can't say that to the American people because all you're doing is putting fear and judgment in them. Yes, I'm unapologetically pro-life, but I don't judge anyone for being pro-choice. I've said I'm fine with a federal law. But the thing is, in order to get a federal law, you have to have a majority of the House, 60 senators and a signature of the President. Margaret, we haven't had 60 Republican senators in over 100 years. So no Republican president can ban abortions, any more than a Democrat president can ban any state law. What we can do is let's find consensus. I think we can find consensus to ban late-term abortions. I think we can find consensus to encourage adoptions and good quality adoptions. I think we can find consensus that doctors and nurses who don't believe in abortion shouldn't have to perform them. I think we can find consensus that contraception should be accessible, and I think we should find consensus that any woman who has an abortion, no state law should say she's going to jail or getting the death penalty. I will not demonize this issue. It's too personal. We have to start doing that. Democrats use fear and Republicans use judgment. This is too personal of an issue to use fear or judgment and I won't be a part of any of that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you're not taking a ban off the table, which allows for Democrats to say that, that you would be on board. Can you say–
NIKKI HALEY:–You are not–
MARGARET BRENNAN: –You will not –
NIKKI HALEY: 60 senators- 60 senators would never approve a ban on abortion. That's a fact. That's a fact. So why put out something that's implying something's going to happen to the American people that is a lie. That's never going to happen with that–
NIKKI HALEY: You're not going to get 60 senators to agree to a ban
(CROSSTALK)
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But you know democrats are using this as a way to motivate voters. Democrats are using this as a way to motivate voters --
NIKKI HALEY: -- Democrats--
MARGARET BRENNAN: –so that they do get the math to add up one day. So if the math does add up--
NIKKI HALEY: -- No --
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- one day, would you sign a ban?
NIKKI HALEY: This is the problem with Democrats. Democrats put fear in the American people. The American people don't need fear. They need confidence. They need security. They need to know that everything's gonna be okay. When it comes to the abortion issue, I will never put fear in the American people. I will tell them the hard truth. The hard truth is 60 senators will never agree to a full ban on abortion. That's a fact; Republicans or Democrats. 60 senators are not going to agree to that. I don't know what 60 senators are going to agree to. Right now they don't even agree to 15 weeks. So we've got a long way to go. Our goal should be how do we save as many babies as we can and support as many moms as we can. I had a roommate in college who was raped. I would never wish on anybody what she went through, wondering if she was pregnant. Everybody has a story. Let's be respectful of that. Stop putting fear into people thinking something's going to happen. That's not going to happen.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we have to leave it there. Thank you for your time. Face the Nation will be back in one minute with Michigan Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer. Stay with us.

The governor cancelled appearances on both CNN’s State of the Union and NBC’s Meet the Press on 21 January, CNN’s Jim Acosta reported on Saturday night, spurring questions about the state of his campaign. Less than an hour later, Mr DeSantis’ press secretary released a statement.
“The media hits were canceled due to a scheduling issue and will be rescheduled,” press secretary Bryan Griffin said on X. “The governor will be traveling Sunday morning with the campaign and has public events scheduled Sunday evening through Tuesday in NH.”
However, observers are still speculating this could indicate the end of the DeSantis presidential campaign.
“I don’t know if it’s today, tomorrow, next week or the following week, but obviously the man has run out of steam, out of options, out of money, out of a path,” Ana Navarro, senior political commentator for CNN, said on Saturday.
“It gives him a way of easing back, because he’s got to come back to Florida and be governor,” she later continued.
In conversation with Navarro, former Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera called the cancelled appearances “coveted” slots.
“Everybody wants that, especially before a big primary,” he said.
Meanwhile, Jenna Ellis, an attorney and member of Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign, said the suspension of Mr DeSantis’ campaign – which she has been supporting – “seems imminent.”
Despite cancelling media appearances, Mr DeSantis did add another campaign event to his Sunday evening schedule in New Hampshire, per NBC News, where he’s currently polling in the single digits.
A CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire has the Florida governor standing at 6 per cent, with frontrunner Donald Trump holding 50 per cent and former Governor Nikki Haley at 39 per cent. Meanwhile, a Suffolk University survey from Wednesday had Mr Trump with 16 points over Ms Haley, and Mr DeSantis at just 5 per cent.
If he stays in the single digits come the primary this Tuesday, Mr DeSantis will fall under the 10 per cent minimum required to win delegates in the state’s primary. That could come as a significant blow to his campaign following his second-place victory in Iowa last week.
What remains crystal clear, however, is that Mr Trump remains the front-runner — and his fellow Republican candidates are in a race for second place.
The Independent has contacted Mr DeSantis’ campaign for comment."
2236,7G1SRUSOD5_PC2CIYNY1C7EFGQ,Ron DeSantis drops out of GOP presidential primary,Jenna Moon,"January 22, 2024 at 5:11 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-gop-presidential-201157620.html,"Insights from New York Magazine, Bloomberg, and Semafor
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the U.S. Republican presidential primary on Sunday and endorsed former President Donald Trump two days before GOP voters in New Hampshire go to the polls.
“Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,” DeSantis said in a video announcing his exit from the race. He said he didn’t “have a clear path to victory.”
The Florida governor’s second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses did little for him in New Hampshire, where tracking polls showed him stuck in the single digits. “He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” former South Caronina governor Nikki Haley told reporters at a Thursday campaign stop.
The final DeSantis stops in New Hampshire were in small venues, where political tourists and college students often got prime seats. Before a Friday night rally in Nashua, the perennial candidate Vermin Supreme climbed on a stage set up for DeSantis, leading a half-amused cheers from the crowd for “free ponies” and “zombie power.”
“I’m the ghost of Bootgates past!” said the candidate, who campaigns with an upside-down boot on his head. DeSantis told audiences that he would out-work both Haley and Trump, taking dozens of questions and pointing out that neither rival was being so open with New Hampshire voters.
“Trump’s running for his issues, Haley’s running for her issues — I’m running for your issues and your family’s issues,” DeSantis said, a line he’d developed in Iowa after Haley was endorsed by Americans for Prosperity and her super PAC got a check from Democratic donor Reid Hoffman.
Signs began emerging in December that DeSantis didn’t have a future in the election, and there was a quick turnaround in support for his candidacy. Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting the Florida governor, started losing staffers in November. The super PAC handled many parts of DeSantis’s campaign — but in managing so much, it may have done the candidate a disservice, Semafor’s David Weigel noted. “One reason is subjective, though it’s an opinion shared by plenty of operatives: Its ads haven’t been very good,” he wrote.
As Never Back Down’s leadership became consumed by in-fighting, donors and campaign staff began to feel skeptical about DeSantis’s chances in the primary, Bloomberg reported in December. Campaign “operatives privately say Never Back Down has spent money irresponsibly,” Bloomberg noted, while the super PAC viewed DeSantis’s Florida campaign staff “as a group of novices, who have no national political experience.”
DeSantis struggled to gain a foothold in his native Florida, and the polling gap between the governor and Trump continued to widen throughout his campaign. The state represented something of a turf war between Trump and DeSantis, and local government leaders rallied their support behind Trump. Among the issues DeSantis faced was upending the cult of personality which follows the former president, Jonathan Chait argued for New York Magazine. While Chait believed it was likely that DeSantis would be the favorite to win the primary, that changed after it became clear that Trump’s sway over voters would not so easily transfer to DeSantis.
People who initially rallied behind the governor were “disappointed and demoralized,” one source told Politico in July, adding they expected other supporters would bail on the campaign if its trajectory didn’t turn around. DeSantis shied away from attacking other candidates with the same vigor they showed him, and refused to engage with the mainstream media, election watchers noted to Politico. “More than anything,” the governor needed to “focus on defining himself,” one analyst said."
2240,7JGP0WSDBP_CMTKWP1Y219B2L1,Comedy's Truthiness Problem,Peter Suderman,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·11 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/comedys-truthiness-problem-110058825.html,"In October 2005, Stephen Colbert invented a new word: truthiness.
In a short monologue for The Colbert Report, a satirical show where the comedian played a caricature of a conservative blowhard cable news anchor, he took issue with an approach to news that relied on facts and credible sources. ""I don't trust books,"" Colbert said. ""They're all fact, no heart. And that's exactly what's pulling our country apart today."" Truthiness emanated from feeling rather than hard evidence, affirming beliefs backed by strong emotions.
This was during the George W. Bush administration, in the post-9/11 era, so inevitably Colbert brought up the war in Iraq. ""Maybe there are a few missing pieces to the rationale for war. But doesn't taking Saddam out feel like the right thing? Right here,"" he said, pointing to his belly, ""right here in the gut. Because that's where the truth comes from—the gut."" In closing, Colbert promised to maintain a posture of truthiness as he conveyed the news to his viewers. ""Anyone can read the news to you,"" he said, deadpan. ""I promise to feel the news at you.""
Truthiness entered the popular lexicon. Today, multiple dictionaries include the word. The general concept, sometimes but not always attached to the word, has become a prominent and recurring criticism of right-wing politics and journalism. Broadly speaking, the argument was that the Republican Party and the American right consistently ignored fact-based rigor when such rigor would prove inconvenient. As political discussion migrated to social media, the critique followed, with Democrats increasingly prone to warning about misinformation and disinformation online.
Colbert transitioned to a new role as a conventional late-night talk-show host, playing himself rather than a comic caricature. But he continued to emphasize that the right wing was prone to exaggerations, telling omissions, conspiracy theories, and outright falsehoods. In early 2022, he released a fictional Spotify playlist for vaccine misinformation, in response to what he said were harmful inaccuracies spread on the service by popular podcaster Joe Rogan. A gag ad for the playlist that aired on his late night show pronounced: ""We hit shuffle on your understanding of basic facts."" Lol.
***
One wonders what Colbert feels, in his gut, about Hasan Minhaj.
Like Colbert, Minhaj is a comedian by trade—he has two Netflix specials to his credit. And like Colbert, Minhaj often wields his comedy to political ends. Minhaj is Indian-American, and his stand-up specials tell personal stories of racism and mistreatment. He frequently criticizes former President Donald Trump and the post-9/11 domestic security apparatus.
From 2018 through 2020, Minhaj hosted Patriot Act, a left-leaning news-and-comedy Netflix series. Patriot Act was reminiscent of The Daily Show, Comedy Central's longrunning pseudo-newscast, which from 1997 through 2005 featured Colbert as a ""correspondent."" After Daily Show host Trevor Noah announced in late 2022 he was leaving the show, Minhaj was widely reported as a top contender for the slot.
The Daily Show is a comedy program, with jokes and snark and play-acted absurdities. But it is also a current affairs program designed to inform its viewers. During the peak of its cultural influence—in the mid-'00s, when it was hosted by Jon Stewart—pundits occasionally grumbled that too many young people were getting their news from Stewart.
The show faded in relevance after Stewart left, but it spawned several imitators, including HBO's Last Week Tonight, hosted by John Oliver (another Daily Show alum), and even another Jon Stewart series, The Problem with Jon Stewart, on the Apple TV+ streaming service (recently canceled). Liberal comics weren't just mocking the news. They were delivering it and explaining it, with clarity and moral forcefulness.
Minhaj seemed to fit into this tradition. So it was notable that when Clare Malone profiled him for The New Yorker in September, she reported that she could not verify multiple stories that Minhaj had told during his stand-up specials. Invariably, these were personal stories designed to make a political point, generally about state or personal mistreatment of people like Minhaj.
One story from the Netflix specials revolves around a man who became close with Minhaj, his family, and their mosque in 2002. The man, dubbed ""Brother Eric,"" was white; he claimed to be a Muslim convert. After insinuating himself into their lives, Minhaj said, Brother Eric tried to coax some of the young men at the mosque into talking about jihad.
Minhaj recounts believing that Eric was a law enforcement informant; as a sort of gag, Minhaj says he told Brother Eric that he hoped to get a pilot's license. This resulted in a visit from the police, as Minhaj told it, who knocked his head into the hood of a police car. Years later, Minhaj says his family watched a news account in which a man resembling Brother Eric was revealed to be an FBI informant. The young Minhaj, it seems, had seen through the ruse.
Almost none of this is true. There was a man resembling Brother Eric who acted as an FBI informant. But as Malone reported, he was in prison in 2002 and didn't begin working with the feds until 2006. He did no work in the area Minhaj's story was said to have taken place.
In other words, the time, the place, and specifics of Minhaj's personal experience—his eyewitness account, leading to a supposed violent encounter with police—were totally fabricated.
In another anecdote from the special, Minhaj recalls receiving an envelope of white powder at his home. In Minhaj's telling, the suspicious white powder came into contact with his young daughter, who was rushed to the hospital.
But Malone found no police account that matched this event. In an interview with Minhaj, the comedian ""admitted that his daughter had never been exposed to a white powder, and that she hadn't been hospitalized."" Instead, he'd received a powder in the mail and joked to his wife it might have been anthrax.
Minhaj, confronted with reported evidence that many of his stories have been false or heavily exaggerated, defended his work. ""Every story in my style is built around a seed of truth,"" he told Malone. ""My comedy Arnold Palmer is seventy percent emotional truth—this happened—and then thirty percent hyperbole, exaggeration, fiction.""
Emotional truth. Put another way, Minhaj's argument was that his stories didn't need to be actually true because they felt true. Minhaj was defending truthiness as good and righteous, so long as it was in service of the proper sort of political narrative. He wasn't just reporting the news to you; he was feeling the news at you.
***
Malone's profile chronicled other purported gaps in Minhaj's stories. In one anecdote, Minhaj recounts being rejected by a prom date. She was white, he was not, and although she initially accepted his invitation, Minhaj says that at the moment he arrived at her home to pick her up, she backed out in humiliating fashion: There was another boy at her door placing a corsage. In the special, Minhaj says the reason she backed out was because her parents didn't want her taking photos with a person of color.
After Malone interviewed the woman from the story, whose name has not been made public, she reported a different version of the events. She told Malone the rejection happened, but not on prom night; it occurred days prior. ""Minhaj acknowledged that this was correct,"" Malone wrote, ""but he said that the two of them had long carried different understandings of her rejection."" In the following sentence, she quotes him saying that as a ""brown kid"" in California, he'd been conditioned to ""just take it.""
""The 'emotional truth' of the story he told onstage was resonant and justified the fabrication of details,"" Malone wrote. According to the reporter, the woman also said she'd been invited to a performance of a stand-up routine in which Minhaj told the prom night story. ""She had initially interpreted the invitation as an attempt to rekindle an old friendship, but she now believes the move was meant to humiliate her.""
Weeks after Malone's story appeared, the comedian released a video response. The video runs a little more than 20 minutes, and in it Minhaj claims Malone excised important portions of his quotes and distorted their meaning.
In it, Minhaj argues that the New Yorker story was ""needlessly misleading."" The largest portion of his response is focused on the prom night story. He shows emails between himself and the woman in the story appearing to show that she requested an invite to his performance. He also takes issue with Malone's use of the ""different understandings of her rejection"" quote, arguing that Malone's presentation lacked context and that it implied he had made up the racial motivation for the rejection. He delivers a fuller version of the quote that more clearly makes his point: that the woman didn't understand how much he'd been hurt by the incident.
The video then addresses the Brother Eric and anthrax stories. In both cases, he admits the stories didn't happen the way he told them onstage. Although he says he had interactions with undercover law enforcement, ""it didn't go down exactly like this, so I understand why people are upset.""
Introducing the anthrax story, he recounts some details from the comedy special, then says, ""This, as you know, is not how it went down."" He apologized for embellishing the stories, but he defends his embellishments as necessary to spotlight some larger truth. Over the course of the video, he argues that his falsehoods (though he does not use that word) were necessary to make his stories clearer, more accessible, more relatable to his audience.
Was there a bit of truthiness in The New Yorker's exposé? Or was Minhaj's defense itself an exercise in obfuscation?
A Slate review of Minhaj's defense concluded that ""almost everything the New Yorker article alleges appears to line up with Minhaj's version of the facts, except for some of the details of the prom date story."" After Minhaj posted his video, Malone tweeted: ""Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point: exactly what we reported."" The New Yorker stood by the story.
***
One might argue that comedy specials do not have a journalistic responsibility to hew to the truth. Minhaj has indicated that he draws a line between his stand-up work and his more journalistic output on Patriot Act.
Certainly, Minhaj is far from the first comedian to exaggerate, embellish, or outright lie for laughs. Indeed, there is a long and noble tradition of lying for laughter. If a silly story makes you guffaw in amusement, there is no need for it to be true.
But Minhaj's stand-up fabrications weren't just jokes. In some cases they weren't even jokes at all, and weren't presented as tall tales: They were presented as clear-eyed truths about American prejudice. In that New Yorker story, Minhaj explicitly defended the use of falsehoods to make a point more powerful. ""The punch line,"" he told Malone, ""is worth the fictionalized premise."" In his defense video, he says he ""made artistic choices to express myself and drive home larger issues affecting me and my community.""
Moreover, although Patriot Act had a research department with fact checkers, Minhaj reportedly found them frustrating. ""In one instance,"" Malone wrote, ""Minhaj grew frustrated that fact-checking was stymying the creative flow during a final rewrite, and a pair of female researchers were asked to leave the writers' room.""
Minhaj's work on Patriot Act was what made him a potential successor to Stewart and Noah on The Daily Show. But in late October, online news outlet Puck reported that although Minhaj had nearly closed a deal to take the reins at The Daily Show, he would not be getting the gig.
When Stewart left The Daily Show in 2015, he used his final monologue to issue a warning about the world of news and commentary. ""Bullshit is everywhere,"" he said. ""There is very little in life that has not been, in some ways, infused with bullshit."" While some minor exaggeration was innocuous and even necessary to function socially, he said, viewers needed to be on the lookout for ""the more pernicious bullshit. Your premeditated, institutional bullshit, designed to obscure and distract. Designed by who? The bullshitocracy.""
He had some good news, though. ""Bullshitters have gotten pretty lazy,"" Stewart said. ""And their work is easily detected.""

2241,7KLVYMDTZO_0B6JURSYU1KH244,What voters in New Hampshire have to say about Nikki Haley and Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary,"Arit John and Jeff Zeleny, CNN","January 22, 2024 at 6:52 AM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-wants-two-person-070018992.html,"Danielle Brown voted for John McCain in the 2000 New Hampshire Republican primary and for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary eight years later. On Tuesday, she intends to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to send a clear message to both parties.
“We need to have some new ideas and a new, younger generation coming in,” Brown, an undeclared voter, said as she clutched a Haley 2024 yard sign freshly autographed by the candidate. “Haley is energized. I think she can do a lot for our country.”
Brown is a voter stuck in the middle, one of thousands of undeclared and independent residents who make up a plurality of the Granite State’s electorate and a critical part of Haley’s coalition. Her chances in New Hampshire – and by extension, the fate of her campaign – likely hinge on how many independents vote for her in the state’s primary Tuesday.
As of Friday, 344,335 voters in New Hampshire were registered as undeclared, making up nearly 40% of the electorate.
Haley’s campaign is targeting Republicans and undeclared voters from the suburbs to the seacoast, advisers said, particularly in precincts where Trump underperformed other Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu. Though former President Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, he lost the state in the general election in both 2016 and 2020.
A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley is backed by a majority – 58% – of registered undeclared voters, but the former president has the support of 67% of registered Republicans.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon, was backed by just 6% of New Hampshire GOP voters in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would have needed to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
A win in New Hampshire could offer Haley’s campaign the momentum, and donor money, necessary to compete in South Carolina on February 24 and the Super Tuesday states voting on March 5.
A loss, however, might hasten the speed at which the Republican Party coalesces around Trump.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who ended his own presidential bid in November, became the latest former candidate to endorse Trump at a rally in Concord on Friday. Haley dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that Trump was lining up “Washington insiders” despite vowing to drain the swamp.
“But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do,” Haley said.
As Trump campaigns in New Hampshire, the former president is trying to keep Republicans in line – and out of reach for Haley.
“Nikki Haley in particular is counting on the Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Portsmouth on Wednesday.
His rallying cry is false. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and the deadline for registering as a Republican or undeclared voter was October. Undeclared voters have the option to choose either a Democratic or Republican primary ballot on Election Day.
Greg Moore, a senior adviser for AFP Action, the political network backed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that has thrown its resources behind Haley, said Friday that the group’s data shows the former governor’s base includes conservative voters. AFP Action, which endorsed Haley in November, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire, Moore said.
“I think some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump,” Moore said. “I know that’s not true.”
What the former president may not know is that Haley’s rallies and town hall meetings in New Hampshire last week were filled with voters like Susan Rice of Rochester, who twice voted for Trump.
Rice, who owns a yarn business in New Hampshire and Maine, was invited to the White House in 2018 during the Trump administration for an event to showcase small-business leaders. She said she believed it was time for the country to move on.
“I’m a staunch Republican and I have been my entire life,” Rice said. “I think it’s time to have a woman as a president. I like her foreign policies and I like the fact that she has a good understanding of our southern border and what she wants to do for that.”
She said she was exhausted by Trump and excited by Haley’s potential to rebuild the Republican Party.
“I don’t necessarily worry about the court cases,” Rice said. “But it’s the baggage, and honestly, sometimes what comes out of his mouth and – how do I put this diplomatically – the name-calling, the putting other people down.”
Michael Lewis, a Hollis resident, said he supported the way Trump approached the economy, the border and America’s relationship with NATO, but he couldn’t vote for a presidential candidate “whose age is past life expectancy.”
He also expressed doubts that Trump will still be eligible to run for president in the general election.
“I think the sequence is there’s campaigning, then there’s the [Republican National] Convention, then there’s going to be the conviction of Donald Trump,” Lewis said. “There’s going to have to be an alternative. I think she’s the answer.”
Still, while some former Trump voters are open, even eager, to vote for Haley, the former president’s base in New Hampshire remains strong.
“MAGA is not going to be with her,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday.
That was the sentiment at the Saddle Up Saloon in Kingston on Friday afternoon, where GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio rallied a few dozen Trump supporters. In interviews, attendees mentioned several criticisms Haley’s rivals have leveled against her foreign policy views and her conservatism.
Sylvia, a Nashua voter at the event who declined to give her last name, said she would sit out the general election if Trump made Haley his running mate.
“She’s a RINO, she’s a war monger,” she said, using the acronym for “Republican in name only.” “I’m not for her at all.”
Bill Jackson, an 86-year-old from Hampton who plans to vote for Trump, said he believed Haley has support only among elitists and echoed the former president’s comments about Democratic crossover votes.
“She’s pro-war. She’s also pro-immigration, illegal immigration,” he said. “I mean, she said we’ve got to treat these people as equals. No, we don’t, they’re illegally coming into this country.”
Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have tried to paint Haley as weak on border security. Haley has responded by saying securing the border would be a top priority of her administration. She has characterized herself as a conservative and said her advocacy for a strong US foreign policy is meant to prevent war.
On the trail, Haley has expanded on the pitch she started making on the night of the Iowa caucuses – that she is the best chance voters have of preventing both Trump and President Joe Biden from winning a second term. She has highlighted polls that show her beating Biden in a general election by a wider margin than the GOP front-runner, and argued that she would help Republicans down ballot win House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
A Marist poll released Friday found Haley running near-even with Biden, 47% to 44%, in a New Hampshire general election matchup, while Trump trailed Biden by 7 points.
Haley has also sought to draw comparisons between Trump and Biden, from their ages to the amount of government spending they approved in office, and said both presidents come with “baggage.”
Her revamped stump speech also pushes back more aggressively against the Trump campaign’s characterization of parts of her record, including her position that the retirement age needs to be raised for people in their 20s and 30s. In a recent ad, Trump’s campaign incorrectly claimed Haley wants to limit Social Security for current beneficiaries.
Haley noted that Trump supported raising the Social Security age to 70. Trump supported raising the Social Security age in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” but wavered on whether to cut entitlements since running for president in 2016, CNN’s KFile reported last year.
“If he’s going to lie about me, we’re going to tell the truth about him,” Haley said in Hollis on Thursday. “You’re going to see a lot of things said, but at the end of the day it’s the drama, and vengeance, and the vindictiveness that we want to get out of the way.”
The message resonated with Nancy Protzmann, an undeclared voter who attended the Hollis event and said she’s long been looking for a candidate to back against Trump. As she left the venue, she said she plans to request a Republican ballot and vote for Haley.
“I will do anything in my power to make sure that Trump does not become our next president,” Protzmann said. “But I liked what she said – and I don’t want Biden either.”
Asked whether her decision was intended to be more of an affirmative vote for Haley or a roadblock for Trump, she said ideally both.
“I hope it will be a launching pad for her, because I do think she would be a good president,” Protzmann said. “And I certainly hope it will help block him.”

2259,8AFGYANS5O_1DMLILYA0OZ5L4Z,"In South Carolina, Ron DeSantis prepares a last stand – and a way out","Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 10:26 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-carolina-ron-desantis-prepares-012656101.html,"With most of the political world closely watching New Hampshire this weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead spent Saturday 900 miles away in South Carolina, laying the groundwork for his presidential campaign’s last stand.
“I’m asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,” DeSantis told supporters at a Florence restaurant. “I’ll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida. I will always be a candidate that you can be proud of. As president, I will get the job done.”
In a marker of the confusion surrounding his unclear path forward, DeSantis’ campaign late Saturday was still scrambling to figure out which state their candidate would appear in on Sunday. The scheduling fluctuations resulted in DeSantis abruptly canceling plans to appear Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His campaign quickly chimed in publicly to end speculation about his political future to note that DeSantis will appear in New Hampshire on Sunday.
Yet, even as he soldiers on, DeSantis increasingly sounds like a candidate wrestling with his relevancy. In the days following his distant second-place finish in Iowa, DeSantis has lashed out at Fox News, bemoaned the money spent against him, blamed cold weather and “very low” enthusiasm for his performance, trivialized the sway of the Hawkeye State Republicans who endorsed him, conceded former President Donald Trump’s edge going forward, admitted his media strategy failed, and for the first time suggested what it would take for him to end his White House bid.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he said Friday night. “The minute I don’t, then I’m not just going to do this just for my health.”
His public journey through the seven stages of grief comes as his Republican rivals have all but dismissed his candidacy as an afterthought.
Trump recently predicted on his social media site that DeSantis “will SOON be out of money and dropping out of the race for President.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was “no longer focused on” DeSantis after Iowa.
“He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” she said. “He’s invisible in New Hampshire. He’s invisible in South Carolina. We’re focused on Trump. That’s the key.”
DeSantis, though, is intensely focused on Haley in South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. In appearances around the Palmetto State this week, DeSantis has contended she’s not conservative enough for the state and has asked the audience to list her accomplishments. He has asserted no one can.
Fourth-grade teacher Regina Wasiluk took issue with that suggestion. She showed up to DeSantis’ Lexington event to defend Haley’s record on education when he once again queried his crowd.
After a brief exchange, DeSantis shut her down.
“This isn’t your show, ma’am,” he said.
Wasiluk said after the experience she wouldn’t vote for DeSantis if he’s the GOP nominee.
“I was very upset that I didn’t bring my phone so that I can share it with other people who feel the same way that I do,” she said.
South Carolina’s February 24 primary is still more than a month away and comes after the Nevada caucuses. But coming just nine days before Super Tuesday, when the race expands into a national contest, the state typically turns into “the graveyard of a lot of campaigns and the booster rocket to at least one,” said the state’s GOP chairman, Drew McKissick.
“This is your last chance to be able to focus on one state at a time,” McKissick said. “After that, you’ve got to be on the air and on the ground in half a dozen to a dozen states at one time. That’s cost prohibitive, time prohibitive and manpower prohibitive.”
Still, DeSantis’ campaign is not setting expectations for a win here or even a second-place finish. Instead, it appears singularly focused on playing spoiler to Haley on her home turf. The theory behind the strategy is Haley would drop out if she can’t manage a strong performance in the state she once led, though she has given no indication that is the case. The Florida governor is moving much of his campaign here to carry out that mission.
DeSantis himself is not setting expectations, either. He told reporters Saturday, “I’m not a political pundit,” when asked his end goal in South Carolina and whether there’s a district he thinks he can win.
“We’re here. You saw the folks. We get great reception,” DeSantis said, referencing a large crowd at the Myrtle Beach event. “As this thing turns, you know, we’re gonna be in a good situation.”
But DeSantis has stopped short of the scorched-earth offensive it may take to damage Haley. His remarks across three stops Saturday largely touched on familiar themes – his accomplishments in Florida, the scourges of a “woke” culture and the urgency to change course as a country – none of which moved the needle for him in Iowa and New Hampshire.
One attendee in Myrtle Beach asked DeSantis why he hasn’t gained traction from Republicans in 2024 given his track record in Florida – a sign of the skepticism from voters that accompanies worsening odds.
“I got to break through a lot of clutter out there in ways that other candidates don’t,” DeSantis contended. “There’s other candidates that get elevated, and I got to break through the clutter.”
Unclear is how much firepower DeSantis will have to “break through the clutter.” DeSantis’ campaign and supporting super PACs have not aired an ad outside of Iowa since mid-November, and the Hawkeye State did not deliver the result for him that could have led to a fundraising bonanza.
Meanwhile, Haley’s campaign is preparing to launch a $4 million media buy in South Carolina beginning the day of the New Hampshire primary, her campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, told reporters Saturday. Americans for Prosperity Action, which is supporting Haley, also has about $2.3 million booked in the state, according to AdImpact.
Also missing since getting thrashed in Iowa is the swagger of the candidate who once cosplayed as a “Top Gun” pilot to drive home the point he will “never back down from a fight.” DeSantis appeared tired touring his third state this week while keeping up a schedule badly battered by winter storms. Asked by a voter Saturday in Myrtle Beach whom he’d pick as a running mate, DeSantis listlessly batted away the question with a blunt assessment of his standing in the GOP race.
“It’s presumptuous,” he said. “I’ve got eight delegates. Trump’s got 20. You gotta get there.”
A visit to South Carolina four days before New Hampshire votes would seem to necessitate punting on the Granite State – where Trump and Haley are in a heated fight and he is at risk of not reaching the 10% vote threshold needed to earn delegates in the state. Yet, as DeSantis arrived in South Carolina, he published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Journal in which he urged voters to support him.
“Support me in the coming New Hampshire primary,” he wrote, “and I will embody the live free or die spirit as your next president.”

AMHERST, NH (NEXSTAR) – In New Hampshire, Nikki Haley has hosted events across the state to meet local residents. Events like these could potentially increase her chances of getting ahead in the polls.
On Friday, January 19, the former South Carolina governor joined voters in Amherst, New Hampshire for some casual conversation and pictures. This event was hosted at Mary Ann’s Diner and was one of many Haley held across the state to engage with voters on a personal level.
Michelle Rogers, a supporter of Haley, appreciated the connection she felt she was able to form with the politician.
“She goes around. She talks to you as a person. She doesn’t talk to you as much as she’s 25,000 levels above you. She talks to you very genuine,” Rogers said.
Other residents, like Al Lacey, were happy to be able to meet the potential Presidential nominee.
“I was just excited that she was going to be here. You know, a buddy of mine called me and told me and we only live two minutes down the road. So, I said, let’s go over. Me and my wife came, and I like her. I think she’s very nice,” Lacey commented.
On Friday, polls indicated that Haley was still trailing former President Donald Trump by 17 points. Many of the Haley supporters were former Trump voters who say they are supporting the former governor over the former president.
“She is truthful. She is knowledgeable. She does not lie. She is truthful!” Rogers expressed.
Other candidates, like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Trump, are only holding rallies in New Hampshire leading up to primary day. However, Haley’s decision to meet face-to-face with voters in a casual setting made many supporters at the event feel comfortable with her and made them see her as a real person, not just a politician.
“I think it’s really good to see that they’re just human, normal people, right?” said a member of the Casalegno and Haslam families, “And to bring it back to real life level, especially for the kids to see that and what a better way than in a place where you’re eating lunch.”
These personal interactions with voters could be what Haley needs to secure a win this Tuesday.

2283,9HIG5V6315_F3824SW7U2Z9X7A,Watch: Trump is not ‘mentally fit’ says Haley after he confuses her with Nancy Pelosi,Rozina Sabur,"January 21, 2024 at 10:47 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-trump-not-mentally-fit-134709247.html,"Nikki Haley never seems to be far from Donald Trump’s thoughts.
Fresh off a landslide win in Iowa, the former president hopes to cement his hold on the Republican nomination contest in New Hampshire, which votes next, and only Ms Haley stands in the way.
“I don’t even talk about DeSanctus - whatever happened to him?” Mr Trump told a rally in Concord, using his nickname for Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who is polling a distant third in the state.
But he had plenty to say about Ms Haley. His former UN ambassador, he said, wasn’t “tough enough”, “smart enough”, or “respected enough” to be the commander-in-chief.
“She’s down very low [in polls]. We’ll finish it off. This could end it,” he said ahead of Tuesday’s election in the Granite State.
Mr Trump is not wrong. The result could determine the trajectory of the Republican primary contest.
If Mr Trump, 77, repeats the large margin of victory he secured in the Iowa caucuses last week, it is likely to be game over for Ms Haley, 52, and Mr DeSantis, 45.
But Ms Haley’s bet on New Hampshire has put her head-to-head with Mr Trump, and in contention to win the state.
To power her to victory she is relying on a broad voter coalition, made up of Republicans who have tired of Mr Trump, and independents, who are able to vote in the state’s open primary.
In a state where the motto is “live free or die”, non-party affiliated voters make up almost two fifths of the electorate.
They may play an even more pivotal role this year because there is no real contest on the Democratic side.
Aware of the threat, Mr Trump has already laid the foundation to claim foul play.
He has claimed Democrats could “infiltrate” the race, although the deadline to switch party registration was in October.
Mr Trump appears to be so unsettled by his 52-year-old rival he even uses her name seemingly unintentionally as he went on his tirade on Friday night in Concord.
As he discussed the lack of security at the Jan 6, 2021 Capitol riots, he seemed to criticise Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat Speaker of the House of Representatives at the time, but used Nikki Haley’s name.
He said: “By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6, you know, Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they – did you know they destroyed all the information and all of the evidence.
“Because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard. So whatever they want, they turned it down.”
Like the apparition of a pantomime villain, the crowd booed, on cue, at the mention of the former South Carolina governor’s name.
But some looked confused. Ms Haley had not been near the Capitol at the time, nor had she been in elected office, much less responsible for the security of the Capitol.
Ms Haley lost no time in highlighting the gaffe, and pressing her advantage.
“They’re saying he got confused,” Ms Haley told her own supporters in Keene, western New Hampshire, the next morning.
“I’m not saying anything derogatory,” she continued, “but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this.”
Ms Haley’s willingness to hit Mr Trump with personal attacks is testament to the make-or-break stage of her campaign.
Mr Trump, too, has ramped up the rhetoric in recent days, nicknaming Ms Haley “Nimbra”, in what has been criticised as a dog whistle reference to her given name, Nimarata.
He has even given oxygen to a false “birther” conspiracy that Ms Haley is not eligible to become a US president on account of her Indian heritage.
Steven Cheung, Mr Trump’s campaign spokesman, has dismissed allegations of racism as “faux outrage”.
Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary, told The Telegraph they were “very confident that he remains in a strong position to win”.
“It’s just too bad that Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis don’t realise that they have no practical pathway to the nomination,” she said, adding: “If they want to keep staying in this race, we will fight them until they’re out.”
Ms Haley has been undeterred, criss-crossing the state’s snowy, rugged terrain, promising to shake every hand and answer any question.
“It’s the Haley and Trump show all week,” said New Hampshire-based strategist Jim Merrill, who held senior roles in campaigns of George W Bush, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio.
He said: “It’s one of the last opportunities for voters to send the message that they want to make a change from Donald Trump and I think Nikki Haley has positioned herself to be in striking distance”.
New Hampshire’s electorate, Mr Merrill added, poses a “challenge” for Mr Trump. It is wealthier, has more university-educated voters, and favours candidates who have broader appeal.
But he cautions against viewing New Hampshire’s large independent constituency as a given advantage for Ms Haley.
“This is not a monolithic voting bloc,” he said, describing it as a healthy mix of conservatives, libertarians and progressives.
Added to which, Ms Haley must still contend with Mr Trump’s unshakeable grip over the Republican grassroots.
Hundreds of his supporters waited patiently in a snow-covered car park for over an hour to see the former president in Concord on Friday night.
Some wore red “MAGA” woolly hats or scarves to shield them from the bitterly cold winds as temperatures fell to -7C. Others had brought camp chairs in anticipation of the lengthy queues.
They included Jack Lianos, a 17-year-old student, who hopes to cast his first vote for Mr Trump in November’s general election, by which time he will be 18.
“I love Trump’s foreign policy,” he said, a key voting issue for him. “He’s not dumping money on other nations. I think that American money should stay in America.”
Like Jack, it was 40-year-old sales worker Geoff’s first Trump rally. A self-described libertarian conservative, he wasn’t an early convert to Mr Trump. But he was won over by the “peace and prosperity” he saw as the hallmark of the former president’s first term.
“I was managing a multi-million dollar company at the time and our best years were the Trump years,” he said. He’s ready, as he puts it, for “another go round with Trump”.
When he bounded onto stage, Mr Trump lost no time reminding them of their mission for Tuesday: turning out “in record numbers”.
“Margins are important,” he told them. “Not because of the people we’re running against... [but] because this could end it.”
He added: “And then we can focus on Biden.”

2295,A2PA3P2ZFO_DG72NDEPNR36C1Y,Haley woos independents in final New Hampshire push against Trump,Gram Slattery and James Oliphant,"January 21, 2024 at 8:10 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/haley-woos-independents-final-hampshire-111041147.html,"By Gram Slattery and James Oliphant
PORTSMOUTH/KEENE, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Tom Mita, a 45-year-old non-profit worker in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is not registered with a political party. That makes him the perfect target for Nikki Haley, who needs independent voters for a chance to prevail in this pivotal primary state.
Mita is thinking about voting for Haley, he told a pair of door knockers who were canvassing on behalf of the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations outside his suburban home on Saturday, but he isn't completely sold on her candidacy.
He wants Haley, who has so far spared Donald Trump from some lines of attack, to go after him more aggressively. He considers Trump a threat to democracy for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. If Haley pulls her punches, he may vote in the Democratic primary instead.
""It's really about stopping Trump,"" said Mita, standing outside his door, hands stuffed in his pockets, on a 19-degree Fahrenheit day. ""Best scenario would be if she comes out and says that she won't endorse Trump for president.""
Voters like Mita, who are unaffiliated with either major party, will be crucial to Haley if she is to pull off an upset and beat Trump in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Tuesday. She likely needs a victory here or a very close second to survive, following her third place finish behind Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last week in Iowa.
Voters untied to either party are the state's most important bloc. They account for 343,000 of all registered voters, eclipsing both the number of registered Republicans and Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state.
Unaffiliated voters are allowed to participate in the primary of their choice. About 30% are effectively Republicans, 35% align with Democrats, and 35% are truly independent, estimates Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center and a political science professor.
Given Trump's stranglehold on the Republican base, Haley will need to secure the support of 70% to 75% of unaffiliated voters in order to win the state, he said.
""That's never happened before,"" said Smith. ""That's a really tall order.""
While Haley has closed the gap with Trump in New Hampshire, the former president retains a comfortable lead of 14 percentage points according to an average of polls compiled by website FiveThirtyEight.
SUPER PAC BOOST
Trump has in recent days sought to portray Haley's gains in state polls as improper because they reflect growing support among independents. He has also falsely claimed registered Democrats would be allowed to vote in the Republican primary.
Chris Ager, chair of the state Republican party, noted that Trump himself benefited from the backing of independent voters when he won New Hampshire in 2016, reviving his campaign after a loss in Iowa. Ager thinks Trump will win but gives Haley an outside shot.
""Nikki Haley could win New Hampshire,"" he told a media roundtable hosted by Bloomberg in Manchester on Saturday. ""The undecideds can break very late.""
Haley's bid could be boosted by a super PAC formed to persuade right-leaning independents in New Hampshire to support her. The group, Independents Moving the Needle, has been airing a number of supportive ads on local television.
One of the committee's founders, Jonathan Bush, told Reuters the group is trying to appeal to “rational Americans” who want to move on from Trump and Biden.
“We’re excited at the traction,” said Bush, a cousin of former President George W. Bush who helped launch the effort after seeing Haley speak in person. Bush e-mailed his contact list and set up an online fundraiser for Haley that netted more than $1 million, he said.
Independent voters, Bush said, are the fastest way for Haley to “get in the ring” against Trump and make it a two-candidate race.
At campaign stops on Saturday, Haley spoke of her appeal to a wide swath of voters, referring to a new Marist College poll that showed her beating Biden in New Hampshire by three percentage points while Trump would lose by seven points.
Angelika Fretzen, 54, an independent voter from Peterborough, New Hampshire, was sold on the pitch. ""She’s a great alternative to Donald Trump,"" Fretzen said after attending a rally on Saturday. “I think it’s time for a new generation, and I think a lot of independents of my age group feel that way.""
Carrying out the door knocking was Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC mainly funded by billionaire Charles Koch. Of the eight interactions with voters observed by Reuters on Saturday, the canvassers engaged with four Republicans, three independents and one person who did not disclose his affiliation.
Mita and another independent said they were leaning toward Haley while the third plans to vote for Trump. The Republicans were split between Trump and Haley, two to two.
One Republican, Chris Jay, gave a reason for considering Haley that meshed with Mita's rationale. Jay, a 57-year-old lumber broker, said he wanted Haley to go after Trump more.
""I think Trump needs to be put in his place a little bit,"" he said.

2303,AHZ98WFJJ5_IG6DB3ZUHO1TCYP,Upscale voters are embracing Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. Can they carry her to a primary win?,"Karissa Waddick and Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY","Updated January 22, 2024 at 7:10 AM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/upscale-voters-embracing-nikki-haley-101028172.html,"BRETTON WOODS, N.H. – Rudy Glocker strolled into the Omni Mount Washington Resort on a mission to see former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, as snow blanketed the luxury hotel’s red tin roof.
Glocker, a 54-year-old entrepreneur, had seen Haley once before at an event over the summer near his company, Burgeon Outdoor’s, a Lincoln, New Hampshire store that specializes in outdoor apparel. Her foreign policy expertise and leadership style impressed Glocker, a former Goldman Sachs executive.
Ahead of the Granite State’s first-in-the-nation primary, he wanted to be sure he was backing the right candidate.
“She has a vision,” said Glocker, a Harvard Business School graduate, who said the former South Carolina governor's approach evoked the problem-solving ability of a business owner. “She expresses a desire to understand the issue, understand what drives it and to take action that will hopefully help solve the problem.”
Glocker is a part of a key demographic that Haley is counting on to overtake former President Donald Trump in Tuesday's primary: highly educated and fiscally conservative professionals.
The departure on Sunday of Ron DeSantis left Haley and Trump locked in a two-person race in which the former president is the heavy favorite.
Though Trump has held a commanding lead in the GOP field throughout the primary campaign, Haley began seeing momentum for her candidacy in New Hampshire last fall as she crisscrossed the state answering voters' questions at town halls.
Upscale voters are an important part of her coalition there. New Hampshire is a relatively wealthy state that boasts proximity to the Boston area along with scenic mountains and coastal areas. Its median household income of roughly $90,000 is more than $10,000 higher than the national average, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
A USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll in early January found that New Hampshire residents earning more than $100,000 a year were more likely than other voters to support Haley. She performs her best among highly educated voters who earned either college or advanced degrees.
While combative rhetoric is a staple of Trump's speeches and also featured heavily in DeSantis's campaign appearances, Haley has a more measured style. The former South Carolina governor and former UN ambassador puts a strong emphasis on explaining her policy proposals, from the economy to the border to foreign policy. That appears to be part of her appeal to college educated voters.
“Much of primary politics is identity politics. When all the candidates have an R or a D next to their name, voters' choices often rely on intangible factors,” Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said.
For Gail Myers, 69, that was exactly the case after meeting Haley at the Bretton Woods event Tuesday.
""I felt like I was her long-lost sister,"" said Myers, who formerly owned her own drapery business.
Myers and her husband, the former president and CEO of A.I.M. Mutual Insurance Companies, drove an hour and half from their home in Wakefield in the lakes region for the event. A friend who served in the South Carolina State Senate told them Haley was ""the real deal."" Haley's brief 20- minute address in the hotel's ballroom had Myers hooked.
""Everything that she had to say was right on target. That was all my feelings,"" Myers said. ""I'm definitely voting for her.""
Haley has courted supporters like Myers by hosting campaign stops at 4-star hotels in coastal and mountain vacation havens frequented by the wealthy, such as the Omni Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, Portsmouth’s Wentworth by the Sea and the Inn on Main near Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro.
In wintertime, travelers from New York and Massachusetts flock to resorts like Bretton Woods to ski down the White Mountains renowned peaks and cozy up by the fire in the lodges. During the summer, they line the streets of quaint downtowns near the seacoast, bumping shoulders with locals as they wait for dinner reservations at chic restaurants.
New Hampshire also has rural voters of more modest means and blue-collar voters. Working class voters are a base of support for Trump both in New Hampshire and across the country. The USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found the former president performing well among those with a high school degree or some college.
If Haley is to do well against Trump, she'll need to overperform in the white-collar communities where she has spent much of her time, such as Portsmouth and Hollis.
""More than anywhere else in New Hampshire on Tuesday, I'm paying attention to those bedroom communities – suburban communities in the southern tier of the state that make up the outer ring of metropolitan Boston,"" Scala said.
Haley has an important supporter in New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.
Sununu is one of the most popular governors in the country and is himself among the state’s elite. His family owns and operates a ski resort in northern New Hampshire that he helped run before he was elected in 2017. As governor, Sununu has championed a platform of fiscal responsibility and traditional conservative policies, such as business tax cuts.
His electoral success rate in the state is nearly unmatched – he won four races before announcing last year that he would not seek another term. Sununu chalks his victories up to retail politics and says that’s how Haley can pull ahead in the state, too.
“National strategies don't work in New Hampshire. You've got to be really genuine. You've got to connect with folks,” he said in an interview. “That's the fundamental rule.”
Greg Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity, an arm of the conservative Koch-backed group that endorsed Haley last November, noted that Sununu has a higher favorability than Trump with wealthy suburban voters.
For instance, in the 2020 general presidential election, Trump lost the once-Republican stronghold of Bedford, a suburb of Manchester, to President Joe Biden. In the same election, Sununu carried the town by more than 70%.
“If Nikki Haley is smart, she's listening to him, as he sort of gives her advice as to how to position herself with those types of communities,” Moore said. “Fundamentally, I think that's an area where she can really clean up.”
Linda Wells, 65, is among the voters in the state who were turned off by Trump but is drawn to Haley's message. A former business analyst for Fidelity Investments, Wells said she is looking for a candidate who is ""cool, calm, collected, logical and future-focused.”
“I don't want Trump again. I'm tired of the drama,” the Wolfeboro resident said after attending a November town hall for Haley. Just down the road, multimillion dollar mansions, including one owned by Sen. Mitt Romney, surrounded one of the state's premiere summer destinations – Lake Winnipesaukee.
Wells, an independent voter, has donated to Haley’s campaign and is considering whether to volunteer for her on Election Day.
“I want somebody fresh and new that will spend her time and energy tackling the issues,” Wells said.
Haley's business background and popularity with donors drew attacks from other Republicans, including DeSantis and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Both sought to paint the former UN ambassador as beholden to Wall Street.
Haley sat on the board of Boeing after leaving the Trump administration. In 2020, she stepped down over the company’s pursuit of a federal bailout during the pandemic. She’s held several other board positions and has made millions from speaking engagements, private consulting and stock market holdings since leaving office, according to her financial disclosure forms.
But in New Hampshire, voters such as Glocker say they don’t see her business ties as a liability.
Instead, they look at her professional pedigree, international background and time as a governor as a trifecta for a presidential candidate. In fact, one of the experiences Glocker said he valued most in Haley, a former accountant, was her time working as a bookkeeper for her family’s South Carolina dress store.
“When I first met her, we talked about the challenges of running a small business,” the former Goldman Sachs vice president said, recalling when Haley came into his store after her event over the summer.
The pair talked like colleagues about the metrics behind the business – sales growth, profit margins, overhead costs – and Glocker said it gave him faith both in Haley’s financial policy plans and her ability to dig into the granular and big picture as president.
“As a small business owner, one of the things is everybody at your firm looks to you for leadership and how to handle a situation,” Glocker said. “I think being honest and blunt, those types of things, is important. And I think Nikki Haley has some of those characteristics.”

2306,ALJQ7TKOCU_8S1Y3TKZC3VHL2A,Rep. Dean Phillips Refuses To Rule Out Third-Party Run,Daniel Marans,"January 22, 2024 at 6:13 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/rep-dean-phillips-refuses-rule-211352187.html,"HAMPTON, N.H. ― Speaking to voters in a restaurant in New Hampshire’s seacoast on Sunday, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, once again refused to rule out the possibility of mounting a third-party bid under the banner of the centrist group, No Labels.
Asked about the idea by a member of the audience at his meet-and-greet event, Phillips responded by citing the possibility of circumstances in which it was the surest route to prevent former President Donald Trump from winning again. “I will do anything it takes as long as the data supports it to defeat the most dangerous man in the world,” he said.
A day earlier, Phillips told voters in Nashua something similar, saying that he would consider the idea only if Trump and President Joe Biden were headed for a rematch in which Biden is “almost certain to lose.”
On Sunday though, he also said that the prospect of the Democratic National Committee using heavy-handed tactics to prevent fair competition in the presidential primary might also be a factor.
“I am a committed lifelong Democrat that believes deeply that I should pursue the process that is in place that is afforded to people who are willing to do so. And I intend to take it all the way through the convention,” he said. “But I am seeing the DNC employ practices that are not just anti-democratic, but I think despicable and dangerous and maybe even illegal. So if they are going to deny the opportunity to have a competition, I will keep going.”
Earlier on in the Q&A session, Phillips cited the case of the DNC asking the New Hampshire Democratic Party to instruct registered Democrats in the state that the primary is “meaningless.” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella (R) responded by issuing the national party body a cease-and-desist letter, claiming that the request “constitutes an attempt to prevent or deter New Hampshire voters” from participating in the primary.
Biden will not be on the ballot in New Hampshire because the DNC, at his behest, took away the state’s first-in-the-nation status in an effort to bring more racial diversity to the early nominating contests. New Hampshire’s Republican-controlled legislature refused to move the date of its primaries though, allowing Phillips to run without Biden on the ballot. Biden’s loyalists are instead running a well-funded campaign to get Democrats to write Biden in as a show of strength against Phillips, whose central tenet for running is that polling shows Biden losing against Trump.
A recent poll showed Phillips trailing Biden 58% to 28% in the Democratic primary, though the poll did not account for the relative difficulty of remembering to write Biden in.
Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), seen here campaigning in Nashua on Saturday, is hoping to take advantage of President Joe Biden's absence from the ballot in New Hampshire.
Phillips has strong ties to No Labels as a member of the group’s moderate, bipartisan bloc in Congress, the Problem Solvers Caucus.
Democrats across the spectrum, including the moderate group Third Way, have gone on the warpath against No Labels’ threat of a third-party candidacy on the grounds that it would threaten Biden’s shot at the White House. These critics argue that a moderate compromise candidate of some kind would invariably take more votes from Biden than from Trump, who enjoys a loyal following and currently attracts little support from moderate voters.
No Labels is struggling mightily to obtain ballot access in all 50 states, but last week it asked the Department of Justice to investigate efforts by Democrats to interfere with its efforts to get on the ballot. Also last week, the group’s founding chairman, former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), dangled the possibility of nominating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as their presidential candidate if she falls short in her bid for the Republican nomination. Haley’s campaign immediately dismissed the idea by saying that she has “no interest in No Labels.”
Phillips defended the group by noting that it only plans to run its own presidential ticket if Biden and Trump are the two major parties’ respective presidential nominees.
“If you vote for me and we start this thing with a huge shocker, we won’t have to worry about third-party candidates, because you know what? No Labels is only going to activate if it is a Biden and Trump matchup. So vote for me, let’s end [the] conversation about it!” he said, eliciting applause from the crowd of more than 50 people who assembled to see him.

Dems aren't happy.,"Lauren Villagran, Deborah Barfield Berry, Trevor Hughes and Terry Collins, USA TODAY","Updated January 23, 2024 at 3:13 AM·11 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/texas-gov-transforms-immigration-border-100459476.html,"DENVER – When elementary school teacher Kristine Wussow began hearing about migrants being bused to her city by Texas with no support, she rushed to collect donations.
On a recent day in January, Wussow, 50, and other volunteers handed out clothing, cookies and homemade baked ziti to Venezuelan migrants staying at a hotel-turned-shelter on the city’s east side.
Her heart broke, she said, seeing families living in tents in the cold. But she also worried whether the local generosity would dry up.
“When I reached out to my neighborhood, people poured out help. But if these folks were living in our actual neighborhood? I can see how that would be different,"" she said. ""One woman who lives here in this neighborhood, she told us her neighbors are angry. They don’t want to help.""
While Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, promote hard-line border policies in stump speeches and news conferences, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has effectively exported the border – and all the problems that come with it – to America's backyards.
Americans who once watched humanitarian crises with pity or disdain from afar now are seeing it close up.
More than half of Americans in a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll this month said they support the idea of sending troops to the southern border and ordering the mass deportation of illegal immigrants. Only 43% said they opposed both, and 4% were undecided.
Abbott's controversial migrant busing program crossed a threshold this month: Operation Lone Star has bused more than 100,000 migrants from the Texas border to Washington, New York, Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
Democratic leaders of the cities Abbott has targeted are pushing back against what they say are his “cruel” tactics. But they’re also complaining about too many immigrants arriving in their communities.
Last Sunday, Illinois Gov. JB Prizker took out a full-page ad in the Austin-American Statesman pleading for Abbott to temporarily halt the migrant busing, noting the cold weather blanketing the nation.
""This is not sustainable,"" Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said a few days earlier, noting that his city was now spending 10% of its annual budget on emergency housing and other migrant services.
""Gov. Abbott has made it clear he wants to destabilize cities, sending thousands of migrants and asylum seekers here,"" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who recently sued the bus companies that have been delivering migrants to his city's doorstep.
Meanwhile, the buses have kept coming.
""You can applaud Abbott for having won the narrative war,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""He opened these salvos and he has had the last word. But he doesn’t deserve a standing ovation. He is doing it for politics.""
Abbott contends Texas is engaging in a ""historic border security effort"" and shouldn't bear the full cost of assisting migrants, even as the state spends millions of dollars on the busing program. His press office didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
To make his point, he has pushed the bar for hard-line tactics at the border to extremes and has made Texas the go-to state for Republicans hoping to burnish their border security credentials in an election year. Abbott recently told a conservative talk radio host that Texas is ""using every tool"" from building border barriers to enacting a state law making it a crime to cross the Texas-Mexico border illegally.
""The only thing that we're not doing is we're not shooting people who come across the border, because, of course, the Biden administration would charge us with murder,"" Abbott told the host. The three-term Republican governor later said no one should misconstrue his remarks to mean that migrants trying to cross the Rio Grande should be shot.

This month, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., held a news conference in Eagle Pass, Texas, flanked by more than 60 Republican members of Congress.
Out-of-state sheriffs have been loaning their deputies to patrol Texas border counties. The governors of at least 14 states – including those crucial to the 2024 presidential election such as Florida, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina – have sent Texas their personnel and resources or deployed their own National Guard troops to Texas.
Federal and Texas officials are locked in a legal dispute about who has jurisdiction over border territories and how much leeway the state has to deter migrants. The federal government went to court last summer to stop the state from placing buoys in the Rio Grande, and the two have been legally sparring ever since.
In the latest disagreement, federal officials accused the state of blocking its access to a park where it had set up a staging area to search for migrants, which contributed to the deaths this month of a woman and two children who drowned while trying to cross the river.
Domingo Garcia was in Washington, D.C., for a meeting in September 2022 when he got a call that two buses chartered by Texas had left dozens of migrants near the home of Vice President Kamala Harris.
He and his staff at the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization, rushed to the neighborhood to find more than 100 men, women and children huddled on the sidewalk, disoriented. They had no food, no money.
“It was such a cruel political act,"" said Garcia, president of the organization. At the time, Abbott said he deliberately orchestrated the drop-off to provoke a response from the administration and pledged to continue sending buses ""until President Biden and Border Czar Harris step up and do their jobs to secure the border.""
Texas border communities were then struggling to shelter thousands of Venezuelan migrants who − unlike many other migrant groups with ties to friends and family − were arriving without resources or a sponsor in the U.S.
Border nonprofits have traditionally helped move migrants to cities across the U.S. by organizing directly with churches and shelters – without creating humanitarian disasters.
But the governor’s decision early on to deliver buses to the Fox News headquarters in New York and to the Harris residence in Washington drew criticism for political grandstanding, as did his unwillingness to give a heads-up about the arrivals to the mayors of the Democrat-led cities he targeted.
In Denver, where officials say they've received 2½ times the number of migrants per capita overall than any other receiving city, the mayor projects spending 10% of the entire annual budget aiding migrants this year.
About 36,000 migrants have arrived in Denver over the past year; Abbott's Operation Lone Star transported about 15,700 of them, according to Texas data.
Juan Carlo Pioltelli, 32, arrived from El Paso, Texas, in December with his partner and their daughter and lived in an illegal encampment for a week.
“When you come here, you want the American dream,” said Pioltelli, a Peruvian migrant who said he was uncertain who paid for their 600-mile bus trip.“The guards in Texas told me that you can go to Denver and it would be good, but when we got here it was different,” he said, shivering in the below-freezing air. “All these people, all we want is to work.”
In order to work, though, the migrants must receive federal permits.
Pioltelli and his family came without work permission or the contacts other more established immigrant groups have historically relied on to get jobs.
Denver city officials earlier this month evicted about 300 migrants living in an unsanctioned tent city near downtown. But on the same day they relocated those migrants to more adequate shelter, another 300 arrived on buses from the border.
""If they arrive and are here for three months or six months or two years and can never work, we're going to need endless amounts of federal support for those individuals,"" Johnston said. And not only do they not want that, we don't want that. They just want to support themselves.""
Federal officials have been trying to speed the process of granting work authorization to migrants, who sometimes have to wait up to five years for a hearing to determine whether they can remain in the United States. Late last year, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reported it had granted about 5,000 temporary work authorizations in about four months.
Lacking money and resources, many of the migrants have been living in illegal, unsanitary tent cities like the one Pioltelli lived in for a week.
Johnston called for the nation's 100 largest cities to develop a system to accept, process and assist migrants similar to the comprehensive federal system used for refugees from Syria and Somalia.
New York City has had the most enduring public fight with Abbott over the state's migrant busing operation.
With the densest population in the U.S. and overseeing the largest number of migrants bused by Texas, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said he’s proud that New Yorkers have done their best to provide for migrants despite receiving little support from the federal government.
But, Levine, a Democrat, said New York has placed more than 68,000 in some sort of shelter, including 20,000 Manhattan hotel rooms.
“You know the saying, ‘As New York goes, so goes the country,'” Levine said. “But we are fending for ourselves as more migrants are arriving and staying in shelters than leaving. This is going to weigh heavily on voters' minds.”
Rafael Collazo, executive director of the UnidosUS Action Fund, a Latino advocacy group, said Democrats need to counter narratives that immigrants are a cause of the nation’s economic and cultural problems.
“It only becomes a winning issue for a right-wing agenda if we allow that and their rhetoric goes unchecked,” Collazo said.
He said Democrats and advocates aren’t pushing aggressively enough to accuse Abbott of using people as political pawns.
“Some of the shenanigans are working for them in the moment as it relates to dealing with their real hardcore MAGA base,’’ Collazo said. “But it's still a very open question if it'll work for them in a general election.”
Meanwhile, Collazo said, local organizations providing support to migrants are frustrated because they don’t have enough resources.
“This is work that they’re built to do,"" he said, but they are feeling the same strain as local governments.
Collazo said it’s incumbent upon Democrats “to have the courage to be honest with the American people and say the source of your economic stress is not undocumented refugees that are seeking asylum.’’
The country's population would shrink in 2024 if it weren't for immigration, according to the Census Bureau. Economists say population growth is essential to grow the economy and shore up a labor market that has nearly 9 million reported job openings, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Many immigrants rights were established during the civil rights era, when leaders tried to establish a more fair and less racist immigration system, said U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, a Democrat from Texas. Those need to be improved now, but the country shouldn't go back to the days of scapegoating immigrants, he said.
“It's the oldest trick in the book to essentially blame our problems on the poor or the sick or those folks that are fleeing violence or those people that don't have a right to vote,’’ Casar said.
Casar said Abbott's approach, which he compared to that of George Wallace, a former Alabama governor and 1960s segregationist, could spark a backlash in an increasingly diverse Texas.
""I think by trying to play to his mostly anti-immigrant base, I think Greg Abbott will still continue to accelerate political problems for himself.’’
Two years after the dropoff ""stunt"" at the Harris residence in Washington, Garcia, from the League of United Latin American Citizens, said Abbott's tactics still stand out.
He said he hadn’t seen such ploys in his 50 years of civil rights work, particularly where a politician would “use refugees, Christians as political piñatas to be bashed and used and thrown away like what we're seeing with this group of Republican leaders.”
“You would think that somebody at their church would tell them, ‘'This is not what Jesus would do,’"" he said.
Garcia complained that both sides have fallen short on addressing the problem, saying Democrats need to establish a legalization process.
“The campaign team and the administration have kind of been asleep at the wheel as the humanitarian immigration crisis has continued to build over the course of the last year,’’ he said. “And unfortunately, the Republicans have turned a humanitarian crisis into an opportunity for fearmongering, scapegoating and creating a whole presidential campaign over the fear of the other.’’
Wussow, the Denver school teacher, said she worries the influx of migrants, and the challenges they're placing on local services, could harden the hearts of independent voters who now cannot avoid seeing the problem firsthand.
“I’m going to be optimistic and hope that people will see these are all humans with needs, and hope for the best.""

2340,CK52WINRRT_KTB0TOIQXWP8TLZ,Is Kim Jong Un Really Planning an Attack This Time?,Choe Sang-Hun,"January 22, 2024 at 1:57 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/kim-jong-un-really-planning-165729036.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired hundreds of artillery shells in waters near South Korean border islands on Jan. 5. Last week, it said it no longer regarded the South as inhabited by “fellow countrymen” but as a “hostile state” it would subjugate through a nuclear war. On Friday, it said it had tested an underwater nuclear drone to help repel U.S. Navy fleets.
That new drumbeat of threats, while the United States and its allies have been preoccupied with the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, has set foreign officials and analysts wondering whether the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un, has moved beyond posturing and is planning to assert more military force.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
For decades, a central part of the North Korean playbook has been to stage carefully measured and timed military provocations — some aimed at tightening internal discipline, others at demanding attention from its neighbors and the United States, or all of that at once.
But to several close watchers of North Korea, the latest round of signals from Kim feels different. Some are taking it as a clue that the North has become disillusioned with seeking diplomatic engagement with the West, and a few are raising the possibility that the country could be planning a sudden assault on South Korea.
Two veteran analysts of North Korea — former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker — sounded an alarm this past week in an article for the U.S.-based website 38 North, asserting that Kim was done with mere threats. “Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,” they wrote.
Analysts broadly agree that North Korea has been shifting its posture in recent years, compelled by an accumulation of both internal problems, including a moribund economy and food and oil shortages, and frustrations in its external diplomacy, like Kim’s failure to win an end to international sanctions through direct diplomacy with former President Donald Trump. And most agree that the North’s recent closeness with Russia, including supplying artillery shells and missiles for use in Russia’s war in Ukraine, will be a game-changer in some way.
But there is still stark disagreement over where Kim’s new tack might be leading.
Many say that Kim’s ultimate goal remains not a war with South Korea, a treaty ally of the United States, but Washington’s acceptance of his country as a nuclear power by prompting arms-reduction talks.
“The North Koreans won’t start a war unless they decide to become suicidal; they know too well that they cannot win the war,” said Park Won-gon, a North Korea expert at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “But they would love their enemies to believe that they could, because that could lead to engagement and possible concessions, like the easing of sanctions.”
Analysts in China, North Korea’s most vital ally, were also deeply skeptical that Kim would go to war unless the North were attacked. Professor Shi Yinhong, at Renmin University in Beijing, asserted that the North’s leadership, not being irrational, ultimately acted out of self-preservation — and that starting a war would work against that goal.
Others noted that the North could assert itself militarily, including through smaller conventional strikes and bolder weapons testing, without necessarily triggering a deadly response.
“There are many rungs of the escalation ladder that North Korea can climb short of all-out war,” said Victor Cha, a Korea expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Kim is not that confident in his capabilities to deter U.S. reaction if he were to do something rash.”
If Kim wants to climb that ladder, recent history suggests that this might be the time.
North Korea has liked to unsettle its enemies at their most sensitive political moments, and both the United States and South Korea are holding elections this year. The North launched a long-range rocket in late 2012, between the U.S. and South Korean presidential elections. It conducted a nuclear test shortly before the inauguration of a South Korean leader in 2013. In 2016, it conducted another nuclear test two months before the U.S. presidential election.
North Korea could also attempt provocations in the coming weeks to try to help liberals who favor inter-Korean negotiations win parliamentary elections in South Korea in April, said analyst Ko Jae-hong at the Seoul-based Institute for National Security Strategy. Through provocations, North Korea hopes to spread fears among South Korean voters that increasing pressure on the North, as the current administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol has tried to do, might “lead to a nuclear war,” he said.
North Korea “will continue to increase tensions until after the U.S. elections,” said Thomas Schäfer, a former German diplomat who served twice as ambassador to North Korea. But “at the height of tensions, it will finally be willing to reengage with a Republican administration in the hope to get sanctions relief, some sort of acceptance of their nuclear program, and — as main objective — a reduction or even complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula,” Schäfer said in a rebuttal to Carlin’s and Hecker’s analysis.
Since Kim came to power in 2011, he has committed to building North Korea’s nuclear capability, using it both as a deterrent and as a negotiating tool to try to win concessions from Washington, like the removal of U.N. sanctions, to achieve economic growth.
He tried it when he met Trump in 2018 and again in 2019. It failed spectacularly, and Kim returned home empty-handed and in humiliation.
He then vowed to find a “new way” for his country.
Since then, the North has rejected repeated calls from Washington for talks. It has also rejected South Korea as a dialogue partner, indicating from 2022 that it would use nuclear weapons against South Korea in a war and abandoning its long-held insistence that the weapons would keep the Korean Peninsula peaceful as a deterrent. It has tested more diverse, and harder-to-intercept, means of delivering its nuclear warheads.
There is doubt that the North has yet built a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that could target the United States. But two of the North’s main enemies, South Korea and Japan, are much closer.
On the diplomatic front, Kim has taken pains to signal that he no longer views the United States as a critical negotiating partner, instead envisioning a “neo-Cold War” in which the United States is in retreat globally. He has aggressively improved military ties with Russia, and in return has most likely secured Russian promises of food aid and technological help for his weapons programs, officials say.
“I worry that his confidence might lead him to misjudge with a small act, regardless of his intention, escalating to war amid a tense ‘power-for-power’ confrontation with the United States and its allies,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
Despite its own increasingly aggressive military posture in recent years, China may prove to be a damper on any North Korean military adventurism.
China and North Korea are bound by a treaty signed in 1961 that requires each country to provide military assistance if the other is attacked. But China has little incentive to be drawn into a war in Korea right now.
“A war on the Korean Peninsula would be disastrous for Beijing. An entire half-century of peace in East Asia, a period of unprecedented growth for the PRC, would come to a crashing halt,” said John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to the People’s Republic of China.
The United States has long leaned on Beijing to rein in North Korea. By drawing close to Moscow, Kim has been putting his own pressure on China’s leader, Xi Jinping.
“It is notable that Kim made his first post-pandemic trip to the Russian Far East, skipping China, and he just sent his foreign minister to Moscow, not Beijing,” Delury said. By raising tensions, Kim “can see what Xi is willing to do to placate him,” he added.

2354,D5HDWI68Z6_PEAVGZOX5O1DARN,Trump goes all in on attacking Nikki Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,"Gregory Krieg, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 11:29 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-goes-attacking-nikki-haley-032835928.html,"Former President Donald Trump spent the three-year anniversary of his White House departure trying to sweep away the few remaining Republican obstacles to his third consecutive nomination, hammering former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and warning supporters against complacency two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester, “because we have to send real unity as a message.”
But over more than 90 minutes, Trump delivered the vengeful message that he has made the focus of his campaign, moaning about the lost 2020 race; defending the January 6, 2021, rioters; pushing again for the Supreme Court to declare him and all presidents immune from prosecution; mocking President Joe Biden; and, with the most gusto, lashing out at Haley, his former UN ambassador and the candidate closest to him in Granite State primary polls.
Even before he spoke, Trump’s campaign beamed its message on a big screen above the stage with rotating slides attacking Haley over supposed ties to “Democrats, Wall Street & Globalists” and her positions on Social Security and other hot-button issues.
When he took the microphone, Trump kept up the barrage.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to run the radical Democratic campaign operation she’s running,” Trump said, referencing his rival’s appeal to some centrist and anti-Trump political groups and donors. “What the hell kind of Republican candidate is that?”
After running through a laundry list of policy criticisms, most pointedly Haley’s campaign pledge to raise the retirement age for younger people, delaying their access to Social Security payments, Trump jabbed back at Haley over her suggestion that he is too old to be president again – which followed an incident in which Trump confused her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it,” Haley, 52, said earlier Saturday of Trump, 77, at a rally in Keene, New Hampshire.
Trump shot back at the rally, claiming he’s recently taken a “cognitive test,” which he “aced,” before promising to “let you know when I go bad.”
After finishing third in Iowa behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley’s campaign is on the line in New Hampshire. A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters there support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley has the support of a majority — 58% — of registered undeclared voters, but the former president is backed by 67% of registered Republicans.
Granite State voting rules — and their potential to help Haley — were a frequent target for Trump on Saturday night, as the former president groused over the potential for those who don’t consider themselves Republicans or typically vote for the GOP to cast ballots in its presidential primary.
But he added a false flourish to that case, telling the audience that Democrats, too, can take part on the Republican contest. They cannot.
“Registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary, and registered Republicans cannot vote in the Democratic primary,” New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan told CNN earlier this week after Trump leveled a similar charge.
Trump also looked ahead to the next major clash in the race: South Carolina. It’s Haley’s home state, where she was twice elected governor, but Trump leads there in the polls and among influential GOP leaders – a handful of whom showed up in New Hampshire.
“We could be in our home state, but we chose to come up to New Hampshire for a reason,” Rep. Russell Fry said. Gov. Henry McMaster invoked the Spice Girls – really – to tell voters “what we want, what we really really want” is Trump.
“We’re going to be there in three weeks, so you know what I’m doing,” Trump said of his guests, adding, “I’m kissing ass.”
Again, it was Trump’s desires that took centerstage.
He repeated his contention that all US presidents, beginning with him, should have immunity from prosecution. This relatively new line of argument comes as Trump awaits a ruling from a federal appeals court regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In the meantime, he’s argued presidents should never face legal consequences for their actions.
The court hearing the claim has expressed skepticism, but Trump is continuing to make his case in public. On Saturday night, he invoked President Harry Truman’s use of the nuclear bomb in Japan in 1945 as a case study.
“Look at Harry Truman,” Trump said. “He wouldn’t have done, if you think Hiroshima, not exactly a nice act but it did end the Second World War probably, right? Nagasaki. He wouldn’t be doing that; he said, ‘I don’t want to do that because my opponents will indict me.’”
The US dropped atomic bombs on both cities toward the end of the war, killing at least 150,000 in Hiroshima alone, according to some estimates. Though the morality of the decision has been debated, no one sought to bring legal charges against Truman.
Trump had much less to say about DeSantis. He even made a point of noting how little he’d spoken about the Florida governor (before proceeding to mock his height at the prompting of a supporter). He had more kind words, though, for Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban.
“It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” Trump said of the strongman, happily reciting the nice things that Orban has recently said about him.

Hutchinson is a conservative whose opposition to Trump became central in his longshot bid for the GOP primary before he dropped out Tuesday.
White House calls Hutchinson to apologize after mocking DNC statement
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Hutchinson said: “Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.”
Hutchinson added: “Go @NikkiHaley in New Hampshire.”
Haley’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
After finishing third in the leadoff contest in Iowa earlier this month, Haley has been looking to appeal to independent and unaffiliated voters in New Hampshire’s Jan. 23 primary to garner a strong finish and turn the race against Trump into a two-person contest.
Hutchinson dropped out after finishing sixth in the caucuses.
His backing comes a day after another of their former rivals in the GOP presidential contest, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, endorsed Trump. Another former candidate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also backed Trump.

“Nikki Haley, I know well. Sadly, she’s made an unholy alliance with the RHINOS, the never-Trumpers … the globalists, the radical left communists,” Trump said, slamming the former U.N. ambassador while he was surrounded by roughly 5,000 supporters who stood outside in 14-degree weather to see him.
In recent days, Trump has been hurling insults at Haley, who has been steadily closing the gap in New Hampshire. In the past two months, she cut Trump’s lead in the state by half. Trump has an 11 percent lead in the Granite State, according to The Hill and Decision Desk HQ’s polling average. Two months ago, he had a 22-point lead.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to fund the radical Democrat campaign operation that she’s running,” Trump told supporters during the Saturday rally.
In an effort to especially irk Haley, Trump invited several politicians from her home state, including Gov. Henry McMaster (R), to join him on stage.
“Almost every politician from the state of South Carolina is endorsing me,” Trump said as a slight to Haley, who is a former governor of the state. South Carolina is also next major contest after New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary.
In addition to the Palmetto State politicians on stage, Trump also secured the endorsement of her home state’s senator, Tim Scott (R-S.C.), on Friday. Haley nominated Scott to the Senate when she was governor and lobbied for his endorsement when he dropped out of the 2024 GOP presidential race.
These attacks haven’t been one-sided. Haley has dropped her reluctance to criticize her former boss and has ramped up attacks on the former president in recent days.
“The reality is who lost the House for us? Who lost the Senate? Who lost the White House? Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump,” Haley said Thursday.
Tuesday’s primary is a critical moment for both Haley and Trump. If Haley can pull off a win — or a close second-place finish — in the Granite State, it could threaten Trump’s front-runner status for the GOP presidential nomination.

Ron DeSantis, who suspended his campaign Sunday, as the former president said he would no longer call the governor by the mocking nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious.""
The brief note Sunday followed in the the governor's announcement. The statement read: ""With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates.""
Trump's campaign added that ""it is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump."" At the moment, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley remains the only one of the initial close-to-a-dozen Republicans who sought the GOP nomination remaining as a challenger to Trump.
Later, while speaking in Rochester, N.H., Trump ""congratulated"" the governor and complimented Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.
""He ran a really good campaign. I will tell you it's not easy,"" Trump told those attending his rally. ""But as you know, he left the campaign trail today, at 3 p.m., and in so doing he was very gracious and he endorsed me. I appreciate that. And I also look forward with Ron and everybody else to defeat Crooked Joe Biden.""
Earlier, Trump told a crowd that the derisive nickname ""DeSanctimonious"" was now ""officially retired"" to loud cheers.
DeSantis' fake Churchill quote: Did he quote a Budweiser ad when he dropped out of the race?
One Florida ally of DeSantis immediately called for unity around Trump's candidacy.
""As Republicans we must all rally behind President Donald J. Trump. Let’s stop the infighting and unite behind a strong leader that will turn this country around!"" wrote a post by state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican and former chairman of the Florida Republican GOP.
Commentary from Trump's supporters ranged from appreciative to gracious to taunting.
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, who endorsed Trump last November, posted: ""Florida is all in for President Trump!""
U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Pensacola Republican who is one of Trump's most vocal backers on Capitol Hill, shared on social media a photo of himself with DeSantis and simply the words ""thank you.""

Taylor Budowich, CEO of Make America Great Again Inc., praised DeSantis saying he ""made the right decision today to drop out and get behind President Donald Trump.""
Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles, a former DeSantis campaign aide, responded to a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, foreshadowing his departure from the race saying ""Bye, bye.""
Trump's campaign took aim at Haley, who served as U.N. ambassador in Trump's administration in its statement saying ""Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement.""
The muted response to DeSantis' exit from the 2024 race was a sharp contrast to more than a year's worth of savaging of the governor by the former president.
Trump dubbed DeSantis as ""DeSanctimonious"" in November 2022, just days before that year's midterm elections and as Trump readied to announce his 2024 presidential comeback campaign. Trump took on blowback for ridiculing his one-time political ally, who won a decisive reelection that fall, and the former president shelved his attacks until early 2023.
It was then that Trump began unleashing fierce salvos singularly aimed at DeSantis, who did not officially enter the race until May, despite what by the spring of last year was a broad field of other suitors for the Republican nomination.
In a speech in West Palm Beach last February, Trump rolled out an early attack strategy in vowing that ""under no circumstances will we allow anyone to cut Medicare or Social Security for our nation."" In April, Trump's team fired off an ad ridiculing the governor, this one mocking DeSantis' purported habit of scooping pudding with his fingers.
In West Palm Beach, Trump spoke at the Turning Point USA summit and repeated what by then was a stump speech staple, claiming credit for DeSantis' initial gubernatorial win in 2018. As DeSantis' standing in the polls eroded precipitously, Trump raised the intensity of the withering attacks.
Speaking to the Club 47, a Trump fan club, the former president issued this warning last fall to the governor about his political future.
""I think he blew it for in four years. You never know what's going to happen, but in '28, I don't see it happening,"" Trump said to a crowd of supporters. ""I can never forget because that's such great disloyalty.""
After winning the Iowa caucus Jan. 15, Trump seemed to give both DeSantis and Haley an off-ramp by congratulating them in what was a seemingly uncharacteristic call for reconciliation and unity.
When DeSantis didn't drop out after Trump decisively won the caucus, the former president again turned up the heat. In a post last week on his social media platform, Trump called DeSantis ""very flawed"" and said he is ""out of money"" and ""out of hope.""

""There is a great man, a great leader in Europe — Viktor Orban,"" Trump said, recalling how Orban praised him.
“He is the Prime Minister of Hungary. He is a very great leader, a very strong man. Some people don't like him because he's too strong.”

Since the beginning of Russia's major invasion, Orban has repeatedly made anti-Ukrainian statements. Budapest does not support Kyiv with weapons and blocks EU financial aid. On Oct. 17, 2023, Orban personally met with Vladimir Putin in China, and after criticizing the EU and the United States, he said he was ""proud"" of the meeting.
As the 45th U.S. President faced criminal charges, the Hungarian Prime Minister publicly supported him. More recently, he congratulated Trump on his victory after the first Republican caucuses in Iowa.

2402,FDO9OOWIH4_3A7PJGJ7FWKZMZW,New Hampshire Republican primary – what to expect and what it can tell us,Joan E Greve,"January 23, 2024 at 4:15 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-republican-primary-expect-tell-130029018.html,"New Hampshire voters are headed to the polls on Tuesday. After Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the Iowa caucus last week, his top rival for the Republican nomination – the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley – hopes to make a splash in the critical primary state.
But the Republican primary is not the only contest being held in New Hampshire on Tuesday. New Hampshire Democrats are moving forward with their own primary, one with a major asterisk: Joe Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot as the Democratic National Committee has said that the New Hampshire primary is “meaningless” after party officials moved to make South Carolina the first voting state.
Here is everything you need to know about the New Hampshire primary:
New Hampshire will hold the first primary election of the 2024 election cycle, while Iowa held the first caucuses of the Republican nominating contest. In a caucus, each voter is required to appear in person at a specific precinct location to cast a ballot, as the Guardian’s Martin Pengelly explained earlier this month.
A primary is much more straightforward, with polling locations across the state open for a set number of hours to allow voters to cast their ballots. Because of the relative ease of voting and the option for undeclared voters to participate in either party’s primary, New Hampshire generally sees higher turnout than Iowa.
In 2020, roughly 176,000 Iowans participated in the Democratic caucuses, while nearly 300,000 New Hampshire voters participated in the Democratic primary. The turnout gap is particularly notable considering Iowa’s population is more than twice the size of New Hampshire’s.
Two dozen candidates filed the necessary paperwork to appear on the Republican primary ballot in New Hampshire, but the overwhelming majority of votes are expected to be cast for Haley and Trump.
DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, just two days before the primary, after it was clear the downward trajectory of his campaign could not be revived in New Hampshire. He joined other candidates who had ended their presidential bids.
After their disappointing performances in Iowa, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson both dropped out of the Republican primary. Their names will still appear on the ballot, as will the names of other former candidates like the former vice-president Mike Pence and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott.

Yes, but it’s complicated. The Democratic National Committee voted last year to designate South Carolina as the party’s first primary state moving forward, while New Hampshire would have the opportunity to vote second.
The decision outraged New Hampshire Democrats, who insist they will not go along with the national party’s plan to rob them of their “first-in-the-nation” status. As a result, the New Hampshire Democratic party decided to hold its primary the same day as the Republican primary in defiance of the DNC’s decision.
The DNC has criticized the New Hampshire primary as a sham, calling on the state party to “educate the public” that the contest “is a non-binding presidential preference event and is meaningless”. The New Hampshire attorney general, Republican John Formella, in turn sent a cease-and-desist letter to the DNC to compel the organization to stop making “false, deceptive and misleading” claims about the primary.
Because of the standoff, Biden’s name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, although many Democrats still plan to vote for him as a write-in candidate. Other long-shot candidates, including Minnesota congresswoman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson, will appear on the ballot and hope to capitalize on New Hampshire Democrats’ frustration with the change in the voting calendar.

Voters who are registered as a Democrat or a Republican may only vote in their party’s primary, but undeclared voters may choose to participate in either primary. There are already indications that Democrats and independents in New Hampshire plan to participate in the more competitive Republican primary, as thousands of voters changed their registration leading up to the deadline in October.
The presence of independent and Democratic voters in the Republican primary could dramatically affect the results. Haley in particular hopes that she can sway enough of those voters to chip away at Trump’s advantage with more hard-right Republicans.
Polls show that Trump remains well ahead of Haley in New Hampshire, although Haley has significantly narrowed the former president’s lead in recent weeks. According to the FiveThirtyEight average of New Hampshire polls, Trump is about 13 points ahead of Haley, but he was leading by 25 points last month.
Even though she finished third in Iowa, Haley had presumptively made the argument that the primary was “a two-person race” between her and Trump because of DeSantis’s low polling numbers in New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary late next month. After DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, Haley faces a new opportunity to consolidate the support of non-Trump voters and overtake the former president. But as the results of the Iowa caucuses showed, there may not be enough non-Trump voters left in the Republican party for Haley to pull off an upset.
New Hampshire is generally whiter, older and wealthier than the rest of the nation. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, 90.5% of New Hampshire’s voting-age residents identify as only white, compared with 67.1% of all American adults who identify as such. Only 1.1% of New Hampshire residents over 18 identify as Black and 3.1% identify as Hispanic, while 12.3% of all American adults identify as Black and 14% identify as Hispanic.
New Hampshire also has a higher share of citizens over the age of 65, with 25% of its adult residents in that age bracket compared with 23.2% of all American adults. The median age of all New Hampshire residents is 43.3, which is older than the 39.0 median age for all Americans.
In terms of household wealth, 7.2% of New Hampshire adults report an income that falls below the poverty level, compared with 11.1% of all Americans whose incomes fall below that level. And while 94.1% of New Hampshire’s adult residents have at least a high school degree, 91.3% of all Americans over 18 can say the same.
Because of the demographics of New Hampshire, a number of critics have challenged the state’s early voting status. In its move to push the New Hampshire primary to a later date, the Democratic National Committee cited the racial diversity of other early states like South Carolina and Nevada to justify their prioritization in the voting calendar.
“This calendar looks like the Democratic Party, and it reflects the diversity of America,” the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, said last year.

2404,FESVFWXCD7_B7IS59S7QAOZB5V,Adam Kinzinger: Cast your vote in the Republican NH primary in support of democracy,Adam Kinzinger,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 10:37 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/adam-kinzinger-cast-vote-republican-102054304.html,"Three years ago, if you had told me Donald Trump would be the frontrunner in the Republican primary, I would not have believed you. After witnessing his failure to uphold his oath of office, his unfulfilled campaign promises, the relentless turmoil during his presidency, his blatant disregard for our Constitution, his persistent and unfounded claims of election fraud, his impeachable offenses, and his numerous criminal acts, the thought would have seemed preposterous. At that time, I might have wagered that Trump would either be confined in a jail cell or isolated at Mar-A-Lago, with the Republican Party having decisively turned its back on him.
Yet, here we are again. Trump’s base has not moved on and continues to be consumed by a man who abuses their patriotism and mocks them behind their back. A disturbing number of so-called leaders continue to echo Trump’s lies — driven by weakness and a fear of retribution.
But there’s a silver lining. New Hampshire, known for its fierce independence, has the opportunity to take a stand. This is evident by the fact that the state has more registered Independents than Republicans or Democrats. And due to their open primary system, New Hampshire independents have the ability to vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary, making them uniquely positioned to swing the 2024 election.
Make no mistake: this Tuesday, democracy itself is on the ballot. To all the independents in New Hampshire, in the spirit of your state’s strong tradition of independence, I urge you to cast your vote in the Republican primary in support of democracy. You have the unique opportunity to cast an historic vote against the bitter forces that divide our country, and build a more united America. You have the chance to champion democracy, to defend its principles, and to celebrate our cherished democratic traditions and that fierce New Hampshire independence.
New Hampshire, I leave you with a challenge I posed three years ago, which resonates even more profoundly today. Will we prey on people’s fears, or draw upon their hopes? Will we feast on anger, or summon our better angels? Will we lead America forward and upward?
This rings as true today as it did then.
The future of America is unwritten. New Hampshire, your votes can significantly shape the trajectory of our nation’s future, perhaps more than ever in American history. Let’s show the country and the world that democracy, integrity, and the true spirit of New Hampshire remain strong. You know what to do.

2409,FO3REQIHQV_BZW7ZG38DOC6RJP,Ron DeSantis drops out of presidential race after campaign’s failure to launch,Katie Hawkinson,"January 22, 2024 at 5:39 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-presidential-race-201041031.html,"Ron DeSantis is suspending his 2024 presidential campaign, according to an announcement video posted on X.
“We don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,” Mr DeSantis said. “I’m proud to have delivered on 100% of my promises. I will not stop now.”
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”- Winston Churchill pic.twitter.com/ECoR8YeiMm

The Florida governor went on to endorse the former president for the nomination.
“I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic, and his elevation of Anthony Fauci,” he said. “Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden.”
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge,” he continued. “He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, or a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Meanwhile, Nikki Haley said Ron DeSantis “ran a great race” after receiving the news he had dropped out during a campaign event in New Hampshire.
“He’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” Ms Haley said at the Sunday afternoon event. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.”
The announcement comes just days ahead of the New Hampshire Republican primary, in which Mr DeSantis was polling in third place with single digits after winning second place in the Iowa Republican caucus. If Mr DeSantis received less than 10 per cent of the vote, as the polls are projecting, he would have been inelligble for any delegates per state primary rules.
The Florida governor’s campaign was plagued by challenges long before the primary season kicked off in Iowa.
Last month, Jeff Roe left his role as top adviser to Never Back Down, the super PAC backing the DeSantis campaign. The move came just hours after The Washington Post published a story about the internal disputes and suspicions between the PAC, the campaign and DeSantis’ allies.
NBC News also published an exclusive report on Sunday detailing the pitfalls of the DeSantis campaign.
“This thing blew up on the launch pad,” a former adviser to the governor told the outlet. “They had six months to get ready for very serious strategic questions, the most important of which was how to deal with Donald Trump. They had no answers. We are nine months in, and they still have not figured it out.”
Mr DeSantis also cancelled his Sunday media appearances ahead of this announcement, with press secretary Bryan Griffin claiming it was due to scheduling issues. The move prompted questions about the future of his campaign hours before Sunday afternoon’s confirmation.
The Independent has contacted the DeSantis campaign for additional comment.

According to a pool report obtained by Deadline, correspondent Vaughn Hillyard was informed “that if he was the designated pooler by NBC News that the pool would be cut off for the day.”

“After affirming to the campaign that your pooler would attend the events, NBC News was informed at about 2:20pmET that the pool would not be allowed to travel with Trump today,” the pool report stated.
It’s believed by sources at the network that the campaign refused to allow Hillyard in the pool because of his questions on Saturday to Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), a Trump surrogate, about the E. Jean Carroll case. A jury last year found Trump liable for sexual assault of Carroll and later defaming her, and a trial is currently taking place in New York largely to determine additional damages.
“Do you believe E. Jean Carroll?” Hillyard asked.
Stefanik said, “They are all witch hunts against Donald Trump and the reason is he is pulling ahead of Joe Biden.”
She seemed to be irritated by the question and added, “The media is so biased. This is just another example of the media being out of touch…”
Hillyard added, “It’s not me. It’s not the media, it’s a jury that found…”
Stefanik added, “The media is so out of touch with the American people. Like 2016, you are going to see the American people speak out loudly and clearly with their vote.”
Puck first reported on the Trump campaign’s restriction of Hillyard.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dean Phillips, D-Mn, blasted President Biden as ""unelectable and weak"" during a campaign event in New Hampshire, where Biden is set to skip the first Democratic presidential primary this week.
Phillips is challenging Biden in the Democratic primary, and New Hampshire represents his top opportunity. Biden chose to skip the state's primary entirely after New Hampshire declined to give up its first primary slot to South Carolina.
While Biden supporters are organizing a write-in campaign to prevent Phillips from securing a win, he still says he hopes to secure upward of 20% of the vote.
""Sadly it's going to demonstrate that our incumbent president is unelectable and weak and I think it's going to show this country that there's a candidate here who can actually do here what has been promised for generations,"" Phillips told reporters at a campaign event.

2427,GJCPA1Q5OL_C5HLKK1ZXV3RBYG,Nikki Haley Suggests Trump Is 'Not As Sharp' As He 'Used To Be' In Response To Jan. 6 Gaffe,Kelby Vera,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 5:30 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-suggests-trump-not-181801835.html,"Nikki Haley questioned Donald Trump’s mental fitness while campaigning in New Hampshire on Saturday, where she suggested the 77-year-old former president is “not as sharp” as he “used to be.”
Haley asked Republican voters to consider Trump’s age after he appeared to mix her up with Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a campaign speech in Concord, New Hampshire, on Friday.
Trump blamed his former ambassador to the United Nations for the Jan. 6 attacks, an accusation he’s repeatedly aimed at Pelosi, who was then speaker of the House.
“I wasn’t in D.C. on Jan. 6th,” said Haley, who left the Trump administration at the end of 2018. “I had nothing to do with the Capitol.”
Nikki Haley speaks to reporters after a campaign stop at the Monadnock Center for History & Culture on Saturday.
“It’s things like that,” she continued in footage from USA Today. “He said multiple times that he ran against President Obama. He didn’t run against President Obama. These things happen because, guess what? When you’re 80, that’s what happens. You’re just not as sharp as you used to be.”
New Hampshire governor and Haley supporter Chris Sununu echoed her concerns on “Meet the Press” Sunday, telling host Kristin Welker, “I mean, look, the point is you have two nearly 80-year-olds fighting this thing out.”
“That’s not what America wants. That is a great example of, this is not Donald Trump, the disruptor of 2016. This guy has lost his fastball.”
President Joe Biden broadcasted Haley’s remarks in a post on X on Sunday.
“I don’t agree with Nikki Haley on everything, but we agree on this much: She is not Nancy Pelosi,” Biden’s account posted along with video of Haley’s criticism intertwined with multiple Trump blunders.
Haley and allies’ attacks on Trump’s age comes as she aims for an upset in the New Hampshire primaries, which will be held on Tuesday.
On Sunday, CNN released a poll that showed Haley still trailing behind Trump in the Granite State. According to research conducted by the University of New Hampshire, Trump has the support of 50% of likely Republican primary voters while Haley holds 39%.

2448,HGDU0T6H4Y_QMWPUQZYLVTDNQH,CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire,"Jennifer Agiesta, CNN","January 22, 2024 at 6:50 AM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cnn-poll-trump-lead-over-140815664.html,"The race for the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary appears to be former President Donald Trump’s to lose, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire following Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa’s caucuses last week.
Trump holds 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stands at 39%. Both have gained supporters since the last CNN/UNH poll in early January – when Trump held 39% to Haley’s 32% – as the field of major contenders has shrunk. Both Trump and Haley now hold their highest level of support in UNH polling on the race since 2021. But Haley’s sharp gains since late last summer have not been enough to catch Trump, as the gap between them has once again widened to double digits.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president. He stood at just 6% in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
For Trump’s opponents, New Hampshire has long appeared to be the place in the early primary calendar that offered the best shot at knocking him off track in his bid for a third straight GOP presidential nomination. It was the only early state where polls consistently found Trump without majority support, and where voters often showed the most openness to his rivals. But this latest survey suggests that Trump’s popularity within the GOP base and the commitment of his supporters outweigh the appeal of his challengers.
New Hampshire’s traditional independent streak and more moderate pool of likely primary voters, when compared with other states whose nominating contests land ahead of Super Tuesday, are part of why some Trump rivals fixated on the state as the place to stand out. And Haley has won over those groups.
She holds 58% support among those who are registered as undeclared (New Hampshire’s term for independent voters) and plan to vote in the GOP primary, and 71% support among those who consider themselves ideologically moderate. She also stands ahead of Trump among voters who hold college degrees (50% Haley to 38% Trump). But each of these groups on its own makes up a minority of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire: 47% are registered undeclared, 33% are at least college graduates and just about 3 in 10 describe themselves as moderate.
Trump has largely consolidated his support among the larger flip sides of each of those groups. He has the backing of 67% of registered Republicans, 71% of conservatives and 55% of those who do not have a college degree. And among Trump’s supporters, 88% say they have definitely decided to support him compared with 74% of Haley supporters who are similarly locked in. That translates to 45% of the electorate being firmly decided Trump supporters, compared with just 30% who are equally decided Haley backers.
With just a few days to go before Tuesday’s primary, about 1 in 5 likely Republican primary voters overall say they have not yet locked in their choice. That group broadly backs Haley as of now: 51% support her, 28% supportTrump and 14% say they support DeSantis.
Broadly speaking, New Hampshire’s likely Republican primary voters expect Trump to win on Tuesday (70% say they think he will carry the day, though just 36% of Haley backers feel that way), and more say they would be satisfied were he to become the party’s presidential nominee than would feel that way about Haley or DeSantis (61% say they would be either enthusiastic or satisfied should Trump win the nomination, compared with 54% each saying the same about Haley or DeSantis).
And Trump continues to be viewed more favorably than either Haley or DeSantis within the primary electorate: 56% have a positive view of Trump, compared with 36% who feel that way about Haley and 28% about DeSantis. He is the only remaining candidate to have maintained a net positive favorability rating throughout the past year, while Haley ends the campaign for the Granite State in negative territory.
The state’s Republican primary electorate also has a broadly positive outlook on what Trump actually did as president. Looking back on his first term in office, 70% of likely Republican primary voters say that he did more to help the country than hurt it, while 28% say he did more to hurt and 2% that his time in office didn’t make much of a difference.
The survey asked whether Trump would attempt – and whether he would succeed at – six things he’s talked about doing during the campaign: building a wall along the US border with Mexico, appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” President Joe Biden and his family, dismantling the “deep state,” repealing Obamacare and replacing it with another health care law, bringing the war between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and reimposing a travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries.
Majorities in the GOP electorate say that if he wins, Trump would likely succeed in accomplishing four out of those six: building the wall (71% say he would definitely or probably succeed in doing so), ending the war between Ukraine and Russia (59%), reimposing the travel ban (56%) and appointing a prosecutor to go after the Biden family (53%). Far fewer see Trump as likely to succeed at dismantling the deep state (39%) or repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (34%).
Most New Hampshire residents agree with likely Republican voters that should Trump win the presidency, he is at least probably going to accomplish reimposing the travel ban (58%), appointing a special prosecutor to go after the Biden family (56%) and building the wall (52%). But there are deep partisan divisions in views on his prospects for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia; 71% of Republicans feel he will at least probably succeed in that effort, compared with 33% of independents and 8% of Democrats; 79% of Democrats say that Trump is unlikely to even try to bring the war to an end. And few of any partisan stripe feel he’s likely to repeal and replace the ACA (26% overall).
There is also a notable partisan divide over the chances that Trump will try or succeed in appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family. Nearly all Democrats think he will at least try (90%) compared with about two-thirds of independents and Republicans (63% each). Democrats are also most apt to say it is at least probable that he will succeed (64% say so), with only about half of Republicans (51%) or independents (47%) saying the same.
About two-thirds of likely primary voters on the Democratic side say they plan to write in Biden (63%). Biden did not file to be a candidate on the state’s primary ballot because the primary is in violation of the Democratic National Committee’s rules for the nomination process, but supporters have mounted a write-in effort on his behalf. Nearly all likely Democratic primary voters are aware of that effort; 91% said they had heard that Biden would not be on the ballot before taking the survey. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips holds 10% support in the poll, matching his high mark in CNN/UNH polling on the race, and author Marianne Williamson has 9% support, with 11% saying they would support someone else.
Nearly all Biden backers, 92%, say they have definitely decided to support him, compared with just 28% of those who are supporting another candidate. Most in the Democratic primary electorate say they would be at least satisfied with Biden as their party’s nominee (70% say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied), but enthusiasm for Biden among Democratic primary voters (31%) is lower than enthusiasm for Trump on the GOP side (46%).
Still, just 46% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that Biden would give the party its best chance to win in 2024, while 39% say someone else would give Democrats a better chance, and 15% say they’re not sure. There is little agreement among those who say someone else would be better around who that might be. Phillips is most frequently mentioned at 28%, but a wide range of other names also emerge.
Most likely Democratic primary voters say that in Biden’s time as president he has done more to help the country than hurt it (71% help, 16% hurt, 11% hasn’t made much difference).
But neither Biden nor Trump is seen by most New Hampshirites as helping the country during their respective presidencies. Overall, 55% of New Hampshire adults say that Trump hurt the country as president, and 51% say that Biden has. There isn’t much overlap between the two groups. Only 8% total say that both men did more to hurt than help, just 1% that both of them did more to help, 41% say that Trump helped and Biden hurt, 35% that Trump hurt and Biden helped, and 10% that Trump hurt while Biden hasn’t made much difference.
The CNN New Hampshire poll was conducted online January 16-19 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Results among the full sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults drawn from a probability-based panel have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. Likely Republican and Democratic primary voters were identified through survey questions about their intention to vote. Results among 1,210 likely Republican primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Results among 838 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

2464,HY9KBAMVZ0_VRDO3MAW5P5YNQW,Ron DeSantis drops out of Republican presidential race,Martin Pengelly in Washington and staff,"January 22, 2024 at 6:23 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-republican-presidential-201127388.html,"Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor of Florida, has ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsed Donald Trump.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said in a statement posted on X. “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
DeSantis’s withdrawal in the days ahead of the New Hampshire primary follows a disappointing result in the Iowa caucus, where he finished second place but trailed Donald Trump by a large margin. In New Hampshire, his numbers were far behind former South Carolina governor Haley and Trump.
On Sunday night, Donald Trump set aside months of criticism of DeSantis and celebrated his onetime rival as his newest supporter.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Trump said. “He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.”
“He’s been a good governor and I wish him well,” Haley said at a campaign event on Sunday. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.”
DeSantis’s news was the culmination of a long, agonising decline.

As recently as spring 2023, the former navy lawyer and rightwing congressman was widely seen as the Republican most likely to stop Trump becoming the nominee for a third election running, in large part by attempting to offer harsh Trumpist policies without the attendant drama.
In November 2022, DeSantis cruised past the Democrat Charlie Crist to win a second term in Tallahassee. In his victory speech, he crowed: “We have embraced freedom. We have maintained law and order. We have protected the rights of parents. We have respected our taxpayers and we reject ‘woke’ ideology.”
Referencing Winston Churchill, a near-mythic figure on the American right, he went on: “We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the schools, we fight the woke in the corporations. We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die.”
He received a rapturous reception, supporters with an eye on 2024 chanting “two more years” and the New York Post branding him “DeFuture”, as speculation abounded that Rupert Murdoch was finally set to move on from Trump.
But despite formidable fundraising, a seemingly strong campaign structure, strong polling and a rising Republican star in his wife, Casey DeSantis, after a long run-in to a formal campaign declaration, little went right.
DeSantis’s hard-right agenda ran into trouble as he chose to take on Disney, a dominant employer in Florida, over its opposition to his “don’t say gay” policy regarding LGBTQ+ issues in schools. Generating a string of stories, scandals and lawsuits over book bans in school libraries, the subject continued to dog the campaign.
In May the launch of that campaign, a Twitter Spaces session with Elon Musk, descended into farce as the platform glitched and buckled. The event host, the donor David Sacks, claimed: “We got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.” Few observers agreed.
On the campaign trail in the months that followed, the governor came across as stilted and awkward. For a campaign focused on social media and the influencers who lurk there, the resultant string of mocking memes and threads could not have been in the plan.
Nor could a summer fiasco over bizarre campaign videos, posted to social media and featuring far-right, white supremacist, Nazi and arguably homoerotic imagery. A firing followed but the campaign’s image had taken another big blow, reports of fundraising problems appearing.
There was a scandal over an attempt to change history teaching in state schools, regarding the place of slavery in Florida’s past. There were attempts to troll Democrats on immigration, including sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-run states by bus or plane. That policy ended up in the courts as well.
As the polling gap to Trump grew, and as the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley steadily moved through the field, DeSantis sought ways to fight back.
In November he took the unexpected step of debating a Democrat other than Joe Biden. The Fox News-hosted contest with Gavin Newsom, the California governor, proved little more than a sideshow. Brandishing a map he said showed the spread of “human faeces” on the streets of San Francisco, DeSantis succeeded only in feeding more “poop map” memes.
DeSantis and Haley became more willing to attack Trump as the first vote neared, if still with the gloves kept on, even Trump’s lie about a stolen election in 2020 proving hard to simply disown. In Iowa, DeSantis picked up key nominations from the governor, Kim Reynolds, and evangelical leaders and eventually finished in second. But that still didn’t catapult his campaign into safe New Hampshire territory, and he dropped out before the numbers could prove just how far behind he might be.
Democrats celebrated the news on Sunday.
“As Democrats, we’ve been shouting from the rooftops that his strategy of waging culture wars on the backs of hardworking Floridians just to further his own ambitions was wrong for the state & would be disastrous for the nation,” said Fentrice Driskell, the lead Democrat in the Florida state legislature on Twitter/X.
Sarafina Chitika, spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: “Just like Trump, DeSantis ran a campaign pledging to ban abortion nationwide, rip away access to healthcare, and gut Social Security and Medicare, while embracing election deniers and whitewashing January 6. Whichever candidate wins the race for the Maga base will be left running on the same dangerous and unpopular anti-freedom agenda that voters will reject in November.”
For its part, the New Hampshire electorate did not seem too shaken by his last-minute announcement.
Two hours before an event he had planned in New Hampshire, there were no signs of the DeSantis campaign or his fans at The Farm Bar and Grille. A member of staff said they had found out from news reports that DeSantis wouldn’t be coming and said he had not yet pre-paid for the space.
“Nope, I’m about to charge him right now.”

2469,I9K6GW10KD_AZAGTIW0XKUR9AX,Ron DeSantis drops out of presidential race and endorses Trump,Tony Diver,"January 22, 2024 at 6:34 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-presidential-race-213408745.html,"Ron DeSantis has withdrawn from the Republican primary race, leaving just Donald Trump and Nikki Haley battling for the nomination ahead of New Hampshire’s primary tomorrow.
The Florida governor said he did not have “a clear path to victory” and was suspending his campaign to endorse Donald Trump.
In a video posted on X, he said that while he had “had disagreements with Donald Trump”, he was “superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden”.
“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear,” he said.
“Following our second place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward,” he said.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a more favourable outcome – more campaign stops, more interviews – I would do it.
“But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory.
“Accordingly, I am now suspending my campaign.”
Polls showed Mr DeSantis was expected to receive around 6 per cent of votes in the New Hampshire primary, where Mr Trump and Ms Haley are competing for first place.
His campaign has suffered in recent days following a disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses last Tuesday, where he secured 21 per cent of the vote and only narrowly beat Ms Haley.
Mr DeSantis had poured significant resources into Iowa, hoping to be in contention to win the vote or close that gap between himself and Mr Trump, who won a landslide.
In New Hampshire, the eligibility of independent voters in the Republican primary and Mr Trump’s dominance of the contest left Mr DeSantis with little chance of attracting significant support.
A poll released yesterday morning found Mr Trump was projected to win in the Granite State with 46 per cent of the vote, with Ms Haley receiving 44 per cent. Mr DeSantis had the support of 6 per cent of eligible voters, it found. Other polls by CNN and Suffolk University suggested Mr Trump’s lead may larger, predicting he will beat Ms Haley by a margin of 11 to 19 points.
The first sign that Mr DeSantis was planning to withdraw came on Saturday night, when he cancelled two scheduled media interviews on CNN and NBC, while Never Back Down, his Super Political Action Committee, cancelled events in New Hampshire, citing scheduling issues.
Mr Trump’s campaign seized on the apparent turmoil in Mr DeSantis’s camp, with staff posting online that the “end is near”.
Vivek Ramaswamy, who withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucus results, said that Mr DeSantis “would do the GOP and the country a great service if he drops out tonight”.
“This movement can’t be about ego or ambition. He deserves immense credit if he does. This primary needs to end on Tuesday,” he said. In response to the news Mr DeSantis had cancelled events and interviews, David Axelrod, the former Obama strategist, said: “Sounds like the end of the road.”
Following the Iowa caucus result, Never Back Down reportedly began sacking campaign staff, and moving many of the remainder to South Carolina, which will vote for its preferred nominee at the end of the month.
Mr DeSantis had hoped that months of work in Iowa and an expensive ground campaign would help him secure an early victory in Iowa, but he attracted less support than expected from rural voters and evangelical Christians, analysis of the results shows.
The 45-year-old former US Navy officer launched his presidential bid in May last year, and became the favourite of various contenders hoping to beat Mr Trump to the Republican nomination.
Reacting to the news, Ms Haley said Mr DeSantis “ran a great race” as she told a crowd in New Hampshire: “There’s now one fella, and one lady left.”
Speaking to supporters on a campaign stop, she said: “He ran a great race, he was a good governor, and we wish him well.
“Having said that, there were 14 people in this race. There were a lot of fellas.
“All the fellas are out, and this comes down to: what do you want? Do you want more of the same? Or do you want something different?”

2477,IKAQTDZOZ7_CW25B9M1PIEYZ2B,Harris takes center stage in 2024 abortion fight,Brett Samuels,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/harris-takes-center-stage-2024-110000825.html,"Vice President Harris has cemented herself as the Biden administration’s foremost messenger on abortion rights, the issue that the White House hopes will define the 2024 election cycle.
After an uneven first 18 months in office, in which Harris faced criticism over her ability to handle complex and intractable matters including migration and voting rights, the vice president has planted her flag in the fight over reproductive rights.
Ever since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, Harris has been traveling the country, visiting red, blue and swing states to meet with activists, providers and women impacted by abortion bans.
“As a leader, she uniquely was able to meet the moment when Roe v. Wade was overturned, and she so galvanized the anger and fear people were feeling when the news came down that Roe was overturned,” said Karen Finney, a veteran Democratic strategist.
“Reproductive rights connect to a number of different issues,” Finney added. “Having the vice president be able to say, ‘We get it, we see you, we hear you and we’re fighting with you’ is critically important.”
Abortion rights have been a key issue for Harris even before the Dobbs decision.
She was endorsed by pro-abortion groups when she ran for California attorney general in 2010 and has maintained strong ties with those organizations in the years since. When she was running for president in 2019, Harris vowed to put more federal guardrails around abortion access by requiring states with a history of restricting it to seek clearance from the Justice Department before enacting any new abortion laws.
Much of the messaging from the Biden administration ahead of the 2024 election has been focused on the ongoing threat a Republican administration would pose to reproductive rights — and personal freedoms more broadly.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager, said in a statement.
“In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country. These are the stakes in 2024 and we’re going to continue to make sure that every single voter knows it,” she added.
Beginning Monday, Harris is embarking on a nationwide tour focused on the Biden administration’s efforts to protect reproductive rights.
She will start in Wisconsin, a battleground state where abortion fueled a Democratic victory in a key state supreme court election last year. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is promising to fight a GOP supermajority Legislature that just introduced a 14-week abortion ban.
While there, Harris will “highlight the harm caused by extreme abortion bans and share stories of those who have been impacted in Wisconsin and across the country,” the vice president’s office said.
“She will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care,” it added.
Biden campaign aides and Democratic strategists believe Harris will be a particularly valuable asset on the trail as she engages with young voters and voters of color, both of which will be important to the president rebuilding the coalition that helped him win in 2020.
“The first order of business when you’re running for reelection is to consolidate your base, and Joe Biden hasn’t completely done that yet. He’s not where he should be with young voters. He’s not where he should be with some women voters and some nonwhite voters,” said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of center-left think tank Third Way.
“Kamala can do a great job in all those places. The choice issue will certainly be front-and-center,” Kessler added.
One Democratic strategist noted Harris has long-standing relationships with pro-abortion activist groups, and her record on abortion is clear, dating back to her time working in California politics.
That track record gives her credibility on the issue, which is particularly useful given how President Biden’s views on abortion have evolved.
Biden as a senator initially expressed skepticism about the Roe v. Wade ruling, and he previously supported the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for most abortions.
Three of the largest abortion rights groups — Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly known as NARAL, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and EMILY’s List — all endorsed Biden and Harris for reelection in June, just before the anniversary of Dobbs.
Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications and research at Reproductive Freedom for All, recalled an event it hosted with Harris in April at Howard University in Washington, D.C.
“People were so responsive and reactive to her message and the way that she delivered it,” Vasquez-Giroux said. “She is a Howard alum. She …  just came across to me as authentic, very comfortable, you know, speaking to a crowd of mostly young Black women and reproductive freedom advocates. She just really seemed like she was at home and in her element.”
Even Republicans have taken notice of Harris’s efforts as the face of the administration’s abortion efforts.
Former Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News that while she disagreed with Harris’s policy views, the vice president was effectively tying her broader messaging about the Biden agenda back to reproductive rights.
“Because she knows what is true and that is — is the GOP has lost every single abortion ballot initiative post-Roe,” McEnany said Wednesday, calling Harris’s approach “very powerful among women.”
“When even your sworn enemies are able to appreciate how good a messenger you are, I think that’s another really great proof point,” Vasquez-Giroux said.

2478,IMIGB93CJE_INOGUAL7END34FF,Can Trump be stopped? Key questions ahead of New Hampshire after DeSantis drops out of race,STEVE PEOPLES,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 7:17 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-stopped-more-key-questions-132117106.html,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Donald Trump's effort to march to the Republican presidential nomination faces perhaps its greatest challenge on Tuesday when voters in New Hampshire hold the first-in-the-nation primary.
With Ron DeSantis ending his 2024 campaign and endorsing Trump on Sunday, the primary becomes the first one-on-one matchup between Trump and Nikki Haley.
The former president enters the contest emboldened by his record-setting performance in last week's Iowa caucuses. But New Hampshire has a more moderate political tradition and primary rules that allow unaffiliated voters to participate in the race. Trump-backed MAGA candidates have struggled here in recent years.
Haley, the former U.N. ambassador and onetime South Carolina governor, is hoping to capitalize on those vulnerabilities, especially now that she is the only major candidate left in the GOP primary aiming to defeat Trump outright. DeSantis, even before dropping out altogether, had effectively surrendered New Hampshire to focus instead on South Carolina's Feb. 24 primary. But he did have supporters in New Hampshire who now must decide what to do.
A Haley victory would usher in a more competitive phase of a primary that Trump has so far dominated. A Trump win, however, could create a sense of inevitability that he would become the GOP nominee for the third consecutive time.
Don’t forget Democrats have a primary, too. President Joe Biden is not on the ballot, having made South Carolina the first formal stop on the Democratic primary calendar. But New Hampshire is sticking to tradition and hosting its own Democratic primary anyway.
Here's what we're watching for on Tuesday:
CAN TRUMP BE STOPPED?
If Haley can't beat him in New Hampshire, she may not be able to stop him anywhere else, even in her home state of South Carolina.
The one-on-one fight between Trump and Haley is exactly what Trump's Republican critics have been clamoring for. Haley appears competitive and enjoys support among moderate voters and independents. She's also earned the backing of popular New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.
Still, Trump remains the favorite.
Sensing a knock-out blow, the former president has called in his growing army of prominent supporters in recent days to help demonstrate his strength. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Trump's former opponent, endorsed Trump at a New Hampshire rally over the weekend. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Ohio Sen. JD Vance stumped for Trump on Saturday before an appearance from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.
A significant number of New Hampshire Republicans insist they will never support Trump. And without a competitive Democratic primary in the way, many left-leaning unaffiliated voters could decide to support Haley. But that doesn't change the fact that Republican primary elections are typically decided by Republicans, and Trump's grip on the base appears stronger than ever.
Still, New Hampshire loves a comeback story (just ask Bill Clinton), so we wouldn’t rule anything out.
WHERE DO DESANTIS SUPPORTERS GO?
DeSantis was seen as a distant third-place finisher in New Hampshire even before ending his campaign Sunday.
The Florida governor visited the state for the first time as a major 2024 primary candidate in June. After his 30-point drubbing in Iowa, where DeSantis had committed most of his time and resources, he surrendered New Hampshire before a single vote was cast. DeSantis actually spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, which hosts its primary election in five weeks.
But dismal poll numbers don't mean DeSantis had no support at all in New Hampshire. With him having aimed for the most conservative factions in the GOP coalition and then endorsing Trump, it's possible his formal departure adds votes to the former president's vote totals. Could that be the difference between Trump managing a narrow victory over Haley or garnering a clear majority that he then uses to declare the nomination a done deal before Haley gets her home-state shot at him?
HOW MUCH DOES ELECTABILITY REALLY MATTER?
Publicly and privately, Democratic leaders have repeatedly acknowledged that they fear Haley much more than Trump in a prospective general election matchup against Biden. We're about to find out whether Republican primary voters agree.
Haley has spent months telling voters that, without Trump's chaos and political baggage, she would be better positioned to defeat Biden in November. That argument didn't help her much in Iowa, where she finished just behind DeSantis.
She's betting that voters in swing-state New Hampshire will place more value on her longer-term political appeal. Sununu, New Hampshire's popular GOP governor, has been at Haley's side for weeks reminding voters of Trump’s dismal record in national elections ever since he entered the White House.
It's unclear if the message has resonated.
If it doesn't, it'll be because Trump has effectively convinced Republican voters that he — not Haley — is the most electable general election candidate. That's a risky bet, given his extraordinary legal problems, the attack he inspired on the U.S. Capitol and his demonstrated record of alienating suburban voters in successive elections.
Biden's unpopularity is no doubt muddying the issue.
Still, New Hampshire voters have an opportunity to cast a strategic vote Tuesday based on the one issue that seems to matter more than all else in today's politics: the ability to beat the other side.
IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT
The end result may be tied most to who actually shows up to vote on Tuesday.
Iowa saw one of its lowest turnouts in recent history in last week’s caucuses. Low turnout elections typically favor the candidate with the strongest support among the party’s base. And in 2024, that’s Trump.
But Haley, with arguments about Trumpian chaos and electability, has been trying to appeal to independents and less-ideological moderate Republicans and independents.
New Hampshire law allows unaffiliated voters to participate in either party’s nomination contest. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the GOP primary, although voters had an opportunity to change their registration before an October deadline.
Haley needs a large turnout, driven by those unaffiliated voters, to have a chance.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David M. Scanlan predicted that 322,000 voters would participate in the GOP primary, which would be a record high. On the Democratic side, he’s expecting just 88,000 given there’s virtually no competition.
A PRESIDENTIAL EMBARRASSMENT?
It may not be the headline, but New Hampshire Democrats are voting for their presidential nominee as well. As much as Biden's team wants you to think they don't care about the outcome, they're paying attention.
Biden won't be on New Hampshire ballot, of course.
He's avoiding New Hampshire altogether after pushing the Democratic National Committee to award the nation's opening primary to South Carolina, a much more diverse state that's set to vote on Feb. 3. Furious about Biden's decision, the “Live Free or Die” state ignored the president's wishes and will host an unsanctioned Democratic primary anyway.
There are several lesser-known Democrats on the ballot, including Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and progressive activist Marianne Williamson. Eager to demonstrate Biden's strength despite his absence, the president's allies in the state have been encouraging voters to write in Biden's name.
The outcome will have no bearing on the number of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination. But an underwhelming finish, even in a write-in campaign, would represent an unwanted embarrassment as Biden tries to improve his political standing heading into the fall campaign.

Nikki Haley in Tuesday's New Hampshire Republican presidential primary.
""If you can select a Republican ballot on Tuesday,"" it wrote Sunday, ""we urge you to select Nikki Haley as your next president. New Hampshire is ready for a change. America is ready for a change. The world is ready for a change. We want a better option than we have had for the past eight years, and Nikki Haley is that option.""
The endorsement did not mention either former President Donald Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who are running against her, instead touting her character and her accomplishments.
""She is easily the most qualified candidate on either ballot,"" it said. ""Nikki Haley is an accountant by career and training. Nikki Haley is a mother. Nikki Haley is a military spouse. Nikki Haley is the child of immigrants. Nikki Haley has experience as a successful governor and a diplomat.""
Polling indicates that Trump, who won the Iowa Caucuses on Monday, is in the lead in the Republican race, with Haley second.
""New Hampshire can prove that the independent-minded voters of the Granite State will not be told the election is a done deal,"" the endorsement said. ""New Hampshire can prove that nothing is inevitable and send Nikki Haley home to South Carolina with a head of steam.""
The Union Leader, which is based in Manchester, has long been influential in New Hampshire politics and, by extension because of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status, nationally. However, its endorsements in contested Republican primaries have not fared all that well in recent years: Both former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (2012) and then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (2016) lost.
In 2020, when Trump was basically unopposed on the Republican side, it urged independents or Democrats in its state to back Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who also lost."
2488,J92AUO2ME4_3A4XLM8I9D76BTO,The Pro-Life Movement’s Aspirational Moment,Daniel Darling,"January 21, 2024 at 4:42 PM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pro-life-movement-aspirational-moment-074200905.html,"In the fall of 1973, horrified by the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision earlier that year, a lawyer in the Labor Department organized a meeting of a small group of women in her home. Nellie Gray, a Texan and veteran of the Women’s Army Corps during World War II, worried that the anniversary of the monumental decision would pass by without being remembered. And she had reason to think so. Many considered this the end of the conversation over abortion.
While the Catholic Church was vocally opposed to the practice of abortion, evangelical Christians had a mixed response. Christianity Today condemned the ruling as “counter not merely to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people” while the largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist convention, was initially ambivalent. A poll taken a few years before Roe found 70 percent of Baptists supported the right to abortion. Few pundits and prognosticators thought this would be a contested issue in American life.
Yet what Gray and others catalyzed in those early days grew: 20,000 people showed up in January 1974 to march past the Capitol and on to the Supreme Court in what would become an annual rite for those who care about the sanctity of life. Evangelical philosopher Francis Schaeffer toured the country with Boston pediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop, giving lectures on the moral horror of abortion and touting their video and book, Whatever Happened to the Human Race? Pro-life ethicist Richard Land became the Southern Baptist Convention’s chief public policy spokesperson. Ronald Reagan, who had signed legislation loosening abortion laws in 1967 as governor of California, ran for president in 1980 promising to oppose the practice. Shortly after he wrote a small book, Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation, outlining his beliefs.
As the march grew into a movement, there were small yet significant victories along the way. The 1976 Hyde Amendment prevented the federal funding of abortion. The 1984 Mexico City Policy kept foreign aid going to abortion, though the policy has typically been enacted by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents.
Yet the biggest goal, overturning Roe, always seemed more aspirational than probable. Year after year pro-lifers worked to elect presidents to nominate and senators to approve Supreme Court justices who might be willing to strike down the case. Yet after many near-misses—such as 1992’s Casey v. Planned Parenthood decision—it all still seemed impossible. Come 2022, many pro-life groups were meeting in anticipation of a half-century anniversary.
Then the unthinkable happened: The Supreme Court reversed itself in the Dobbs decision in June 2022.
What began in a living room in Washington in 1973 became one of the most effective social and political coalitions in American history, provoking—through a mosaic of legislative, legal, cultural, scientific efforts—the nation’s conscience with a new moral vocabulary.
So now what?
The movement has some advantages now it did not have five decades ago: durable institutions, political leaders who champion the cause, and a public that favors modest restrictions on abortion. Yet today, as in 1973, enormous challenges confront those who care for the unborn.
Ironically, the end of Roe—which once seemed impossible—complicates the legal and political fight. The pre-Dobbs legal argument was fairly straightforward. Even the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of abortion, admitted that Roe was a flawed legal ruling.
Now the arguments are more nuanced. Is abortion a state issue? A federal issue? Look no further than the Republican presidential primary contest for proof: Former President Donald Trump has criticized Florida Gov. Ron Desantis for signing a six-week abortion ban. Some candidates have insisted that the arguments against Roe—that abortion should be decided by voters in the states—should be the ongoing standard, while others argue the federal government has a role to play in regulating abortion.
Dobbs was also a galvanizing event for the pro-choice community, which was eager to seize on this moment. Abortion supporters captured the zeal of their young base. They also won ballot victory after victory across even red states like Kentucky and Ohio.
Stung by setbacks, some pro-lifers may despair. But we should not—despite the wishes of so many—go away. Instead we need the aspirational hope and long-term vision of those first courageous advocates. We still need to see ourselves as a movement. Every effective force for justice has taken the long view, even if that horizon stretched past their lifetimes. Abolitionist William Wilberforce’s fight to end the slave trade in Great Britain took him his entire life. The civil rights movement has been a long, slow, painful march. And ours will be as well, replete with setbacks and losses.
Pro-choice advocates and many sympathetic media voices are quick to say that the pro-life movement was caught flat-footed for the day Roe fell. But that thesis is too simplistic. For years, pro-life advocates preached that the legal battle was just the beginning of the fight, which would then proceed state to state and would require much more changing of hearts and minds.
Still, a new era will require new approaches. The legal fight, so persistent and effective, will take a myriad of forms, from working to stop the distribution of abortion drugs at the federal level to conscience protections for people of faith. We know legal restrictions on abortion work, as evidenced by the reduction abortions in the months following the Dobbs decision.
The legislative approach will take many forms, too. Perhaps states with pro-life majorities will pass comprehensive restrictions while swing states adopt incremental ones. Legislators should be wise to carefully word their legislative language to include the rare exception for cases in which the mother’s life is in danger and then effectively communicate those clarifications in the face of widespread misinformation and hyperbolic coverage. Pro-life public officials should talk about these hard cases with compassion and care. The Kate Cox case in Texas was an example both to correct the common misconceptions about the health of a mother and also demonstrate genuine compassion toward her. And pro-lifers should be steadfast, but realistic, at what can be accomplished at the federal level. Without a 60-seat pro-life majority in the Senate, even incremental restrictions will mostly stall in Congress.
Yet the most important, long-term project is cultural. Though the pro-life message is a half-century old, we falsely assume every generation has heard it. New cohorts of young people may be awakened to the horror of abortion for the very first time and might be persuaded by the growing body of science that demonstrates life at the earliest stages of development. Pro-lifers should not give up the art of persuasion, adjusting and adapting the apologetic for a new age.
Those conversations may happen in places we hadn’t anticipated before Dobbs. Recent ballot defeats in conservative states like Ohio and Kentucky demonstrate that large cohorts of Republican voters, when asked as a single issue in a referendum, are less sympathetic to the pro-life cause. Shifting political maps have seen Trump bring in many working class, previously Democratic voters, to the Republican Party. Many aren’t part of church communities and are right-leaning when it comes to immigration and other issues, but are ambivalent about or even supportive of abortion. As Francis Schaeffer and others made the case in the 20th century, so too must a new generation make the case today with innovative approaches and persuasive arguments.
Pro-lifers have always understood that abortion is downstream from other cultural issues, particularly the economic and social struggles of American families. Many women today are alone, abandoned by men who see abortion as a way of escaping responsible fatherhood. Thankfully, a network of thousands of pregnancy resource centers connect mothers with resources and communities, usually religious ones, that can help buoy motherhood in those early years. But we need to supplement this good work with a renewed emphasis on the goodness of the family. Sociologist Brad Wilcox and others have documented the social benefits of stable, two-parent families even as the share of single-parent homes continues to rise in the US. Conservatives should not hesitate to champion the family and find ways to stabilize homes economically. Many pro-life leaders are already thinking in these holistic ways.
Conservatives should also recover a political philosophy of virtue, not in an self-righteous, preening sort of way, but in keeping with the spirit of the American founding. The Constitution was made for a “virtuous and moral people,” John Adams famously wrote. Many who champion faith do not, as so many progressives often argue, seek to construct a theocratic state. Rather, they acknowledge that freedom can become atomized anarchy without Judeo-Christian religious morality. Christianity emphasizes liberty to serve God and others in the context of community, as opposed to libertinism and unbounded individualism. Yuval Levin accurately diagnoses this malady in his book, The Fractured Republic:
The capacity of individuals to define the terms of their own existence by defining their personal identities is increasingly equated with liberty and with the meaning of some of our basic rights, and it is given pride of place in our self-understanding.
The American Founders understood this idea well. In his letter to the Massachusetts Militia, Adams wrote:
Morality and virtue are the foundation of our republic and necessary for a society to be free. Virtue is an inner commitment and voluntary outward obedience to principles of truth and moral law. Private virtue is the character to govern oneself according to moral law at all times. Public virtue is the character to voluntarily sacrifice or subjugate personal wants for the greater good of other individuals or the community.
Where it has influence, the pro-life movement should attempt to frame its arguments in the context of virtue. This might involve a distancing from amoral, barstool conservatism. Sometimes we may be forced into political alliances with imperfect characters. But we should not turn votes into endorsements of the worst behavior. While we welcome advocates where we can, we should be careful about platforming, as champions, those who champion a sexual ethic that feeds the abortion industry. Thankfully, many across the ideological spectrum are starting to question the aims of the sexual revolution and reconsider the virtues of stable, nuclear family life.
As I write this, I’m leaving Washington, D.C, and reflecting on another trip to the nation’s capital to join the protest Nellie Gray started a half century ago. The first march began four years before I was born. Yet I will fly home to continue teaching my own children, now teens, about the importance of standing up for the dignity of every human life. And I wonder, as they grow into adulthood, what stories will they tell. What movement will they inherit? What aspirational pro-life milestones will they see achieved in their time? We can, and must, hope and pray and act.

Griffiths,"January 22, 2024 at 7:23 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-might-worst-presidential-candidate-222356551.html,"Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 race on Sunday.
At one time, it would have been considered an unexpected ending for a promising candidate.
Now, DeSantis will go in history as one of the worst candidates in recent memory.
Turns out, Mickey Mouse is stronger than you thought.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential campaign on Sunday, succumbing to the final realization of defeat in a candidacy that once held such promise.
The epitaph of his campaign is and will be intensely debated. Perhaps, any politician trying to be a replica of Trump when the original was readily available was doomed to fail.
And yet, it doesn't explain the glitchy rollout. The weird, definitely too online videos. And how the governor of one of America's largest states, just seemed well, odd on the campaign trail. It's true that as DeSantis himself complained, Trump's unprecedented criminal indictments upended the race. Still, it seemed like one man in America who could have humbled Trump just couldn't stop tripping over himself.
It's worth remembering as pundits, foes, and anyone else kick the Florida man while he's down that they remember DeSantis once cut a much different figure. After all, there's a reason the Biden White House once made it a point to tangle with him regularly.
DeSantis cut his teeth after narrowly winning a general election over then-Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a candidate who was virtually anointed as the future of the Democratic Party but who now looks at best like a deeply flawed challenger. And yes, it was then-President Donald Trump whose endorsement powered DeSantis to that very general election in the first place.
You know how the story goes. DeSantis pivoted away from his early governorship to becoming a pandemic-era culture warrior willing to take on Trump or anyone else who stands his way. He later added Disney, one of his state's largest employers, to his enemy list. After pundits point out this a bold strategy for a historic swing state, DeSantis pulls off a historic reelection rout.
Front pages proclaimed him the man of the moment. Very early polling showed DeSantis leading Trump in national polling. The Wall Street Journal had him up by double digits over Trump in a 2022 poll.
Of course, it didn't last.
It might be our fault too, more specifically the media. To juice early interest in the presidential race, the national media often declares frontrunners that age more poorly than a mid-2000s sitcom: just ask Rudy Giuliani, Scott Walker, and Kamala Harris (briefly). Some, namely Joe Biden, campaign long enough to go from frontrunner to also-ran back to winning the race again. But for the rest, they drop out before the Iowa caucuses or live on long enough to be humbled by roughly a couple hundred thousand Americans.
While DeSantis may often be compared to former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the Floridian's disappointing performance might be so bad that he has now risen close to the level occupied by Giuliani. As America's (former) Mayor, Giuliani dominated early polling in the 2008 Republican primaries. But Giuliani was ultimately doomed by cultural issues (evangelical conservatives couldn't stomach his then-pro-choice views) and his curious decision to skip the early states in favor of focusing on the delegate battle. He ultimately staked his campaign on Florida. After finishing third, he quickly dropped out.
Walker's failed candidacy is similar in that the Wisconsin Republican expanded his operation quickly to match the early hype for his bid. Just like DeSantis, Walker ended up being doomed by the sheer rate at which his campaign burned through contributions.
Maybe there's a different ending in another multiverse. But in this reality, a week ago DeSantis lashed out at ""worthless"" Republicans who back Trump.
""You can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he'll say: 'You're wonderful,"" DeSantis told Iowans just a day before he finished the caucuses without carrying a single county.
DeSantis can only hope he'll return to a wonderful world as Florida's governor. It sure won't be Disney's.

2500,JRBPHBJGBT_7UJH8F1N3OVDEXG,Inside the door-to-door battle to boost Nikki Haley in New Hampshire,Allan Smith,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 9:52 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/inside-door-door-battle-boost-212015698.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — When Ken Chase pondered whom he would vote for in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation GOP presidential primary here, he didn’t see much of a choice at all.
“Well, [former President Donald] Trump seems to be the only choice,” Chase told a door-knocker from Americans for Prosperity Action.
That wasn’t what AFP wanted to hear. The conservative group is going door to door in early-voting states, hoping to convince primary voters to back former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s presidential bid.
But Chase didn’t see Haley breaking through in the Granite State.
“My wife doesn’t like her. I’m neutral,” he said. “Anybody would be better than [President Joe] Biden. I don’t know. I don’t think she can do it.”
One of the biggest moments of Haley’s campaign was when she earned AFP’s official backing late last year. It was an endorsement that, among other benefits, opened up a national network of canvassers who would immediately start knocking on doors across the country in an effort to get Haley, then rising in the polls, over the hump.
And perhaps nowhere was this bolstered ground game more important than in New Hampshire, considered the most favorable early state to her candidacy — though still one where she trails Trump by double digits in statewide surveys. It’s a state with a large number of undeclared voters who have the choice of voting in either a Republican or Democratic primary — the kinds of voters who may be more open to Haley’s brand of conservatism over Trump’s “MAGA” politics.
On Friday, NBC News joined AFP Action as it knocked doors on Haley’s behalf north of Manchester to get a sense of what the organization was up against. Most voters who answered their doors had already made up their minds to vote for either Trump or Haley in Tuesday’s election. About a half dozen voters AFP Action reached at their doors said they either were already backing Haley or were open to supporting her, a little more than half of those who answered at their doorsteps.
“Not f------ Trump,” said Chris Kordas, a military veteran who said he would support Haley, when asked at his door about the election. “Not Trump. Anybody but Trump.”
Kordas ultimately said he didn’t care whether it was a Democrat or Republican who won the presidency this fall so long as it were “a good person.” Trump didn’t fit that bill.
“He lies and lies more and lies more,” he said. “He’s in and out of the courts all the time, and everybody thinks it’s not” because of his own actions.
Kordas said in his neighborhood, he has received a lot of pushback from neighbors for not supporting Trump, adding that one person said he was a “disgrace to the uniform” for criticizing the former president. Pointing at this race, he took note of Trump changing his tune about Haley’s effectiveness, criticizing her now after earlier praising her as his ambassador to the United Nations.
“He said Nikki Haley does a great job,” he said. “Now look what he says about her. He trusted her.”
As she campaigns across New Hampshire, Haley seeks to convince the broader Republican electorate that she’s more than a choice for those who hold the former president in low esteem. Her backers at AFP Action sought to hammer that point home, too.
At a Friday-morning press conference, Greg Moore, regional director for AFP Action, said his organization sees her pulling from both conservatives and moderates.
“Some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump. I know that’s not true,” he said.
Elaine Lanoie, a Manchester voter who is voting Republican on Tuesday, said when reached at her door Friday that she viewed Haley as a credible conservative. But, she said, she was still “100% for Trump.”
“Based on what he did when he was in office,” she said in explaining her Trump support. “I know he’s egotistical. I know he’s very, you know, doesn’t speak well. But he got the job done.”
AFP Action, as Moore laid out, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire since the group’s post-Thanksgiving endorsement, fanning out 100 volunteers across the state to hit doors and make phone calls.
But as Haley’s allies began talking about how a strong second-place finish would amount to victory for her here, Moore said, “If Trump wins by 1 point, I don’t think that knocks Haley out by any stretch of the imagination.”
“It’s game on,” he said.
Door-knocking has taken center-stage in this Republican presidential primary, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ primary outside backers, the super PAC Never Back Down, putting it at the center of its multimillion-dollar strategy to help elect him. But for DeSantis, it hadn’t produced the intended results. After a second-place finish in Iowa — ahead of Haley — he dropped out of the race on Sunday and endorsed Trump.
Trump has had advantages over both when it comes to the ground game. Trump’s aim is merely to turn out as many existing Trump supporters as possible, while his rivals must not only seek to turn out voters, but to convince them to shift toward their candidate. As Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign, told NBC News last month, “Our opponents are put in this awkward spot of trying to get people to actually go and change their vote and go in a different direction, which is a much heavier lift.”
Just how effective Republican canvassing efforts are continues to come under scrutiny, too. A wide-ranging NBC News investigation this year found some large-scale conservative canvassing efforts were plagued with issues that included fraudulent and untrustworthy data entries, though Republicans insist on the practice’s usefulness when properly executed.
Justin Wilson, the grassroots engagement director for AFP Action New Hampshire who took NBC News on the door-knocking tour Friday, said he’s been really encouraged by the conversations he’s been able to have with voters across the state. He feels that enough voters are buying into Haley’s message about the need to limit “chaos” and give the party its best chance to win in November. (In Iowa, NBC News entrance polling found that just 11% of Iowa’s Republican caucusgoers felt the ability to beat Biden was their top consideration when backing a candidate.)
“At the end of the day, it’s about trying to win,” he said. “And I would say that for a very long time, Republicans have leaned towards not wanting to win. … I don’t think now is a great time to try and make anything as contested as it can possibly be. We really need to go all in on a good, solid candidate. And I don’t think that that candidate is Donald Trump.”
With Trump dominating primary polls nationally and across early states, some Haley supporters have contemplated the choice they may have to make this fall: Trump or Biden.
“Not happy,” Joanne, a Haley supporter, said of how she’d feel about a prospective Trump-vs.-Biden rematch when reached at her door Friday. “I will not vote for Biden. So I would have to vote for Trump, which I’m not happy about either. But it’s going to be [a] Republican.”

Haley's jabs were in response to the former president appearing to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a Friday rally in Concord, N.H. During the speech, Trump incorrectly said Haley was in charge of Capitol security during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.
""They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he's talking about Nancy Pelosi,"" Haley said. ""He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario. The concern I have is -- I'm not saying anything derogatory -- but when you're dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this. We can't.""
Neither Haley nor Pelosi would have been in charge of Capitol security, but Trump regardless accused Haley of turning down 10,000 soldiers to protect the Capitol.
""By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6,"" Trump told supporters. ""You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley ... did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it? All of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security, we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.""
Haley, 52, has called for term limits and mental competency tests for politicians over 75. The former South Carolina governor has criticized both Trump and President Joe Biden's mental fitness and argued Americans shouldn't ""leave our kids two presidential candidates who are in their 80s.""
She doubled down on her condemnations in Keene Saturday, telling voters ""Congress is now the most privileged nursing home in the country."""

Tuesday morning: Manhattan, New York, on trial for defaming a woman he sexually abused. Tuesday night: Atkinson, New Hampshire, campaigning for the US presidency. Wednesday morning: court in New York again.
Donald Trump, the former US president and frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024, has intertwined his political and legal calendars until they are all but indistinguishable. At rambunctious campaign rallies, he plays the victim and rails against a biased justice system. In sombre courtrooms, he creates a spectacle that guarantees airtime and fundraising to fuel his run for the White House.

The jarring juxtaposition seems to be working.
Trump’s 91 criminal charges across four cases did not stop him winning 98 out of 99 counties in Monday’s frigid Iowa caucuses, and interviews with his support base showed they accept his narrative of politically motivated prosecutions. He is leading opinion polls in New Hampshire and looks poised to become the Republican standard bearer.
“The court appearances are his campaign,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “He’s spending much less time than the other candidates in the key states. He’s not spending as much on TV advertising. He’s doing all kinds of things that candidates for president usually don’t do because he’s got an ace card that none of the others have.
“This has convinced not just his supporters but in a broad-based way the whole Republican party that he’s being oppressed, that Joe Biden is using the judicial system to try and put a stake in the heart of his toughest challenger for November. And they buy it.”
Trump’s recent court appearances have been voluntary, not obligatory, at a time when his Republican rivals are crisscrossing states in search of votes. Last week the 77-year-old former reality TV star showed up for a hearing in Washington DC to hear his lawyers argue that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. A day later he was in Des Moines, Iowa, for a Fox News town hall.
The duelling schedule evidently did him no harm in Iowa, where he romped to victory over the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, by nearly 30 percentage points, more than twice the biggest winning margin ever achieved by a Republican. During his speech in Des Moines, Trump nodded to his legal tribulations: “I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they’re using that for election interference.”
The following morning, he was in a Manhattan federal court – again by choice – to watch the selection of a jury that will decide whether he should pay damages for defamatory comments he made in office about the writer E Jean Carroll. Last year a jury concluded that Trump sexually abused her in a department store in 1996 and defamed her in 2022.
That evening he headed to Atkinson, New Hampshire, for a campaign rally where he boasted about his win in Iowa but told supporters: “If I didn’t get indicted all these times and if they didn’t unfairly go after me, I would have won, but it would have been much closer. I tell you, I don’t know if I would have made the trade. I might have just liked the position we’re in right now.”
Come Wednesday, it was back to New York and the Carroll case. This time Trump was animated, shaking his head at testimony he disliked, passing notes to his lawyers and speaking to them while jurors were in the room.
He was scolded by Judge Lewis Kaplan after a lawyer for Carroll complained that he was grumbling about the case so loudly that jurors could hear him. When the judge threatened to expel him, Trump retorted: “I would love it.” The judge admonished: “I know you would. You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.”
Outside the courtroom, the Republican frontrunner then held a press conference, describing the trial as “rigged” and Carroll as “a person I never knew”. He complained that Kaplan, a Bill Clinton appointee, was “a nasty judge” and a “Trump-hating guy” who was “obviously not impartial”.
Somehow he had made the case about himself rather than his victim. Maggie Haberman, author of Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America, told CNN: “He showed up for her testimony and so instead of us talking about her testimony we are talking about the fact that he was making noises, he was overheard whispering to his lawyer.”
She added: “He would have liked to have gotten thrown out because he would then claim he was a victim. It’s heads he wins, tails the other side loses.”
Trump was not in court on Thursday so he could attend his mother-in-law’s funeral in Florida. He will soon head back to New Hampshire to hold rallies ahead of Tuesday’s primary election, where he could in effect seal the Republican nomination. As endorsements from senior Republicans pour in, it seems that the party has made a collective decision to carry the legal baggage of a man who now openly brags that he has been indicted more often than Al Capone.
Charlie Sykes, editor of the Bulwark website and a former conservative radio host, said: “He’s going to have a courtroom campaign because Donald Trump relishes the idea of being the martyr. He thinks that being associated with these trials will actually help him in the polls and so far he’s not wrong. Every time he’s been indicted, he’s gone up.”
But Sykes believes that Trump’s decision to attend the trial involving E Jean Carroll could be a mistake as he pivots to general election voters. “How many Americans actually know about this case? There’s been such a firehose of indictments, hearings, charges. Now Donald Trump himself has decided that he is going to draw attention to a case that he’s already lost, that has found him liable for sexual assault.
“It’s hard for me to imagine any swing voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia or Milwaukee hearing for the first time about this case and thinking, yeah, this is the guy that I want to support for president.”
Anna Greenberg, a senior partner at polling firm GQR, also sees limitations in Trump’s gameplan. She said: “He saw that when he got indicted he got a major boost, and you saw it in the primary polls, and so he may be thinking if I engage with these trials against me and I rail and I attack, that’s going to continue to give me some kind of benefit.
“I think he already got the benefit. I don’t think there’s any additive benefit for him but I think there’s a real downside for him, which is that’s how he’s spending his time and not out on the campaign trail and doing the campaigning.”
Trump has pleaded not guilty in four state and federal criminal cases, including two claiming he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. This week his lawyers filed paperwork in another case – over his allegedly illegal retention of sensitive classified documents – arguing that intelligence agencies were politically biased against Trump.
Some observers fear that the scorched earth approach poses a far-reaching danger to civil society and American legal and political structures. Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, added: “Donald Trump is waging a concerted campaign to de-legitimize the justice system in America.
“He is trying to discredit not just prosecutors, but also judges and juries and the entire process of legal accountability and the damage is going to be long lasting and it’s going to be profound.”"

JD Vance (R-Ohio) made the case Sunday that former President Trump is a more electable candidate than former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, citing the former president’s resiliency after years of media criticism and controversy.
In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the Trump campaign surrogate was asked to respond to concerns from voters who say Trump brings “chaos” — an argument Haley makes frequently on the campaign trail.
“My response to that voter would be, Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn’t faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced,” Vance told host Shannon Bream.
“And, frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and is still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience,” Vance said.
Vance continued making the argument that Haley has simply not faced the same barrage of attacks that Trump has, and he claimed she might not be prepared for what’s coming if she wins the party’s nomination.
“I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she’s the low-baggage candidate. In reality, she’s the candidate the Democrats haven’t teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she’s the nominee,” he said. “She won’t be [the nominee], but if she is, she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years.”
“And I don’t think she’ll survive, and I certainly don’t think she’ll win the presidency through it. That’s why we need to elect the guy who’s shown some resilience. That’s why we need to nominate Donald Trump,” Vance added.
On Tuesday, New Hampshire voters will head to the polls for the first primary election of the 2024 presidential cycle. According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s New Hampshire primary polling average, Trump leads by 11.4 percentage points, with 46.7 percent support compared with Haley’s 35.3 percent support.
Nationally, the polling average puts Trump ahead by 50.7 percentage points, with 63.3 percent support, followed by Haley’s 12.6 percent and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s 10.6 percent support.

Asa Hutchinson threw his support behind Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential race, his message was as much an indictment of the former president as it was an endorsement of Haley ahead of New Hampshire’s Tuesday primary.
“Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so. Go @NikkiHaley in New Hampshire,” Hutchinson wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday afternoon.
Haley’s well-timed bump in the polls in the Granite State — bolstered by a timely endorsement from the state’s popular GOP governor, Chris Sununu — has elevated the first-in-the-nation primary as the event to watch this election season. It’s also drawn Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and former Trump administration official, the backing of several of the loudest anti-Trump voices still left in the Republican Party.
Around the same time Hutchinson called on New Hampshire voters to support Haley, GOP Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont did the same: “After years of controversy, violent rhetoric and growing polarization, the very last thing we need is four more years of Donald Trump,” Scott said in a statement, calling Haley “our only chance to ensure America has the choice it deserves in November.”
Just over a week earlier, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who’s been eyed as a possible third-party candidate, backed Haley ahead of Iowa’s caucuses, calling her “the strongest chance” for Republicans to put forward the best possible candidate in the general election.
And the most-prominent New Hampshire newspaper, the Union Leader, joined the chorus this weekend, endorsing Haley, touting both her character and her experience. Despite its conservative bent, the paper backed Joe Biden in the 2020 general election, defying its long history of supporting conservatives in the general election.
“If you can select a Republican ballot on Tuesday,” the editorial said, “we urge you to select Nikki Haley as your next president. New Hampshire is ready for a change. America is ready for a change. The world is ready for a change. We want a better option than we have had for the past eight years, and Nikki Haley is that option.”
The slate of late-breaking endorsements would normally be a boon for a candidate hoping to sway voters in the waning days of a campaign. But for Haley, it also brings risk.
The former U.N. ambassador has, like most of the GOP candidates, painstakingly avoided going after Trump head on. Only recently did she ramp up her criticism of the former president, and rule out the possibility that she would accept a job as Trump’s vice president.
While anti-Trump messaging may charm New Hampshire’s more moderate electorate — which includes a significant number of independent voters — it’s unlikely to appeal to the conservatives in other early voting states. And in recent campaign stops in New Hampshire, Trump has attempted to play up Haley’s independent support, claiming that liberals are attempting to ""infiltrate the Republican primary,” in New Hampshire.
Haley is also still missing the support of two of the most nationally recognizable Trump detractors: former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
Christie’s exit from the race earlier this month was poised to be a win for Haley, as polls indicated that likely Christie voters eyed Haley as a possible second choice in the race. But Christie, whose campaign hinged on taking on Trump, slammed Haley on his way out the door.
“She’s gonna get smoked,” Christie was caught saying of Haley — although he did not reference her by name. “And you and I both know it. She’s not up to this.”
Haley is still trailing Trump by double digits in recent polls of Granite State voters, her surge appearing to slow. Even Sununu, her top surrogate in the state, has tempered expectations for her on Tuesday.
""She doesn't have to win. I mean, look, nobody goes from single digits in December to 'you absolutely have to win' in January,"" he said Sunday during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
Trump, meanwhile, has scooped up the support of three of the other also-rans: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Vivek Ramaswamy and most recently (and most stingingly) Sen. Tim Scott, Haley’s fellow South Carolinian, as well as two of his 2016 primary foes, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
“It comes right down to, what does America need for the next president?” Scott said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“The only conclusion,” he added later, “is Donald Trump.”"

DeSantis continued that despite previously having disagreements with Trump, he is throwing his support behind the 45th president in his run for the White House this year.
""It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" he said, adding: ""He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
DESANTIS SUSPENDS CAMPAIGN, TWO DAYS TILL NEW HAMPSHIRE IT'S A TWO-PERSON PRIMARY
The announcement was made just before the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, and after Trump easily won the Iowa caucuses last week.

Some Republicans and conservatives on social media celebrated the move as one that would strengthen Trump's campaign to defeat President Biden come November, while others thanked DeSantis for his conservative policies on the campaign trail.
""GREAT move by Governor Ron DeSantis! President @realDonaldTrump is uniting the GOP & we are closer than ever to taking our country back! #Trump2024,"" former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake posted on X.

Trump has 55% support among those likely to vote in the primary, compared to Haley's 36% support and DeSantis' 6% support, a Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 poll found. Other polls have found a tighter margin between Trump and Haley, including a CNN poll that found Trump has 50% support to Haley's 39%.
The New Hampshire race will now include only Trump and Haley.

Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential campaign on Sunday, posting a video on X saying he could not ask his campaign staffers to give their time ""without a clear path to victory.""
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis said.
He added that he had signed a pledge to support the eventual nominee. As he left the race, DeSantis took a parting shot at opponent Nikki Haley. Trump, he said in his video, ""has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear — a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism — that Nikki Haley represents.""
Who's running for president?
Soon after DeSantis announced he was dropping out of the race, Haley told reporters, ""He's been a good governor and we wish him well,"" and noting that the race is now down to ""one fella and one lady,"" she added, ""May the best woman win.""
After placing a distant second in Iowa, losing to former President Donald Trump by 30 points, DeSantis has failed to articulate his path to the nomination and what states he would be able to win against Trump, dropping out of the race two days before the New Hampshire primary.
He had invested large amounts of time and money in trying to win Iowa, as he and his super PAC bet that an aggressive approach of retail politics and building a ground game operation would result in an upset or a closer race.
On the campaign trail, DeSantis, 45, pitched himself as a more effective figure to implement some of Trump's policies on immigration or curbing government spending, and that Trump's legal cases could cost Republicans the White House in a general election.
DeSantis' record in Florida was an anchor of his candidacy, often pointing to his response during the COVID-19 pandemic and legislative record on taxes, his handling of the state's budget taxes and his six-week abortion ban. He pointed to his 20-point re-election win in Florida as a data point of electoral success he'd have as the Republican nominee.
But since his glitchy launch on X (formerly Twitter) ""spaces"" in May 2023, DeSantis' campaign had struggled to create a convincing argument for voters to pick him over Trump.
He saw his polling gap with Trump in the early states widen as the former president went on the attack against him, claiming he was disloyal and disparaging him ""DeSanctimonious."" Trump's campaign and allies spent millions on anti-DeSantis ads and trolled him on his personality, his footwear and internal dysfunction with his campaign.
His campaign appeared to be overspending early on, straining its financial resources and cutting staff heading into fall of last year.
The campaign struggled to generate high fundraising numbers throughout the campaign —  especially as Haley won support from GOP donors looking for a non-Trump candidate.
Throughout his run, a pro-DeSantis super PAC, ""Never Back Down,"" had an outsized role not traditionally seen in presidential campaigns, running the grassroots operations and door knocking in the early states. The super PAC hosted DeSantis as a ""special guest"" for a majority of his campaign events because his presidential campaign was low on funds.
Never Back Down saw a high-profile turnover of leadership in November and December, after conflicts over advertising strategy, increased involvement on the PAC's board from DeSantis loyalists from Tallahassee, and overall frustration with the governor's position in the polls.
Legally, campaigns and super PACs cannot coordinate because super PACs are not subject to any fundraising limits. The heavy involvement by Never Back Down prompted a formal complaint to be filed by the Campaign Legal Center.
While DeSantis argued that he could whittle the race down to a two-person matchup against Trump, DeSantis failed to establish himself as the clear Trump alternative, especially as Haley saw a rise in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire after her strong debate performances in the late summer and fall.
Asked in January on New Hampshire radio whether he believes he should have waited until 2028 — when he likely wouldn't be facing Trump — to launch a run, DeSantis replied, ""I don't know what [20]28 is gonna look like. I may not have the calling then. I had the calling now. I think the party supporting me would lead to great results over an eight year period.""
""Obviously with Trump in, it's more difficult,"" he added.

DeSantis's withdrawal, after months of weakening support, leaves only low-polling Nikki Haley standing between Trump and nomination as the Republican Party's candidate for the US presidential election in November.
In a video message, DeSantis said that following his second place finish last week in the Iowa caucuses he could not ask ""supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""
The decision came less than two days before the New Hampshire primary, where polls showed him far behind front-runner Trump and former UN ambassador Haley.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis said, noting he has had differences with the former president, notably over the coronavirus pandemic.
""He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear or a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
Trump stormed to victory in Iowa last Tuesday, with 51 percent of Republican voters choosing the twice-impeached former president over DeSantis, who gained only 21 percent, and Haley at 19 percent.
No candidate has ever lost the race after claiming the first two states, and Trump would almost certainly declare the Republican nomination over with a win in New Hampshire.
His campaign said in a statement Sunday that he was ""honored"" by DeSantis' endorsement, and called for Republicans to rally behind him, dismissing Haley as ""the candidate of the globalists and Democrats.""
""It's time to choose wisely,"" the statement said.
In her own statement, Haley warned that the United States is ""not a country of coronations.""
""So far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not ... Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road,"" she said.
- Once a rising star -
Many Republicans had pinned their hopes on DeSantis, who at just 45 was embraced by some as a rising star of the right.
But his candidacy, announced at the end of May, struggled to establish itself as a threat to 77-year-old Trump.
A former naval officer, DeSantis was elected in 2018 as governor in Florida after receiving Trump's valuable endorsement in the Republican primary.
Since then, he often distanced himself from Trump and gained notoriety for hard-right stances on education, immigration and LGBTQ issues.
His state management of the pandemic, pushing for a rapid reopening of the economy during then-president Trump's term and opposition to policies of President Joe Biden's administration, made him an instant hit.
He then sought a national platform, but appeared stiff and uneasy at candidate debates, media interviews and voter events.
""I'm glad that he's dropped out. I think that it was inevitable,"" Lynne Mason, 60, who runs a small business in Keene, New Hampshire, told AFP.
""We need a strong leader right now, with the state of the United States at this point.""
At an event in Seabrook, New Hampshire, Haley said DeSantis ""ran a great race, he's been a good governor, and we wish him well.""
""Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady,"" she continued. ""This comes down to 'what do you want?' Do you want more of the same or do you want something new?""
Having previously avoided direct invectives against Trump, Haley later leaned into the frontrunner, telling CNN she's ""not thin-skinned"" like him and that she views him and 81-year-old Biden as ""equally bad.""
""I don't think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House ... we need to know they're at the top of their game.""

Ambassador Nikki Haley’s (R) attacks on former President Trump came too late for it to potentially make a difference in the GOP primary.
During his appearance on CNN Saturday night, Sabato said that Haley’s diggs against Trump were long overdue and noted that the only other candidate in the Republican field who took on Trump directly was former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who dropped out of the race two weeks ago.
“It is definitely too little too late,” Sabato said, referencing Haley’s recent digs at Trump, including her questioning Trump’s mental fitness when he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nanci Pelosi (D-Calif.) when talking about the Jan. 6 attack during a rally Friday.
“Chris Christie is the only Republican candidate running for president, no longer running now, but in the campaign, he was the only one who really took out after Trump,” Sabato said.
He noted that even with Christie’s approach, all other Republican candidates, including Haley, have a difficult job distinguishing themselves from the former president while still being able to gather enough support to secure the party’s nomination.
“Of course, he’s no longer in the campaign, which tells you the very difficult situation that all of these candidates, including Nikki Haley, found themselves in,” Sabato said. “This is the MAGA party. This is the Donald Trump party and so to get the nomination against Donald Trump, you have to somehow convince people that Trump is no longer up to the job or can’t win in November, but not offended so much that they won’t vote for you. And it’s a near impossibility.”
Sabato’s analysis comes after Trump won the Iowa Caucuses by over 50 points and is bringing that momentum to New Hampshire, where he is looking to win the first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23.
The editor-in-chief of the “Crystal Ball,” a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, cautioned that New Hampshire is “different” and that it might be one place where Haley, who has slowly climbed up in the polls, might be able to pull “an upset” victory.
“We know New Hampshire is very different,” Sabato said. “It’s the one place where someone like Haley might be able to pull an upset —might — but it isn’t looking like it yet,” he added.
Trump is currently leading in the Granite State with 46.7 percent, outpacing second-placed Haley by 11.4 percent. The former South Carolina governor has 35.3 percent, far ahead of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) who is at 5.8 percent, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate of polls.
“There are times when they [New Hampshire voters] will shock everybody, you never know for sure until you see the votes coming in there,” Sabato concluded.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on Sunday suggested she is not interested in being vetted as former President Trump’s vice presidential pick.
In an interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Sanders said she preferred to stay in her current role.
“Look, I absolutely love the job I have. I think it’s one of the best jobs I could ever ask for, and I am honored to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years,” Sanders said, suggesting she would not want to leave the job early to run with Trump.
Sanders served as Trump’s press secretary and has been a consistent backer of the former president, praising his time in office and defending him against criticism. She endorsed Trump’s current bid in November 2023.
Some in Trump’s inner orbit have predicted Trump is likely to pick a woman to serve as vice president, and Sanders’s name has come up as a possibility.
Trump more recently has signaled he’s already decided whom he would pick but has so far refrained from providing detail into who they might be.
Trump has recently garnered support from many prominent GOP politicians. On Friday, he secured an endorsement from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who suspended his own presidential campaign, which had emphasized a message of hope and positivity.
Scott on Sunday left the door open to being Trump’s vice presidential pick when asked in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying, “The only thing I want is four more years of Donald Trump and a Republican majority in the Senate, a majority in the House and the White House.”
“That’s what I really want,” Scott continued. “And if I can help achieve that through my endorsement by being on the campaign trail in my home state of South Carolina for the next four or five weeks, and then beyond, that’s the goal.”

Asa Hutchinson endorsed Nikki Haley on Saturday, days before she tries to take on frontrunner Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primary.
Hutchinson is a conservative whose opposition to Trump became central in his longshot bid for the GOP primary before he dropped out Tuesday.
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Hutchinson said: “Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.”
Hutchinson added: “Go @NikkiHaley in New Hampshire.”
Haley's campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
After finishing third in the leadoff contest in Iowa earlier this month, Haley has been looking to appeal to independent and unaffiliated voters in New Hampshire's Jan. 23 primary to garner a strong finish and turn the race against Trump into a two-person contest.
Hutchinson dropped out after finishing sixth in the caucuses.
His backing comes a day after another of their former rivals in the GOP presidential contest, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, endorsed Trump. Another former candidate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also backed Trump.
Haley last weekend won the support of former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who had fueled speculation that he was preparing for his own third-party bid.

Trump last week appeared mix up Haley, a former United Nations ambassador who served in his Cabinet, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) while speaking about the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
Asked by CBS “Face The Nation” anchor Margaret Brennan if the apparent gaffe is the first time she’s questioned Trump’s mental fitness, Haley listed off a series of recent incidents where the former president appeared to mix up names or events.
“He claimed Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II, I’m assuming he meant World War III. He said that he ran against President Obama, he never ran against President Obama. He says that I’m the one that kept security from the Capitol on Jan. 6, I was nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6,” Haley said. “Don’t be surprised if you [have] someone that’s 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline, that’s just human nature. We know that.”
Haley then pointed to the likely Democratic presidential nominee, President Biden, who at 81 is the oldest sitting U.S. president, and argued he is “very different” than he was two years ago when he first took office.
The White House hopeful said Biden should serve as a “warning sign” for 2024.
Brennan then asked Haley if she ever questioned Trump’s mental fitness when working in his Cabinet.
“I called him out if he was doing something wrong. I mean, I would show up, pick up the phone and say, ‘You can’t do this. Instead you could X, Y, or Z, you know.’ So I always told him what I thought was in the best interest of the country when I was in his Cabinet,” Haley said. “But this is different. I mean, we’re seeing he’s just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we’re seeing some of that decline.”
Trump on Saturday pushed back on claims of mental missteps after he appeared to mix up Haley and Pelosi in reference to Jan. 6, telling a crowd in New Hampshire that he often relies on sarcasm during speeches.
“A lot of times I’ll say that President Obama is doing a lousy job, meaning that Obama is running the show,” Trump said during his rally. “They’ll say, ‘Donald Trump doesn’t know who our president is.’ No, no. A few months ago I took a cognitive test my doctor gave me, I said give me a cognitive test … and I aced it. I also took one when I was in the White House.”
Despite the former president’s age and his opponents’ doubts about his ability to serve as president, Trump, who is 77, continues to lead in GOP primary polling. He easily won during last week’s Iowa caucuses and has a 11.1 point lead over Haley in New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Tuesday, according to The Hill and Decision Desk HQ’s polling index.

In recent weeks, the presidential race had whittled down to a contest between three candidates — DeSantis, Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. With DeSantis out, and Trump still commanding large majorities in polls, several senators and candidates have come out in support of Trump in recent weeks.
Only one state so far has had a chance to vote in the Republican primary. In the Iowa caucuses, Trump won 51% of the vote, while DeSantis finished with 21% and Haley with 19%.
The New Hampshire primary is this Tuesday, where the latest CNN poll showed Trump with 50% support and Haley with 39% among likely Republican voters. DeSantis was far behind his competitors with only 6% support.

It was neatly packaged inside a quick but piercing insult as if it felt comfortable serving as a tool for violence. Although initially unaware of its significance, I could tell it felt both natural and out of place at the same time — a feeling I knew all too well.
“Faggot.” I was 12 years old, using social media as a means to understand my identity when I first encountered those six, seemingly innocent letters. Initially oblivious, I looked up the word’s meaning — a simple action that altered my perception of myself. I realized I was not only abnormal but my very existence was offensive.
In a society where LGBTQ+ education is not only scarce but actively censored, I was forced to learn about my community — and myself — through less reliable means: social media. With Instagram and YouTube as stand-ins for teachers, I matured without fully understanding who I was becoming and why I strayed from the status quo. My life became plagued with conflict catalyzed by an absence of LGBTQ+ inclusive education and representation.
Despite this lack of representation, the LGBTQ+ community has been present throughout history. Starting as early as 9,600 BCE, its acceptance then extended into the Roman Empire and beyond — exemplified most notably by Renaissance champion Leonardo da Vinci. However, the first push for LGBTQ+ inclusive education didn’t occur until directly after the Stonewall riots of 1969. Although initially unsuccessful, this push prompted further movements — the first successful one occurring 42 years later.
As a part of the FAIR (Fair Accurate Inclusive and Respectful) Education Act of 2011, California became the first state to enact legislation “requiring that the curriculum include information about the contributions and roles of LGBTQ Americans.” However, in the 12 years since, only five other states have followed suit: Colorado, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois and Nevada. While that progress is inspiring, many other states are deliberately censoring this education.
Most notably, in 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, signed the “Parental Rights in Education” bill (more commonly known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill). This piece of legislation, which only 40% of Floridians support, prohibits classroom discussions regarding sexual orientation or gender identity through third grade — although, in April 2023, it was extended to the 12th grade. Additionally, presidential candidate Nikki Haley — who most view as a moderate alternative to former President Donald Trump — even stated that the law does not go “far enough.” Further, since the Florida legislation, 30 similar anti-LGBTQ+ education bills have been passed in 16 states.
Legislation is not the only barrier, though; many teachers are hesitant about LGBTQ+ inclusive education as well. Specifically, a 2021 Education Week poll found that 43% of teachers, district leaders, and principals believe that LGBTQ+ matters should not be taught in schools — even in an age-appropriate manner. This hesitation could stem from several factors: Teachers might fear parental backlash, face limited curriculum options or simply lack the necessary training. However, other teachers and faculty members believe that, at a time in which LGBTQ+ rights are being targeted throughout the country, it is more important than ever to promote LGBTQ+ education — especially since 20.8% of Generation Z self-identifies as LGBTQ+.
According to the American Bar Association, “an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum promotes a positive school environment and student well-being.” Further, research indicates that a positive school environment for LGBTQ+ students increases academic motivation and decreases feelings of sadness, disconnectedness and even suicidal ideation. In fact, these indicators saw a drastic reduction when LGBTQ+ students felt as safe at school as their straight, cisgender peers. Considering that LGBTQ+ inclusive education directly improves the quality of life for one in five of our nation’s students without harming the other four, I find it difficult to comprehend the reason for its censorship — and so should you.
The general public is also hesitant to endorse LGBTQ+ inclusive education. In fact, a recent study from the University of Southern California revealed that only a mere quarter of respondents stated that they support such education at the elementary school level. However, this reluctance was largely based on blind, uninformed conclusions as half of the respondents stated they were “unsure” whether LGBTQ+ matters were even being addressed in educational curricula. Although a higher number supported LGBTQ+ inclusive education at the high school level, I contest that it is imperative to begin as early as possible.
Drawing from personal experience, I know that, by the time LGBTQ+ students reach high school, the adverse effects of the absence of inclusive education have already taken their toll. To remedy this, I propose age-appropriate education. Many believe that more inclusive education means that primary school students would learn about detailed sexual education or complex theory, but that is simply not the case. Instead, according to teacher Sara Springer, primary school students might learn that “no one should be treated unfairly because they are different” and that “families come in all shapes and sizes.” Then, as students progress to middle school, they can learn about prominent LGBTQ+ figures, gaining insight into the challenges the community had to overcome to get to where it is today.
Another criticism of LGBTQ+ inclusive education is that it will distract students from other aspects of education. In fact, in support of the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, DeSantis stated: “Schools need to be teaching kids to read, to write, they need to teach them science, history.” While I completely agree with this sentiment, I believe compromise is possible and necessary.
In English classes, teachers can assign books with LGBTQ+ characters — even if they simply serve supporting roles (after all, it is the representation that matters). In history classes, curricula can highlight prominent LGBTQ+ figures (e.g. Marsha P. Johnson, Harvey Milk and Pete Buttigieg) and events (e.g. the Stonewall riots, Pride and the AIDS crisis). Finally, in science classes, students can learn about prominent LGBTQ+ scientists. For example, elementary schools currently revere astronaut and physicist Sally Ride as the first American woman in space without disclosing that she was, in fact, bisexual. Although these suggested curriculum changes seem minor, it is education like this that fosters more accepting school environments. In fact, California students who studied LGBTQ+ matters at school reported less bullying overall.
Finally, by fostering age-appropriate LGBTQ+ inclusive education and dispelling misconceptions, we can create positive learning environments that not only inform students of an important community but also allow LGBTQ+ students the comfort and bravery to begin embarking on their journeys of self-discovery.
So now, as you consider your stance on implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive education into national curricula, I urge you to think of the approximately 15 million American LGBTQ+ students who face bullying every day, just for being themselves. I urge you to think of the students who are forced to learn about their identity through unreliable — typically damaging — means. I urge you to think of the students who long for representation.
I urge you to think of me.

During an interview with Newsmax’s Rob Finnerty, Donald Trump Jr. stated that Carlson becoming Trump’s VP “ clearly would be on the table.” The disgraced media personality rose to fame on a network that promoted white supremacist rhetoric and falsehoods. As a reminder, here’s a brief history of Fox’s most heinous lies.
Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, who hosts the show Tucker Carlson Tonight, has pushed the heinous notion of “great replacement” theory for years. It states that white people are in danger of becoming a minority in the US due to immigration policies and social movements. This racist rhetoric was connected to the motive behind the violent Buffalo massacre that target Black people last year.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson couldn’t help himself when he said that the 2020 police brutality protests were “definitely not about Black lives.” He didn’t stop there as he added: “Remember that when they come for you, and at this rate, they will. Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It’s like being swarmed by hornets.” The backlash Carlson faced was imminent.
The reason Dominion Voting Systems’ is currently suing Fox News is for saying that the election technology company helped rig the 2020 presidential election (a claim that Donald Trump notoriously asserted). Recently, Rupert Murdoch’s testimony was made public as part of the lawsuit. The chairman of Fox News’s parent company admitted in a deposition that “some of our commentators were endorsing” the lie that the election was stolen.
Last year, Tucker Carlson went on a tirade on how the hiring rules have become altered under the Biden administration and that Karine Jean-Pierre, like Kamala Harris and Ketanji Brown Jackson, was picked for the role of White because she satisfies a Democratic diversity quota—and nothing else. “It’s really simple. Show us your picture, and we’ll tell you if you’re qualified for the job,” he stated.
In 2019, Laura Ingraham—host of Fox News show “The Ingraham Angle”— rallied behind white supremacists who she believed were unfairly censored on social media. This included the likes of Alex Jones, Candace Owens and Milo Yiannopoulos. Although hate should always be de-platformed, Fox rallied behind Ingraham. “Anyone who watches Laura’s show knows that she is a fierce protector of freedom of speech,” the network said.
A lot of ridiculous things have come out of Megyn Kelly’s mouth—she notoriously defended blackface after all. Back in 2013 during her show “The Kelly File,” she declared that Jesus is white. “I just want the kids watching to know that,” she said. “How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy, of the story, and change Santa from white to Black?” Even though evidence has shown that Jesus was born in Palestine, racism always defines logic.
Shortly before he was fired by Fox News in 2017, Bill O’Reilly spent years saying that racism is not a real problem in America and that if it is, it’s white folks who suffer. During his “Talking Points Commentary” in 2016, O’Reilly said that “the left in America is demanding that the Electoral College system put into place in 1787 be scrapped” since “the left wants power taken away from the white establishment.” He also said that the biggest desire for Democrats is that “white working-class voters [becoming] marginalized.”
In 2016, Michelle Obama gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in which she talked about the progress American society had made by referring to the fact that the White House was built by slaves. In response, the opportunistic racist that O’Reilly is couldn’t help but say that those same slaves “were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government.” In addition, he said that “Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House” but “there were others working as well.”
In 2022 during a broadcast, Fox News host Harris Faulkner told viewers that migrants at the southern border “make our country look like what they left” and “our people” are now forced to clean up their “excrement.” “The Faulkner Focus” often mimics the views of Tucker Carlson, pushing the horribly racist ideology that immigrants make America “poorer and dirtier.”
Fox host Jesse Watters has always used his platform to promote racist stereotypes of Asian people. In 2016, he did a series of mocking interviews in New York’s Chinatown. It was so horrible that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the segment. Two years later, Watters used his show to make jokes about a New York Times editorial board hire, Sarah Jeong. Watters later apologized.
In 2019 during his impeachment trial, Donald Trump tweeted: “All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here—a lynching. But we will WIN!” Of course, Fox News couldn’t wait to side with the delusional former president. Host Lisa Boothe agreed with the statement, saying: “I think the context and the point that President Trump was trying to make is that this is a terribly unfair process. Objectively, it is. I mean, you have Democrats holding this impeachment inquiry in secret, selectively leaking certain information.” The network always manages to grossly outdo themselves whenever it gets the chance.

2613,O4IEI9GSUU_5VU0I3KP79ZE4I6,Inside the pressure campaign ahead of Ron DeSantis dropping out,Shelby Talcott,"January 22, 2024 at 5:07 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/inside-pressure-campaign-ahead-ron-200725160.html,"The pressure campaign for Ron DeSantis to drop out of the presidential race reached a fever pitch — both publicly and internally — as he prepared his exit. He made it official Sunday afternoon in a post on X, and endorsed Donald Trump.
“Clearly the base is not ready to move past Trump,” said a DeSantis supporter close to his campaign, who noted even his staunchest Florida-based backers wanted him to drop out sooner rather than later. “Iowa was critical for DeSantis and he did everything right in the state, but he couldn’t pull off a win in even one county. It’s bad for America. DeSantis would have been an outstanding president, but unfortunately it is the current state of this primary.”
Bloomberg first reported Sunday that the Florida governor’s team was beginning exit discussions, trying to figure out the best time and place to drop out. While he endorsed Trump immediately in his video, it doesn’t appear that there was coordination with Trump’s team on that announcement.
Once seen as the conservative darling who could take on Donald Trump, the Florida governor’s supporters have widely recognized the bitter reality over the past few weeks: That it just might not be Desantis’s time. The seeds of doubt among his allies and some donors began months ago, when Nikki Haley began gaining momentum in the race. Even back then, DeSantis began facing quiet pressure to drop out, sources say.
But after a second place finish in Iowa (30 points behind Trump) and seemingly no path to win New Hampshire or South Carolina, the push for him to suspend his campaign reached its height. Publicly, top conservative pundits like Laura Ingraham and The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board have called on him to suspend his campaign. Meanwhile, he also faced a barrage of internal pressure, with donors and top Floridians who want him to be viable in 2028 quietly urging his campaign to give up.
Trump’s team has said they’d welcome DeSantis dropping out — and his endorsement — despite the bitter rivalry between the two over the last year.
“I think we should welcome Gov. DeSantis and all of his supporters into the warm embrace of MAGA,” Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz told Semafor on Saturday. “He’s got a lot of successful years ahead in Florida. We’ve got to pull together and win this thing. Joe Biden’s the enemy, not each other.”
Trump’s team saw DeSantis’s remaining voters as likely converts — conservatives who disagreed with Haley on foreign policy, and who’d been told by their candidate and conservative media that Haley was a corporate shill.
“The majority of his voters come to us,” Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita told Semafor. Polling from CNN and the University of New Hampshire released Sunday morning found Trump hitting 50% for the first time, as supporters of Vivek Ramaswamy came over en masse.
Tim Scott, another Trump rival, endorsed the former president ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Even before his victory in Iowa, the overwhelming majority of House and Senate endorsements were for Trump."
2614,O767M4NHYX_VA9W9K7KGEY14BX,Watch: Donald Trump 'honoured' by DeSantis endorsement,Tony Diver,"January 22, 2024 at 7:04 PM·15 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-suspends-2024-presidential-campaign-201239198.html,"Donald Trump’s campaign said he was “honoured” to be endorsed by Ron DeSantis, after the Florida governor dropped out of the Republican primary race on Sunday and admitted he did not have a “clear path forward to victory”.
In a surprise move, Mr DeSantis suspended his campaign two days before the New Hampshire primary vote, where he was expected to suffer heavy losses to both Mr Trump and Nikki Haley.
In a statement posted on X on Sunday afternoon, Mr DeSantis gave Mr Trump his endorsement for the presidency, referencing his earlier promise to support any Republican nominee in the general election.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said, adding that while he had “disagreements” with the former president, he was a better choice than Joe Biden.
He criticised Ms Haley, who polls show is currently in second place in the state, declaring that her “corporatism” would make her a poor president.
Mr DeSantis thanked his family and campaign staff, and repeated the themes of his campaign.
“We launched this campaign to bring accountability to government, regain sovereignty at our border and restore sanity to our society,” he said.
“We cannot succeed as a country if we allow our nation to be invaded, our currency to be debased, our cities to crumble and our kids to be indoctrinated.
“The DC elites who facilitated this mess, do not care about you, and they do not work for you.”
Welcoming the endorsement, Mr Trump’s campaign said: “With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates.
“It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.”
Mr Trump himself added that his derogatory nickname for his rival - “Ron DeSanctimonius” - was “officially retired”.
Ms Haley said Mr DeSantis has “run a great race” and repeated her campaign message that the primary was now a contest between her and Mr Trump.
She said: “All the fellas are out, and this comes down to: What do you want? Do you want more of the same? Or do you want something different?”
Read all the updates below to see how the news unfolded
We’re closing this blog now, but here is a reminder of what has happened this evening.
Ron DeSantis announced he was suspending his presidential campaign, in a surprise move that leaves Nikki Haley the only contender left to beat Donald Trump in the primary.
The Florida governor praised Mr Trump in a lukewarm endorsement, telling supporters that he would be a better president than Joe Biden. He reminded Republicans he had promised to support whichever nominee the party chose.
Mr Trump welcomed the endorsement and promised to stop ridiculing him. Ms Haley said his decision to withdraw reinforced her message that the campaign is a “two-horse race”.
Just two days remain before the New Hampshire primary, which analysts say is the last opportunity for Ms Haley to demonstrate she could beat Mr Trump to the nomination. If she performs poorly here, the party will hold a coronation for Mr Trump at this summer’s Republican National Convention.
As Ron DeSantis’s presidential dream comes to an end (for now), it’s a good time to share this interview from last year, with Allister Heath.
In the piece, the Florida governor talks wokery, Disney and why Britain feels like a second home to him.
You can read it here.
Ron DeSantis was seen as a distant third-place finisher in New Hampshire even before ending his campaign today.
The Florida governor visited the state for the first time as a major 2024 primary candidate in June. After his 30-point drubbing in Iowa, where he had committed most of his time and resources, he surrendered New Hampshire before a single vote was cast.
Mr DeSantis actually spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, which hosts its primary election in five weeks.
But dismal poll numbers don’t mean DeSantis had no support at all in New Hampshire.
With him having aimed for the most conservative factions in the GOP coalition and then endorsing Donald Trump, it’s possible his formal departure adds votes to the former president’s vote totals.
Could that be the difference between Trump managing a narrow victory over Haley or garnering a clear majority that he then uses to declare the nomination a done deal before Haley gets her home-state shot at him?
Ron DeSantis had reckoned on a Republican Party that had tired of the 77-year-old, criminally indicted Mr Trump, but it took just one state to vote in the party’s nomination contest to shatter that illusion.
He staked all on Iowa, a state where evangelical Christians decide its victors. He championed family values with his central casting wife and children in tow, and a dedication to service as he stressed his military career.

Bob Good, the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, has issued a statement endorsing Donald Trump just minutes after Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign.

In his only direct reaction to the news - other than a statement from his campaign - Donald Trump has posted a poll showing he would be more likely to beat Joe Biden in a head-to-head race.
The graphic is designed to dispel one of Mr Haley’s main campaign lines - that she would beat Mr Biden by a landslide, while Mr Trump and Mr Biden are even and “within the margin of error”.
Here is the full statement released by the Trump campaign just now:
“With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honoured by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates. It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.
“Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement. From higher taxes, to decimating Social Security and Medicare, and to open borders, she represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans.
“It’s time to choose wisely.”
Nikki Haley has said Ron DeSantis “ran a great race” as she told a crowd in New Hampshire: “There’s now one fella, and one lady left”.
Speaking to supporters on a campaign stop, she said: “He ran a great race, he was a good governor, and we wish him well.
“Having said that, there were fourteen people in this race. There were a lot of fellas.
“All the fellas are out, and this comes down to: What do you want? Do you want more of the same? Or do you want something different?”
The Trump campaign swiftly turned its fire onto Nikki Haley and what it described as her “dopy chief surrogate”, New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu, writes David Millward.
“If Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire - there are only two options,” the campaign said in an email to supporters.
“Option A:  Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden (where, in the latest Harvard-Harris poll, Trump bests Biden by double the margin a now-fictional Haley vs. Biden match-up would be).
“Option B:  Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina after she gets zippo votes or delegates in Nevada, because Haley entered the Nevada Primary, rather than the Nevada Caucus, where 100% of the state’s delegates are actually awarded.”
Never Back Down - the Super PAC supporting Ron DeSantis’s presidential bid - has released a statement on his withdrawal from the race.
Like him, they note that he had promised to support the successful Republican nominee, and appear to suggest this is the only reason he is now backing Donald Trump.
The group also refers to Mr DeSantis as “THE conservative candidate”, in a swipe at the former president.

It is “kind of amazing how poorly” the DeSantis 2024 campaign went, Christopher Galdieri, professor of politics at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, told my colleague David Millward.
“He spent from the start of Covid into his second term as the one true Trump alternative, he would offer everything people liked about Trump without the chaos, but it just didn’t come together.
“A lot of the hard core culture war stuff  he was doing was not appealing to mainstream Americans. It gave Trump the opportunity to appear more  reasonable.”
This afternoon’s video on X came with a short message from the Florida governor, apparently quoting Winston Churchill.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,” he wrote.
While the campaign is obviously not continuing, the quote may be a nod at a possible run for Mr DeSantis in the 2028 presidential race.
There are already Republican strategists who believe he wasted his campaign this time, and should have waited until Donald Trump was out of the frame.
Alas, the quote appears to be apocryphal. The International Churchill Society says on its website that the former prime minister never said those words, after “careful research in the canon of fifty million words by and about Churchill, including all of his books, articles, speeches and papers”.
The surprise exit of Ron DeSantis, two days before the Republican primary, is a boost for Nikki Haley.
For days she has been telling audiences that the primary is a “two-horse race” between her and Donald Trump - but now that is actually true.
However, there is unlikely to be much crossover between her supporters and his, and this result is more likely to entrench Mr Trump’s lead even further.
The battle for her campaign will now be to convince Trump sceptics in the Republican Party, and maybe even some of his supporters, that she would do a better job.
Ron DeSantis had become known for his love of aggressive slogans about woke culture and the Washington elite, and his video withdrawing from the Republican primary race provided a few more of them.
He took some time to tell his supporters that he was dropping out - first delivering a short speech about what he believed he achieved and the purpose of his campaign.
“We launched this campaign to bring accountability to government, regain sovereignty at our border and restore sanity to our society,” he said.
“We cannot succeed as a country if we allow our nation to be invaded, our currency to be debased, our cities to crumble and our kids to be indoctrinated.
“The DC elites who facilitated this mess, do not care about you, and they do not work for you,” he continued.
“They work for themselves. They seek to accumulate power at your expense, to pursue an agenda that is harmful to the American people. Citizens do not serve politicians. It is the duty of politicians to serve you.”
The latest polling from New Hampshire was not looking good for Ron DeSantis. Although he came second in Iowa -- by a whisker -- his campaign had dedicated almost all of its resources to the first state in the hope of gaining some momentum.
The dominance of Donald Trump in Iowa and his poor polling numbers in later states has clearly forced the Florida governor’s hand.
Here is how the polls looked as of this morning:

Ron DeSantis’s statement supporting Donald Trump is hardly a ringing endorsement of his old rival.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden,” he said.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honour that pledge.
“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear, or repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.
“The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology, are over.”
The first sign that Mr DeSantis was planning to withdraw came on Saturday night, when he cancelled two scheduled media interviews on CNN and NBC, while Never Back Down, his Super PAC, cancelled events in New Hampshire, citing scheduling issues.
Mr Trump’s campaign seized on the apparent turmoil in Mr DeSantis’s camp, with staff posting online that the “end is near”.
Mr DeSantis’s decision came as polls showed he was expected to receive around six per cent of votes in the New Hampshire primary, where Mr Trump and Ms Haley are competing for first place.
His campaign has suffered in recent days following a disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses last Tuesday, where he secured 21 per cent of the vote and only narrowly beat Ms Haley.
Mr DeSantis had poured significant resources into Iowa, hoping to be in contention to win the vote or close that gap between himself and Mr Trump, who won a landslide.
Ron DeSantis has withdrawn from the Republican primary race, leaving just Donald Trump and Nikki Haley battling for the nomination ahead of New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday.
The Florida governor said he did not have “a clear path to victory” and was suspending his campaign to endorse Donald Trump.
In a video posted on X, he said that while he had “had disagreements with Donald Trump”, he was “superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden”.
“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear,” he said.
“Following our second place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward,” he said.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a more favourable outcome – more campaign stops, more interviews – I would do it.
“But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory.
“Accordingly, I am now suspending my campaign.”

The 2024 frontrunner discussed beating GOP rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who came in second, and former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who came in third in the Iowa primary.
Trump hit back at Haley after she questioned the former commander-in-chief’s mental capacity after he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally this week.
""She’s just trying to get a little nasty because she came in third place. She wanted to come in second. And she wasn’t even that close, actually, to second. You know, I have to give that to Ron De-sanctimonious,"" Trump said, referring to his penchant for coming up with nicknames for his opponents. Most recently, Trump referred to Haley – the daughter of Indian immigrants – as ""Nimbra,"" referring to her birth name of ""Nimrata.""
FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY SAYS IT'S ‘ABSOLUTELY’ POSSIBLE FORMER PRESIDENT IS CONVICTED
Haley earned 21,085 caucus votes, or just under 20% in Iowa, putting her behind second-place finisher Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had 23,420 votes, or 21.2%. Trump trounced all of his challengers, winning an outright majority at 51%, with 56,260 votes in a historic caucus victory that resoundingly confirmed his frontrunner status.

That frontrunner status was further cemented later Sunday when DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump.
Responding to Haley’s assertion that Trump’s political indictments have become a liability on the campaign trail, Trump dismissed them as ""Biden indictments.""
""He is bad for democracy … He is very dangerous,"" Trump said of his Democratic rival in the White House. ""He can’t win fair and square. The guy can’t put two sentences together.""
Trump also took shots at Fani Willis, the Fulton County District Attorney who was accused of having an improper romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to prosecute the election interference case against the former president.
""They did this. This is all political stuff, and it’s a very bad thing for our country,"" Trump said. ""And remember, that goes the other way too. If a Republican gets in … they can do the same thing to a Democrat.""
On the question of a potential pick for vice president, Trump said: ""There’s no rush to that.""
New Hampshire’s first-in-the nation primary comes Tuesday, January 23 – just two days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was suspending his campaign.

“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear,” DeSantis said in a video released Sunday on X, formerly Twitter. The Florida governor described Trump as the preferable alternative to President Joe Biden or Nikki Haley, the last remaining rival to Trump in the GOP primaries.
His exit from the race is a stunning blow to the political fortunes of a candidate who just two years ago won a second term as governor in a landslide election and stepped onto the national stage heralded by big-dollar Republican donors as the future of the party.
New polling from CNN and the University of New Hampshire showed DeSantis earning just 6% of the state’s Republican vote, with Trump at 50% and Haley, the former South Carolina governor, at 39%.
“I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory,” DeSantis said in the video.
Trump said he was honored by the endorsement, urging “all Republicans to rally behind” his candidacy and help defeat Biden in November.
“Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement,” Trump said in a statement. “It’s time to choose wisely.”
Haley addressed DeSantis’ exit during a campaign stop shortly after his announcement.
“I want to say to Ron, you ran a great race,” Haley said to cheering crowds. “It’s now one fella and one lady left.”
Some donors wanted DeSantis to preserve political capital so he could potentially run for president again in 2028. The Florida governor is only 45 years old, and donors see potential for him to seek higher office again when Trump is no longer on the ballot.
Once flush with cash and projecting bravado, DeSantis was considered the heir apparent to Trump and the former president’s most formidable challenger when he joined the race in May.
DeSantis has expressed regret over his early campaign media strategy where he avoided mainstream media, preferring instead to speak to conservative outlets.
“I should have just been blanketing. I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything,” he told radio host, Hugh Hewitt, on a recent show.
Money Woes
DeSantis’ operation was wracked by internal turmoil, including fights over messaging and strategy between the campaign based out of Tallahassee and the main super political action committee backing him, Never Back Down. It also became mired in leadership shakeups and a cash crunch.
Donors were rattled as DeSantis team’s burned through cash even as he began losing ground in the polls, leading him to lay off staff, reshuffle top aides and focus his strategy on early voting states, in particular Iowa. Many of his donors moved to back other candidates in the GOP field.
In the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, two newer super PACs, Fight Right and Good Fight, booked millions of dollars in advertisements in the state, highlighting the clash between the campaign and Never Back Down.
DeSantis and aides insisted they had money to stay in the race until at least early March but the Iowa loss raised fresh doubts among donors. In the days following the caucuses, DeSantis moved most of his team to South Carolina, largely ceding the New Hampshire contest to Trump and Haley.

Our GOP presidential primary is our election in the Heart of Dixie. We are a one-party state, especially in presidential races. Alabama is one of a group of states that will hold its primary early, March 5 to be exact. Therefore, we will be going to the polls in less than two months to vote for a presidential nominee.
The presidential contest will more than likely be a rematch between Joe Biden, the sitting Democratic president, and Donald Trump, the Republican former president. Americans are not too enthused to see this rematch. I have never seen such a weird presidential matchup or unusual scenario in my lifetime.
More: These Alabama leaders are poised to make a mark in 2024 | INSIDE THE STATEHOUSE
The old political truism, “more people vote against someone than for someone,” will definitely come into play in this presidential race. More people would rather vote for anyone than Trump or Biden. I have never seen two candidates for president with this high negative polling numbers. Indeed, if Republicans were to nominate anyone besides Trump, they would beat Biden. By the same token, if the Democrats were to nominate anyone besides Biden, they would beat Trump. If indeed Biden and Trump are the nominees, you will see a low voter turnout come November.
As I remind you every four years, we do not elect our president by direct vote. You vote for electors who go to an Electoral College and cast their votes. Under the “winner-take-all” Electoral College System, if a candidate wins a state by one vote, they get all of that state's electoral votes.
We have become such a polarized partisan electorate there are fewer than 10 of our 50 states that matter in a presidential contest. The race for president will be determined in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa and Georgia. The few truly independent voters left in these pivotal swing states will decide the presidency. Both parties will concentrate their efforts and resources in these states.
The straight party lockstep voting mentality of American voters has become so entrenched that in at least 40 states the race for president has been predetermined. As I have often said, “If Mickey Mouse were the Republican nominee, he would carry Alabama. By the same token, if Donald Duck were the Democratic nominee, he would carry California.” It will be fun to watch.
We do not have many good races to watch in Alabama. We have four seats on our state Supreme Court up for election this year. However, popular Republican Justices Will Sellers, Jay Mitchell and Tommy Bryan are all running unopposed and will be back for six more years. Justice Sarah Stewart is opting to run for chief justice, leaving her seat open. It will be filled by Republican Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Chris McCool, who like Sellers, Mitchell and Bryan garnered no opponent, Democrat or Republican.
The chief justice race is the only contested Supreme Court Seat. Sarah Stewart has two opponents, Bryan Taylor and Jerry Michael Blevins.
The Democrats have fielded a candidate in the chief Justice race. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin will be on the ballot. However, winning a statewide race in the Heart of Dixie as a Democrat is difficult, to say the least, and not only improbable, but maybe impossible. There are 29 elected statewide positions in Alabama; all 29 are held by a Republican.
There are two Republican assistant attorney generals, Thomas Govan and Rich Anderson, running for Chris McCool’s seat on the Court of Criminal Appeals. Both are well-qualified for this appellate post.
Under the federal court’s decision to realign Alabama's congressional district lines to try to create a new minority Democratic district in the state, all of our powerful incumbent congressmen have altered districts. However, our veteran seniority member’s districts have probably been enhanced to their benefit.
Republican congressmen Robert Aderholt, Mike Rogers, and freshman Republican Dale Strong have no or token opposition. Democratic congresswoman Terri Sewell is also getting a free ride.
This is not the case in the newly drawn 1st District. Two incumbent Republican congressmen, Jerry Carl (Mobile/Baldwin) and Wiregrass Republican Barry Moore were placed into the same district. They will be pitted against each other in a March 5 primary contest that will be decided that day, since it is a super-Republican district.
By far the biggest race in Alabama this year will be for the newly drawn open 2nd Congressional District in Montgomery to Mobile. We will discuss that race next week.

2636,P0MAHDW6G5_935P3ZW4Y21I5QT,"In small-town Wisconsin, looking for the roots of the modern American conspiracy theory",TIM SULLIVAN,"January 21, 2024 at 9:12 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/small-town-wisconsin-looking-roots-121208885.html,"APPLETON, Wis. (AP) — The decades fall away as you open the front doors.
It’s the late 1950s in the cramped little offices — or maybe the pre-hippie 1960s. It’s a place where army-style buzz cuts are still in fashion, communism remains the primary enemy and the decor is dominated by American flags and portraits of once-famous Cold Warriors.
At the John Birch Society, they’ve been waging war for more than 60 years against what they're sure is a vast, diabolical conspiracy. As they tell it, it’s a plot with tentacles that reach from 19th-century railroad magnates to the Biden White House, from the Federal Reserve to COVID vaccines.
Long before QAnon, Pizzagate and the modern crop of politicians who will happily repeat apocalyptic talking points, there was Birch. And outside these cramped small-town offices is a national political landscape that the Society helped shape.
“We have a bad reputation. You know: ‘You guys are insane,’” says Wayne Morrow, a Society vice president. He is standing in the group’s warehouse amid 10-foot (3-meter) shelves of Birch literature waiting to be distributed.
“But all the things that we wrote about are coming to pass.”
___
Back when the Cold War loomed and TV was still mostly in black and white, the John Birch Society mattered. There were dinners at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and meetings with powerful politicians. There was a headquarters on each coast, a chain of bookstores, hundreds of local chapters, radio shows, summer camps for members’ children.
Well-funded and well-organized, they sent forth fevered warnings about a secret communist plot to take over America. It made them heroes to broad swaths of conservatives, even as they became a punchline to a generation of comedians.
“They created this alternative political tradition,” says Matthew Dallek, a historian at George Washington University and author of ""Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right.” He says it forged a right-wing culture that fell, at first, well outside mainstream Republican politics.
Conspiracy theories have a long history in the United States, going back at least to 1800, when secret forces were said to be backing Thomas Jefferson’s presidential bid. It was a time when such talk moved slowly, spread through sermons, letters and tavern visits.
No more. Fueled by social media and the rise of celebrity conspiracists, the last two decades have seen ever-increasing numbers of Americans lose faith in everything from government institutions to journalism. And year after year, ideas once relegated to fringe newsletters, little-known websites and the occasional AM radio station pushed their way into the mainstream.
Today, outlandish conspiracy theories are quoted by more than a few U.S. senators, and millions of Americans believe the COVID pandemic was orchestrated by powerful elites. Prominent cable news commentators speak darkly of government agents seizing citizens off the streets.
But the John Birch Society itself is largely forgotten, relegated to a pair of squat buildings along a busy commercial street in small-town Wisconsin.
So why even take note of it today? Because many of its ideas — from anger at a mysterious, powerful elite to fears that America’s main enemy was hidden within the country, biding its time — percolated into pockets of American culture over the last half-century. Those who came later simply out-Birched the Birchers. Says Dallek: “Their successors were politically savvier and took Birch ideas and updated them for contemporary politics.”
The result has been a new political terrain. What was once at the edges had worked its way toward the heart of the discourse.
To some, the fringe has gone all the way to the White House. In the Society's offices, they’ll tell you that Donald Trump would never have been elected if they hadn’t paved the way.
“The bulk of Trump’s campaign was Birch,” Art Thompson, a retired Society CEO who remains one of its most prominent voices, says proudly. “All he did was bring it out into the open.”
There’s some truth in that, even if Thompson is overstating things.
The Society had spent decades calling for a populist president who would preach patriotism, oppose immigration, pull out of international treaties and root out the forces trying to undermine America. Trump may not have realized it, but when he warned about a “Deep State” — a supposed cabal of bureaucrats that secretly controls U.S. policy — he was repeating a longtime Birch talking point.
A savvy reality TV star, Trump capitalized on a conservative political landscape that had been shaped by decades of right-wing talk radio, fears about America’s seismic cultural shifts and the explosive online spread of misinformation.
While the Birch Society echoes in that mix, tracing those echoes is impossible. It's hard to draw neat historical lines in American politics. Was the Society a prime mover, or a bit player? In a nation fragmented by social media and offshoot groups by the dozens, there’s just no way to be sure. What is certain, though, is this:
“The conspiratorial fringe is now the conspiratorial mainstream,” says Paul Matzko, a historian and research fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “Right-wing conspiracism has simply outgrown the John Birch Society.”
___
Their beliefs skip along the surface of the truth, with facts and rumors and outright fantasies banging together into a complex mythology. “The great conspiracy” is what Birch Society founder Robert Welch called it in “The Blue Book,” the collection of his writings and speeches still treated as near-mystical scripture in the Society’s corridors.
Welch, a wealthy candy company executive, formed the Society in the late 1950s, naming it for an American missionary and U.S. Army intelligence officer killed in 1945 by communist Chinese forces. Welch viewed Birch as the first casualty of the Cold War. Communist agents, he said, were everywhere in America.
Welch shot to prominence, and infamy, when he claimed that President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the hero general of World War II, was a “dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.” Also under Kremlin control, Welch asserted: the secretary of state, the head of the CIA, and Eisenhower’s younger brother Milton.
Subtlety has never been a strong Birch tradition. Over the decades, the Birch conspiracy grew to encompass the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, public education, the United Nations, the civil rights movement, The Rockefeller Foundation, the space program, the COVID pandemic, the 2020 presidential election and climate-change activism. In short, things the Birchers don't like.
The plot’s leaders — “insiders,” in Society lexicon — range from railroad baron Cornelius Vanderbilt to former President George H.W. Bush and Bill Gates, whose vaccine advocacy is, they say, part of a plan to control the global population. While his main focus was always communism, Welch eventually came to believe that the conspiracy's roots twisted far back into history, to the Illuminati, an 18th-century Bavarian secret society.
By the 1980s, the Society was well into its decline. Welch died in 1985 and the society’s reins passed to a series of successors. There were internal revolts. While its aura has waned, it is still a force among some conservatives — its videos are popular in parts of right-wing America, and its offices include a sophisticated basement TV studio for internet news reports. Its members speak at right-wing conferences and work booths at the occasional county fair.
Scholars say its ranks are far reduced from the 1960s and early 1970s, when membership estimates ranged from 50,000 to 100,000. “Membership is something that has been closely guarded since day one,” says Bill Hahn, who became CEO in 2020. He will only say the organization “continues to be a growing operation.”
Today, the Society frames itself as almost conventional. Almost.
“We have succeeded in attracting mainstream people,” says Steve Bonta, a top editor for the Society’s New American magazine. The group has toned down the rhetoric and is a little more careful these days about throwing around accusations of conspiracies. But members still believe in them fiercely.
“As Mr. Welch came out with on Day One: There is a conspiracy,” Hahn says. “It’s no different today than it was back in December 1958.”
It can feel that way. Ask about the conspiracy’s goal, and things swerve into unexpected territory. The sharp rhetoric re-emerges and, once again, the decades seem to fall away.
“They really want to cut back on the population of the Earth. That is their intent,” Thompson says.
But why?
“Well, that’s a good question, isn’t it?” he responds. “It makes no sense. But that’s the way they think.”

2642,PARFRYE9U5_57H1BTVJ17U0B74,Lauren Boebert switched districts in a bid to stay in Congress. Winning over voters won't be easy,JESSE BEDAYN,"January 21, 2024 at 9:52 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/lauren-boebert-switched-districts-bid-125220371.html,"LAST CHANCE, Colo. (AP) — Fleeing a tough reelection bid in the district where she lives, Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert is moving from the mountains to the plains, in the hopes of finding conservative pastures green enough to salvage her place in Congress.
To win, she'll have to convince a new swath of voters that her brand of white-hot, far-right political activism — built on divisive one-liners and partisan ferocity in the U.S. House — is more needed in Washington than the home-grown Republicans she now faces in the primary.
While Boebert's new district voted for President Donald Trump by a nearly 20 percentage point margin in 2020, more than double the margin in her old district, and some Republican voters are already admirers, others are greeting her with hands-on-hips skepticism.
“She feels she is a better candidate than the ones that we have,” said Robin Varhelman, seated behind a desk at the cattle auction she owns in Brush. “She’s gonna have to explain to people why.”
Varhelman, flanked by the massive head of a bull named Big Red she used to rope, with a cap reading “USA Trump” hanging from its right ear, said she wasn’t sure if Boebert made the switch for the good of the state or her own survival.
After Boebert eked out a victory by just 546 votes in 2022, her home district moved from Republican-leaning to a toss-up for 2024 — threatening the GOP’s already threadbare control of the U.S. House.
The narrow margin in Congress leaves both major parties fighting fiercely for every available seat in 2024. Boebert's move to the new district, where she'll have to take on at least nine other Republicans for her party's nomination, probably gives the GOP a better chance to win both.
That's part of her reason for switching, she said in a phone interview, but she gave another reason for jumping into a race that's already considered safely Republican: “There is need for my voice in Congress.""
After attacking the Democrat who nearly upset her in 2022 as the beneficiary of outside money, Boebert has become the outsider and will have to live down the “carpetbagger” label that her new opponents are already lobbing her way.
Boebert’s abdication came after a video surfaced last year of the congresswoman vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater, which rattled even devoted supporters as she barreled toward an election rematch against Adam Frisch. The Democrat she nearly lost to in 2022 had received triple her campaign donations in this year’s race, benefiting tangibly from her disruptive profile, which grated on donors far beyond state and district borders.
“I can read the tea leaves,” Boebert said. “I don’t want the left to have a chance to buy the seat from us, and their only argument is me.”
Number crunchers, political experts and the National Republican Campaign Committee generally agree that Boebert’s exodus will give Republicans a better chance to retain that district — though newly elected NRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson said the organization had no hand in the decision.
Frisch said he’s “taking a bit of a victory lap” after Boebert's retreat, and is plugging ahead with the same bipartisan platform, buoyed by at least $7.7 million in his campaign coffers. Frisch is expected to face Jeff Hurd — a mild-mannered conservative in the old GOP tradition, who said his goal is “making local headlines, not national headlines.”
In Boebert’s new district, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has endorsed her candidacy, and the NRCC is treating her as an incumbent. Less happy with the switch is Republican state Rep. Richard Holtorf, now one of her opponents.
“By Lauren Boebert district shopping and becoming a carpetbagger so she can keep her office in D.C., she has now become part of the swamp,” he said.
Whether Boebert will join the ranks of American politicians who have relocated and won remains unclear.
That road is littered with many who “could never quite convince voters that they were in this for something other than their own ambition,” said Christopher Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, who wrote a book on American politicians who’ve picked up and moved races.
Boebert does have some things working in her favor — she’s not leaving Colorado, she’s a known conservative gladiator on national issues such as immigration and reducing the national debt, and she’s a dedicated acolyte for Trump, whose popularity among rural Republicans remains high.
Rancher Dawn Whitney, who attended one of Varhelman’s recent auctions, said Boebert’s flag-bearing for conservative, Christian and agrarian values is already enough to earn her vote.
“Ranchers and farmers are pretty much the same everywhere,” said Whitney, her calloused hands busy at a word search puzzle as the auctioneer chanted.
“As long as she is country related, I think she’ll be fine,” said Whitney, who cited a well-worn reason voters cling to Boebert: Rural residents often feel their political power slipping and see an outspoken champion in Boebert.
“She don’t back down,” she said.
Still, Boebert is joining a race that is practically guaranteed to elect a Republican anyway, said Galdieri. In effect, that means she’s pushing aside “homegrown options” to run in a safer district.
“Voters notice that,” he said.
While some voters — even if they chafed at Boebert’s style — weren’t as miffed that she changed districts, the June Republican primary is where her opponents can do the most damage. Along with Holtorf, she’ll face Mike Lynch, minority leader in Colorado’s House of Representatives.
“I was a fan of Lauren Boebert when she first got there,” he said. “And then I think, for lack of a better term, she drank the Kool-Aid and became what she was fighting.”
Boebert’s retort is unwavering.
“If there’s anyone who takes on the swamp, it’s me,"" she said. “I’m the only candidate in this race who’s actually done the work.""
Nodding to part of the challenge ahead, she added, “I’m excited to meet people and learn more about the nitty gritty local issues.”
While a segment of the new district’s voters is in a more urban center south of Denver, the region stretches across Colorado’s prairie east of the Rocky Mountains — where some folks’ great-grandparents ate dinner beneath tablecloths during the Dust Bowl. A half-century ago, grandparents wrestled their calves out of blistering winter chills, just as their descendants were doing this week, and as their own children will do as long as things hold steady.
Though Boebert might be escaping tough electoral odds, voters in the new district hold tight to the traditional values borne from that history — the same values that Boebert stepped on in the groping episode at a musical production of “Beetlejuice"" in Denver.
That embarrassment was memorable enough to transcend district lines.
“I don’t really care either way what she does, but she’s definitely got to get some sh— together, getting thrown out of a theater,” said Mark Moorman, a Republican who bid at auction on a bull the size and weight of a small car.
Before she switched districts, Boebert had apologized up and down Colorado’s 3rd district as part of her last-ditch strategy against Frisch. She’d undertaken a local press tour and grassroots boot camps geared to emphasize her work on local issues.
Now, on new turf, “that’s totally out the window,” said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics in Denver. “She’s the national politics candidate. That is her weakness; that is her strength. She kind of has no choice.”
It’s the difference between Republican voter Debbie Spear — “She’s going to have the same target on her back wherever she goes, here, there, Texas. We don’t need that, what is she going to bring more than the candidates we have?” — and the passerby at a ranching store nearby, who shouted out: “The girl from Rifle? Hell, yeah.” ___

2646,PFE98PYY4R_50RFJW6MECR8CJ5,State of Texas: DOJ report finds law enforcement failures during and after Uvalde school shooting,Grace Gates,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 AM·18 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/state-texas-doj-report-finds-000000277.html,"AUSTIN (Nexstar) — The Department of Justice took a “minute-by-minute” approach in its investigation of law enforcement’s response to the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde. Its nearly 600-page report describes chaos, confusion and ignorance — all aspects that the Texas House of Representatives found within their own investigation released just weeks after the 2022 mass shooting.
RELATED: New DOJ report finds ‘cascading failures’ in law enforcement response to Uvalde school massacre
Thursday morning, the U.S. Department of Justice released its highly anticipated critical incident review of the active shooting at Robb Elementary School that killed 19 students and two teachers on May 24, 2022. The document reveals themes related to leadership failures on the day the Uvalde elementary shooting took place, as well as a lack of communication, collaboration and cooperation in the days and months following.
“I think that the DOJ report goes a long way in validating our concerns about the lack of communication, the lack of leadership,” said State Representative Joe Moody, vice chair of the Texas House of Representatives’ Investigation Committee on the Robb Elementary Shooting.
The House’s 77-page document uncovered the miscommunication among officers which led to a delay in stopping the shooter. “The scene was chaotic, without any person obviously in charge or directing the law enforcement response,” it reads.
KXAN’s coverage of the Uvalde school shooting
According to the DOJ report, the lack of structure not only contributed to the confusion and chaos during the incident, but also affected law enforcement’s post-incident response to preserving the integrity of the crime scene.
Only two law enforcement officers in leadership positions with the main responding agencies had training in Incident Command Systems (ICS) and National Incident Management Sytems (NIMS), according to the DOJ report.
Those two officers were Uvalde CISD Police Chief Pete Arredondo, who had completed 32 hours of training, and the Texas Department of Public Safety South Texas Regional Director Victor Escalon, who arrived shortly before the classroom was entered, had completed 88 hours, according to the report.
“In critical incidents, particularly events involving multiple jurisdictions and disciplines, the understanding and use of NIMS and ICS are essential to the successful sharing of information and coordination of resources, tactics, and investigations,” the DOJ report states.

“There were also failures in leadership, command, and coordination. None of the law enforcement leaders at the scene established an incident command structure to provide timely direction, control, and coordination,” the report states.
Neither Arredondo nor Escalon took steps to provide leadership to those in the room, according to the report.
Once children were finally rescued from the classrooms, a perimeter should have been established and direction with other leadership in the hallway should have been given by Escalon, according to the DOJ.
“The TXDPS regional director, and some other officers, walked past the law enforcement officers bringing injured and deceased victims out of the classrooms and entered classrooms 111 and 112 with no identifiable purpose or action, therefore compromising the crime scene,” the report states.
It wasn’t until a few minutes later that a Texas Ranger on scene took control and ordered all law enforcement out of the crime scene, according to the DOJ.
“The Texas Ranger appeared to be one of the few leaders on scene who attempted to coordinate with other agency personnel and ended up in different interactions with all the major responding agencies,” the report states.
Internal memos find ‘no fault’ in suspended Texas Ranger’s Uvalde response
According to the report, a Texas DPS captain present at the crime scene ordered another officer to create a log of names for anyone who enters the crime scene; however, “none of the officials filed reports after their walk-throughs, as is reportedly required by TXDPS.”
In addition to the integrity of the crime scene inside the school being jeopardized by leadership shortfalls, the DOJ report states DPS declined the FBI’s offer to assist with the collection of evidence from the car wrecked by the shooter. The report states there was an urgent need to preserve the crime scene with a forecasted major storm moving in.
As a result, “the storm brought heavy rainfall and winds that washed out the crime scene and compromised the evidence, which included one of the subject’s two rifles, casings from shooting at the funeral home employees, and other personal items inside the vehicle,” according to the DOJ.
KXAN found this wasn’t the only instance DPS refused help or denied other agencies information further delaying the investigative process, the report states.
The DOJ’s report states the FBI offered its victim specialists to help with the death notification process but were denied the ability to assist.
Officials react to DOJ report of Uvalde shooting response
“They were told “we got this” by TXDPS, even though the TXDPS staff was untrained in this process,” according to the DOJ report.
Furthermore, the report states local investigations have been delayed due to the unwillingness to cooperate with a request by the City of Uvalde for evidence necessary to their internal review.
“UPD’s internal investigation has been hampered by a lack of access to evidence that TXDPS was in possession of and not willing to share,” the report states.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that none of the 376 officers at the scene will face federal charges. One day after the release of the DOJ report, Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell called forth a grand jury to review evidence. Any charges related to the May 2022 shooting are left up to them.
The report states Texas DPS and other law enforcement agencies failed to communicate in a culturally sensitive manner with victims’ family members.
DOJ report: TX DPS official re-enacted Uvalde shooting in front of victims’ families
Key among these failures was a lack of information released in Spanish, death notices delivered by undertrained personnel and insensitive leadership, the report said.
According to Moody, the Texas House investigative committee also acknowledged a lack of information flow to families, especially those whose primary language is Spanish. The DOJ report says that press conferences were primarily held in English, despite requests for translation.
Moody explained that the House had planned to release English and Spanish reports at the same time but received word that families wanted the documents immediately, rather than waiting for the translation. A Spanish report was eventually published.
The federal agency also criticizes the Department of Public Safety for refusing to utilize resources from the FBI’s victim specialists. The report details one press conference where a DPS officer “re-enacted the shooting,” in front of victims and families.
IN-DEPTH: TX DPS official re-enacted Uvalde shooting in front of victims’ families
Moody emphasized that the DOJ was better able to delve into how Uvalde and DPS officials communicated with the public. “We certainly heard from some of the family members about, you know, the lack of care or lack of compassion,” he said. “There’s no right way to deliver such terrible information to people who have lost so much, but it certainly could have been better, should have been better.”
On Friday, the Texas Department of Public Safety released a statement thanking the DOJ “for the tremendous amount of time and attention it has put into compiling the critical incident review.”
“As DPS Director Steven McCraw first stated in the weeks after the shooting, the law enforcement response that day was an abject failure, and this report’s observations underscore those failures,” DPS said in its Friday statement. “The State of Texas has already implemented some of the recommendations proposed by the DOJ review in order to prevent tragedies in the future.”
A Travis County judge issued an order Friday for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to sit for a deposition on Feb. 1 in the lawsuit brought by four of his former employees. However, some of those plaintiffs and their attorneys expect Paxton to appeal.
Judge Jan Soifer said Paxton will have to appear for and answer questions in an oral deposition at an Austin law firm on that day starting at 9 a.m. She said she reached this decision because his office failed to negotiate with the plaintiffs’ attorneys over times to schedule the deposition.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton moves to end litigation in whistleblower lawsuit
The order also set dates for three of Paxton’s top employees: Feb. 2 for First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster, Feb. 7 for Chief of Staff Lesley French Henneke, and Feb. 9 for senior advisor Michelle Smith.
KXAN never received any responses after reaching out twice Friday seeking comment from the Office of the Attorney General about the judge’s latest order. This story will be updated once anything is shared.
This all comes a day after Paxton’s attorneys submitted a filing that they said aims to end the lawsuit the former employees brought against his office. It also follows the Texas Supreme Court denying Paxton’s request to block his deposition in the lawsuit from his former top-ranking deputies, who allege Paxton wrongfully terminated them after reporting him for alleged corruption to federal authorities.
Attorney TJ Turner, who represents whistleblower David Maxwell, shared his reaction Friday to this filing, calling it a “stunt” intended to block the deposition from happening.
“I think the last thing Ken Paxton wants to do is put a hand on his Bible and tell the truth, and he’s going to avoid that at all costs,” Turner said. “So I think there will be another legal maneuver, and we’ll wait and see what that is.
In their filing, Paxton’s attorneys emphasized his belief that he did nothing wrong, noting the Texas Senate acquitted him at his impeachment trial last year. They also argue that the former employees claims’ include are not protected by the state’s whistleblower protection law.
However, in the same document, they said Paxton’s office “hereby elects not to contest any issue of fact in this case” and “elects not to dispute the Plaintiffs’ lawsuit.”
That latter argument especially shocked Blake Brickman, a former deputy attorney general who’s now suing Paxton. He said he saw what Paxton wrote in the filing as “total vindication.”
“This is a total 180 that Ken Paxton has done. He is now saying he is not contesting our facts. The impeachment trial was based on our allegations, and now he’s saying what we said is true,” Brickman said. “The people of Texas really need to think about that. Conservative, rule-of-law Republicans really need to think about how disingenuous this attorney general is for him to say, actually, all these things are true now, right before he’s about to get deposed, after he went through the impeachment. It’s shocking. It really is.”
Brickman said he does anticipate Paxton to appeal the judge’s order. However, that last resulted in the Texas Supreme Court rejecting his request to avoid testifying under oath in the lawsuit.
If Paxton does eventually go under oath, though, he could invoke his Fifth Amendment right and not answer any questions. Mike Golden, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that could end up harming a defendant in a civil case like this.
“Here in a civil case, any witness, including the defendant or an employee defendant, can plead the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer any particular question. That’s protected by the Constitution, and they can’t be compelled to answer those questions,” Golden said. “But the flip side is, in the civil case, their refusal to answer that question gets used against them in court. The plaintiffs can argue to the jury: he didn’t answer this question because he knew the answer will be bad for him, and he didn’t answer 77 questions because he knew the answers were going to be bad for him. That’s the huge difference between how a criminal case works and a civil case [works].”
In new campaign finance reports released this week, Paxton detailed how he spent nearly $2.3 million in campaign funds to pay for his legal defense in his impeachment trial.
A round of frigid weather had many Texans facing subfreezing temperatures last week, and the Arctic blast led to record-breaking demand for electricity across the state. During those days, ERCOT called on Texans to conserve energy. But the state still set new records for power use.
Numbers from ERCOT show the previous peak energy demand record for January was set back in 2018. Back then, Texans set the record at just under 66-thousand megawatts. Last Sunday, January 14, the state shattered that record, with peak demand closing in on 71-thousand megawatts.
The next day, we shattered it again, with demand topping 76-thousand megawatts. Tuesday brought another record, with peak demand exceeding 78-thousand megawatts.
But the new records have some worried about future demand on the system. Politics reporter Ryan Chandler spoke with the CEO of ERCOT about how the state will meet the need for energy.
Ryan Chandler: Every time the supply and the demand on the grid gets a little too close, I notice that wind and solar are always the first scapegoats or points of blame — because maybe the sun isn’t out or there’s less wind than we expect. But you know, of course, back in February 2021, natural gas was also hindered by the extreme cold, as well. Can you break down how all of the different energy sources that feed our grid play into the overall supply and which are the most reliable this week?
Pablo Vegas, ERCOT CEO: Well, it’s really a question of needing to have all of the pieces of the puzzle working together in order to get through an event like this. And it’s really never our intent to try to place blame on any one source of energy. When we’re having challenges or when the grid gets tight, what we want to do is just try to explain facts as to what’s happening on the grid. Those facts can vary based on what the season is and what’s going on, and what time of day it is. For example, during the winter, we’re always going to see those peaks, typically when the sun goes down and things get very cold. So, obviously, solar resources won’t play a role in helping to deliver energy during those peaks in the wintertime.
And then, as we look at this week in particular, we really needed all of the pieces and parts to work together. So we needed the thermal power plants to be available, we needed the batteries to all be available and ready to go. And then wind is the main variable that we look at. That just depends on whether the wind is blowing for this event. The wind performance, the wind has been blowing a little bit less than what is seasonally normal this time of year. So that does help to contribute a little bit, but it’s not blame. It’s just the fact — the wind blows, sometimes it blows hard, and sometimes it doesn’t blow hard. But the windmills themselves, they’ve seen really good performance in terms of very little icing. So we haven’t been losing the available windmills to that kind of issue. So, all across the board, the electric supply fleet has really been performing very well during this week.
Ryan Chandler: Let’s talk long-term because this week we’re feeling pretty comfortable, but every December, January, February, people are still anxious ever since that February 2021 storm. Every time the temperatures plunge, we start worrying: ‘Are the lights going to stay on? Am I going to stay warm?’ What are we doing as a state and as a grid in the next 5, 10 years to make sure that when the temperatures drop, we don’t have to have this same conversation next year or the year after that?
Pablo Vegas, ERCOT CEO: We certainly know a couple of things are going to likely remain true. One is: Texas continues to grow economically year over year. Texas is doing really well. A lot of people are moving to the state, businesses are moving to the state. So that helps to drive electric demand up. As a result of that, it requires infrastructure investments across the board. We’ve seen the state legislature take up this issue and find ways to try to incentivize all different types of generation to get developed, including thermal dispatchable generation.
We’re already seeing a lot of growth on the electric grid from renewable sources. We’re seeing solar and wind growing on the electric grid year over year. We’re seeing batteries growing very rapidly on the electric grid. We’re seeing that every year, the additions of those resources, and they’re making a big difference during the summers as well as during the winters. If we can add to that and balance that growth with some thermal dispatchable resources, which is what some of the legislation that was passed in the last session enabled and incentivized, then we’re really going to be able to get to that place where we know we’re going to be able to address whether it’s the hottest day or the coldest winter without having as many reliability concerns as we sometimes do today.
Ryan Chandler: Are we seeing any impact from those investments? For people who may be unaware, the governor signed a pair of bills meant to provide loans and incentivize power plants to come to Texas and build more plants. It could cost as much as $18 billion, per some reports. Are we seeing any payoff from that investment? Any projects in the pipeline now?
Yeah, we’ve already seen some announcements made from companies that are going to start to build new gas-fired power plants as a result of that incentive that came through the legislation. The governor and I were just down in Houston a few weeks back (for) an announcement that Calpine made about an investment. They’re already making up their Freestone energy center. So, it’s definitely leading to companies making decisions to make investments and to help support the growing energy economy here in Texas.
Texas voters will begin heading to the polls in just over a month for the primary elections. Early voting begins on Feb. 20 for the March 5 primary. New polling is giving early insight into how voters feel about the issues and the candidates.
The Emerson College Polling/Nexstar Media poll asked 1,315 registered Texas voters about the upcoming presidential and senate primaries along with hypothetical November election scenarios.
The poll found a variety of concerns motivating Texans to vote this year. Immigration and border security was listed by 29% of voters as the top issue facing Texas. The economy finished second at 22%, followed by healthcare at 12% and education and abortion access both at 9%. Threats to democracy, crime and housing affordability were also named.
Among Democratic voters, a key primary race will determine who faces Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November. In the Senate primary, 29% of Democratic voters polled plan to support Representative Colin Allred. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez trails with 7% support in the poll, just ahead of the 6% supporting Nueces County District Attorney Mark Gonzalez. A plurality of voters (37%) are undecided ahead of the March primary.
While Allred has a double-digit lead over the other Democrats in the field, the poll still shows him short of the 50% threshhold to avoid a runoff to decide the nomination.
In a hypothetical general election between Allred and Senator Ted Cruz, Cruz holds 42% of the vote over Allred’s 40%, a statistical tie considering the poll’s credibility interval of +/- 2.6 percentage points. A race between Gutierrez and Cruz appears even closer, with Cruz receiving 41% and Gutierrez receiving 40% of support. In both cases, approximately 8% of voters choose someone else, and 11% are undecided.
The poll shows that Texas voters expect a November rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the presidential election. In the primary poll, President Biden won support from 72% of Texas Democrats, giving him a strong lead for the nomination. Marianne Williamson trails with 6%, followed by 5% for Dean Phillips.
Donald Trump leads the Republican primary with 69% of support from Texas voters. He’s trailed by former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley at 11% and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 9%. Trump is also ahead in a hypothetical general election battle, claiming 49% of the vote over Biden’s 41%.
Almost 90% of people in the Emerson College Polling/Nexstar Media poll said they were likely to vote in the upcoming state primary elections. That would be astonishingly high. Just 18% of registered voters participated in the 2022 primary election. In 2020, the last presidential primary year, 25% of Texas voters turned out for the March primary.
As of now, Texas is home to 17.9 million registered voters, about 81% of the voting age population. That’s over a million more potential voters than January 2020.

Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday dug into former President Trump following his apparent confusion about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing the former president has “lost the fastball.”
The comment came in response to a question by NBC “Meet the Press” anchor Kristen Welker, who pointed to Trump’s speech last week, when he appeared to confuse Haley and Pelosi while discussing the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.
“Look, whether it’s Joe Biden or Donald Trump … either one, get off the teleprompter, they can barely make a cogent point. I mean, really,” Sununu said.
Welker interjected to ask if Sununu was saying Trump is not mentally fit, to which the governor responded, “Not in that moment, he sure as heck wasn’t. I mean, look, the point is you have two nearly 80-year-olds fighting this thing out. That’s not what America wants.”
“That is a great example of, this is not Donald Trump, the disruptor of 2016. This guy has lost his fastball. You know, that’s a great example of it. We always want to go forward in America, right? We always want that next generation. Neither of these guys represent the next generation,” Sununu continued.
Sununu, whose state will hold its high-stakes primary on Tuesday, has endorsed Haley and appeared with her on the campaign trail in recent months. He came under criticism earlier this month, however, when he said he would support whomever the eventual Republican nominee is, even if it is Trump as a hypothetical convicted felon.
Haley also called out Trump’s mental fitness during another Sunday interview, arguing the former president’s mental fitness is “not at the same level” as it was the first time he won the White House in 2016.
A polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with a 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails far behind.

2656,PNYAT7T31Z_H0WM90RC8406ZX1,"Trump weighs in on border security deal, adding new pressure to Republicans in Congress","Riley Beggin, USA TODAY","January 21, 2024 at 7:52 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-weighs-border-security-deal-105211342.html,"WASHINGTON – Former President Donald Trump is trying to torpedo a bipartisan border security package, putting new pressure on Republicans to reject a deal that Senate negotiators have been crafting for months.
It’s the latest example of the former president leveraging his popularity within the GOP to influence Republican officeholders – even as he lacks any formal powers to set the political agenda. If Trump openly campaigns against it, Republicans will have a hard time supporting the border security deal that is now favored by many senators in their own party.
The proposal – which has not yet been finalized – would reportedly approve several conservative border priorities. The deal would call for stricter asylum standards and new deportation powers in exchange for a $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and other domestic and foreign goals that are related to the mission of keeping the country safe.
In an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson Wednesday night, Fox News host Laura Ingraham said Trump told her he was against the deal, that he’d urged Johnson to reject it, and that he was “extremely adamant” about it.
“He and I have been talking about this pretty frequently,” Johnson said, noting that he would reserve judgment on the deal until the bill text is out. But “it doesn’t sound good at the outset.”
Trump also posted to Truth Social Wednesday that he opposes a border package “unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION” at the southern border. He added that he has “no doubt” that Johnson will “only make a deal that is PERFECT ON THE BORDER.”
Trump’s comments are “certainly not helpful,” Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Thursday. “But in the end, people are going to have to do what they think is right to solve what is a major crisis at our southern border at a time when we have more leverage than we would ever have.”
Many Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have argued it is a unique moment to win conservative border policy, as Democrats won’t want to support new restrictions under Trump and have an incentive to address migration. In a CBS News poll released earlier this month, just 32% of Americans said they supported Biden’s handling of the border.
But that’s the same reason some House Republicans have opposed the package, arguing it would not only open the door to additional Ukraine aid, which several oppose, but that it could help Biden’s reelection prospects and take away a politically salient issue for Trump to campaign on.
That’s left Senate Republicans arguing that the package is a more conservative deal than they’d ever get with Trump in office – and that it wouldn’t hurt his prospects.
“I don’t think it’s going to be like turning off the spigot tomorrow if we were to pass something,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “This is going to long be an issue, including through the election. There’s a lot of other stuff to run on too … I don’t think you need to hold a gun to your own head and say ‘don’t make me do this.’”
Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Democrats won’t agree to conservative border priorities “without being forced to.”
“It doesn’t surprise me” that Trump is talking to Johnson about the deal, Rounds told USA TODAY. But “I think that the next administration, if it’s different than the Biden administration, will definitely want these tools in their arsenal.”
Johnson has not officially dismissed the bipartisan plan, which Senate leaders are hoping can come to the floor for a vote as early as this week. But he has said he would only support something that hews closely to House Republicans’ hardline border bill, which received no Democratic votes in the House and has no chance of survival in the Democrat-controlled Senate – making successful border policy this year even more out of reach.
Since leaving office at the beginning of 2021, Trump has repeatedly flexed his influence in the party that he reshaped during his first term in office.
In the months following Jan. 6, 2021 – when a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol after he repeatedly claimed he had won the election without evidence – many Republicans distanced themselves from the former president and condemned his lack of action to interrupt the riot.
But even then, only 10 Republican House members voted to impeach him and seven Republican senators voted to convict.
In the years since, those attitudes have softened and Trump’s power in the party has grown. In the 2022 midterm elections, he actively campaigned against those who he felt hadn’t been sufficiently loyal, with mixed success.
He’s weighed in on multiple Congressional fights, including the bid to replace former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. He has pushed members to take action that would benefit him or punish his opponents, such as impeaching Joe Biden or face being “immediately primaried.” He has fostered relationships with GOP members and personally asked for their endorsements, leading to more than half of the caucus endorsing him before the Iowa Caucuses.
Now, he remains the clear frontrunner to be the party’s nominee for president. He took more than half of the votes in Iowa, which was the first presidential nominating contest of the election season, and is likely to similarly dominate the New Hampshire primary this week.
“He’s the leading candidate to be president coming out of our party,” Rounds told reporters Thursday. “So most certainly, individuals here will give deference to someone who is the leading candidate to be the next president.”

2660,PTO72R94DS_YO2K18E2GD18CYT,Will bad weather keep New Hampshire voters home on Tuesday? Don't count on it,"Michael Collins and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY","January 22, 2024 at 8:00 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bad-weather-keep-hampshire-voters-230039503.html,"The good news for Republicans heading into Tuesday’s presidential primary in New Hampshire: GOP voters are projected to turn out in record numbers.
The good news for all New Hampshire voters planning to go to the polls: There's no snow in the Election Day forecast.
Not that it would matter.
“New Hampshire voters don't seem to care too much about what the weather's doing,” said Nathan Shrader, a political scientist at New England College and co-director of the school’s Center for Civic Engagement. “If they have their minds made up about voting and participating, they're going to do it. These are some of the most civically minded people I've ever met.”
Counting the vote: Will results of the New Hampshire primary be delayed? What to know.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican who oversees elections in the state, predicted Friday that 322,000 people could vote in the GOP primary. That’s roughly 53% of the total number of registered Republicans and voters who haven’t declared a preference for either party.
It also would set a new state record. The previous record was set by Democrats in 2020, when about 297,000 votes were cast in the contested Democratic primary.
Before that, it was Republicans who held the record. In 2016, the first time Donald Trump was a candidate for president, a record of more than 287,000 people – or 44% of eligible voters registered as Republican or undeclared – voted in the GOP primary. Four years later, when Trump sought re-election and faced nominal opposition, GOP turnout was 23%.
Trump is back on the ballot on Tuesday, with polls giving him a comfortable lead over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Republican voters are eagerly engaged in the contest this year, Shrader said, because they see a chance to do one of two things: Give Trump a big win that would all but make the GOP nomination his and allow him to focus more quickly on the general election in November. Or give Haley an unexpected victory or a close second-place finish that would prolong the nominating process for a few more weeks.
“New Hampshire voters relish that opportunity,” Shrader said.
A record GOP showing in New Hampshire could help ease concerns raised by last week’s Iowa Republican caucuses, which had considerably low turnout. Roughly 110,00 registered Republican voters took part in the Iowa caucuses, down from a record 187,000 voters in 2016.
The low turnout was widely considered to be the result of Iowa’s extreme cold and snow. Lagging turnout in New Hampshire could raise questions about Republican enthusiasm.
Shrader doesn’t expect that to happen, though.
The weather forecast doesn’t call for any snow in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Even if it did snow, that probably wouldn’t be enough to keep most voters at home, Shrader said.
“Voters here take this so seriously, their roles so seriously, I don't think they allow challenging weather conditions to keep them away from the polls,” he said.
'Conservative all my life': With her candidacy on the line, Haley takes on Trump in New Hampshire
Democrats, meanwhile, haven’t been all that enthusiastic their Granite State primary, Shrader said, since their leading candidate, President Joe Biden, won’t be on the ballot.
Biden, who is seeking a second term, isn’t competing in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary because of a disagreement between state and national Democrats over which state should lead the nominating process. The Democratic National Committee, at Biden’s request, wanted South Carolina to go first. New Hampshire went ahead and scheduled its primary earlier than allowed, which national Democrats said violated the rules.
As a result, Biden decided to skip New Hampshire, but a group of volunteers unaffiliated with his campaign has launched a write-in campaign.
Still, Democratic turnout is expected to be lower than in previous years. Scanlan projected that 88,000 people would vote in the Democratic primary. That’s just 14% of the total number of Democrats and undeclared voters. For comparison, turnout on the Democratic side was 43% in 2020 and 41% in 2016.
As of Friday, New Hampshire has 873,357 registered voters: 267,768 registered Republicans, 261,254 registered Democrats and 344,335 undeclared voters for either party. Scanlon projects that overall turnout on Tuesday should be around 47%.

Ron DeSantis of Florida dropped out of the GOP presidential race on Sunday.
The onetime rival to Trump used a purported Winston Churchill quote in his announcement video.
According to the International Churchill Society, the quote is fake.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida ended his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed former President Donald Trump.
Much like his disappointing campaign, perhaps one of the worst in history, DeSantis' video announcing the suspension missed the mark by including an apparently fake Winston Churchill quote.
""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" DeSantis wrote in a tweet accompanying his video, attributing the quote to Churchill.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”- Winston Churchill pic.twitter.com/ECoR8YeiMm
— Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantis) January 21, 2024
But as many people quickly pointed out, the International Churchill Society debunked the legitimacy of the quote over a decade ago.
""Not only did Churchill never say those words — he never said the similar words more usually attributed to him, which are: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,'"" the society wrote in 2013.
It added that the conclusion was based ""on careful research in the canon of fifty million words by and about Churchill, including all of his books, articles, speeches and papers.""
A DeSantis spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Florida governor was seen as Trump's strongest opponent in the early days of his campaign, but DeSantis' numbers took a nosedive in the months that followed.
He pinned his hopes on last week's Iowa caucuses but lost to Trump by 30 percentage points.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in Sunday's announcement. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""

2668,PZY2L9ANJM_RSDEVYRZEQJQGUJ,Nikki Haley tries to draw New Hampshire's independents without alienating voters who backed Trump,The Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 6:10 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-tries-draw-hampshires-211042355.html,"Richard Anderson drove through a snowstorm last week to see his preferred candidate in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. But he’s not sure how far he’ll go to support her if she wins the nomination.
Anderson, a 73-year-old independent voter from Jackson, liked what he heard from Nikki Haley at the Mount Washington Hotel. But he disagrees with the former U.N. ambassador’s plan to pardon former President Donald Trump if he is convicted of any of the crimes he’s been charged with.
“That bothers me,” he said. “I’ll still vote for her in the primary, but I’ll wait to see if she’s still saying that in the general election.”
Haley’s best shot at shaking Trump’s grip on the Republican nomination rests with her ability to attract New Hampshire’s independent voters — including some who might not stick with her in November — without alienating too many conservatives. Other Republicans have hit the right balance here, notably John McCain in two GOP primary victories. But those wins came long before Trump’s rise in politics and the Republicans’ rightward shifts both in the state and nationally.
“It’s a very difficult needle to thread,” said Nathan Shrader, an associate professor of politics at New England College, “because if she makes too much of an overt play for the independent voters, that could be a turnoff for some of the Republicans who we know in the Trump era are more conservative than they might have been a generation ago.”
Democrats can’t vote in the GOP primary, but voters unaffiliated with a party — who make up nearly 40% of registered voters in New Hampshire — can. That makes them a key target, though they aren’t a monolith.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Sunday found that a majority of registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary — 67% — said they planned to vote for Trump. But a majority of those registered as undeclared — 58% — said they support Haley.
The poll, taken Tuesday through Friday, also found more registered Republicans in the state view Haley unfavorably (47%) than favorably (31%). Trump, meanwhile is viewed favorably by 76% of registered Republicans and unfavorably by just 16%.
Haley was viewed favorably by 42% of people who have registered themselves as undeclared, while 32% viewed her unfavorably. Just 34% of the same group, by contrast, views Trump favorably, compared with 59% unfavorably.
The poll was published before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race Sunday afternoon.
Some Haley supporters interviewed at her events are left-leaning voters who have little ideological overlap with Haley but are intent on stopping Trump. Others lean Republican and agree with her policies.
Corinne Pullen is a blend of both. Pullen, a retired 68-year-old nurse from Canterbury, said she’s impressed with Haley’s “strict and strong” foreign policies and her plans to decrease federal spending. She considers Trump a “narcissistic braggadocio buffoon.”
“When I compare these two candidates, it is a no-brainer who I would feel comfortable and safe having in the White House,” she said.
Trump has turned that crossover appeal into an attack line, suggesting that Haley is being propped up by “radical left Democrats.” The former president’s campaign argues Haley will struggle with conservatives in closed primaries like that of her home-state South Carolina, where the Feb. 24 primary is the next big matchup for her and Trump.
“Her entire focus at this point in time ... has been about turning out Democrats and behavioral Democrats to hijack the Republican primary in New Hampshire,” Trump senior advisor Chris LaCivita told reporters this month.
As if to underscore that point, Trump on Saturday arranged for South Carolina’s current governor, lieutenant governor, and several other elected leaders to come to New Hampshire to campaign with him. The day before, he won a rousing endorsement from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, whom Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor.
Haley, however, dismissed that move.
“I won South Carolina twice as governor,” she said recently. “I think I know what favorable territory is in South Carolina. We are going to South Carolina. We’re going to be strong in South Carolina.” She added: “The road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire, that’s always been the plan.”
Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, is skeptical that Haley can pull together a strong and diverse enough coalition to top Trump in Tuesday’s primary. Even if she did, “how do you duplicate that elsewhere?” he asked. “The answer is, you don’t. I don’t think you can pull off that magic trick in state after state.”
Unlike McCain, who openly appealed to “Republicans, independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians, all of them,” Haley doesn’t mention independents in her stump speech. But the super PAC backing her is filling its mailboxes with fliers citing her endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Trump critic, and her plans on the economy and debt reduction.
Haley described herself to reporters Thursday as “a conservative that knows how to talk to moderates and independents and not make them feel bad, but make them feel included.”
At the same time, she pushed back against criticism from Trump and DeSantis that she isn’t conservative enough.
“Show me where I’m moderate, because I’m not,” she said.
That didn’t stop Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican who voted for Biden in 2020, from endorsing her on Saturday and urging New Hampshire voters to “showcase their deep-rooted independent streak.” And it doesn’t bother independent voter Kristen Mansharamani, who described herself as “further left” than Haley on abortion, education and other issues but said she believes Haley would be a unifying leader.
“I told my 12-year-old son that I am looking for the person who I think is going to get rid of some of the standstill and the polarization in politics and I think she can do that better than anyone else out there right now,” said Mansharamani, 48, of Lincoln.
In Iowa, Haley was the top candidate for the most anti-Trump Republicans, including those who said the former president did something illegal in one of the pending criminal cases against him, according to data from AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of likely Iowa voters before they entered the caucuses.. Two-thirds of Haley’s caucusgoers said they would not ultimately vote for Trump in the general election.
In New Hampshire, some anti-Trump independents supporting Haley say they aren’t sure whether they’d back her in a general election either.
Amy Watson, a 59-year-old oral surgeon from Hollis, praised Haley’s tenure as U.N. ambassador and governor but said Haley’s views on environmental issues may be a dealbreaker in November.
“As things transpire, I think I’m going to consider what she has to say,” she said. “I’m very much concerned about global warming, so that’s one area where she may lose me.”

“It’s a very difficult needle to thread,"" said Nathan Shrader, an associate professor of politics at New England College, “because if she makes too much of an overt play for the independent voters, that could be a turnoff for some of the Republicans who we know in the Trump era are more conservative than they might have been a generation ago.”
Democrats can’t vote in the GOP primary, but voters unaffiliated with a party — who make up nearly 40% of registered voters in New Hampshire — can. That makes them a key target, though they aren’t a monolith.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Sunday found that a majority of registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary — 67% — said they planned to vote for Trump. But a majority of those registered as undeclared — 58% — said they support Haley.
The poll, taken Tuesday through Friday, also found more registered Republicans in the state view Haley unfavorably (47%) than favorably (31%). Trump, meanwhile is viewed favorably by 76% of registered Republicans and unfavorably by just 16%.
Haley was viewed favorably by 42% of people who have registered themselves as undeclared, while 32% viewed her unfavorably. Just 34% of the same group, by contrast, views Trump favorably, compared with 59% unfavorably.
The poll was published before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race Sunday afternoon.
Some Haley supporters interviewed at her events are left-leaning voters who have little ideological overlap with Haley but are intent on stopping Trump. Others lean Republican and agree with her policies.
Corinne Pullen is a blend of both. Pullen, a retired 68-year-old nurse from Canterbury, said she’s impressed with Haley’s “strict and strong” foreign policies and her plans to decrease federal spending. She considers Trump a “narcissistic braggadocio buffoon.”
“When I compare these two candidates, it is a no-brainer who I would feel comfortable and safe having in the White House,” she said.
Trump has turned that crossover appeal into an attack line, suggesting that Haley is being propped up by “radical left Democrats.” The former president’s campaign argues Haley will struggle with conservatives in closed primaries like that of her home-state South Carolina, where the Feb. 24 primary is the next big matchup for her and Trump.
“Her entire focus at this point in time ... has been about turning out Democrats and behavioral Democrats to hijack the Republican primary in New Hampshire,” Trump senior advisor Chris LaCivita told reporters this month.
As if to underscore that point, Trump on Saturday arranged for South Carolina’s current governor, lieutenant governor, and several other elected leaders to come to New Hampshire to campaign with him. The day before, he won a rousing endorsement from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, whom Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor.
Haley, however, dismissed that move.
“I won South Carolina twice as governor,"" she said recently. “I think I know what favorable territory is in South Carolina. We are going to South Carolina. We’re going to be strong in South Carolina.” She added: “The road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire, that’s always been the plan.”
Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, is skeptical that Haley can pull together a strong and diverse enough coalition to top Trump in Tuesday's primary. Even if she did, “how do you duplicate that elsewhere?” he asked. “The answer is, you don’t. I don’t think you can pull off that magic trick in state after state.”
Unlike McCain, who openly appealed to “Republicans, independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians, all of them,” Haley doesn’t mention independents in her stump speech. But the super PAC backing her is filling its mailboxes with fliers citing her endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Trump critic, and her plans on the economy and debt reduction.
Haley described herself to reporters Thursday as “a conservative that knows how to talk to moderates and independents and not make them feel bad, but make them feel included.”
At the same time, she pushed back against criticism from Trump and DeSantis that she isn’t conservative enough.
“Show me where I’m moderate, because I’m not,” she said.
That didn’t stop Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican who voted for Biden in 2020, from endorsing her on Saturday and urging New Hampshire voters to “showcase their deep-rooted independent streak.” And it doesn’t bother independent voter Kristen Mansharamani, who described herself as “further left” than Haley on abortion, education and other issues but said she believes Haley would be a unifying leader.
“I told my 12-year-old son that I am looking for the person who I think is going to get rid of some of the standstill and the polarization in politics and I think she can do that better than anyone else out there right now,” said Mansharamani, 48, of Lincoln.
In Iowa, Haley was the top candidate for the most anti-Trump Republicans, including those who said the former president did something illegal in one of the pending criminal cases against him, according to data from AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of likely Iowa voters before they entered the caucuses.. Two-thirds of Haley’s caucusgoers said they would not ultimately vote for Trump in the general election.
In New Hampshire, some anti-Trump independents supporting Haley say they aren’t sure whether they’d back her in a general election either.
Amy Watson, a 59-year-old oral surgeon from Hollis, praised Haley’s tenure as U.N. ambassador and governor but said Haley’s views on environmental issues may be a dealbreaker in November.
“As things transpire, I think I’m going to consider what she has to say,” she said. “I’m very much concerned about global warming, so that’s one area where she may lose me.”

Ron DeSantis didn’t save the Republican Party after all, or America for that matter.
Two days before the New Hampshire primary election, DeSantis suspended his campaign for president on Sunday.
As he exited, he endorsed former President Donald J. Trump. Of course, he had no choice. The Florida governor tried to sell voters the idea that he’s just like Trump, but more electable, more reasonable — but also more conservative. That didn’t work because, in the end, DeSantis’ brand wouldn’t exist without MAGA.
DeSantis’ departure from the Republican primary, which now leaves only Nikki Haley as a serious contender against Trump, marks the end of a political nosedive for our governor, once viewed as the strongest candidate who could end the Republican Party’s addiction to Trump.
He failed.
His trademark culture wars, anti-COVID vaccine stance and opposition to government-mandated school closures weren’t enough to persuade voters in other parts of the country to back him. With his presidential pitch gone, and Trump’s reemergence after his 91 criminal charges, DeSantis became a candidate without a cause.
It was clear he couldn’t survive much longer but DeSantis had vowed to stay in the race until Super Tuesday. His deflating 30-point loss to Trump in the Iowa caucuses last Monday had seemingly closed his path to the White House. And we all wondered: What was the point in staying in a losing race?
In the video his campaign released announcing his decision he fell in line with the party of Trump: “Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear.”
It’s not just that he was steamrolled by Donald Trump. DeSantis never appeared to want to save the GOP. He was more interested in making it a more ravenous, angrier and intolerant party. That worked for Trump, but didn’t work for the governor with all the charisma of burned toast.
So now DeSantis’ presidential campaign has ended. But the damage of the laws he has pushed through in Florida, as he landed more appearances on Fox News, will live on. Without his political ambitions, there likely wouldn’t be “Don’t say gay,” woke wars and the waste of state resources to fight meaningless battles against drag queen bars. These were efforts to appeal to Trump’s base but his supporters refused to leave the former president, especially after he was indicted.
DeSantis’ hard-right stances on issues like abortion and the Ukraine war — which he once called a “territorial dispute” before walking that comment back — alienated moderate voters. In the end, DeSantis became a candidate without a lane. What an outcome for a Florida governor who established himself as the dominant figure in state politics and who had the Legislature under his thumb. In the past two years, lawmakers have given DeSantis most of his priorities, often with little vetting, resulting in laws that are ambiguous and confusing, perhaps by design.
With his White House aspirations over — at least for now, because he could try again in 2028 — DeSantis returns to the Sunshine State to finish the final three years of his second term. In hindsight, it is now clear the young governor, who’s only 45, was a man in a hurry — too much of a hurry.
Glorified by the media as Trump’s heir apparent and buoyed by his legislative successes, DeSantis soon proved he wasn’t ready for prime time. He refused to engage with mainstream media, a strategy that worked for him as governor, until he felt forced to give more attention to outlets like CNN and network news. But that was too late.
There was also a barrage of negative news coverage of his imploding campaign, rumors about whether he wore hidden height boosters in his cowboy boots and, more than anything, his struggle to connect with voters.
DeSantis could have pitched a kinder form of conservatism or at least a more reasonable version. Instead, he banked on exploiting divisions in our country. As he bows out, DeSantis leaves the Republican Party exactly as he found it, under Trump’s dominance.

2683,QFUTJEV4AT_OS2M9BE9M8IK9OM,Trump mocks Nikki Haley's first name. It's his latest example of attacking rivals based on race,Bill Barrow,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 9:40 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-mocks-nikki-haleys-first-230429383.html,"ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump used his social media platform Friday to mock Nikki Haley 's birth name, the latest example of the former president keying on race and ethnicity to attack people of color, especially his political rivals.
In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump repeatedly referred to Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, as “Nimbra.” Haley, the former South Carolina governor, was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She has always gone by her middle name, “Nikki.” She took the surname “Haley” upon her marriage in 1996.
Trump, himself the son, grandson and twice the husband of immigrants, called Haley “Nimbra” three times in the post and said she “doesn't have what it takes.”
The attack comes four days before the New Hampshire primary, in which Haley is trying to establish herself as the only viable Trump alternative in the Republicans' 2024 nominating contest.
Trump's post was an escalation of recent attacks in which he referenced Haley's given first name — though he's misspelled it “Nimrada” — and falsely asserted she is ineligible for the presidency because her parents were not U.S. citizens when she was born in 1972.

The attacks echo Trump's “birther” rhetoric against President Barack Obama. Trump spent years pushing the conspiracy theory that the nation's first Black president was born in Kenya and not a “natural born” U.S. citizen as required by the Constitution. That effort was part of Trump's rise among Republicans' most culturally conservative base ahead of his 2016 election that surprised much of the U.S. political establishment.
Haley has dismissed Trump's latest attacks as proof that she threatens his bid for a third consecutive nomination.
“I’ll let people decide what he means by his attacks,” Haley told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday when asked about Trump’s false assertions that her heritage disqualifies her from the Oval Office. “What we know is, look, he’s clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums, if he’s spending millions of dollars on TV. He’s insecure, he knows that something’s wrong.”
Trump’s campaign did not reply to an inquiry about his comments.
Since Monday's Iowa caucuses — which Trump won by 30 points over Ron DeSantis, who placed second — Haley has aimed to portray the rest of the GOP primary battle as a two-way race between Trump and herself despite her narrow third-place finish. Haley's campaign is aiming for a stronger showing in New Hampshire, hoping for a springboard into her home state South Carolina, which holds the South's first presidential primary next month.
For his part, Trump bounces between declarations that the nominating fight is already effectively over and blasting Haley as if the two are indeed locked in a tight contest. Trump still criticizes his other remaining rival, DeSantis, but his preferred pejoratives for the Florida governor, “Ron DeSanctimonious” or “Ron DeSanctus,” have nothing to do with race or ethnicity. DeSantis is white.
Trump’s focus on Haley's name comes as far-right online forums have for months been littered with mentions of her given name alongside racist commentary and false “birther” claims. Haley's name and family background also have become talking points on the left. Some widely circulating social media posts have called her a hypocrite for saying America was “never a racist country” when she likely experienced racism herself.
Pastor Darrell Scott, a Black man who has led a diversity coalition for Trump’s previous campaigns, defended the former president's latest attacks as “slings and arrows” that come in election season.
“You have to dissect politics as politics. It’s not personal,” said Scott. “He’s not intending to demean her or degrade her in any way. He’s just doing that to garner votes.”
Scott said Trump “has a compassionate side that most people don't see” and defended his aggressive approach as a “goose-and-gander situation” for a public figure constantly “under attack for everything.”
Tara Setmayer, senior adviser to the Lincoln Project group that opposes Trump from within the conservative movement, agreed that Trump’s rhetoric works in a Republican primary. But she said that’s a damning reality for the party and does not excuse his behavior.
“These are the rantings of an incredibly, almost pathetically insecure man who has demonstrated over his entire career his racism and bigotry,” said Setmayer, who is multiracial and calls herself a former Republican and now a conservative independent. “Why would anyone expect it to be any different now, when an entire political party has enabled this level of morally questionable behavior?”
Amid the fallout Friday, Trump won the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican and formerly a presidential candidate himself. Haley appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012, during her first term as governor.
Trump has a long history of using race, ethnicity and immigrant heritage as a cudgel.
For years, he has referred to Obama as “Barack Hussein Obama,” putting an obvious emphasis on the 44th president's middle name. Obama was the son of a white American mother and a Black father from Kenya. He was born in Hawaii, though Trump spent years asserting Obama had manufactured the story and a birth certificate to support it. Trump eventually admitted his claims were false but then, during the 2016 general election, said he did so only to “get on with the campaign.”
When David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, encouraged Republican primary voters to back Trump in 2016, Trump responded in a CNN interview that he knew “nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists.”
Trump is also among many Republicans who deliberately mispronounce Vice President Kamala Harris's name. Rather than the correct “KA'-ma-la,” Trump sometimes says, “Ka-MAH-la.” Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, is the first woman to become vice president and the third non-white person as either president or vice president, following Obama and Charles Curtis, Herbert Hoover's vice president who had Native American ancestry.
Leading up to Trump’s 2017 inauguration, civil rights icon John Lewis, then a Black congressman from Georgia, said he would not attend Trump’s inauguration because he considered him an illegitimate president. Trump reacted by blasting Lewis’s Atlanta-based district as being in “horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).” The district includes downtown Atlanta, Coca-Cola’s world headquarters, the Georgia Institute of Technology and principal sites of the 1996 Olympic Games, among other attributes.
During his presidency, Trump questioned during a meeting with lawmakers why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and “shithole countries” across Africa instead of countries like Norway. He did not explicitly mention race but the White House followed disclosure of his comments with a statement explaining that Trump supported granting access to the U.S. for “those who can contribute to our society.”
He also has said that four congresswomen of color should go back to the “broken and crime infested” countries they came from, ignoring the fact that all of the women are American citizens and three were born in the U.S.
Trump's mother was born Mary Anne MacLeod in Scotland and came to the United States between the two world wars. His paternal grandfather, Frederick Trump, was a Bavarian-born immigrant from Germany in the 1880s. Trump's first wife, Ivana Zelníčková before their marriage, was born in what is now the Czech Republic. His third wife, former first lady Melania Trump, was born Melanija Knavs in what is now Slovenia. That means four of Trump's five children also are children of immigrants.
Haley frames her family's story as proof that the U.S. “is not a racist country.” She sometimes highlights her role in taking down the Confederate battle flag from South Carolina statehouse grounds after a racist massacre in her state — though she had sidestepped requests to remove the banner earlier in her term. And Haley has for years navigated Trump's penchant for racist rhetoric.
“I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK,” Haley said during the 2016 primary campaign after she had endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over Trump. “That is not a part of our party; that is not who we want as president.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, that aired on Jan. 21, 2024.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We go now to the Republican governor of the state of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Good morning, Governor.
GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Good morning, Margaret. It's great to be with you.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to talk to you. You are one of the youngest, if not the youngest governor in the [country], the first female governor of Arkansas. I want to ask you about a number of things, including the current Arkansas law, we've been talking a lot about reproductive health. The law bans abortions except to save the mother's life in a medical emergency, no exceptions for rape or incest. Your Attorney General has twice recently rejected ballot measures that would repeal the ban and give a limited right to abortion up until 18 weeks of conception. As Governor, are you open to any ballot initiative?
GOV. SANDERS: Look, I'm proud of the fact that Arkansas is one of the most pro-life states in the country. I'm unapologetically pro-life, I believe that we are a culture that protects life, that values life. I think that's who we are as a country. And I'll continue to support those measures.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But- I know those are your personal convictions, but would you seek the opinion of your constituents on this? I mean, some of the Attorney General's objections. One of the things he objected to was replacing the word conception with fertilization. And another one, it was narrowing a medical emergency to threat to physical health and defining it just as that. I mean, they seem to be tweaks. On the premise though, would you be open to seeking the opinion of your constituents in a ballot initiative?
GOV. SANDERS: Arkansas overwhelmingly pro-life state, I'm proud of that fact and proud of where we are. And we'll continue to push for things that I think protect all innocent human life. It's why we haven't just focused on pro-life legislation. But we've also done things in the foster and adoption care space. It's why I've spent so much time focusing on education, empowering every single Arkansan to have a great quality of life. We are looking at every aspect and making sure that we're doing what we can to protect and value life at every stage here in the state of Arkansas.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like a no? You wouldn't want to put it on a ballot?
GOV. SANDERS: I'm not going to put a blanket on anything that could come forward. But as it stands right now, I haven't seen anything that I would be supportive of.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state, you're talking about the sanctity of life, your state had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, according to the CDC up until about 2021. Arkansas is one of the few states that hasn't extended postpartum care for mothers. Why don't you want those moms to get care for a full 12 months, as is being offered, instead of just 60 days?
GOV. SANDERS: Well, I'm gonna have to disagree with the premise of your question saying that I don't want that. I certainly want us to do everything that we can to help during pregnancy and well after a child is born, which is why we have done things like focus on the foster and adoption care, we've put significant funding into our pregnancy crisis centers, we're focusing on things that help our mothers, including bring your kids to work at state government. We've expanded maternity leave for state employees, we included that in our education package. We have taken a number of steps that are very positive in this front. And we're going to continue to do that as long as I'm governor.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the states of Mississippi, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, they did extend for 12 months rather than the 60 days. So, I'm just wondering specifically on that option, why you opted out?
GOV. SANDERS: We're gonna continue to look at options that we feel like best help people here in the state of Arkansas, we've done that in a number of ways and we're going to continue to do that over the course of hopefully the next seven years while I'm governor of Arkansas.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you as well about what is happening with the kids in your state. I was interested to see that you are not among the 15 Republican governors who rejected a new federal program to give food assistance to eight million children during the summer months. You opted into that--
GOV. SANDERS: I did. I--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- A number of Republican guidance say on premise that- that- that- this- this violates conservative principles. So why are they wrong? And why are you okay with this federal program?
GOV. SANDERS: Well, I want to focus on why I think it helps our state. Arkansas in the past has ranked at the bottom when it comes to food insecurity for children. I don't think any child should ever go hungry if we have options available to us to help improve that. That's exactly what we're going to do. That's why we've opted into this program. We're going to continue to look for ways to help and protect kids in our state. And I was proud to be part of that program. And we'll continue to look for options to help move Arkansas out of the bottom when it comes to food insecurity and into the top.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You are, as we said at the get go there, the youngest governor in the country. And I wonder when you look at your party right now, what does it say about the party and about our politics that not only is the President of the United States at such an advanced age, but the Republican front runner Donald Trump, 77 years old here- are these much older individuals, really the new generation that you've been calling for?
GOV. SANDERS: I think this election right now is very simple. It's a very clear contrast, you have two individuals who have a four-year record to run on. One has a record of success coming from a posture and a position of strength in Donald Trump, and one who comes from a position of weakness. Every single thing that voters actually care about, every single thing that drives voters to show up and cast their ballot. Donald Trump is winning on, whether it's the economy, whether it's securing the border, whether it's national security, whether it's taking a hard line against China, every single one of those major issues that really drive voters, Donald Trump is dominating Joe Biden on, and they both have clear records in which to run from, and I have no doubt that the matchup in November will declare Donald Trump a clear victor because of that- that contrast.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's only four years younger than the president whose age you've- you've criticized, but your predecessor as governor, Asa Hutchinson, just recently ended his presidential bid and he endorsed Nikki Haley. He said, ""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last eight years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America."" Do you honestly, Sarah- Sorry, Governor Sanders, I'm used to calling you Sarah from- from the front row at the White House there? Do you honestly believe Trump is going to unite the country this time, when in the first term, that you were part of, the country was very divided?
GOV. SANDERS: You know, one of the things that I think is so often left out of Donald Trump's story is the patriotism and the love of country that he brought back. We haven't seen that in this president--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What do you mean by that?
GOV. SANDERS:-- In fact, we've seen the total opposite. We see people who believe in America again, who see the strength of our country. We brought back American manufacturing, we secured our border, we had a strong economy, our enemies abroad actually feared us and our allies actually respected us. Instead of the people now are across the- the other side of the world are laughing at us and taking advantage of the weakness of this President. Donald Trump-- you know, you joked a minute ago, you called me Sarah, instead of Governor, you know, your colleagues called me a lot of other things. I'll take Sarah all day over some of the things that the media and the left called me. But when those things were happening, the person who was defending me, empowering me to do my job was Donald Trump. I know that he can deliver again, because he's done it before.
MARGARET BRENNAN: No-- Governor, I think we've always had a respectful exchange, you and I, so I don't think we're part of the media group you're talking about--
GOV. SANDERS: -- I didn't say you, I was--
MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Right. But- but on the substance of the question, in terms of uniting the country, I mean, some of the policy things you just rattled off, as you know, immigration has been broken for decades. And those border problems were border problems under President Trump. The Middle East policies he had didn't solve issues. I mean, in fact, we are seeing the conflict in Israel really flare up in a way, he didn't broker the peace deal he promised. He didn't get Russia out of Ukraine. She didn't improve relations with China. So how can you point to that as a- as a high point without recognizing that even he says the work was not finished?
GOV. SANDERS: Well, that's why we need him to come back for four years because he didn't get to finish, but he certainly made significant progress. Our border was far more secure under President Trump, than under President Biden, I had the chance to go to the border myself. And while I was there, met with those who are standing on the front lines, including members of the Arkansas National Guard that we deployed, because the federal government is not doing their job, states are having to step up. And in meeting with those individuals, they told us that more people had come across in just that month, just that month on the terrorist watch list than in the entire four years of Donald Trump's presidency. Donald Trump was actually taking steps to secure our border, to strengthen our country. It's hard to argue that having a good economy, having safe and secure borders, taking a hard line against China, those are empowering and unifying things for our country--
MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Would you be his VP if asked?
GOV. SANDERS: -- And only- hold on I want to just finish this one point. And only one of two people in the race has actually delivered on each of those things. And it's Donald Trump, not Joe Biden.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'd be open to vetting to be his vice president potentially?
GOV. SANDERS: Look, I absolutely love the job I have. I think it's one of the best jobs I could ever ask for. And I am honored to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Next seven years. All right. That sounds like two terms. Maybe a no. Governor Sanders. Thank you. We'll be right back.

Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) could end his Democratic primary challenge to President Biden and make a third-party bid with No Labels, claiming that Phillips’s campaign doesn’t even matter.
“At the end of the day, there’s only going to be two parties that have an ability to get to 270 electoral votes, and that’s going to be Joe Biden as a Democratic nominee and whoever emerges from the extreme Republican primary that’s going on right now,” deputy campaign manager Quintin Fulks said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.
Phillips’s long-shot challenge to Biden has gained no momentum, and questions swirl over whether the congressman will continue his campaign after the New Hampshire primary. Biden will not be on the ballot in New Hampshire, but a write-in campaign is seeking to defeat Phillips anyway.
“We’re going to stay focused on the issues and make this about freedom and democracy,” Fulks continued. “The Americans that have the most at stake understand that, and they’re not going to be fooled by anything else.”
The Biden campaign has effectively ignored Phillips since he launched his candidacy in October.
“There are only two options of who’s going to be the President of the United States, and that’s either Joe Biden or whoever the Republicans put forth, and our campaign is going to continue to make sure that we’re delivering a message to draw that contrast about what this election is all about, and that’s restoring democracy and protecting freedoms from millions of Americans across this country,” Fulks added.
No Labels, a third-party effort that has vowed to put forward a bipartisan presidential “unity” ticket, is actively recruiting figures to place on the ballot. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has been floated as an option, as has Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). Both have teased that they could make White House runs, but neither has made a public decision.
Phillips first signaled interest in No Labels on Saturday, saying he would be interested in running on the group’s ballot line if Trump was the GOP nominee.
“It would have to be a Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch that shows Joe Biden is almost certain to lose,” Phillips told The New York Times. “That is the only condition in which I would even entertain a conversation with any alternative.”

The move comes after DeSantis lost the Iowa caucuses to Trump by 30 percentage points, according to the Deseret News.
“Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward,” he said. “If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources. We don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”

“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis continued. “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, or repackage formed of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Trump responded to DeSantis’ endorsement in a statement to Fox News Digital Sunday:
“Very honored to have his endorsement,” Trump said. “I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country.”

Primary concerns in presidential politics
At a campaign event in New Hampshire on Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley responded to DeSantis’ announcement.
“I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” she said.
Haley later released a statement where she wished DeSantis well and said she would continue her campaign, according to a Politico reporter.
“So far, only one state has voted,” she said. “Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not. We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road. New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are trying to temper expectations for U.S. President Joe Biden in next week's Democratic primary election in New Hampshire, as supporters scramble to gin up write-in support for him since his name is not on the ballot.
The primary on Jan. 23 offers the first at-the-polls gauge of Biden’s political strength this election cycle, and the unprecedented situation will be closely watched amid polls showing him tied with likely Republican challenger Donald Trump .
A poor showing against Democratic longshots Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman, and self-help author Marianne Williamson is likely to fuel concerns that Biden is weak heading into the general election.
Biden did not register for the New Hampshire contest after the state refused his demand that it cede its top spot in the presidential primary calendar to the more diverse South Carolina.
But his New Hampshire supporters can still vote for him because many U,S, states allow voters to write the name on a ballot paper of a candidate who is not officially running. That candidate wins if they receive more votes than the registered candidates.
Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said Biden should achieve ""a fairly significant win,"" but added that he didn't really know what that looks like.
""What is a big enough win to count? Right now we see Biden with upwards of 70% of the vote. Is that enough? Does that mean the Democratic Party is behind him, or does it show division in the party?"" Smith told Reuters.
Supporters say the unpredictable race should not be viewed as some type of national litmus test, because turnout will be low, write-in campaigns are notoriously hard and Biden angered Democrats there by booting the state from its historical role as the party first-in-the-nation primary.
Jim Demers, one of the organizers of the shoe-string Biden write-in campaign said he’s seen polls that range from less than 50% to 60% of the vote for Biden.
State officials expect to declare a Democratic winner on Tuesday after tallying write-in votes.
Biden allies say the benchmark should be the 2010 write-in campaign of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, the first U.S. senator to win that way in 50 years, taking about 40% of the vote and besting a Tea Party favorite.
""She won with 39% of the vote as a candidate in a write-in effort she led and Joe Biden and his campaign aren’t even participating in an effort to write his name in for this one,"" said Jim Messina, who was then-President Barack Obama's campaign manager in 2012.
The Democratic National Committee ruled that the New Hampshire election effectively won’t count and the winner won't amass New Hampshire's 23 delegates in the march to the party's nomination.
Some New Hampshire Democrats are definitely upset.
""When it comes down to it, we’re in the Democratic primary and Biden has chosen to take his name off of the New Hampshire ballot,"" said state representative Jonah Wheeler, a Democrat who supports Williamson.
Biden's high-profile supporters including California Representative Ro Khanna, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu have been helping rally the faithful, and organizers have a shoe-string budget to teach voters how to write in a candidate.
A CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center in mid-November showed 65% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire plan to write in Biden’s name, with 10% going for Phillips and 9% for Williamson.
In 2020, Biden finished a disappointing fifth in a crowded Democratic primary that saw some 300,000 votes cast. State officials expect less than 100,000 votes this year.
Lyndon B. Johnson, then the Democratic incumbent, shunned the New Hampshire primary in 1968 due to over-confidence, only to see an insurgent campaign from Minnesota, U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy and his anti-Vietnam War platform. Johnson supporters mounted a barely successful write-campaign, but a weakened Johnson dropped out of the race weeks later.
David Watters, a write-in advocate and Democratic state senator in New Hampshire, said the best way right now to register rejection of former President Donald Trump, his likely Republican challenger, is to write-in Biden on Tuesday.
""We've got to stand up for Joe Biden,"" Watters said.
Elliot and Edith Smith, a married couple, attended a Dean Phillips campaign event in Nashua earlier this month. Like many U.S. voters, they are dissatisfied by a choice between of Biden and Trump, but they don’t see any other viable options.
The were both planning to vote for Biden in the state’s primary, but not enthusiastically, over deep concerns about Biden’s vigor and whether the 81-year-old president can withstand a second term.
“I am disgusted with both parties, but we can’t elect Trump,” said Elliot Smith, 72. “I’m a Democrat, but would consider other Republicans like Haley or Christie in the general election, but there’s no chance they can beat Trump.”

Doug Burgum, who endorsed Donald Trump after suspending his own Republican presidential campaign, on Sunday tried to downplay the former president's inflammatory new attacks on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's name and heritage.
When pressed by ABC News ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Trump's intentional mispronunciations of Haley's first name -- Nimarata -- and elevation of a false conspiracy theory that she is unable to be president because her Indian immigrant parents weren't citizens when she was born in South Carolina, Burgum initially did not give a direct answer.
But Raddatz followed up: ""Please answer the question, sir. Answer the question about why you think Donald Trump is doing that.""
Trump has repeatedly misstated or mispronounced Haley's first name, more often in social media posts. She goes by her middle name and took her husband's last name after they married.
Trump has a history of racist attacks on some non-white opponents -- including infamously questioning whether Barack Obama was born in the U.S. (he was) and singling out Obama's middle name, Hussein.
Burgum on ""This Week"" chalked the comments up to more routine sharp exchanges in a campaign, pointing to how President Joe Biden has gone after Trump rather than, he argued, focusing more on key issues like crime, immigration and inflation.
""I think it's politics,"" Burgum said, adding, ""That's politics around the world, and it's politics in America.""
""So, do you think that's the kind of politics that Donald Trump is using, going after Nikki Haley's heritage, that will bring the country together?"" Raddatz asked.
""You could ask me the question about, you know, what did Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris say? The vicious things they said about Joe Biden, even during debates nationally televised within that party,"" Burgum said, referencing some of Biden's 2020 primary opponents. ""This is all in the norm for politics in our country. But once we agree as parties, we get behind candidates. The Democrats got behind Biden in 2020. I'm confident Republicans are gonna get behind President Trump.""
Haley has also responded to Trump's attacks.
""I know President Trump well. That's what he does when he feels threatened. That's what he does when he feels insecure,"" she said during a CNN town hall on Thursday.
Burgum, who suspended his campaign in December after failing to gain traction, endorsed Trump earlier this month, one day before the Iowa caucuses that began the 2024 race.
On ""This Week,"" Burgum was asked about several areas in which he seemingly diverges from Trump, including a self-declared mission to pull the country together -- while Trump has vowed ""retribution"" -- and reaffirming that Biden won the 2020 race.
Burgum said he was endorsing Trump because he was ""confident that President Trump is going to be right on the economy, right on energy policy and right on national security.""
""During the time that President Trump was in office, I mean, we had peace and prosperity in America. And under President Biden, we’ve got chaos around the world,"" he said.
When Raddatz pressed Burgum over Trump's repeated and unfounded claims that the 2020 election was ""stolen,"" a stance Burgum has opposed in the past, including an interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, Burgum initially pivoted to past instances of other candidates raising questions about the election process.
He then cited ""irregularities"" regarding 2020, though there has never been any evidence of widespread fraud.
""Do you think the election was stolen now, sir?"" Raddatz followed up.
""No, I'm not saying that,"" Burgum responded.
""I'm saying that I think that we have to ... make sure that Americans have confidence in these elections,"" he said.
Burgum also swatted away a recent gaffe by Trump in which he repeatedly confused Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while discussing the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump and other Republicans have made repeated attacks on Biden's age and fitness, which many voters also feel is poor, polls show -- as Biden says his work speaks for itself.
Haley seized on Trump's slip in a recent campaign appearance, suggesting he, too, might not be mentally strong enough.
""I've been on the campaign trail, and I know when you're going around the clock, it's possible to ... use words that don't fit in sentences,"" Burgum told Raddatz. ""But I would say having been with the president last week in Iowa and in New Hampshire and watching him go for 20 hours a day, I know that he's got the strength, he's got the experience to lead.""any

2720,S0J07W5JHD_ST4ZHPXBOTUVLXZ,DeSantis Backs Down: Florida’s governor ends his presidential campaign,Max Greenwood,"January 22, 2024 at 5:15 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-backs-down-florida-governor-201555236.html,"Ron DeSantis is backing down — and getting behind former President Donald Trump.
The Florida governor, who bet everything on the Iowa caucuses and lost, ended his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, less than 48 hours before the New Hampshire primary, a contest that he had virtually no chance of winning.
In a video posted online just two hours before a scheduled campaign stop in Manchester, DeSantis acknowledged that he had no path forward in the race for the 2024 Republican nomination for president.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome — more campaign stops, more interviews — I would do it,” DeSantis said. “But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
DeSantis’ decision to drop out of the presidential contest left the primary a two-candidate race between Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. DeSantis, in his video, said he was endorsing Trump — releasing people who’d previously backed the governor to announce their support for the former president.
Florida lawmakers, including state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, House Speaker Paul Renner and House Speaker Designate Daniel Perez, were among those who threw their endorsements behind Trump.
“I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump to be the next President of the United States,” Perez, R-Miami, said in a statement. “Floridians have delivered for President Trump twice before, and we will work nonstop to do so again this November.”
Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who’d previously endorsed Trump, said on the social media site X that Republicans were “one step closer to getting everyone focused on saving our country by helping Trump beat Biden.”
It was a swift about-face for DeSantis, who had ramped up his attacks on Trump in recent weeks. In his closing pitch to voters in Iowa, he said that, with Trump, “you can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he’ll say you’re wonderful.”
DeSantis explained his reversal, saying in his video announcement that while he has had “disagreements” with the former president, Trump is “superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden.”
Trump welcomed DeSantis’ endorsement on Sunday, signaling that he is willing to put their rivalry behind them.
“With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement. “It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.”
When a reporter asked Sunday how DeSantis could get back in Trump’s “good graces,” the former president’s response was short: “We’ll see.”
With his White House campaign now behind him, and the state’s legislative session underway, the governor will return to Florida to finish out the final three years of his last term in the governor’s mansion. His agenda isn’t entirely clear; he spent his time on the campaign trail saying he’d already accomplished everything he’d promised to do as governor.
“He’s going to settle back into the governor’s mansion and act like it’s business as usual; like nothing happened,” said Rick Wilson, a former Republican consultant and a co-founder of the anti-Trump group, the Lincoln Project. “He won’t admit he failed.”

DeSantis had insisted all week after his second-place Iowa finish that he would not drop out, and that he had a shot to win the nomination.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he told reporters Friday outside an ice arena at Saint Anselm College. “The minute I don’t, I’m not just going to do this for my health.”
But there were signs before the Sunday announcement that DeSantis’ campaign was nearing the end of the line.
DeSantis’ campaign appeared directionless as Tuesday’s primary approached. He bounced back and forth between New Hampshire and South Carolina. Then he canceled two planned TV appearances on Sunday morning after saying just days earlier that he regretted not engaging with mainstream media more readily. His campaign also scheduled a last-minute stop in New Hampshire on Sunday, explaining that he’d canceled the TV interviews because he had a scheduling conflict.
He never made it to Manchester.

Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday was repeatedly questioned by NBC anchor Kristen Welker over his pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it is former President Trump as a hypothetical convicted felon.
The exchange, during an NBC “Meet the Press” interview, started when Welker asked for Sununu’s reaction to Trump remarks about presidential immunity over the weekend, in which he argued any president should be allowed immunity so “that [the] president can act, and do what he feels, and what his group of advisers feel is the absolute right thing.”
Sununu said he does not agree with Trump’s presidential immunity argument and that “everybody should be concerned with that type of mentality going into the White House.”
Sununu, who has endorsed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley’s White House bid, said earlier this month he would support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it is Trump, who could be a convicted felon. Welker on Sunday asked Sununu how he could make this sort of vow given the fact he disagrees with the former president’s argument.
“Look, at the end of the day, I think most Republicans are going to get behind the Republican nominee. I’m hoping that it’s obviously Nikki Haley. This is how bad Joe Biden is. Six months ago Trump couldn’t beat Biden,” Sununu responded, before listing off various issues facing the country.
“So this is where we’ve come, where Joe Biden is so bad that even folks would get behind Donald Trump,” he added later.
Welker then pressed Sununu again on how he could support Trump, whom the governor has previously said contributed to the Jan. 6 riots.
“And yet you’re saying that the comments by Donald Trump, everyone should be worried about that. You have said earlier that Trump’s rhetoric and actions contributed to the January 6 insurrection. How can you support someone who you believe contributed to the insurrection?” Welker asked.
Sununu appeared to avoid directly answering the question and brought the focus to New Hampshire, which will hold its first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday.
“We’re … we’re here in New Hampshire in the first nation primary. No one’s really thinking about the general election right now. If you want to beat Donald Trump, it has to happen at the ballot box,” Sununu said.
Welker then asked for a third time if Sununu would vote for Trump in the general election “despite all of these comments, despite his comments on immunity, despite what you said about the insurrection.”
Sununu did not answer the question directly, instead pointing to polling: “Well, according to the polls, most of America would. This is how — I mean, this is what you guys don’t report on. This is how bad Biden has been, this is how incompetent he’s been.”
Welker switched gears and asked the New Hampshire governor if he believes Trump would follow the Constitution if reelected in November, to which Sununu said, “My sense is if … he were in … there in a second term, you know, not a whole lot is going to happen. Because nobody’s going to be willing to work with him.”
Welker interjected and asked again, “Do you think [Trump] would follow the Constitution?”
Sununu responded, “I would hope so.”
Welker sought to clarify his comments, asking Sununu if he is “really not confident” Trump would follow the Constitution and that he’s instead just “hopeful.”
“I would say that about any president. I would hope so. I’d hope Joe Biden would, I would hope any of them would. Yes,” he answered.
A polling index maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with an 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails far behind, polling in single digits, according to the polling index.

Sununu, New Hampshire’s popular chief executive, endorsed Haley for the GOP nomination and has campaigned extensively with her across the Granite State. Haley needs a strong showing there after finishing third in Iowa’s Jan. 15 Republican caucus, behind former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
“Just showing a stronger performance than was in Iowa, that’s the most important piece right now and having less candidates in the race and defining it as a one-on-one race,” Sununu said in an interview on Sunday with Bloomberg Television.
New Hampshire so far presents the strongest opportunity for Haley — a former US ambassador to the UN — to upset Trump owing to the state’s more moderate electorate and the ability of undeclared voters to participate in the GOP primary.
Even so, a CNN poll released Sunday showed Trump with 50% support among likely Republican primary voters versus 39% for Haley. Both candidates have seen an increase in support since a previous survey earlier this month, when Trump had the backing of 39% of voters and Haley registered at 32%. DeSantis was at 6%, the CNN poll found.
Sununu dismissed characterizations that early contests in New Hampshire and Haley’s home state of South Carolina were make or break for her presidential bid, but said that she must notch wins in the Super Tuesday round of primaries on March 5. He said Trump has sought to frame the early primaries as must-win contests because the former president wants to end the nomination race early.
“I don’t think any of these early states are must wins for Haley,” Sununu said. “When you get to Super Tuesday, OK, now you really have to start winning states obviously. But as long as she keeps building on that momentum, I think there’s a lot of opportunity.”
Sununu has long been a staunch critic of Trump. In the Bloomberg Television interview, he cited Trump’s loss in 2020 to Joe Biden and said that the former president has hurt the Republicans’ ability to win congressional races.
“Because of that Trump brand, we’ve lost in 2018 and 2020 and 2022,” he said. “We’re just tired of that brand that just drags the rest of the Republican Party down.”
Trump has begun to look ahead to the Feb. 24 primary in South Carolina. On Saturday, in a jab at Haley, Trump was joined at a New Hampshire rally by current South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and several state lawmakers, a day after announcing the endorsement of South Carolina US Senator Tim Scott.
Sununu criticized Scott for endorsing the former president over Haley, who appointed Scott to the chamber in 2012, when she was South Carolina governor.
“Tim Scott wouldn’t be a senator without Nikki Haley,” he said. “That’s why what he did was so disrespectful.”

MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump will make their closing arguments in New Hampshire on Sunday in a final stretch of campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination before voters go to the polls on Tuesday.
Time is running short for Haley, who served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, to topple the Republican presidential frontrunner after his victory in the Iowa caucuses underscored his dominance in the primary race.
If she cannot score an upset win in New Hampshire on Tuesday, her already-narrow path to the nomination could close altogether.
Trump, who is leading Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis here, addressed a stadium full of cheering supporters in Manchester on Saturday night, encouraging them to go the polls on Tuesday, when the primary will take place.
But he also appeared to shift some of his focus to the next major nominating contest, in South Carolina in late February.
At the rally, several high-ranking state and federal officials from that state spoke on Trump's behalf, including South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.
""They understand that I am the only candidate in this race who is going to save America and we're gonna get rid of this Biden disaster right away,"" Trump said.
""So you know what I'm doing? I'm kissing ass.""
Haley has stepped up her attacks on Trump in recent days with a late-in-the-game move to draw contrasts with a businessman and politician whose time in the White House was characterized by chaos and who faces four criminal cases, including for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election that he lost to now President Joe Biden.
Despite her shift, some Republican and independent voters say Haley should go further with her criticisms and that she has not hit her main rival hard enough throughout her campaign.
""I think Trump needs to be put in his place,"" said Chris Jay, 57, a Republican who said he was leaning toward Haley but wanted her to lob more head-on attacks at the former president.
Haley on Saturday knocked Trump, 77, for his age after he seemingly confused her with former Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Haley also criticized Trump for his affinity for strongmen such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Trump, she said at a campaign event in Keene, New Hampshire on Saturday, “needs to stop praising dictators.” She said as his UN ambassador, she tried to break up his “bromance” with Putin.
Trump has upped his already fierce attacks on Haley as well, targeting her given first name on his social media platform and amplifying false posts questioning her birthright U.S. citizenship.
The daughter of two immigrants from India, Haley was bornNimarata Nikki Randhawa but has long used her middle name Nikki and later took her husband's surname.
At the Saturday night rally in Manchester, Trump attacked Haley for her support among some wealthy donors who have also supported Democrats and called her a threat to social security.
Above the stage where Trump spoke, a large screen showed messages critcizing Haley, alongside unflattering pictures of her.
""Nikki Haley is loved by Democrats, Wall Street and globalists,"" one of the images on the screen read.

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) signaled Sunday he was open to serving as former President Trump’s vice presidential running mate days after he put his full endorsement behind the former chief executive in the 2024 race for the White House.
Scott — who ended his own presidential bid in November — was asked about chants for Scott to serve as Trump’s “VP” during a rally in New Hampshire on Friday when Scott formally endorsed Trump.
“The only thing I want is four more years of Donald Trump and a Republican majority in the Senate, a majority in the House and the White House, so that poor kids who are today growing up in neighborhoods like I grew up in, have a chance for a quality education. I want kids to look to their future and believe that America is their oyster,” Scott told CNN’s Dana Bash when asked on “State of the Union” if he wants to be Trump’s running mate.
“That’s what I really want,” he continued. “And if I can help achieve that through my endorsement by being on the campaign trail in my home state of South Carolina for the next four or five weeks, and then beyond, that’s the goal. If you don’t think about yourself, but think about the country first, we’ll be in good shape.”
Bash pointed out that Scott was not rejecting the idea of serving as vice president, saying, “That wasn’t a no. That door is wide open. Fair read?”
“Well, Dana, you can, you can take it any way you want,” Scott responded with a laugh. “My goal is to do one thing. It’s always going to do the same thing, make America and Americans believe in our future in the way that we do not today. Whatever that takes.”
Scott’s endorsement came days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, set to take place Tuesday.
Scott, whose campaign for president emphasized a message of hope, was first appointed to the Senate by Nikki Haley, who was governor of South Carolina at the time. The two clashed on the campaign trail, and Scott’s endorsement of Trump’s campaign is seen as a blow for Haley.
Scott, in his CNN interview, defended endorsing Trump over Haley, saying it’s important for the party to unite behind Trump. Scott also said he texted Haley several times since ending his campaign, including the day before he announced his endorsement of Trump.

Maine has joined Colorado in banishing Trump from the primary ballot and other states have challenges before their courts also questioning Trump’s eligibility to hold office.
Section 3 of the amendment says “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”
The Supreme Court, in taking this case, will very likely render a decision that either universally qualifies Trump to run for office or universally disqualifies him. The Supreme Court’s decision, one way or the other, will be greeted with massive dissent and will have a pronounced impact on the Nov. 5 presidential election.
During his term as president, Donald Trump appointed three of the nine justices. In any normal legal matter, a judge placed in a circumstance such as this, would very likely recuse himself or herself due to the obvious conflict of interest. One of the determining factors in this case will be whether the three Trump-appointed justices recuse themselves. If they do not, it is difficult to see how anything resembling a fair and balanced decision will be reached.
A heavily biased Supreme Court is disturbing. It is distributing no matter which way the court might be loaded, conservative or liberal. The Constitution is neither. It is a document that is supposed to establish how American government works and guarantee freedom for the American people. However, the document has always been interpreted by men and women who are biased. It could not be otherwise.

The case itself must necessarily turn on whether Trump participated in insurrection or, and this is potentially the most telling point, gave aid and comfort to those who did. Many of his actions, or inactions on Jan. 6, 2021, appear to have violated this amendment, and he has not stopped giving aid and comfort to those who stormed the Capitol Building even after leaving office.
Since Trump did not himself storm the Capitol building, his attorneys could argue that he did not participate in insurrection. That is a great deal like Bill Clinton’s denial that he had sex with the intern. The defense is in the semantics, or the definition, rather than in the action itself. And it is likely the concept that Trump didn’t storm the building himself that lawyers will use to argue his case before the Supreme Court. They might make a case for him not participating, but it will be more than difficult to argue that he did not give aid and comfort to those who did.
The court’s decision will do one of two things. First, they could rule that Donald Trump can be removed from primary ballots. It is quite clear that Trump fomented the insurrection, fired up a mob, released it against the Capitol, and did nothing to stop what turned into an ugly, violent clash that claimed the lives of several people and endangered many others. Everyone in America saw what he did, heard his words, and saw his complacency toward the unfolding disaster, all of which is easily classifiable as violating the 14th Amendment.
If the justices do this, they will face enormous pressure from Trump’s following, a group of devotees who have shown not the least hesitation to threaten the lives of those who oppose their leader. The resume of this group, and it is by no means a complete list, includes an attempt to “arrest” the governor of Michigan, an attempt to force a caravan of Biden supporters off a highway, death threats sent to court officials and an attack on the U.S. Capitol building.
The justices could also rule that the former president is eligible to be on ballots in all 50 states. This is the path of least resistance and the path that requires the least courage. It will appease the Trump following and put the decision in the hands of voters. This is the most likely outcome, particularly if the three Trump-appointed justices do not recuse themselves. It is also the decision that will create the least public outcry.
The language in the 14th Amendment is plain. Trump’s behavior was obvious and continues to be obvious. The problem for the court and the problem for America in general is that Trump’s threats of retribution against those who oppose him pose a danger to the peace and stability of our nation if the court rules against his challenge.
Allowing each state to determine Trump’s fate would doom any chance he has to regain the White House. Since this situation is without precedent, whatever decision the Supreme Court makes will resonate throughout the future history of the United States.

“I don’t think it would hurt. I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting,” Whitmer said on CBS’s Face the Nation. Whitmer added that using more “blunt language” would be helpful as he communicates his belief that women, not politicians, should make their own decisions.
Democrats increased abortion rights messaging after conservative justices voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2002. The issue remains central to the party’s efforts to sway women and more moderate voters.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will headline an abortion rights rally in Virginia this week. Biden’s campaign said the event will “underscore what is at stake for reproductive freedom in 2024,” while communicating Biden’s “commitment to codifying the protections of Roe into law.”
Their campaign is also releasing television advertisements this week to run in battleground states marking the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Democrats are seeking to tie the issue to former President Donald Trump and his appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices that made Roe’s overturn possible.
Republican candidate Nikki Haley has suggested the idea of a ban on late-term abortions, though said that some restrictive laws would be difficult or impossible to pass through Congress.
Michigan approved a proposition to ingrain abortion access into the state constitution during the 2022 election, joining a small number of other states with such protections.

His opponent, former Trump cabinet member Nikki Haley, is making political hay out of his recent flub where he confused her with former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Don’t be surprised if you have someone that is 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That’s just human nature,” the former South Carolina governor said Sunday on Face the Nation. (Trump is 77 years-old and would be 78 on inauguration day 2025). She added, “I don’t know if he was confused, I don’t know what happened, but it’s enough to send us a warning sign.”
Did @NikkiHaley ever question Donald Trump’s mental fitness when she served in his cabinet?“I called him out if he was doing something wrong,” but she says that Trump is now “just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we're seeing some of that decline.” pic.twitter.com/D5coEaehEs
— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 21, 2024
Trump during a Friday campaign speech said that “Nikki Haley” was “in charge of security” at the Capitol on Jan. 6, repeating Haley’s name four times where he almost certainly meant to say Pelosi’s. Not only did Trump confuse Haley and Pelosi, he also repeated a claim that he offered to send 10,000 troops, which has been fully debunked by the Jan. 6 committee.
“Nikki Haley, you know they, do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it, because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security,” Trump told the rally crowd, although it’s unclear what exactly he claims Haley (or Pelosi) deleted. “We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard, whatever they want. They turned it down. They don’t want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people.”
When Margaret Brennan incredulously asked Haley if this was the first time she ever questioned Trump’s mental fitness, Haley listed a number of his recent flubs, but she conveniently skirted around Brennan’s question about whether she questioned Trump’s cognitive abilities while she served in his cabinet.
“[Trump] claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I’m assuming he meant World War III,” Haley said. “He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I’m the one that kept security from the Capitol on Jan. 6. I was nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6.”
Trump has defended his switching Biden and Obama’s names last November by claiming he did it “sarcastically.”
“When you worked in his cabinet, did you ever question his mental fitness?” Brennan asked Haley.
“When I worked in his cabinet, I called him out if he was doing something wrong,” Haley said, dodging the question. “I would show up, I’d pick up the phone and say, ‘You can’t do this, instead you could do X, Y, or Z… but this is different. We’re seeing he’s just not at the level he was in 2016. I think we’re seeing some of that decline. But more than that, what I’ll say is, focus on the fact that no matter what it is, chaos follows him. Rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him, and America is tired.”
“Does he cause it?” Brennan interjected.
“In some cases he causes it. In some cases he doesn’t, but regardless, he’s like a magnet to it,” Haley said.
Voters have demonstrated concern for both Biden and Trump’s mental fitness, although Biden hasn’t made Trump’s cognitive abilities a campaign issue the way Trump has done to Biden. And that may be reflected in the polls. An NBC News poll from Sept. 2023 found that 74 percent of respondents had major or moderate concerns about Biden “not having the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term,” while only 47 percent said the same of Trump’s mental and physical health.
Trump is currently leading over Haley in New Hampshire polls by eleven points. The Granite State heads to the polls for the primary on Tuesday.

Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) as a group of South Carolina politicians join Trump on stage in Manchester, New Hampshire.
MANCHESTER, N.H. – Three days before a New Hampshire primary in which former President Donald Trump hopes to defeat former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, he addressed a packed rally of his supporters alongside South Carolina’s top Republican elected officials.
Trump announced the group of conservative Palmetto State politicians – Haley’s successor Gov. Henry McMaster; Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette; State House Speaker Murrell Smith; Treasurer Curtis Loftis; Attorney General Alan Wilson; and U.S. Reps. William Timmons, Joe Wilson, and Russell Fry – as evidence of Haley’s political weakness. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a former presidential candidate, endorsed Trump on Friday, but was not present at Saturday night’s event.
“The Radical Left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley for one reason because they know she’s very easy to beat. She’s gonna be very easy to beat. She’s them,” Trump declared before introducing the elected officials, several of whom spoke on his behalf. “That’s why I’m so proud to be joined today by an incredible group of leaders from Nikki’s home state of South Carolina where we’ll be in about three weeks.”
Trump’s effort to display dominance over Haley served a dual purpose. Since the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Trump has hammered Haley as a liberal infiltrator because of her reliance on the support of anti-Trump moderate Republicans and independents. To that end, he has made the misleading claim that Democrats are allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. In fact, while independents are free to vote in the state’s GOP primary without any advance preparation, registered Democrats who want to participate must have switched their registration to the Republican Party in early October.
“They want to turn liberal voters into Republicans for about two minutes while they vote and then go back to being liberal voters in the Democrat party,” he said on Saturday night. “It’s terrible.”
After repeatedly suggesting changing party affiliation was as simple as changing a band-aid, he later made clear, in passing, that he understands that any Democrats who want to vote in the Republican primary needed to have done so by Oct. 6.
Trump did not mention that South Carolina, where polling shows him with a large lead in that state’s Feb. 24 contest, does not have partisan registration of any kind. That means that people who vote consistently for Democrats are free to participate without any additional requirements.
Don’t listen to polls. Get out and vote. We need a big, big win against these terrible people.Former President Donald Trump
Of course, Trump’s show of force on Saturday night also set the stage for a strategy he is likely to employ should he either lose, or win only narrowly, in New Hampshire: Writing off the state as a liberal aberration, and encouraging his supporters to avenge him in the deeply conservative Palmetto State. Thanks to its population of Trump-skeptical moderate and libertarian voters, Trump’s polling lead over Haley in New Hampshire, while substantial, is far narrower than it is in South Carolina.
“Don’t listen to polls,” he told the Manchester crowd, warning them against seeing his lead over Haley as a sure thing. “Get out and vote. We need a big, big win against these terrible people.”
Judging by the raucous crowd of thousands assembled to see Trump in Southern New Hampshire University’s arena on Saturday night, his base of supporters in the state does not lack for enthusiasm. Event staff closed the doors to the venue an hour before Trump got on stage, saying that the fire marshal said the arena was at legal capacity. Inside the arena though, there were many empty seats.
Even as he savaged Haley with biting attacks, Trump enjoyed a jovial rapport with the crowd.
“Nikki Haley, I know her well,” he began, prompting a chorus of boos and apparently a lone cry of “bird brain” from one attendee.
“The guy’s screaming ‘bird brain.’ Only in New Hampshire does that happen!” Trump responded.
Haley was the core focus of Trump’s speech, against whom he continued to marshal a combination of attacks from the right – that she is a “globalist” who will cave to China, bankroll Ukraine, and fail to curb illegal immigration – and from the left, by hitting her for her plans to raise Social Security’s retirement age.
Trump went on an extended riff about the latter point toward the end of his speech, arguing that her position was both wrongheaded and politically stupid.
“Haley said she wants to raise the Social Security retirement age to match life expectancy, which means that she wants it to go up to about 77. Is everybody happy with that?” he asked, eliciting a loud “no” from the audience. “It’s not going to happen with us.”
Haley has actually said that she would raise the age for younger workers to account for life expectancy, not to match average life expectancy exactly.
Trump went on to outline how Haley’s stance would cost her the election, just as former Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to privatize Medicare undermined Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential bid when Ryan was his vice presidential candidate.
“Paul Ryan’s 2011 plan to destroy Medicare – the same plan that led to Democrat ads, the most vicious ads showing Republicans wheeling granny off the cliff. Do you remember that? That was not good politics,” Trump recalled. “They lost that election.”
Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley speaks at a get-out-the-vote rally in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday. She has pinned her hopes on a strong showing in the Granite State.
Trump instead implied that he could grow the economy enough by drilling for more oil – “liquid gold under our feet” – that benefit cuts would not be necessary to close Social Security’s funding gap. (There are no credible actuarial analyses that say the program’s funding gap can be addressed solely through economic growth, though it is possible to shore up its finances with revenue increases alone.)
He also blasted Haley for supposedly supporting a 23% national sales tax, based on a 2012 social media post in which she said she supported “the Fair Tax” proposal. (A select group of fiscally conservative, congressional Republicans have, for years, introduced a bill called the FairTax Act that would replace federal income, payroll, and estate taxes with a single 23% sales tax.)
“Think about that. Think. This is death – this is death for a candidate,” he said. “The world doesn’t know that. I thought I’d let you know before the election.”
Trump treated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis mostly as an afterthought though he noted that DeSantis had also voted to raise the Social Security retirement age, and backed the 23% sales tax as a member of Congress.
“I haven’t even mentioned the name of Ron DeSanctimonious yet because I think he’s gone,” Trump said toward the beginning of his speech.
Someone in the crowd yelled out that DeSantis wears high heels. The claim is based on internet speculation that DeSantis uses lifts in his cowboy boots to make himself look taller.
Our economy didn't suck when he was our president and I was finally doing the best financially in my life.Leslie Szabunka, food service worker
“He does not wear high heels, OK! He does not wear high heels!” Trump joked with faux coyness. “All right, maybe.”
“Guy screams out, ‘He’s got a new pair of high heels,’” Trump added. “You can’t do that. It’s not polite. Don’t do that. I’ll have to admonish you.”
Trump supporters told HuffPost that they felt that the economy was better under Trump.
“Our economy didn’t suck when he was our president and I was finally doing the best financially in my life,” said Leslie Szabunka, a food service worker at a local college who was sporting a red “Trump” stocking hat.
Mahmoud Attia, manager of a Nashua pizza place, and his wife, Wesam Al-Sayed, drove up to hear Trump speak with their three boys. After waiting in line in the freezing cold for an extended time, they were not able to get in before the arena reached capacity.
Attia previously voted for Democrats, but regretted his vote for President Joe Biden and plans to rectify that with a vote for Trump this year.
Trump has a “strong personality. He knows what he’s doing,” said Attia, who immigrated from Egypt in the late 1990s. “He’s not a mess like this guy, like crooked Joe Biden.”
Asked what issues he had with Biden, Attia replied, “Economy sucks – everything is bad.”"
2771,U13HOU96I1_14DQ4ZT0G8Y8AB3,"DeSantis suspends presidential campaign, endorses Trump","Emily L. Mahoney, Jay Cridlin, Tampa Bay Times","Updated January 22, 2024 at 11:10 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-suspends-presidential-campaign-201300872.html,"Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that he is dropping out of the presidential race Sunday, ending the long-held ambitions of the man whom his backers previously deemed “America’s Governor” and who had positioned himself as the torchbearer for the next generation of Republican leadership.
DeSantis made the announcement in a video posted to the social media site X just before 3 p.m.
“Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome ... I would do it,” he said. “But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am, today, suspending my campaign.”
In the video, DeSantis threw his support behind former President Donald Trump, despite ramping up his attacks against Trump on the campaign trail.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,” DeSantis said. “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that (former South Carolina Gov.) Nikki Haley represents.”
The move suggests his team saw no viable path forward after placing a distant second behind Trump in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15, a state on which DeSantis had staked his campaign.
It was an unceremonious end to a campaign that previously had soaring expectations following DeSantis’ landslide 2022 reelection victory, a win that prompted many observers to predict that DeSantis could be the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination. Some early polls in late 2022 and early 2023 showed DeSantis leading Trump, in some cases by double digits.
But the reality was quite different.
Even after DeSantis’ campaign and supportive super PACs spent more than $100 million — including money spent to promote DeSantis in states that will now vote after he has dropped out — Florida’s governor could not pry Republican primary voters from Trump.
DeSantis was not expected to fare well in New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday. DeSantis had consistently fallen into fourth place in that state in publicly available polls, behind Trump, Haley and ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, before the latter dropped out.
DeSantis’ departure highlights how difficult the path may be for Haley in trying to loosen Trump’s grip on the party, even as the former president faces unprecedented criminal indictments.
Haley was stumping in Seabrook, New Hampshire, on Sunday when she learned DeSantis had dropped out. Haley and DeSantis had been locked in a political brawl for months as it became clear they were in a heated battle for second place.
”I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” Haley said to the voters at her event, according to a video posted to social media. ”Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” she said to cheers.
In a statement, Trump’s campaign bashed Haley and called for “all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.” Speaking at his campaign’s Manchester, New Hampshire, office, Trump on Sunday told reporters that his favorite nickname for DeSantis, “Ron DeSanctimonious,” was “officially retired.”
Less than 24 hours before he dropped out, DeSantis had packed a town hall in Lexington, South Carolina — his third Palmetto State stop of the day — where he reiterated his stance that he would not accept the role of Trump’s vice president. He also addressed the prospect of endorsing the former president.
“(Trump) expects everyone to endorse him,” DeSantis told supporters. “And if you don’t, you could be the most conservative, successful elected official in America, and he will trash you.”
Within hours of DeSantis’ campaign suspension, several state lawmakers who had endorsed DeSantis for president announced they were switching their support to Trump.
“Nobody will work harder than I will in making sure we return President Donald J. Trump to the White House,” state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia posted on X, days after he’d flown to frigid Iowa to campaign for DeSantis. “Let’s gooooooo!!!!”
Just earlier in the day on Sunday, DeSantis’ campaign sent out a text to supporters asking them to “make your voice heard with Ron DeSantis.” And DeSantis had several events lined up in New Hampshire leading up to Tuesday’s primary, as well as Sunday appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and CNN’s “State of the Union.”
When he pulled out of those interviews Saturday evening, spokesperson Bryan Griffin posted on X that it was because of “a scheduling issue” and that DeSantis would be traveling to New Hampshire Sunday morning for “public events scheduled Sunday evening through Tuesday.”
Once news broke that DeSantis was suspending his campaign, Griffin wrote that his Saturday post was true at the time, and that DeSantis’ decision “was made today after rerouted travel to Florida to make it at home with family.”
While his bid for president may be over, DeSantis will still be the chief executive of Florida through 2026. What was less clear, though, is how DeSantis’ once-enormous clout in Tallahassee could be impacted by this loss in the national arena.
“His ridiculous obsession with the presidency has had real consequences here, from his refusal to address our property insurance and affordability crises to the effects of his made-up culture wars,” said Nikki Fried, the chairperson of the Florida Democratic Party. “His lack of people skills and political instincts — not to mention complete inability to surround himself with a competent team — finally brought him to the most predictable place we could imagine: a whimper of an ending almost as embarrassing as his failure to launch in May.”
At his final campaign stop Saturday night, DeSantis took questions from the audience for about an hour before shaking hands and posing for photos with supporters near the stage. He left with a wave, saying “thank you” as Fleetwood Mac’s “Don’t Stop” played overhead.

Donald Trump looks to knock out Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis,"David Jackson, USA TODAY","Updated January 22, 2024 at 6:56 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-death-knell-donald-trump-191706587.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. - Former President Donald Trump is looking for a Republican campaign knockout punch.
Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley is trying to keep her 2024 campaign alive - something Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was unable to do during the New Hampshire campaign.
Given the stakes, the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday will be a big turning point in the Republican presidential race.
And perhaps end it altogether.
""We have to win by a lot,"" Trump told backers Saturday in a chilly hockey arena in Manchester, later adding: ""Now's the time for the Republican Party to unify.""
The night before, in Concord, Trump said of the New Hampshire primary: ""This could end it.""
DeSantis accommodated Trump early, announcing Sunday he was suspending his campaign and endorsing the former president.
This despite the fact that Trump faces up to four criminal trials in months ahead, that he is in the middle of a civil damages trial in which he is accused of sexual abuse, and that he's made shaky statements on the stump, including mixing up Haley and former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Haley, the former South Carolina governor, has surged in New Hampshire polls and put herself in position for a possible upset.
After finishing third in Iowa, is banking on a unique feature of the New Hampshire primary: Independents can vote in party primaries.
While Haley is pursuing these independent voters, Trump remains the favorite in New Hampshire. As of Sunday, the average of polls compiled by the Real Clear Politics website puts Trump at 50.3%, Haley at 35.3%, and DeSantis at 6.3%.
Haley and her supporters, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, said that even a strong second place will propel her into her home state primary in South Carolina on Feb. 24.
At the present time, Trump also enjoys a huge lead in South Carolina.
Haley has said little about Trump's legal troubles, preferring instead to emphasize his political baggage.
All the ""drama"" surrounding Trump would make him unelectable in a fall race against President Joe Biden, Haley has said. She holds Trump responsible for Republican election reversals in 2018, 2020 and 2022.
""The problem with Joe Biden and Donald Trump is we've seen they take all of politics personal,"" Haley told Fox News. ""That's what's gotten us into this situation with the country where we are, where it's divided and it's toxic.""
Coming off a convincing win in the Iowa caucuses last week, Trump has repeatedly said he would pressure rivals to get out of the race if he takes a ""big vote"" in New Hampshire.
While Trump has spent most of the campaign going after DeSantis, he has recently intensified his attacks on Haley as she displaced the Florida governor as the biggest electoral threat to the former president.
The Trump attacks have been called racist, toxic and in some cases just plain strange.
During his rally in Concord, Trump confused Haley with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when discussing Trump supporters' attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Trump has also made references to Haley's Indian heritage. He has repeatedly mangled Haley's given first name − Nimarata − as “Nimbra."" He has re-posted a ""birther"" hit piece questioning whether Haley is eligible for the presidency (she is, having been born in the United States).
Haley said Trump's attacks show he is ""scared"" of her rise in the nomination race.
In addition to asking for votes, Trump is defending himself against many legal accusations by claiming that accusers are using the legal system to play politics.
Trump's future trials include two cases in which he is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election, triggering the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.
The New Hampshire primary is taking place in the middle of a civil defamation trial in which Trump is accused of sexual assault.
Writer E. Jean Carroll testified that Trump lied about her and about he assaulted her in a department store in the 1990s.
On two days last week, Trump attended the Carroll trial in the morning and then flew to New Hampshire for campaign rallies in the evening.
The former president may testify in the Carroll trial as soon as Monday, the day before the New Hampshire primary.
Throughout the campaign, Trump has claimed that the indictments are politically motivated. Polls indicate that many Republicans agree with him, while moderates and independent voters are more concerned about Trump's behavior.
DeSantis, the governor of Florida, had insisted he was in the race to stay − right before announcing by video Sunday that he was withdrawing.
It wasn't a total shock. Since finishing a distant second in Iowa, DeSantis has split his campaign time between New Hampshire and South Carolina, for some reason.
DeSantis was in single digits in New Hampshire polling and canceled a pair of national television interviews on Sunday, ratcheting up questions about his political future.
All this after saying he planned to live up to the New Hampshire state slogan.
""‘Live free or die’ is the motto I have led by in Florida, and it’s the mindset I’ll bring to the White House as president,"" DeSantis said on the social media site X (formerly Twitter).
As they head to the polls Tuesday, New Hampshire voters have been known to deliver surprises, a quality that Haley is counting on.
In the Democratic primary of 2008, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was coming off a big win in Iowa and was heavily favored to defeat New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Clinton won.
In 2000, Arizona Sen. John McCain defeated Republican frontrunner George W. Bush in New Hampshire, a surprise blowout fueled by the kinds of independent voters being wooed by Haley.
Many New Hampshire Republicans forecast a Trump win after a relatively lifeless campaign conducted recently in cold January weather.
""There's low energy around the whole race,"" said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who is backing Haley.
One reason, he said, is the sense that New Hampshire and the rest of the country are headed ""for something nobody wants: A rematch between Biden and Trump.""
Nationwide, many Republicans said Haley will need at least a very close loss in New Hampshire in order to be competitive down the line.
""If Trump beat her in New Hampshire by a very narrow margin − say 1 point − she might be able to make a last stand in South Carolina,' said Liz Mair, a Republican political strategist who opposes Trump.
The problem, she said, is that ""Trump is extremely popular in South Carolina, so she needs a lot of momentum going into the state. It’s hard to see how she gets that without a win"" in New Hampshire.
Trump backers who saw him in Manchester expressed total confidence, though they said Haley and/or DeSantis will stay in the race for a while if anti-Trump activists keep giving them money.
Roger Sylvester, 71, a retired farmer from Clarksville, N.H., said that, one way or another, a big New Hampshire win would be eventually fatal to any stop-Trump effort.
""It'll be the beginning of the death knell,"" he said.

MANCHESTER, N.H. (NEXSTAR) – Manchester is home to New Hampshire’s well-known political institute and to get questions answered ahead of Tuesday’s first in the nation primary, we heard from an expert in the department.
Donald Trump is well ahead in the polls, yet still people question how. Voters who don’t back Trump want to know what his backers see in the former president.
Executive Director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anslem College, Neil Levesque, spoke about the loyalty of Trump supporters. Levesque is from New Hampshire and has hosted four presidential primary debates.
“Donald Trump has a connection with a certain segment of republican primary voters that I’ve never seen before in politics.”
Levesque’s says his loyal backers trust, love, and believe in him.
“No one really has been able to make an argument to a solid Trump voter as to why they shouldn’t vote for Trump.”
Even with four criminal indictment charges, Trump supporters have not turned their backs on him. New Hampshire voters have not penalized Trump for his lack of engagement in debates either which is evident from the polls.
“It’s a fascinating situation because he’s almost like a goal post. He’s been about 45% popularity here in New Hampshire for a whole year, despite all the indictments all the things going on all the opponents attacking him, all the money spent, still 45%.”
While the debate that was supposed to be held at Saint Anslem College was canceled, Trump is still making his way through the state to reach the people of New Hampshire. He has speeches and rallies scheduled throughout the weekend in Concord, Manchester and Rochester.

2781,UJS6KNT449_B43AC9NCJJ1D0I0,Picking up the pieces: DeSantis campaign chief draws criticism for jigsaw,Rozina Sabur,"January 22, 2024 at 2:51 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantiss-campaign-chief-criticised-175122211.html,"A key figure behind Ron DeSantis’s presidential bid has been criticised for doing a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle during a critical point in the Florida governor’s campaign.
Scott Wagner, head of the Never Back Down political action committee, has come under fire from staff within the group after Mr DeSantis finished in a distant second place in Iowa.
They shared a photograph with NBC News of Mr Wagner working on the puzzle at the group’s headquarters in West Des Moines, just days before the caucuses.
“Staffers are putting their dedication and devotion to electing Governor DeSantis and they come in and the CEO, the chairman of the organisation, is sitting there working on a puzzle for hours,” one member of the group said.
Mr Wagner told the network the puzzle was “there when we arrived” and “became a sense of pride for the entire team and everyone chipped in a few minutes a piece to get it done”.
“We worked non-stop together on operations in terrible weather conditions,” he added. “I am so proud of what we achieved in Iowa and will achieve beyond.”
The multi-million dollar Never Back Down operation had staked much of its capital on a strong showing in the first state to vote in the Republican nomination contest.
Mr DeSantis was so confident of victory, he declared just last month: “We’re going to win Iowa”. However, he trailed Donald Trump, who secured 51 per cent of the vote, by 30 points.
It is just the latest criticism of Never Back Down, which entered the 2024 race with more than $80 million and spent huge sums recruiting staff to knock on hundreds of thousands of doors and make phone calls to potential voters in Iowa.
The New York Times suggested the effort “could go down as one of the most colossal bonfires of cash in American political history”.
Mr DeSantis’s political campaign group is now laying off staff as it shifts operations out of Iowa.
Throughout the latter half of last year several prominent Republican donors pulled or paused their contributions to the governor’s coffers as his poll numbers plateaued.

2783,UPOOZZ89F2_QJ56WOJ1F44AICR,The attacks on Donald Trump’s age may be at a tipping point,Shelby Talcott,"January 21, 2024 at 8:43 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/attacks-donald-trump-age-may-234300710.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Donald Trump is 77 years old. After he repeatedly mixed her up with Nancy Pelosi during his speech last night, Nikki Haley wants voters to know that.
“I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this,” she said Saturday in Keene. “We can’t.”
On Fox News, she continued that focus: “These are people making decisions on the future of our economy. Do we really want them throwing out names and getting things wrong when they’re 80 and having to deal with Putin and Xi and Kim and North Korea? We can’t do that.”
And at a stop in Petersborough, she mentioned Trump’s prior habit of describing Barack Obama as if he’s the current president, a recurring story that drew enough attention late last year for Trump to address it on Truth Social, claiming it was deliberate.
“He got confused and said he was running against Obama — he never ran against Obama!” she said. “Don’t put our country at risk like this.”
Lines like these have been a long time coming: Haley launched her presidential bid calling for politicians over 75 to be required to take a “mental competency test,” a proposal she continues to tout in speeches.
But since coming in third in Iowa last week, the attack has sharpened. On the campaign trail this week, the former South Carolina governor has repeatedly mentioned Trump’s age, tying him in with President Joe Biden for good measure: “The majority of Americans think that having two 80-year-olds running for president is not what they want,” she told voters on Tuesday. And on Saturday, she noted how he “got confused” when discussing her culpability in security failures on January 6th as if she were speaker — even though “I wasn’t even in D.C. on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office then.”
She’s not alone either: DeSantis has argued for months that Trump has lost a step. “If you put a side by side between him in 2016 riffing and really at the top of his game versus now in 2024, I mean, it’s just a different guy that you’re seeing there,” he told Iowa radio host Steve Deace earlier this month.
There’s little sign attacks on Trump’s age, let alone his cognitive fitness, have swayed Republican voters — and it’s pretty late for this angle to start working now. But Democrats are watching closely as well for signs they may be able to neutralize Biden’s vulnerabilities on the issue in a general election.
“Trump is all about projecting,” New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley said. “Trump’s a crook so he calls Hillary a crook. Trump is feeble minded, so he calls Biden feeble.”
Last year, the Biden campaign, frustrated with the ongoing narrative about Biden’s own age and health, began trying to flip the script — or at least bring Trump into the conversation — by highlighting Trump’s gaffes while out on the campaign trail. Their campaign accounts have continuously shared every little example they can find of Trump stumbling on his words or going off on an odd tangent.
The Haley/Pelosi mixup, under the glare of peak primary campaign coverage, may be the most traction this angle has gotten, and Democrats now have clips of Republicans validating the attack.
On Saturday, the Biden campaign even shared Haley’s comments on the episode, writing on X: “Haley reacts to Trump’s delusional and confused rant last night where he suggested that she was Speaker of the House on January 6: He got confused. I question if he’s mentally fit.” (Left out: The part where she directly compared him to Biden).
Making Biden look younger is a tough task. But a critical part of his re-election hinges on convincing some Democratic-leaning voters worried about his age that it should not be a decisive concern relative to the alternative. An encouraging Marist poll this week showed him leading Trump in New Hampshire, thanks to solid support from people who “somewhat disapprove” of his job as president — an example of what a winning map around the country might look like.
The former president is (once again) starting to brag about his cognitive abilities on the campaign trail this week. During a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Trump declared that he feels “like I’m about 35 years old.”
“I actually feel better now than I did 30 years ago,” Trump said. “Tell me, is that crazy? I feel better now, and I think cognitively I’m better than I was 20 years ago.”
After a house party in Concord organized by the Write In Biden campaign, California Rep. Ro Khanna said that Democrats didn’t need to pile on Trump for a moment of confusion.
“I think there are plenty of reasons to campaign against Donald Trump — January 6, his two impeachments,” Khanna said. “This is sort of gotcha politics. Anyone who’s spoken a long time makes mistakes. This is the type of politics they do to Biden, and I don’t think we have to reciprocate.”
At The Atlantic, McKay Coppins recommended Americans of political stripes visit a Trump rally, which are rarely carried live and unedited this election cycle. One of the biggest changes from 2016 he noticed at a recent event: Trump “often turned rambly, and the crowd seemed to lose interest.”"

Ambassador Nikki Haley had a curt goodbye for GOP primary rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday after DeSantis announced he will suspend his presidential campaign.
DeSantis, who has for months feuded with Haley in debates and on the campaign trail, endorsed Trump.
“Ron DeSantis has been a good governor, and I wish him well,” Haley said in a statement.
Haley painted a hopeful picture for her White House bid, as she is now the last candidate standing between Trump and a third consecutive GOP nomination. Trump did well in last week’s Iowa caucuses, but the Haley campaign hopes a good performance in New Hampshire could provide the needed momentum to upset Trump.
“So far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not,” she said. “We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road.”
“New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision,” she added.
The former South Carolina governor has sharpened her attacks on Trump in recent weeks as Republican voters begin to go to polls, claiming that Trump couldn’t beat President Biden in the 2024 election.
“All the evidence says that if it’s a Trump-Biden rematch, it’s going to be another toss-up election. It could go either way,” Haley said in remarks after Iowa’s caucuses last week. “And then look at what happens when I go head-to-head against Biden. We win in a landslide. It’s not even close.”
Polls support her sentiment, with Trump leading Biden by a single point according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average of polls, while Haley would lead Biden by 3 points.
In New Hampshire, Haley trails Trump by about 11 points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average of state polls. Nationally, she is behind by a massive 55 percentage points. Both figures use polls that included DeSantis.

Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination Sunday, ending a bid that began as the best-funded and most high-profile challenge to former President Trump but fizzled over the course of a year.
He endorsed Trump, saying in a video posted to social media that it was now clear that ""a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
DeSantis said he and his team had “prayed and deliberated” about how to move forward after he finished a distant second in last week's Iowa caucuses.
“I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory,” DeSantis added. “Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
""Fire sale on all Ron DeSantis merch today!"" Gov. Gavin Newsom, who predicted DeSantis would not be the Republican nominee when the pair debated on Fox News in November, gleefully wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

DeSantis received 21.2% of the vote in Iowa, well behind Trump's 51% and just two points ahead of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who won 19.1%.
DeSantis said he disagreed with Trump over his handling of the pandemic and his ""elevation"" of chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, but argued that the former president ""is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden.”
In a visit to his New Hampshire campaign headquarters Sunday afternoon, Trump acknowledged the endorsement from DeSantis, whom he called a “very capable person.”
“Without the endorsement, I think we would have gotten almost all of those votes because we have very similar policies — strong borders, great education, low taxes, very, very few regulations,” Trump said.
In his farewell video, DeSantis also took a dig at Haley, who has steadily risen in the polls.
""We can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,"" DeSantis said.
“He ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” Haley said at a New Hampshire event Sunday afternoon, minutes after DeSantis exited the race. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left. … All the fellas are out except for this one. And this comes down to, what do you want? Do you want more of the same or do you want something new?”

DeSantis' sudden departure from the contest effectively makes Tuesday's New Hampshire primary a head-to-head battle between Haley and Trump. But DeSantis, several other Republican dropouts and a collection of lesser-known candidates will all still appear on Tuesday's ballot.
Haley has staked her campaign on the Granite State, hoping to slow the Trump juggernaut by winning over moderate New Hampshire voters. Polling over the last two months showed her gaining on the former president, and by early January she appeared to be within striking distance. But after her less-than-impressive showing in Iowa last week, Haley's New Hampshire outlook began to look grimmer.
Earlier on Sunday, the closely watched Suffolk University/NBC 10 Boston/Boston Globe tracking poll had Trump finishing with 55% of the vote to Haley’s 36%. In the same poll released Sunday, DeSantis was a distant third, polling at just 6%. Even if all DeSantis voters switched to Haley, the shift would not be enough to eliminate Trump’s lead.
DeSantis’ decision to drop out will not greatly benefit Haley, said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire.
“It makes the hill even steeper,” he said. “Most of those DeSantis voters are not going to Haley. Some will stay with DeSantis anyway. Of those remaining, I’ve got to think the split will favor Trump. That makes things a little steeper for Haley on Tuesday.”
Scala marveled at how quickly Trump appeared to be securing the GOP nomination. “How rapidly Trump is wrapping things up is remarkable,” Scala said.
“It’s been over from Day 1 and it just takes some of these knuckleheads time to figure out they never had a shot in the first place,"" Ray Buckley, the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said in an interview. ""Trump’s margin is growing by the hour and he’s going to have a blowout on Tuesday.”
A year ago, DeSantis appeared to represent a formidable challenge to Trump and surpassed him in many polls of potential Republican primary voters.
A mid-February UC Berkeley IGS/Los Angeles Times poll of California Republicans, for example, found DeSantis leading Trump 37% to 29% in the state, which sends the largest delegation to the Republican National Convention. At the time, Republicans were still smarting from the defeats they suffered in the 2022 midterm elections, which many in the party blamed on Trump, and many voters were open to DeSantis' argument that he could offer Trump-like policies without the attendant baggage.

But the strength of that argument waned as memories of the midterm losses began to fade. At the same time, three other developments undermined DeSantis' hopes: Criminal indictments of Trump caused many Republican voters to rally around the former president; Biden's standing in polls started to slip, blunting the argument that Republicans needed someone other than Trump to defeat the incumbent; and Trump pummeled DeSantis with attacks that the Florida governor largely left unanswered, fearing that attacking back would alienate the Trump supporters he needed.
When DeSantis was riding high, polls showed that much of his support came from Republicans skeptical of Trump — college-educated voters and more moderate Republicans who disliked the former president's style and some of his policies. But DeSantis aimed his appeals primarily at Trump's core supporters, who make up the largest part of the Republican primary electorate. For a brief time, that approach appeared to work — conservative voters were attracted to DeSantis because of his issue stands and his pugnacious attacks on liberals and culture-war targets, while moderates saw him as the best bet to beat Trump.
But the strategy only worked so long as DeSantis seemed to be beating Trump. Once his poll numbers started to decline, many of those moderate voters pulled away. Meantime, most conservatives seemed uninterested in anyone other than Trump.
That set in motion a downward spiral that DeSantis proved unable to reverse. Between January and July, he lost roughly half his support in the average of national polls maintained by FiveThirtyEight, a polling aggregator. In California, Trump retook the lead by mid-May and never relinquished it.
Over the course of the fall, DeSantis’ aides fought bitterly — sometimes publicly — over strategy, and the candidate often appeared to be flailing as he sought a way forward. DeSantis’ campaign was plagued by a series of blunders, starting with his campaign launch, which took place on Twitter and was interrupted by technical problems.

Jason Roe, a top DeSantis supporter who helped lead Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's presidential bids, said the Florida governor's media strategy and unwillingness to trust advisors outside his Florida circle led to his downfall. Roe also said the campaign should have focused more on fundraising and communications.
“The campaign never found its footing,” said Roe, who also served as strategist for San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. “The rollout was clunky, the restarts were clunky. I think Trump brilliantly bracketed everything they tried to do to find their sea legs. Once [Trump] got indicted, I think that made him unstoppable.”
A former staffer at Never Back Down, the super PAC that formed the backbone of DeSantis’ campaign, was deeply disappointed by the Florida governor’s decision to drop out. But the person, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, questioned the organization's decision to hire staff in Super Tuesday states, including California and Texas, before it was clear that DeSantis could survive the early-state contests.
“He’s amazing. He did the 99 counties,” the staffer said, referring to DeSantis’ barnstorming of Iowa. “He’s not lazy. He’s a hard worker. I truly wish he was the guy.”

“He’s just not at the same level he was in 2016,” the former South Carolina governor said Sunday of Trump on CBS’s Face the Nation. “I think we’re seeing some of that decline.”
Haley, 52, has mostly steered clear of strong attacks on the 77-year-old former president, whom she served as United Nations ambassador. But she seized on Trump’s mental acuity after he repeatedly appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a rally on Friday night.
Her shift in tone comes as the critical vote looms Tuesday, with a new CNN poll showing Trump holds 50% of support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire versus 39% for Haley.

On CBS, Haley ticked off “multiple” examples of Trump possibly being “confused.”
“He claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I’m assuming he meant World War III,” she said. “He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I’m the one that kept security from the Capitol on January 6th, I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6th.”
“Don’t be surprised if you have someone that’s 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline,” Haley said.
“It should be enough to send us a warning sign,” she said. “Joe Biden, he’s very different than he was two years ago.”
Biden, 81, added his voice to the tumult over Trump’s repeated assertions Haley was responsible for security on Jan. 6.
“I don’t agree with Nikki Haley on everything, but we agree on this much: She is not Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said on X, formerly Twitter.
New Hampshire so far presents the strongest opportunity for Haley to upset Trump, owing to the state’s more moderate electorate and the ability of undeclared voters to participate in the GOP primary.

But even if she defies the polls and wins in New Hampshire, Haley faces a steep climb toward the GOP nomination. Other polls show Trump dominating around the nation, including in her home state of South Carolina. That primary is on Feb. 24.

The era of certainty is gone. The modern age is defined by heightened confusion and inexplicable world events. Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The election (and possible re-election) of Donald Trump. Attempted coups-d’état in the U.S., Russia and Germany. The first global pandemic in a century.
In the face of all this, it’s difficult to escape the feeling that our current system is dysfunctional. There is mass uncertainty about the future in America and other Western nations, bolstered by a series of alarming trends.
The U.S. is currently the only country in the developed world where life expectancy is declining. This is partly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the trend actually began a few years earlier. From 2014 to 2017, life expectancy fell for three consecutive years; this hadn't happened in the U.S. since 1918, and is virtually unheard-of in modern societies not facing war or disease. According to data from the Center for Disease Control, U.S. life expectancy is now at its lowest since 1996. COVID erased two full decades of life-expectancy growth in the U.S, whereas average life expectancy in peer countries decreased only marginally, to about the level of 2018.
Why is this happening in the richest country in the world? The reasons are not obscure. It’s largely happening because of an increasing number of what have been called “deaths of despair” (this mostly means suicides and alcohol- or drug-related fatalities), which disproportionately occur among white middle-class or working-class Americans. The term comes from Princeton researchers Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who speculate that the phenomenon is related to economic inequality and inadequate health care. In 2017, the number of deaths of despair in the U.S. was estimated at 150,000. The U.S. appears to be facing the worst drug epidemic in its history right now. Overdoses have joined car crashes and gun violence as a leading cause of death, and suicide rates hit an all-time high in 2022.
Last year, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a public advisory about loneliness in America, declaring it to be a public health crisis. The mortality impact of being socially disconnected, Murthy reported, was similar to that caused by smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day. In 2018, the British government created an unofficial ""minister of loneliness"" position. Japan did the same in 2021, partly in response to the ""Hikikomori phenomenon,"" a severe form of social isolation in which young men stay in their rooms for periods of six months or more. By some estimates, more than half a million Japanese men have become Hikikomori.
The U.S. is suffering from an inability to provide basic, reliable social services. Although the Biden administration has ramped up infrastructure spending, the American Society of Civil Engineers still grades U.S. infrastructure at C-minus, its second lowest ranking. The U.S. exhibits higher wealth inequality than almost any other developed country, and is the only major developed country that does not guarantee health care to all citizens.
In other words, these symptoms of decline did not come out of nowhere. We have been following this trajectory for decades. America now ranks as a “developing nation” on a number of international indexes. Our condition is not terminal, but it is moving in the wrong direction. The overall health of our society is backsliding, and it seems conceivable that we could be approaching a major upheaval on the scale of the collapse of communism in the 1990s.
No one can predict the future with certainty. But what is so striking about the current moment is that the most serious threat to America's existing social order is not some better-performing alternative model advocated by our adversaries. It is coming from within. For decades after World War II, anticommunism was the driving force behind our geopolitical strategy. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, this antagonism has been directed internally.
In the 1970s, power began to shift away from the manufacturing sector and toward financial institutions, constituting a new economic reality no longer organized around the means of production and distribution. Around the same time, we saw a precipitous decline in union membership and collective bargaining. Financial regulations were dismantled. Wages began to stagnate. Speculation increased. Following the collapse of the Democratic coalition forged by Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, political figures from both parties were unable to envision or enact anything approaching major economic reforms, even after the crash of 2008, the worst since the Great Depression.

In the 1960s and 70s, Republicans capitalized on the backlash to civil rights legislation with the “Southern strategy,” drawing Southern white voters away from Democratic Party. They also mobilized evangelical Christians by championing bans on abortion. This has led directly to today’s partisan split, where the domestic agenda is dominated by culture-war issues involving race, sex and gender. Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections, yet have managed to hold power almost half the time — a form of minority sabotage. The ideal of national unity seems increasingly precarious.
Mitch McConnell, of all people, accurately summarized the nation's polarization crisis: “We cannot keep drifting apart into two separate tribes with a separate set of facts and separate realities with nothing in common except our hostility toward each other and mistrust for the few national institutions that we all still share.”
The days when the public could debate a set of shared facts are over. The news media in America today has become increasingly fragmented, not unlike the situation in nations divided by civil war, where information must be pieced together from conflicting reports delivered by sources loyal to opposing oligarchies. There was once a sort of monoculture in American news media, where people responded to the same set of basic facts. This had its downsides, of course, but today, there is no longer any consensus reality at all. The internet democratized information, but degraded its quality. Incompatible worldviews have been isolated within bubbles where contradictory points of view or unresolved complications cannot reach.
America is effectively becoming two societies, who agree about almost nothing except blaming the other side. This has contributed to a larger culture of social fragmentation: People of all demographic groups feel more alone than ever before, while public trust in the government has been at record lows for years. This kind of turmoil provides fertile ground for populist demagogues.
In recent years, we’ve seen far-right movements emerge around the globe, and far-right leaders come to power, at least temporarily, in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil, Italy, Hungary, Argentina and the Philippines, among other countries. There has also been a resurgence of left-wing politics, though with less electoral success: Bernie Sanders never became the Democratic presidential nominee; Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the British Labour Party ended in defeat. Meanwhile, the previously dominant political center has all but collapsed in many Western nations, although perhaps Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak offer evidence that it has not become obsolete.
This goes far beyond electoral spectacle; it could be seen as symptomatic of a death-drive. Since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has maintained the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic measurement of how close the world is to nuclear annihilation. Midnight marks the theoretical destruction point. Last year, because of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Board placed the clock's hands at 90 seconds to midnight — the closest to Armageddon it has ever been.
Last March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its annual climate change synthesis report, which concluded that uncontrolled greenhouse-gas emissions will lead to “widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages to nature and people.” Last June, smoke from wildfires in Canada drifted hundreds of miles down to the eastern seaboard of the U.S., turning the skies orange over New York City. July was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.
We should consider what Sigmund Freud in ""Civilization and its Discontents"" called ""the fateful question for the human species"":
[W]hether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction. It may be that in this respect, precisely the present time deserves a special interest. Men have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help, they would have no difficulty in exterminating one another to the last man. They know this, and hence comes a large part of their current unease, their unhappiness and mood of anxiety. And now it is to be expected that the other of the two ""Heavenly Powers,"" eternal Eros, will make an effort to assert himself in the struggle with his equally immortal adversary. But who can foresee with what success and with what result?
In an era when multiple catastrophes are competing for primacy, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that our society is entering a death spiral. We are in a period of what UC Berkeley professor Alexei Yurchak calls ""hypernormalisation,"" a term he coined to describe life in the Soviet Union during the last years of the Communist regime. It describes a moment when everyone knows the system is failing but no one has a viable alternative vision, so the state of decay comes to seem normal. Is this where we are?
Alternative paths are, in fact, possible, and opinion polling suggests that most Americans want them. Majorities favor raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes on the wealthy, creating national health insurance, enacting the Green New Deal and rebuilding public infrastructure. They oppose cutting or privatizing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In this and many other ways, the gap between what Americans want and what those who supposedly represent them are willing or able to do is stark, even shocking.
History is clear enough: Positive change nearly always begins with mass movements: the civil rights movement, women’s rights, the Vietnam War protests, the anti-apartheid movement, LGBTQ activism and many more. For a variety of reasons, protest movements in the 21st century — from the Iraq war to Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and climate justice — have not succeeded in creating large-scale social and economic change, although they have shifted public consciousness to some degree. What the future will require, I believe, is a level of sustained street activism in conjunction with labor militancy and workplace democracy, the likes of which America had in the 1930s. We can see hints of this in the renewed power of labor unions, although these still represent a small proportion of America's workers.
This kind of unified movement could assert power from outside government by controlling key sectors in the economy, with the goal of improving living standards, increasing wages and providing equal access to health care benefits for everyone. More optimistically, such a movement could, in the longer term, help encourage a return to communal life. People engaged in cooperative efforts for their mutual benefit feel less alone — because they are not alone — and feel a greater sense of purpose and stability in their lives.
In one direction lies a future built on citizen engagement and a shared vision. In the other lies the Soviet Union in 1991, a superpower that no one imagined could collapse — until it did."

There are more than three reasons we are unable to break the cycle of budget dysfunction. Leading the way? Courage.
Members of Congress know that doing the right thing and making the hard decisions means slashing the federal budget, reducing the non-Defense federal employment headcount, eliminating departments that are relics, and modifying the social safety net to ensure it remains sustainable long term — all of which will upset the status quo and put their reelection in jeopardy.

Evangelical pastors are fostering comparisons of Donald Trump with Jesus. I understand that anything goes in politics, but ministers should be expected to stay within the vicinity of truth and accuracy.
Unlike Trump, Jesus never committed fraud, sexually abused a woman, lied constantly, sought revenge or retribution, or demeaned the weak, disabled or immigrants. It is disheartening to see “Christians” on TV earnestly make these comparisons. They honestly feel they represent true Christian understanding and values. The question is, whose Christianity? It seems some people are making it up as they go.

Get a job, two or three jobs if necessary, and earn the living they need to pay their bills — just as we did.

2803,VGIBSIHGAH_DM4ZDOCZSIJUHVI,Ron DeSantis ends his struggling presidential bid before New Hampshire and endorses Donald Trump,The Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 5:24 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-ends-struggling-presidential-202450492.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign on Sunday, ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump.
The decision leaves Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary. This is the scenario Trump’s foes in the GOP have long sought, raising the stakes for this week’s contest as the party’s last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.
But as some Trump critics cheered, DeSantis nodded toward Trump’s primary dominance — and attacked Haley — in an exit video he posted on social media.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone.
He continued: “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Haley spoke at a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as DeSantis announced his decision.
“He ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” she told a room packed with supporters and media. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.“
DeSantis’ decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa, marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Trump’s supremacy in the Republican Party.His record wasn’t enough to overcome Trump
He entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $130 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses — which he had vowed to win — by 30 percentage points to Trump.His departure was days in the making
DeSantis’ allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.
The Florida governor notified top donors and supporters of his decision through a series of phone conversations and text messages between senior campaign officials to top donors and supporters on Sunday afternoon, according to two people who received such communications. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversations.
DeSantis had returned to Florida by then after a roller-coaster weekend that included stops in South Carolina ahead of an event in New Hampshire Sunday evening that was ultimately canceled. The campaign also canceled a series of national television appearances earlier in the day, blaming the cancelation on a miscommunication with DeSantis’ super PAC.
DeSantis was physically worn after spending weeks on the campaign with little, if any, time off, even as he stormed across frigid Iowa and New Hampshire, often without a winter coat.A bitter rivalry comes to a meek end
He ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Trump given his popularity in the party despite the deeply personal feud between them.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,” said DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida’s governor, which ends in January 2027.
The endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for DeSantis, whom Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.
For Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staffers, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy. Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality, and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.
DeSantis’ team joined Trump in attacking Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape. Some doubt Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head matchup between Trump, would benefit from DeSantis’ decision.
“She will not be the nominee,” key DeSantis supporter Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told AP. “She will not be the president of the United States.”
Trump had already shifted his focus to Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after DeSantis’ announcement, the former president’s campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Haley to win New Hampshire.
“Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire — there are only two options,” wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.
“Option A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” they wrote. “Option B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARRASSED in her home state of South Carolina,” which votes on Feb. 24.
“Now, for some important advice,” they continued. “Choose wisely.”
Trump himself addressed DeSantis’ departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.
“We just got some word that one of our opponents, very capable person, is dropping out of the race — Ron DeSantis. And Ron is dropping out and, in doing so, he endorsed us,” Trump said to cheers, before a “Trump!” chant broke out in the room of volunteers.
Asked if he would be using the nickname “Ron DeSanctimonious”: “I said that name is officially retired,” he said to loud cheers.
At roughly the same time not far away, DeSantis’ dejected supporters gathered privately in the Manchester restaurant where he had been scheduled to speak.
Rep. James Spillane, of Deerfield, said he had initially backed Trump, switched to DeSantis and will now vote for Trump.
“I had a suspicion this morning, and I had talked to some friends of mine saying the way I was hearing things shake out, I thought this was going to happen, and I was right,” he said. “Unfortunately, DeSantis is not going to be able to make it forward. However, in the future, hopefully we can have a viable way forward in 2028.”

Ron DeSantis, who entered the 2024 presidential race with a bankroll rivaling that of coup-attempting former President Donald Trump, dropped his bid for the GOP nomination on Sunday — and endorsed Trump on his way out.
“Nobody worked harder and we left it all out on the field,” DeSantis said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, before going on to say, “If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome ― more campaign stops, more interviews ― I would do it.”
“But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
DeSantis then added that he was backing Trump over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the remaining major candidate in the race.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said, adding, “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
At a campaign stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, Haley acknowledged DeSantis’ announcement.
“I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” she said.

The announcement comes just days after DeSantis claimed he had gotten his “ticket punched” to continue his campaign despite finishing a distant second to Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Late polls in that state showed that DeSantis could finish third behind Haley. When DeSantis ultimately finished just two points ahead of her, he tried to spin it as a victory ― even though he had previously said he had to win Iowa to win the nomination.
DeSantis was polling even worse in New Hampshire and South Carolina than he had been in Iowa, and his campaign seemed uncertain of a strategy going forward. His first stop after Iowa was a campaign visit to South Carolina, a contest that is a full month after New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday. He was to return to New Hampshire on Friday, but then was planning to head back to South Carolina on Saturday.
Republicans who feared Trump could not win a general election, particularly wealthy party donors, had initially lined up behind DeSantis after his nearly 20-point reelection as governor in November 2022. That star power allowed him to continue collecting donations of unlimited size in a state account and eventually transfer more than $80 million into a federal super PAC created to support him.
But DeSantis’ high point in the campaign turned out to be just after that reelection victory, when some polls showed him actually ahead of Trump for the 2024 nomination.
However, that began to change quickly. Trump entered the race just weeks after those midterm elections and soon began attacking DeSantis in speeches, online and even in television ads.
DeSantis chose not to enter the race himself until the end of Florida’s legislative session in May, by which point he was polling only in the 20s both nationally and in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The poor polling resulted in weaker fundraising, which resulted in two rounds of staff layoffs and shakeups ― even though much of the logistical work of the campaign was effectively outsourced to the relatively flush Never Back Down super PAC.
An even bigger problem for DeSantis, though, may have been something even the best fundraising could do nothing about: his personality. Longtime Florida Republicans told HuffPost a year ago that DeSantis has never seemed to enjoy interacting with people.
That trait, as it turns out, became a major liability in a primary race that still places a high value on personal interactions with primary voters in the early voting states.
“His problem is that the more people see him, the less they like him,” said one influential New Hampshire Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity.

2818,W2JTC50MJB_GMEXJVBKRN3LBAQ,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ends presidential campaign, endorses Trump","Zac Anderson, Sarasota Herald-Tribune","Updated January 22, 2024 at 9:57 AM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-gov-ron-desantis-ends-201330385.html,"After a meteoric rise that made him one of the most prominent Republicans in the country and led many to believe he was the GOP leader best positioned to move the Republican party past former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday ended a presidential campaign that had been on a downward slide for months.
DeSantis immediately backed former President Donald Trump's campaign despite months of criticizing his performance in office, saying ""he has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear.""
DeSantis entered the race last May with sky high expectations after a dominating reelection victory in Florida vaulted him to the top of the list of presidential prospects. Polls in early 2023 showed him competitive with Trump.
Yet his campaign never came close to delivering on that early hype, and end up losing badly in Iowa last week. Polls showed DeSantis trailing by large margins in other early states, and he dropped out before what was likely to be a big loss in New Hampshire Tuesday.
""Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,"" DeSantis said in a video posted on X Sunday. ""Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome ‒ more campaign stops, more interviews ‒ I would do it but I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""
DeSantis added that he believes most GOP primary votes want ""to give Donald Trump another chance.""
Trump's campaign said in a statement Sunday that ""we are honored by the endorsement of Governor Ron DeSantis"" and ""it is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat"" President Joe Biden. The comments mark an abrupt change in tone after more than a year of Trump mercilessly mocking DeSantis.
Once dubbed ""DeFuture"" of the GOP, DeSantis is now facing an uncertain political future after a bruising campaign marred by dysfunction and marked by GOP voters overwhelmingly rejecting him in favor of the former president.
DeSantis pledged to continue showing ""the country how to lead"" through his work ""down here in Florida."" He will be governor for nearly three more years and hinted that he may still harbor national political ambitions, quoting a line he attributed to Winston Churchill ‒ but that the International Churchill Society says the former United Kingdom prime minister never spoke ‒ that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal ‒ it is the courage to continue that counts.""
Yet the ineptitude his presidential campaign displayed from the beginning left many political observers marveling at how badly things went wrong.
DeSantis ran a hard right campaign that courted Trump's MAGA base, arguing he could deliver conservative policy victories that Trump failed to achieve and without the chaos and drama.
The pitch boiled down to Trump without the baggage, or ""Trump Lite.""
It didn't work.
Polls show most Republicans like DeSantis, but they like Trump more and the governor didn't offer them a good enough reason to move on from the former president.
DeSantis also found himself fighting against the powerful effect produced by Trump's four indictments, which led many Republicans to view him as a victim and rally around him. DeSantis' poll numbers began to sharply decline in April when the Manhattan district attorney issued the first indictment.
Trump's emotional hold on the GOP base always was going to be tough for DeSantis to break, but he made it more difficult by running a campaign plagued by frequent missteps.
There were problems right from the start. Technical glitches turned DeSantis' campaign launch on social media site X into a disaster. It proved to be a sign of things to come.
By July, DeSantis was laying off staff after burning through cash too quickly, and in August he switched campaign managers.
A decision to outsource much of his campaign to a super PAC, Never Back Down, also proved problematic. The PAC imploded amid friction with campaign staffers; top PAC leaders were fired or left.
Team DeSantis' troubles mastering the mechanics of running a presidential campaign were matched by the candidate's own struggles. Widely viewed as stiff and somewhat awkward when he started out, DeSantis took months to warm up and become more comfortable in the spotlight.
DeSantis later said he regretted shunning the mainstream media in the early part of the campaign and not making himself more available. That decision limited his reach early on, and may have stunted his growth as a candidate.
The question of how best to take on Trump also proved problematic for DeSantis, who for months before launching his campaign allowed the former president to routinely mock him and define him in the public eye without responding. Even after getting in the race, DeSantis was careful about how he attacked Trump, leading some supporters to express frustration that he was going easy on him.
Trump, meanwhile, savaged DeSantis in highly personal terms, branding him ""DeSanctimonious.""
Trump's aggressive criticism of DeSantis before he even announced his campaign is a sign that he once viewed him as a major threat.
Indeed, by the end of 2022 DeSantis had emerged as the most prominent Republican in the country other than Trump.
A little-known former congressman who eked out a narrow win in his first race for governor in 2018, DeSantis' rise to rock star status nationally in the GOP began during the COVID-19 pandemic when he fought to keep schools and businesses open.
The governor's strident stance against many COVID restrictions, including mask and vaccine mandates, thrilled conservatives and vaulted him into the national spotlight.
Subsequent culture war battles centered around race and LGBTQ issues only increased DeSantis' national standing within the GOP.
His record in Florida became the touchstone for DeSantis' presidential campaign. Battling with Disney, removing left-wing prosecutors and flying migrants to Martha's Vineyard became part of his presidential pitch as he sought to ""Make America Florida.""
Yet while Republican voters in interviews often said they liked DeSantis' record in Florida, it wasn't enough to sway them from Trump. That become clear in Iowa last week.
DeSantis launched his presidential bid with ambitions to run a national campaign, but recalibrated after a series of setbacks and instead focused heavily on Iowa, traveling the state relentlessly across all 99 counties and scoring key endorsements.
Fueled by $82.5 million DeSantis raised for his re-election bid and transferred over from a state committee, the Never Back Down super PAC flooded Iowa with door knockers as part of the most robust ground game mounted by any candidate. DeSantis also spent much of the $35 million he raised in his campaign account in Iowa.
DeSantis predicted he would win Iowa but ended up losing to Trump by 30 points. He initially said the second place finish meant his campaign “got our ticket punched out of Iowa,” and vowed to continue in the race, but many viewed the results as a resounding rejection.
Fundraising would have been be difficult going forward, and he faced the likelihood of trying to compete with significantly fewer resources.
At just 45, and with a broad network of supporters from his time as governor and running for president, DeSantis may still have a future in national politics.
A Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll from earlier this month show that 58% of GOP voters in that state view him favorably.
But that's a decrease from his 66% favorability rating from just a month ago.
The campaign took a toll on DeSantis' popularity, including in Florida where just 50% of voters in November – down from 54% four months earlier – said they approve of the job he is doing as governor, according to a Florida Atlantic University Survey.
With his eyes on winning a GOP presidential primary, DeSantis pushed through a series of highly controversial bills, such as a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The FAU poll shows that nearly 60% of independents now disapprove of his job performance.
A prolonged battle with Trump was likely to erode DeSantis' standing with the GOP base and his hopes of running for another office. Exiting now and endorsing Trump could help preserve some of that political capital, even if it marks a jarring turnabout after months of fighting between the GOP heavyweights.
DeSantis took a shot at Trump's remaining primary challenger, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, in his remarks Sunday, saying she represents ""a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism.""
""The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology, are over,"" DeSantis said in remarks that may indicate he still hopes to inherit the MAGA wing of the party from Trump someday.
Haley, meanwhile, said that DeSantis ""ran a good race... he's been a good governor and he added a lot to the campaign.""
Democratic National Committee Press Secretary Sarafina Chitika said in a statement that DeSantis ""pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA agenda that both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are still running on, and now he is the latest member of the GOP to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.""
DeSantis endorsed Trump a week after declaring in Iowa during one of his final rallies that “you can be the most worthless Republican in America but if you kiss the ring, he’ll say you’re wonderful.”
Even as DeSantis backed Trump Sunday, it was clear that the acrimony between the two campaigns has been intense, and often personal.
Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles, who once worked for DeSantis before being pushed out of his orbit, responded Sunday to a post on X foreshadowing his departure from the race with two words: ""Bye, bye.""

NASHUA, New Hampshire (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Dean Phillips, attempting a longshot bid for the Democratic nomination, assailed Joe Biden as ""unelectable and weak"" on Saturday as he tried to take advantage of the president's absence from New Hampshire's primary.
Biden did not register for the New Hampshire after national Democrats opted to move their first primary to South Carolina, which offers a more diverse population.
But Biden's supporters are mounting a write-in campaign in New Hampshire to ensure a win in the state on Tuesday, and a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released on Sunday showed Biden drawing 63% of the primary vote in that state, with Phillips at 10%.
The Democratic National Committee has ruled that the New Hampshire election effectively won’t count and the winner won't amass New Hampshire's 23 delegates in the march to the party's nomination.
Phillips, a wealthy Democrat from Minnesota, said during a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire, that he hoped to do well in Tuesday's voting.
Phillips said a strong showing by him would be getting upwards of 20% or more of the vote - ""going from zero to somewhere in the 20s would be pretty awesome, I think.""
""Sadly it's going to demonstrate that our incumbent president is unelectable and weak and I think it's going to show this country that there's a candidate here who can actually do here what has been promised for generations,"" Phillips told reporters after addressing dozens of people at a senior citizen activity center.
He also noted Biden's age, 81.
""If you listen to the voters, people feel he's at a stage of life that makes it incompatible to leading the free world. And the same is true of Donald Trump,"" said Phillips, 55.
Trump, 77, is the leading Republican candidate. The former president was defeated by Biden in his bid for a second term in 2020.
The White House has repeatedly dismissed concerns about Biden's age, though polls show voters are concerned about it.
""Our perspective is that it's not about age, it's about the president's experience,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Biden's 81st birthday. ""We have to judge him by what he's done, not by his numbers.""
The Biden re-election campaign did not respond to a request for comment and has avoided commenting directly on Phillips's challenge. When the congressman launched his challenge in October, it issued a statement saying Biden's ""campaign is hard at work mobilizing the winning coalition that President Biden can uniquely bring together to once again beat the MAGA Republicans next November.""
Minnesota's Democratic Governor, Tim Walz, in a fundraising email at the time said: ""You know, I have to say this about Minnesota: it’s a great state, full of great people. And sometimes they do crazy things.""
The New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23 offers the first at-the-polls gauge of Biden’s political strength this election cycle, and the unprecedented situation will be closely watched amid polls showing him tied with Trump.
A poor showing by Biden against Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson would likely fuel concerns that Biden is weak heading into the general election.
Both Phillips and Williamson appeared to have little chance of defeating Biden.
Backers of the write-in campaign are staging events throughout the weekend to educate voters on how to write in Biden's name and generate support for him.
Williamson told several dozen people at an event in Manchester that she also felt Biden was weak and questioned the wisdom of nominating him for a second term just because he beat Trump in 2020.
""To say he beat Trump once and therefore he'll beat him again - for me it's like saying to an actor who's nominated for an Oscar twice. 'He won last time so it's only reasonable to think he'll win this time. Well, it's a different movie,"" she said.

2828,WRUDB6FZPK_CRO08TJXA7VYCXV,Opinion: Here’s why voters in New Hampshire will be writing in Biden’s name on the ballot,Opinion by Maggie Hassan,"January 22, 2024 at 8:44 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-why-hampshire-really-first-144800881.html,"Editor’s Note: US Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, is in her second term representing New Hampshire. She served as governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
As we approach New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary on Tuesday, America’s democracy is more challenged than at any point during my lifetime. The threat of a second term for Donald Trump means that our country’s fundamental values and electoral system itself are on the ballot in 2024.
Despite the attempt to change the primary calendar, Granite Staters on Tuesday will write in President Joe Biden precisely because of our passion for citizen-led democracy and our commitment to protecting the future of our country.
This year, President Biden’s name will not be on the primary ballot over a dispute with the Democratic National Committee, which voted to change the date of the New Hampshire primary. It decided to disqualify the state from receiving any delegates after determining that South Carolina should be the first primary — but that has not stopped Granite Staters from organizing a write-in campaign and continuing our engagement with the democratic process.
Since its inception, the New Hampshire presidential primary has helped strengthen our democracy and elect better presidents. The “all-hands-on-deck” spirit of our state means we participate in town meetings, volunteer for our community and elect a 424-member volunteer citizen legislature to serve a population of 1.4 million.
Our commitment to civic participation is in part why the people of New Hampshire helped create the modern primary — Granite Staters were among the first in the nation who decided that instead of selecting party delegates in the backrooms, all voters across the state should have a say. We helped wrestle nominating contests from the grips of party bosses, holding our first in the nation primary — where voters choose party delegates — for the first time in 1920. In 1952, voters started directly selecting their preferred presidential nominee.
The New Hampshire primary has always helped strengthen our democracy. In our polarized political moment — where social media, algorithms and some partisan politicians sow discord and drive more Americans to the extremes — it has become challenging for voters to sort truth from misinformation. In order to help bridge this divide, voters need the opportunity to engage with candidates face-to-face and in real time.
In other larger states, campaigns are won and lost by massive ad buys or flashy rallies where candidates may never come face to face with a question from a voter, but the small size of our state provides candidates the opportunity to do things differently. Our primary provides an ideal proving ground for candidates to have direct, person-to-person interactions with the people who they wish to serve.
In our state, candidates can travel in just an hour or two from our largest cities that grapple with challenges like homelessness to our rural communities where the lack of high-speed internet continues to hold back families and the economy.
Successful candidates in our primary have to be prepared to win one conversation at a time, talking to voters of all ages, backgrounds and — particularly in a state where independents are a plurality of voters — all political stripes. Because New Hampshire’s government requires an unusually high degree of citizen engagement, direct access to elected officials is routine for most Granite Staters and we are not easily swayed or impressed by slick advertising or large entourages.
In our state, candidates who expend shoe leather and spend time listening have a shot against those who start the contest well known or with big war chests, which is why it is critical that New Hampshire goes first. It is also important to note that New Hampshire is not the only early state; while our state continues to grow in its racial diversity, especially among young people, the group of early primary states has strong racial and geographic diversity.
New Hampshire’s person-to-person style of campaigning also forces candidates to answer direct questions from the voters. Just last month we were reminded how skilled Granite Staters are at holding candidates to account when Nikki Haley was pressed about what was the cause of the American Civil War and she refused to say that it was caused by slavery. She later backpedaled her comments and said “of course the Civil War was about slavery.” These direct questions that get to the heart of a candidate’s character are just one of the ways that our primary helps produce stronger nominees.
In this time of polarization, having a primary that places a premium on direct conversations between candidates and citizens is invaluable; it is not only how citizens can hold candidates to account, but it gives us a chance to see how democracy works at its best. It bridges divisions and helps us see the priorities and heartaches that we have in common. New Hampshire’s commitment to empowering citizens — and in treating those who would lead us as “citizens in chief” — has made our first in the nation primary indispensable and our democracy stronger.
Granite Staters’ commitment to democracy is why we will continue to hold our primary and why we organized a write-in campaign to support President Biden.
The dangers of another Trump presidency are clear. As just one example, at a rally last November in Claremont, Trump echoed fascist dictators by calling his political opponents “vermin,” and he has continued to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
President Biden, on the other hand, is committed to protecting our democracy and to working on behalf of the American people — regardless of political party — to deliver results. At a time when many believed that bipartisanship was impossible, President Biden has demonstrated that our democracy can work, passing bipartisan legislation to lower costs, invest in manufacturing here at home and rebuild our infrastructure.
There are those who suggest that — given the DNC’s wrongheaded decision to forego New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary — Granite Staters should stay home, or refuse to vote for President Biden. We’re not going to do that. I know that New Hampshire Democrats and many independents will join me in writing in President Biden’s name on Tuesday because we understand the importance of this election for our country. We have long known that staying on the sidelines is not an option and we will put our country first.

2834,X7MS6XIBT4_5GH2D5IA5BBTA8I,Why America’s controls on sales of AI tech to China are so leaky,The Economist,"January 21, 2024 at 10:53 PM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-america-controls-sales-ai-135332424.html,"GINA RAIMONDO seemed frustrated when she took the stage at the Reagan National Defence Forum in California in December. The Department of Commerce, which she leads, had just tightened restrictions on the sale of American semiconductors to China. But Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, had immediately started developing a new, slightly less powerful artificial-intelligence (AI) chip for the Chinese market, to which the restrictions would not apply. “If you redesign a chip…that enables [China] to do AI, I’m going to control it the very next day,” Ms Raimondo warned.
That was bombastic, given that it had taken her department a full year to rework the restrictions to cut off Nvidia’s previous workaround. But America’s five-year campaign against Chinese technology is intensifying. Earlier this month it was reported that Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, and two fellow chip bosses had been summoned to testify in Congress about their Chinese business. On January 19th ABB, a Swiss industrial group, revealed that American lawmakers were investigating its links with China. ABB said it was co-operating with the investigation; Nvidia has said that it is working closely with the government to ensure compliance with the export controls.
Neither Democrats nor Republicans are likely to relent. In a presidential-election year Joe Biden, the unpopular Democratic president, cannot afford to look weak on China. His Republican predecessor and main rival, Donald Trump, has long been America’s China-basher-in-chief. China hawks in Washington want to stymie Chinese efforts both to get around the rules and to recreate the necessary technological capabilities at home. However, the mixed record of export controls so far shows why harsher measures will be difficult to design—and not necessarily more successful.
China has found some ways to work around the existing controls. To Ms Raimondo’s chagrin, for instance, it is possible to train AI models using chips that are not necessarily at the cutting edge, so long as you have enough of them. If the sale of any chip which can “do AI” is to be banned, as she implies, America must restrict the flow of a much broader array of chips to China.
It is hard to know just how much broader. Trade statistics do not break out the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run AI models from the larger flow of integrated circuits. But a sense of the scale of such a ban can be gleaned by examining the financial statements of Nvidia, which sells a range of GPUs. It has earned between 21% and 26% of its revenues from China over the past few years. In the nine months to October the company took in $8.4bn from the Chinese market. Almost all of Nvidia’s products can be used to “do AI”. Mr Huang has said that his firm has no “contingency” for being cut off from China.
Another difficulty for America stems from enforcement. The Department of Commerce is empowered to punish any transgressions it discovers. Last year it fined Seagate, a hard-drive manufacturer, $300m for allegedly breaching export controls by sending components to Huawei, a blacklisted Chinese tech champion. But it is the chip firms themselves that are largely responsible for enforcement. That includes ensuring that their customers are not, in fact, a buying front for Chinese entities with which trade is prohibited. This is hard. “You have coin-sized devices and technologies that are widely commercially available, and indistinguishable from the controlled technologies, distributed around the planet,” says Kevin Wolf, an American lawyer and former official.
The result is a situation ripe for smuggling, which experts say is impossible to quantify but doubtless rife. It also encourages transshipment. Firms in countries that have not signed on to the American export-control regime, like Singapore, can buy chips and send them on to Chinese entities without the knowledge of the American firms or the Department of Commerce. Nvidia’s most recent quarterly earnings for 2023 show that its sales to Singapore grew by a factor of five over the same period in 2022, faster than anywhere else.
Of all customers in China, the one best placed to use such workarounds to get the chips it needs is the People’s Liberation Army. If one of America’s main aims is to deny China access to advanced technology for developing military AI, it is probably failing. Instead the controls are raising the costs to Chinese buyers of acquiring American AI chips. That in turn is aligning China’s tech sector with its government’s policy of indigenous technological development. Chinese tech giants used to prefer buying higher-quality American technology to investing in research and development. Their incentives have changed.
The clearest evidence that this is happening comes from Huawei. The company, whose core business is making telecoms gear, was first targeted by America in 2019 for allegedly breaching sanctions on Iran. A measure called the “foreign direct product rule” (FDPR) cut Huawei off from any chips that had been produced using American technology (which is to say virtually all sophisticated ones). In 2022 the FDPR was deployed against the entire Chinese AI industry, and broadened in October to encompass a wider range of AI chips and chipmaking tools, and to require licences to ship products to countries such as the United Arab Emirates (albeit not Singapore) that are thought to serve as middlemen for Chinese buyers.
Before it was blacklisted, Huawei had its microprocessors manufactured by TSMC, a Taiwanese contract chipmaker. It spent $5.4bn on TSMC-made chips in 2020, before America’s export controls extended to the Taiwanese firm. Now it is doing more business with SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker. SMIC’s capabilities were thought to be many years behind those of TSMC. But last year it came to light that the company was making a Huawei-designed AI chip, the Ascend (and a smartphone chip, the Kirin, which raised many Western eyebrows after Huawei unexpectedly launched a handset containing it in September).
With their access to foreign chips curtailed, Chinese AI companies are now turning to Huawei and SMIC for chips. China’s government is encouraging them, and continuing to shower the industry with subsidies in the hope of creating an industry to rival Nvidia and other American companies. Export controls have, in effect, forced China to embrace import substitution.
The designers of America’s controls foresaw some of this. That is why, from the start, they also targeted China’s ability to recreate advanced technology at home. The controls restrict trade not just in chips themselves but also in tools used to make them. That has involved bringing on board allies such as the Netherlands and Japan, home to many of the toolmakers. As with chips, the tool controls place limits on the sophistication of the equipment that can be sold to Chinese buyers. And as with chips, just how sophisticated a tool has to be to fall under the controls has been the subject of intense debate.
The critical machines are those used to etch transistors onto silicon wafers. The most cutting-edge equipment of this sort is made and sold exclusively by ASML, a Dutch company, and has been blocked from China for years. But older generations of such lithography tools can still be sold there. ASML’s sales to China have grown dramatically over the past year, as have those of companies that produce other chipmaking tools. In the most recent quarter Chinese sales made up almost half of ASML’s total revenue. Other toolmakers also sell lots of their wares to China (see chart).
But, as with chips, export controls are giving Chinese toolmakers a strong incentive to invest in catching up technologically with foreign rivals. Already domestic toolmakers’ sales are growing. On January 15th one of them, NAURA, which manufactures other etching tools, said it expected its revenue to have risen by almost 50% in 2023.
America’s campaign against Chinese technology may, then, be both ineffective and counterproductive. Ineffective, because China is adept at exploiting loopholes. And counterproductive, because it is leading to the creation of a more sophisticated Chinese industry. It may also be predicated on a wrong assumption: that the future economic and military balance of power depends on AI, and that AI depends on computing power. “Both of these are guesses,” points out Chris Miller, a historian of technology at Tufts University in Boston. It is far from clear that AI will have strategic importance. And even if it does, computing power may not be the overriding factor in its development. As Mr Miller points out, oomph is expensive, so AI developers will try to use it as sparingly as possible.
Despite all this, America seems likely to toughen up its export controls on ai chips, as Ms Raimondo all but promised in December. And Republican lawmakers are eyeing more expansive controls still. Some of them see a new threat coming from the other end of the sophistication spectrum, which is less about China’s techno-military might and more about its economic power. Chips are required in growing volumes as components in everything from electric vehicles and heat pumps to electricity grids. By 2027 China could be making almost 40% of such semiconductors, reckons TrendForce, a research firm. The current export controls do nothing to curb China’s dominance of this business, which uses a lot of older American technology.
Three congressional Republicans, Mike Gallagher, Elise Stefanik and Michael McCaul, are thus working on a bill which will force the commerce department to cut China off from all American chip technology, not just the most advanced stuff. Gaining support from allies for such an extreme policy will be hard. Japanese and Dutch businesses—and their governments—rankle even at the porous controls that are in place today. But if Mr Trump, an alliance sceptic, returns to power, the lack of support is unlikely to matter one bit.

2839,XO9DH1GGPK_C6MC44TQWGR6KP0,Biden abortion ad marks campaign shift to emphasize reproductive rights,Edward Helmore,"January 22, 2024 at 2:08 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-abortion-ad-marks-campaign-170823681.html,"The Biden re-election campaign rolled out a new campaign ad on Sunday, signaling a shift in emphasis to reproductive rights that the White House hopes will carry and define Democrats through the 2024 election cycle.
The campaign ad, titled Forced, is designed to tie Donald Trump directly to the abortion issue almost 18 months after his nominees to the supreme court helped to overturn a constitutional right to abortion enshrined in Roe v Wade, which would have turned 51 this week.
Dr Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother of three tells the camera her story about traveling out of her state to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition, calling her situation “every woman’s worst nightmare”.
In Texas, she said, her choice “was completely taken away and that’s because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v Wade”.
The launch of the ad comes as anti-abortion activists descended on Washington DC this weekend. One event, the National Pro-Life Summit, activists came to celebrate anti-abortion activism in the US. At another, the March for Life, marchers called for advocacy against abortion rights.
Vice-President Kamala Harris is now being placed to the forefront of the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights, a position Biden has said he is not “big on” because of his Catholic faith, though he believes the landmark 1973 decision “got it right”.
On Monday, Harris will embark on a nationwide tour to focus attention on the administration’s efforts to protect the right of women to choose. Her tour will start in Wisconsin, where abortion rights propelled a Democratic victory in a key state supreme court election.
Related: Democrats condemn ‘cruel’ abortion bans ahead of 51st anniversary of Roe
A statement from Harris’s office said the vice-president will “highlight the harm caused by extreme abortion bans and share stories of those who have been impacted in Wisconsin and across the country”.
“She will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care,” the statement added.
Democrats this year are hoping to emphasize that a second Trump presidency would establish new personal health restrictions.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager, said in a statement to The Hill.
On Sunday, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, told CBS Face the Nation that “it would be good” if Biden talked about abortion more than he does. “I know that one tenet of his belief system is that women and only women with their families and healthcare professionals are the one who know what decision is right for them.”
Asked if the president needs to take up that message more forcefully, Whitmer said: “I don’t think it would hurt. I think people want to know that this is president that is fighting … but maybe to use more blunt language would be helpful.”"
2846,XTZXWU5NNM_YCZZY3LJYMCKPRU,‘Very dangerous’: Zelensky on Trump’s claim he could end Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours,"Andrew Carey and Victoria Butenko, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 11:12 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/very-dangerous-zelensky-trump-claim-021252650.html,"For the first time, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed publicly unequivocal concern over Donald Trump’s suggestion he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day if he returns to the White House.
Speaking to Britain’s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner’s boast as “very dangerous” – on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.
Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump’s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a “political message.”
But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, “makes me really quite stressed.”
Trump’s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”
Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, “They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.”
Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.
At Davos earlier this week, responding to a similar question from a journalist, the Ukrainian leader answered rhetorically, wondering how Trump would respond if Putin rolled through Ukraine - in a scenario where Trump removed all US support - and began threatening NATO members with invasion.
It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.
By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.
Ukraine’s ability to negotiate toward that result has been significantly weakened, at least in the short term, by the failure of the summer counteroffensive.
Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: “Nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.”
Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.
Turning to address the camera, he said, “Please, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.”
“Maybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,” Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer.

A study published by the journal, Science, on Thursday found that patients experiencing long COVID symptoms had proteins that indicated part of their immune systems remained active after an infection.
According to experts, this discovery could lead to diagnostic tests and treatment for long COVID, which has left people with persistent fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, stomach issues, and a broad range of other symptoms.
The study focused on 113 COVID patients and 39 healthy controls. After six months, 40 patients had developed characteristics of long COVID.
Blood samples for those patients contained a group of proteins which showed the body’s complement system, a part of the immune system, continued to be on high alert long after the COVID virus.
As the complement system remains active without COVID to fight, it “starts damaging healthy cells,” according to Dr. Onur Boyman, a professor of immunology at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and one of the study’s authors.
Blood samples from long COVID patients revealed a common group of proteins which indicated a heightened immune system response.
According to experts, any resulting tissue damage and microclots in the blood could reduce the level of oxygen and nutrients delivered to different organs, leading to long COVID symptoms.
“If your brain, for example, isn’t getting enough oxygen, obviously there will be a lot of issues with memory, brain fog and fatigue,” Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology, and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News.
Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, chair of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and head of its long COVID clinic, told NBC News that the study was a huge advance in the study of the virus.
“Understanding the mechanisms of long COVID is how we’re going to figure out treatments,” she said.
Around 14% of adults report experiencing long COVID, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey.

She has previously avoided lashing out at the former president, but Mr Trump's attacks have become more personal as his commanding lead in the polls has grown.
Mr Trump is leading with 50% of likely Republican voters in the state, with Nikki Haley trailing far behind.
On Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race altogether.
With his campaign faltering, Mr DeSantis admitted he had no path to victory - setting up a two-horse race in New Hampshire. And he endorsed Mr Trump.
In last week's Iowa caucus, Mr Trump dominated Ms Haley and Ron DeSantis.
But even with that decisive win and a clear lead in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Mr Trump has gone on the attack against Ms Haley.
His criticisms appear to have convinced her to turn up the heat on the former president.
Mr Trump went after his former UN ambassador at a campaign rally over the weekend, but he seemed to confuse her for another political foe - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - when speaking about the Capitol riot.
On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Ms Haley seized on the slip up and struck back at the former president, saying that his ""mental stability will probably continue to decline"".
""No matter what it is, chaos follows,"" she added. ""In some cases he [Mr Trump] causes it. In some cases he doesn't... he's like a magnet to it. What happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired.""
The former UN ambassador also blasted her onetime boss as soft on undemocratic leaders, alleging he did not hold Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and China's Xi Jinping accountable.
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Ms Haley said on CBS. ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
Characterising Mr Trump as a mayhem and temper-fueled candidate appears to be a new counter deployed by Ms Haley. It comes after he has ramped up personal insults on her in recent days.
On Friday, for example, Mr Trump took to social media to refer to Ms Haley as ""Nimbra"", a misspelling of her birth name Nimarata, and to baselessly suggest she was ineligible to serve as president or vice president in the US.
The jab against the US-born Ms Haley - whose parents emigrated to the US from India in the 1960s - was reminiscent of the false birther attacks Mr Trump deployed against former President Barack Obama.
Ms Haley responded to the baseless claim by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Mr Trump is ""clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums"".
Her decision to fight back against Mr Trump - something she has been loath to do on the campaign trail - may have come too late in this primary, however.
While Ms Haley appeared to have some momentum a few weeks ago, polls released before Mr DeSantis quit showed Mr Trump dominating ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Trump led with 55% support among likely Republican voters, compared to 36% for Ms Haley and just 6% for Mr DeSantis.
Haley's uphill battle to catch Trump in New Hampshire
What to watch for in the New Hampshire primary
A separate poll, from CNN, had Mr Trump with 50% support, compared to 39% for Ms Haley and 6% for Mr DeSantis.
The former president's lead has prompted Haley campaign officials and political allies to temper and downplay expectations for New Hampshire after previously expressing optimism.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who has campaigned for Ms Haley, told NBC News that she ""doesn't have to win"" in his home state. He claimed that any momentum from this week's race offers an ""amazing opportunity to turn this around"".
Additionally, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney repeatedly declined to offer a prediction during an on-the-record briefing with Bloomberg News, telling reporters only that Ms Haley needs ""incremental progress"".
""I know everyone wants us to put a number on it,"" she said. ""We have never done that. We never will.""
Mr Trump's campaign has also received a boost from the endorsements of two former opponents for the Republican nomination, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.
Ms Haley also received an endorsement from a former rival, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who never earned much support and ended his bid for the Republican nomination last week.
""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years,"" he said in a post on X. ""Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.""
Still, Ms Ankney said that ""beating Donald Trump is not easy"" and appeared to push for a longer view of the campaign.
""He is a juggernaut,"" she said of Trump. ""But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress until we are the last man, or woman, standing against him."""
2892,ZAD7QI9IYC_NFRM8ZJJ3DSVJ43,"'Access Hollywood' tape of Trump won't be shown to jury at defamation trial, lawyer says",LARRY NEMEISTER,"January 21, 2024 at 1:02 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/access-hollywood-tape-trump-wont-040248884.html,"A lawyer for a writer who says Donald Trump sexually abused her in the 1990s and then defamed her while president in 2019 said Saturday that the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape and two women who accused Trump of abuse will not be put before a New York jury considering defamation damages.
The revelation by attorney Roberta Kaplan, who represents advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, means that the Republican front-runner in this year's presidential race could testify in Manhattan federal court as early as Monday, a day before the New Hampshire primary.
The jury is considering whether Trump owes more to Carroll than the $5 million awarded to her last spring by another jury that concluded Trump sexually abused but did not rape Carroll in the dressing room of a luxury Manhattan department store in spring 1996 and then defamed her in October 2022.
Trump attended the trial for two of its first three days, only skipping it on Thursday, when he attended the funeral of his mother-in-law in Florida.
Kaplan said late Saturday in a letter to the judge that she would not show jurors the 2005 tape in which Trump is caught on a hot mic speaking disparagingly of women to keep the issues in the trial “focused.”
For the same reason, she said she won’t call two other Trump accusers as witnesses: Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds.
Both women testified at the trial that ended last May. Leeds, a former stockbroker, said Trump abruptly groped her against her will on an airline flight in the 1970s, while Stoynoff, a writer, said Trump forcibly kissed her against her will while she was interviewing him for a 2005 article.
Kaplan noted that Trump's lawyers had said he is entitled to testify concerning the “Access Hollywood” tape and the allegations of Stoynoff and Leeds, though he would not be if they were not introduced into the case by Carroll's attorneys.
The judge in the case has instructed the jury that it must accept the findings of the jury last year and thus the evidence has focused almost exclusively on what harm has been caused to Carroll by Trump's continuous claims that he never attacked her and doesn't know her and that she is lying.
Trump, 77, has denied her claims in the last week during campaign stops, on social media and at a news conference. And he continues to assert that Carroll, 80, made false claims against him to sell the 2019 memoir in which she first revealed the allegations publicly and for political reasons.
The judge has severely limited what Trump can testify about if he takes the witness stand, and Carrol's lawyers likely decided to limit the introduction of more evidence to prevent Trump from straying into subjects such as what he maintains are many false claims against him.
However, Kaplan said she does plan to show the jury statements Trump has made since her client finished testifying in the case on Thursday.
Kaplan said Trump said he plans to repeat his claims that he never attacked Carroll and doesn't know her “a thousand times.”
“Such statements,” she wrote, “are of course relevant to the issue of punitive damages, as they illustrate that Defendant has no intention of ceasing his defamation campaign against Ms. Carroll, even in the face of judicial proceedings in which his liability for defaming her is settled.”
A lawyer for Trump did not return a request for comment on Kaplan's letter Saturday night."
2902,ZQ0VM8GC6Z_Z0SFUK24KVCQ68I,Nikki Haley questions Trump's mental fitness after he appears to confuse her for Nancy Pelosi,MEG KINNARD,"January 21, 2024 at 10:41 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-questions-trumps-mental-014155386.html,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley on Saturday questioned whether Donald Trump is mentally capable of serving as president again after he repeatedly seemed to confuse her with former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a campaign speech.
As she campaigned in Keene, New Hampshire, Haley referenced Trump's speech the night before, in which he mistakenly asserted that Haley was in charge of Capitol security on January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building seeking to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Trump first said that Haley turned down security offered by his administration on Jan. 6 and then again mentioned Haley, adding, “They destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it.”
Trump, 77, has accused Pelosi of turning down security he says his administration offered, but a special House committee empaneled to probe the attack found no evidence to support that claim.
“They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi,"" Haley said on Saturday.
“He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario. The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory — but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this,” Haley said. ""We can’t.”
Speaking at a Bloomberg News forum on Saturday in Manchester, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney referenced Haley's remarks and said Trump “made a pretty apparent gaffe last night.""
“It’s a distinction without a difference. It’s Nikki and Nancy,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said to reporters Saturday night. “What’s the difference?”
At his rally Saturday night in Manchester, Trump said that he took a cognitive test and “aced it.”
“I’ll let you know when I go bad. I really think I’ll be able to tell you,"" he added. “I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago. Is that possible?”
Trump, who won Monday's Iowa caucuses and is the current GOP front-runner, picked Haley to serve as his United Nations ambassador and has ramped up his criticism of her campaign as the year's votes have gotten underway.
On Saturday, he stumped in New Hampshire with a robust complement of backers from Haley's home state of South Carolina, including Gov. Henry McMaster and several U.S. House members. A day earlier, Sen. Tim Scott — who ended his own 2024 bid in November and was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012 — endorsed Trump over Haley in a rousing call-and-response speech of his own in New Hampshire.
Since entering the GOP race nearly a year ago, Haley, 52, has advocated for “mental competency tests” for older politicians, a swipe at the ages of both Trump and Biden.

2905,ZTRU3858Z8_5P5GSPPXGOTCQLP,Trump supporter calls indictments a smoke screen,Valentina LaFranca,"January 22, 2024 at 12:44 AM·1 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-supporter-calls-indictments-smoke-154408945.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (NEXSTAR) – Donald Trump maintains a double-digit lead in New Hampshire polls ahead of Tuesday’s first in the nation primary.
Some voters who don’t back Donald Trump raise questions about his suitability for president considering criminal cases he’s facing.
Trump has been sued in New York and indicted Georgia, Florida, Manhattan, and Washington, while Federal and State prosecutors have also opened several investigations in other locations.
At the Team Trump New Hampshire Headquarters, after a campaign event featuring House Representative, Elise Stefanik, Trump’s ardent supporters said the charges against him lack merit.
“I’m not a believer that most of these cases are legitimate, I think they’re political minded.” said Susan Ingrahm-Kelly, a mother in Bedford, who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.
A resident of New Hampshire, Sully Sullivan, had the same idea, “I think a lot of it is unfortunately, and dangerously, political.”
“All that legal stuff, I think, is a smoke screen,” said Penny Hayes, a retiree from Manchester. “I think it’s to keep us from paying attention to the real problems we’re having here.”
Stefanik addressed Trump supporters and said it’s up to the American people to save this country by electing President Donald Trump this November.
“When you look at the facts, you look at the evidence, when you look at the state of America in the world during his tenure; Versus where we stand now, where our economy is, immigration issues, I mean go down the list. I think objectively looking at it, the world was better for Americans under President Trump.” Sullivan said.

2916,DVAJAITV51_ALY44GTPS1OUOUU,Ron DeSantis ends struggling presidential bid and endorses Donald Trump,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064660.ron-desantis-ends-struggling-presidential-bid-endorses-donald-trump/,"Florida governor Ron DeSantis has suspended his Republican presidential campaign, ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump.
The decision leaves Mr Trump and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.
This is the scenario Mr Trump’s foes in the Republican Party have long sought, raising the stakes for this week’s contest as the party’s last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.
But as some Trump critics cheered, Mr DeSantis nodded towards Mr Trump’s primary dominance – and attacked Ms Haley – in an exit video he posted on social media.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” Mr DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone, through forced smiles.
He continued: “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honour that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Ms Haley spoke at a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as Mr DeSantis announced his decision.
“He ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” she told a room packed with supporters and media.
“Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.“
Mr DeSantis’s decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa, marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Mr Trump’s supremacy in the Republican Party.
He entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Mr Trump, and early primary polls suggested Mr DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that.
He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of 130 million dollars (£102 million), and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, such as abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024.
From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, Mr DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary.
He lost the Iowa caucuses – which he had vowed to win – by 30 percentage points to Mr Trump.
Mr DeSantis’s allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.
They ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Mr Trump, despite the deeply personal feud between them.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,” said Mr DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida’s governor, which ends in January 2027.
The endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for Mr DeSantis, whom Mr Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.
For Mr Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staff members, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy.
Mr Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.
Mr DeSantis’s team joined Mr Trump in attacking Ms Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape.
Some doubt Ms Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head match up with Mr Trump, would benefit from Mr DeSantis’s decision.
“She will not be the nominee,” key DeSantis supporter Representative Chip Roy (Republican-Texas) told The Associated Press.
“She will not be the president of the United States.”
Mr Trump had already shifted his focus to Ms Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after Mr DeSantis’s announcement, the former president’s campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Ms Haley to win New Hampshire.
“Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire – there are only two options,” wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.
“Option A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” they wrote.
“Option B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina,” which votes on February 24.
“Now, for some important advice,” they continued.
“Choose wisely.”
Mr Trump himself addressed Mr DeSantis’s departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.
“We just got some word that one of our opponents, very capable person, is dropping out of the race – Ron DeSantis. And Ron is dropping out and, in doing so, he endorsed us,” Mr Trump said to cheers, before a “Trump!” chant broke out in the room of volunteers.
Asked if he would be using the name “Ron DeSanctimonious”, Mr Trump said to loud cheers: “I said that name is officially retired.”"
2921,H55K1J9R5L_M31Z2QLD1FU7BIW,Sadiq Khan calls for youth mobility agreement with EU,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24063859.sadiq-khan-calls-youth-mobility-agreement-eu/,"Sadiq Khan has called for a youth mobility agreement with the European Union and said the UK should consider rejoining the customs union.
The London Mayor supports either a bespoke new scheme to allow young people to move freely to and from European countries or changes to post-Brexit visa rules.
He criticised the Tory Government’s “extreme hard Brexit” and even appeared to hit out at Labour’s “omerta”, or pact of silence, preventing the party from discussing potential economic reintegration with Brussels.
Mr Khan, who is seeking a third term in May’s mayoral election, said re-entering the customs union should be on the table when the Brexit deal with the EU comes up for review in 2024.
The capital has been particularly harmed by Brexit, he said in a statement first reported by the Observer.
“The Government’s hard Brexit has done damage right across London, and it is young people who have been hardest hit in so many ways.
“Not only is it more difficult for young people to move abroad for work but the Government’s wrongheaded decision to leave the Erasmus scheme has made it much harder for students to study abroad too.
“I’m clear that I’d be supportive of a youth mobility scheme, which would benefit us economically, culturally and socially.
“While the UK may no longer be part of the EU, London is and always will be a European city.”
The mayor wants young people to be able to study, travel and fill vacancies in key sectors of the economy such as hospitality, which has historically relied on EU workers and has faced staff shortages.
Earlier on Saturday, Mr Khan said “let’s have the conversation” about steps to align with the bloc.
He told the Fabian Society conference in London: “I’m not saying today we should rejoin the European Union. What I’m saying is that (shadow foreign secretary) David Lammy is on to something when he’s saying we should have a closer relationship with the European Union.”
He then suggested there is a code of silence meaning “you can’t talk about being close to the European Union, joining the single market, joining the customs union”.
He said “the economic cost of this extreme hard Brexit is huge”, pointing to a Cambridge Econometrics study which found that it has already cost the UK economy £140 billion and London £30 billion.
Mr Khan also said Rishi Sunak’s Government is using its Rwanda deportation plan “in the same way they used Brexit – as a deflection of all the problems they’ve caused to our country”.
He called for the Labour Party to “speak up” on the benefits of immigration and diversity.
Also at the think tank’s gathering, shadow Northern Ireland secretary Hilary Benn touted the benefits of a stronger alliance with the bloc amid growing geopolitical uncertainty.
He said the EU will breathe an “audible sigh of relief” if Labour wins the general election later this year.
“I think eventually there is going to be a moment when we look at each other across the Channel and say ‘you know what, we’re still big and important trading partners, we’re still friends and allies, we are co-operating on foreign policy and security and we need to do more of that … so wouldn’t it make sense to have a closer relationship?’”
He said this is important for the economy and for “building alliances in a dangerous world”.
The Labour frontbencher pointed to conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, tensions over Taiwan, the threat of climate change and the risk of a second Donald Trump presidency.
“We should come together with those who share our common values to defend those values in the face of these threats,” he concluded.
“The best way to protect your sovereignty is to work with others.”"
