49PCPAQBGT-0,Crown Prince Frederik: What do we know about the next king of Denmark?,By George Wright,31 December 2023,20240101,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67855112,"Danes were given a surprise on New Year's Eve as Queen Margrethe II announced her abdication.
The world's only reigning queen and the longest-serving living monarch in Europe will step down on 14 January, which will be 52 years to the day since she became queen.
""I will leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik,"" she announced live on TV.
But what do we know about Denmark's soon-to-be king?
Crown Prince Frederik was known in Denmark as somewhat of a party prince in the early 1990s, but perceptions started to change after he graduated from Aarhus University in 1995 with a masters in political science. He was the first Danish royal to complete a university education.
During his studies he spent time at Harvard in the United States, where he enrolled under the pseudonym Frederik Henriksen.
He later served in the Danish navy, where he was nicknamed ""Pingo"" - which according to the Mail was earned after his wetsuit filled up with water during a scuba diving course and he had to waddle like a penguin.
The 55-year-old has earned his name as a daredevil, taking part in a four-month ski expedition across Greenland in 2000. He has been hospitalised in sledging and scooter accidents.
""I don't want to lock myself in a fortress. I want to be myself, a human being,"" he once said, insisting he would stick to that even after taking the throne.
Crown Prince Frederik, like Britain's King Charles III, is known for his passion for the environment. He has vowed to ""guide the ship"" of Denmark into the future.
His Australian-born wife, Princess Mary, grew up on the island of Tasmania and was working as a lawyer when the pair met in 2000, at a bar in Sydney during the Olympic Games.
She once said in an interview that she did not know he was the prince of Denmark when they met, saying: ""Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?'""
They are considered by some to represent modern values and have tried to give their four children - a daughter, son and twins - as normal an upbringing as possible, sending them mainly to state schools.
Unlike British royal tradition, there will be no formal crowning ceremony for Crown Prince Frederik. Instead, his accession will be announced from Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen on the day.
He will become King of Denmark and head of state in the country - which is a constitutional monarchy - as well as in Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

Watch: Queen of Denmark announces abdication live on TV
Queen Margrethe II is the world's only reigning queen and the longest serving current monarch in Europe, taking the throne after the death of her father King Frederik IX in 1972.
The 83-year-old revealed the decision was made after a period of reflection following surgery on her back in early 2023.
""The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,"" she said.
""I have decided that now is the right time,"" she added, and offered her thanks to the Danish public for their support over the years.

2DKSK14XYA-1,Ukraine war: Zelensky promises more Ukraine-made weapons in new year speech,By Francesca Gillett,1 January,20240101,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67855158,"President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised a sharp increase in the amount of weapons Ukraine produces next year.
In his new year's message, Mr Zelensky repeated his pledge that at least a million drones would be built.
There was more fighting overnight into New Year's Day with five people killed in attacks in Odesa in Ukraine's south, and the Russian-held Donetsk region.
Earlier Vladimir Putin gave his new year address, praising his army but without explicitly mentioning the war.
The Russian president hailed his soldiers as ""heroes... at the forefront of the fight for truth"" and also referenced economic issues, a key topic for many Russians, and declared 2024 the ""year of the family"".
Speaking on Sunday, as the war against Russia approaches its third year, Mr Zelensky said: ""Next year, the enemy will feel the wrath of domestic production.""
He said Ukraine would produce ""a million"" extra drones in 2024 - something he said earlier this month - and that F-16 fighter jets would be delivered by Ukraine's Western partners.
""Our pilots are already mastering F-16 jets, and we will definitely see them in our skies,"" he said. ""So that our enemies can certainly see what our real wrath is.""
The new year's message came just hours before more attacks. In Donetsk, which is occupied by Russia, four people were reported killed and 13 wounded, according to Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of Donetsk, on Telegram.
He described the attack as ""massive shelling from multiple launch rocket systems"".
Separately in Odesa, in the south of Ukraine, one person was killed and three others were wounded in a Russian drone attack, local governor Oleg Kiper said.
Fighting has escalated in recent days, after Russia carried out strikes across Ukraine on Friday, killing 39 people in what Kyiv described as Russia's biggest missile bombardment of the war so far. Several cities were hit, including the capital, Kyiv.
This was followed by Ukrainian attacks on Russia on Saturday, with Moscow reporting deadly air strikes on the south-west of the country - with 24 people killed and more than 100 injured in Belgorod, near the border.
Mr Zelensky urged his Western allies to keep up support for Ukraine, as the country faces the prospect of a slowdown in aid from allies in Washington and Europe.
Ukraine has received its last package of military aid from the US - with any further aid packages being held up by a row in US Congress.
Mr Zelensky has admitted his country's spring offensive has not been the success he hoped, but in his message insisted that his country had become stronger in the face of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Mr Putin did not broach the war in Ukraine during his new year address, which was noticeably scaled back compared to last year's.
But he said: ""To everyone who is at a combat post, at the forefront of the fight for truth and justice: You are our heroes, our hearts are with you,"" he said. ""We are proud of you, we admire your courage.""

TSCGZ1O5Z4-2,Lee Jae-myung: South Korea opposition leader stabbed in neck on visit to Busan,By Kelly Ng,2 January,20240102,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67860330,"South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung has been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.
Mr Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election, sustained a 1cm laceration on the left side of his neck, reports said.
He was airlifted to hospital. Doctors say the wound is not life-threatening.
The 66-year-old man who attacked him said he had intended to kill Mr Lee, Yonhap news agency reported. The motive for the attack is unclear.
The brazen daytime attack shocked the nation and prompted condemnation from political parties and politicians, including current President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Mr Lee, who leads the Democratic Party of Korea, was addressing reporters at a news conference during a visit to a construction site in the port of Busan on Tuesday morning when the attacker reportedly approached him to ask for an autograph.
He then lunged forward to stab the politician with an 18cm (7in) knife which the attacker said he bought online, police said at a media briefing. The attacker was immediately overpowered and arrested.
Prosecutors plan to bring attempted murder charges against the man, Yonhap said.
Videos posted on social media show Mr Lee first collapsing into the crowd and then onto the ground, while several people try to restrain the attacker. Photographs after the incident show Mr Lee lying on the ground with his eyes closed as someone presses a handkerchief to the side of his neck.

A spokesman for Mr Lee's party said medical staff suspected an injury to his jugular vein, which carries blood from the head to the heart. Mr Lee would have to undergo surgery ""quickly"" as they were concerned about further bleeding, the spokesman, Kwon Chil-seung, said.
He added that they saw the attack as ""a clear act of democracy destruction"". while Mr Yoon's office quoted the president as saying South Korea ""should not tolerate such acts of violence under any circumstance"".
Mr Lee, 59, currently holds a seat in Incheon in South Korea's legislature.
He narrowly lost the 2022 presidential elections - by a mere 0.73% difference in votes - to Mr Yoon, making it the closest presidential race in South Korean history. He is widely expected to stand in the 2027 presidential elections.
Mr Lee, a former civil rights attorney who grew up in poverty and worked in factories as a child, said his working-class roots spurred him to want to fight inequality.
His impoverished upbringing stands in contrast with most other South Korean parliamentarians, who local media report have an average net worth of 2.3bn won ($1.8m; Â£1.4m) .
Since losing the vote in 2022, Mr Lee has been indicted on corruption and breach of trust charges, with prosecutors accusing him of allowing private developers to profit illegally from a property project while he was mayor of Seongnam, a city of a million people to the south of Seoul. Mr Lee has denied those charges, calling them politically motivated.
In September, a court dismissed a request from the prosecution for him to be held in custody while he awaited trial. Prosecutors are still investigating him on a number of other cases linked to corruption while he was in office.
The dismissal came three weeks after Mr Lee staged a 19-day hunger strike to protest at Mr Yoon's foreign and domestic policies, ending with Mr Lee requiring hospital treatment.
South Korea's crime rate is generally low, although the country saw a rise in mass stabbing attacks last year. The country has strict regulations around possession of guns and other weapons, and most public figures are not usually under tight security protection.
There have been a number of previous cases of South Korean politicians being physically attacked with weapons.
In March 2022, Mr Lee's predecessor as Democratic Party leader, Song Young-gil, was attacked with a blunt object while campaigning for Mr Lee. He sustained a laceration.
In 2006, conservative party leader Park Geun-hye, who later became president, was attacked with a knife which left a scar on her face.
In 1979, her father Park Chung-hee, who was president for 16 years, was shot and killed by his spy chief at a private dinner.

XKLE30UU5C-3,Turkey detains 34 on suspicion of spying for Israel,By Paul Kirby,2 January,20240102,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67861377,"Turkey says it has seized 34 people who are alleged to have been involved in spying and planning abductions for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.
Officials said 57 addresses were raided in Istanbul and elsewhere and they were still searching for 12 more suspects.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, but relations between the two countries have declined dramatically during Israel's war with Hamas.
Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya shared video of Operation Mole taking place.
He said authorities had moved in after they had decided that Israeli intelligence was seeking to carry out ""tactical tasks such as reconnaissance, pursuit, assault, and kidnapping against foreign nationals residing in our country"".
Although he made no reference to Hamas, Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued a warning last month to Israel that it would be ""doomed to pay a heavy price"" if it tried to assassinate members of Hamas on Turkish soil.
Unlike the UK, US and EU, Turkey does not categorise Hamas as a terrorist organisation and for years has maintained ties with its leadership, hosting some of its members on Turkish soil.
President Erdogan has even described Hamas militants as ""liberators who protect their land"".
In November, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant made clear that they would target Hamas chiefs wherever they were.
An undated recording was broadcast in Israel days later in which the head of Shin Bet domestic security, Ronen Bar, was heard saying the cabinet had set the agency the goal of eliminating Hamas.
""We will do this everywhere, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar. It will take a few years but we will be there to do it,"" he was quoted as saying.
The death of Hamas's deputy political leader in Lebanon, Saleh al-Arouri, in an explosion in Beirut on Tuesday was immediately blamed on Israel by Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.
Video of some of the Turkish raids posted by the interior minister showed police bursting into people's flats, handcuffing suspects and putting them into police cars.
However, this is not the first time Turkish officials have highlighted operations targeting purported Mossad agents.
In 2022, dozens of people were arrested on suspicion of spying on Palestinian citizens. Then last July, Turkey's MIT intelligence agency named seven suspects it said had confessed to working for Mossad.
Turkish popular and political opinion is broadly behind the Palestinians and a big anti-Israel rally took place in the heart of Istanbul on Monday.
What is behind Turkey's staunch support for Hamas in Gaza?"
ZYKF7NGTGD-4,What is behind Turkey's staunch support for Hamas in Gaza?,By Ece Goksedef,2 January,20240102,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67861266,"On the first day of the year, tens of thousands of Turks poured on to the streets of Istanbul, chanting ""Murderer Israel, get out of Palestine"".
It was not the first massive pro-Palestinian rally in Turkey since the start of Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.
But Monday's mass protest followed incendiary remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Since he first came to power more than 20 years ago, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas.
But even by Mr Erdogan's standards, the rhetoric was extreme. What Israel's prime minister was doing in Gaza, he said, ""is not any less than what Hitler did"".
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying ""Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us"".
Mr Erdogan has made comparisons with Nazi Germany in the past, but the current war of words has put into sharp focus just how bitter Turkish-Israeli relations have become, just months after a significant upturn.
In the latest broadside against Israel, Turkey announced on Tuesday that it had detained 33 people suspected of working for Israeli intelligence service Mossad in raids across eight provinces.
The operation, carried out with Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, followed reports that Israel intended to hunt down members of Hamas abroad, including in Turkey.
Turkey has stepped up support for Gaza since 7 October, for example bringing dozens of patients from Gaza to Turkey for treatment. Turkey's health minister himself accompanied the casualties en route from Egypt.
When Hamas attacked Israel, Mr Erdogan used relatively measured language, urging both sides to remain calm. But as Israel's military response intensified, his rhetoric became increasingly fierce, calling Hamas ""freedom fighters"" and Israel's actions ""genocide"".
This hostility to Israel plays to President Erdogan's support base in Turkey, says Helin Sari Ertem, Associate Professor of International Relations at Istanbul Medeniyet University.
""Palestine has long been a cause for Turkey and the Turkish people, covering almost all political tendencies,"" she says. ""Consequently, it is not possible for Turkish governments to consider the Palestine-Israeli conflict only as a foreign policy issue; as it definitely is a game-changer in domestic politics.""
In the second half of the 20th Century, Israel and Turkey enjoyed close economic and strategic relationships. Turkey was also the first country in the region to formally recognise Israel after it was founded.
But it was not long after Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to office in 2002 that relations with Israel deteriorated while those with Hamas improved. In 2006, then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal visited Turkey following an invitation from Mr Erdogan. Hamas had by then been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US and the EU, amongst others.
The first diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey played out before a world audience when in 2009, Mr Erdogan stormed out of a meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos after a clash with Israel's then-President Shimon Peres over Israeli air strikes in Gaza.
The Turkish leader vowed to never go back to Davos - and he has not returned since.
But just a year later tensions reached breaking point when a ship, the Mavi Marmara, sailed from Istanbul to Gaza leading a flotilla of boats carrying volunteers and humanitarian aid to challenge Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.
When the Mavi Marmara refused to halt, Israeli commandos raided it in international waters and 10 Turkish citizens on board were killed in ensuing clashes. The incident led Turkey to suspend diplomatic relations with Israel for several years.
According to Ms Sari Ertem, Turkey's pivot away from Israel and towards the Palestinians is due to the conservative and pro-Islamic grassroots of Mr Erdogan's AKP party.
While Mr Erdogan's support for the Palestinians is sincere, she says it also aimed at calming down the conservative-nationalist political groups, which did not see sufficient reaction from the AKP in the first days of the war.
The head of the main opposition Republican People's Party in Turkey, Ozgur Ozel, called on the international community to act for Gaza, and the leader of the second biggest opposition party, Meral Aksener, has branded the Israeli prime minister a ""terrorist"".
However, this support for Hamas has come at a cost for Turkey.
Turkey's frayed relationship with Israel was restored only last year and then, within months of both countries reappointing their ambassadors, the war erupted. Turkey recalled its ambassador, and Israel's envoy returned out of security concerns.
Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based geopolitical risk consultancy, says President Erdogan is unlikely to change path.
""He has his domestic supporters and constituents, and he can't ignore such pressure coming from within Turkey and his base,"" Mr Cafiero argues.
He also says the president cannot ignore his desire to be considered as a strong Muslim leader.
""Erdogan is a respected head of state throughout the wider Islamic world, and he has regional and international supporters, too.""
Despite the rupture between the two countries, Ms SarÄ± Ertem believes it will not be too damaging.
""The anti-Israeli discourse, which becomes very much visible especially at times of serious civilian casualties caused by Israel on the Palestinian side, rarely disrupts the traditional Turkish foreign policy approach, which favours a balancing act,"" she says.
""It has always continued its relations with Israel at least economically, if not politically. Turkish-Israeli relations have proved to be quite resilient despite all the ups and downs during history.""

HK50CG6VF4-6,Ukraine and Russia in 'biggest prisoner swap' so far,By Ido Vock,3 January,20240103,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67872417,"Ukraine and Russia have exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war, in what is being described by officials in Kyiv as the biggest swap of the war.
Ukraine said 230 prisoners, including serving members of the armed forces and border guard, had been freed from Russian captivity.
In exchange, 248 Russians were released by Ukraine in the deal, mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
It is the first major prisoner exchange since last August.
""Our people are home,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on social media. ""Today, we brought back over 200 warriors and civilians from Russian captivity.""
In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defence said negotiations had been ""difficult"".
The two countries have exchanged prisoners on a number of occasions since the start of Russia's full-scale war in February 2022, but the Ukrainian leader said last month that the process had slowed down for Russia's own ""very specific reasons"".
Images showing the prisoner releases were posted separately by Russian and by Ukrainian officials. A video released by Moscow showed some of the freed Russians smiling on a bus.
Ukraine said their freed soldiers included seven defenders of Snake Island, a rocky outcrop in the Black Sea.
Snake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance hours into Russia's full-scale invasion, when a border guard posted there refused to surrender to the Russian warship Mosvka.
Others released included National Guardsmen captured at the Chernobyl exclusion zone and soldiers detained during the battle for the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Six of those released were civilians, according to Kyiv.
Both sides thanked the United Arab Emirates for mediating the deal.
Last month, Ukraine said it had freed some 2,598 people from Russian captivity during a process of 48 swaps.
Some Ukrainian prisoners of war previously freed from Russian captivity have said they were subject to torture, including beatings and electric shocks.

6236R6S6NI-8,FDA approves Florida's request to import cheaper drugs from Canada,By Brandon Livesay,5 days ago,20240105,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67884838,"The US Food and Drug Administration has approved Florida's request to import prescription drugs from Canada to rein in drug prices in the state.
Medicines in Canada can be nearly half the price of US counterparts and some drugs cost almost $400 a pill in Florida.
The FDA's decision could open the door for other states to follow suit.
The major policy shift overrides decades of opposition from the US pharmaceutical industry.
The industry's major lobbying group has already indicated it will try to intervene.
Florida estimates the programme, which allows the import of certain prescription drugs used to treat conditions such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and mental illness, will save state taxpayers up to $150m (Â£118m) a year.
The sky-high costs of prescription drugs have been an ongoing political issue in the US, where prices are among the highest in the world.
According to a report by the OECD group of industrialised nations, the US spends more than double the average amount spent by other member countries on prescription medicines per capita.
For example, where the UK paid approximately Â£246 ($314) per head in 2023, the US paid $1,139.
In a statement announcing the FDA's authorisation, Commissioner Robert Califf said the administration would continue to work with states and Indian tribes on these  proposals.
""These proposals must demonstrate the programmes would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" he said.
Florida's approval does come with requirements, including how the drugs are labelled and ensuring they meet FDA specifications and standards.
The state's health care administration will need to submit quarterly reports to the FDA that outlines cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.
There will also be restrictions on who can access the imported drugs.
The FDA's decision comes after President Joe Biden's executive order in 2021 - which directed federal agencies to work with states on lowering costs through importation plans.
An online statement published on Thursday from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America President and CEO Stephen J Ubl said the FDA's decision was ""reckless"".
He said his organisation would consider ""all options for preventing this policy from harming patients"".
It is not known how Canada's healthcare system will react to Florida's plan, but it could stoke fears of drug shortages for its own citizens.
Canada banned the export of some prescription medicines in 2020 to prevent a shortage in the country after then-US President Donald Trump proposed a plan to import drugs from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans.

ZKGLW2C53T-9,Ukraine war: US says Russia using North Korea ballistic missiles,_,5 days ago,20240105,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67888793,"Russia has used ballistic missiles and launchers supplied by North Korea in its war on Ukraine, the US has said.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called it a ""significant and concerning escalation"" relating to Pyongyang's support for Russia.
He said the US would raise the matter at the UN Security Council and impose additional sanctions on those working to facilitate arms transfers.
Moscow has denied any such collaboration.
Hours after the White House made the accusations, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for missile launch vehicle production to be expanded in the country.
The North Korean leader visited Russia to discuss potential military co-operation in September.
The US has previously accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons, but this is the first time US intelligence has shared details about ballistic missiles - self-guided rockets that can reach targets 900km (500 miles) away.
It is unclear what North Korea will get in return for providing the weapons to Russia. Some Western countries have raised concerns over the potential transfer of weapons or military technologies to Pyongyang.
In 2017, a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank suggested that North Korea was able to quickly develop new missiles by obtaining a Soviet RD-250 rocket engine from illicit channels operating in Russia or Ukraine. Ukraine denied the allegation and said Russia was to blame.
But that year, North Korea was able to rapidly expand its missile arsenal, introducing two new systems: the medium-range Hwasong-12 and the intercontinental Hwasong-14.
Speaking during a White House press briefing on Thursday, Mr Kirby said Russia's procurement of ballistic missiles from North Korea was a direct violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions.
""We will demand that Russia be held accountable for yet again violating its international obligations,"" he said.
He also said the US believed Russia was planning on purchasing close-range missiles from Iran, but that it had not done so yet.
The UK said it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's use of ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea in Ukraine.
""North Korea is subject to a robust sanctions regime, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,"" a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.
In his briefing, Mr Kirby also urged US Congress to approve extra US funding for Ukraine ""without delay"".
""The most effective response to Russia's horrific violence against the Ukrainian people is to continue to provide Ukraine with vital air defence capabilities and other types of military equipment,"" he said.
""Iran and the DPRK [North Korea] are standing with Russia. Ukrainians deserve to know that the American people and this government will continue to stand with them.""
The last US military aid package to Ukraine, worth some $250m (Â£195m), was approved by the White House on 27 December.
Talks on further funding have stalled in Congress because of a lack of support among Republicans, who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal.
Ukraine has warned that its war effort and the country's public finances are at risk if further Western aid does not come soon.

972PE9WC72-10,"Ukraine war: Atesh, the group spying on Russians in occupied Crimea",By Jessica Parker,5 days ago,20240106,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67659275,"""I had a hunch that someone was watching me. My heart was pounding.""
A man, who we're calling Agent One, takes photos as he crouches down in some bushes.
He tells us he's part of a group called Atesh - a word that means fire in Crimean Tatar.
And via a messaging app, he describes his secret life to the BBC: spying on Russian forces in occupied Crimea.
""For probably two weeks, I planned in my head how and what I would do,"" he says. ""Planned the route, the main backup, what I should say in case I was noticed.""
Agent One is thorough. He takes multiple shots from multiple angles.
But it's dangerous - potentially deadly - work. On one occasion, moments after investigating a site, he noticed a group of Russian servicemen nearby.
""[That] was a terrible moment,"" he says. ""I managed to lean down [by a] car and pretended that I had a problem with the wheel.""
""Miraculously, they just didn't talk to me.""
Atesh says it collects information on Russian military movements - mostly in Crimea but also in other occupied areas and even inside Russia itself.
Operatives say their information has aided high-profile Ukrainian strikes on Crimea, such as hits on a Russian landing ship and submarine - the Minsk and Rostov-on-Don - and an attack on the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in September 2023.
Most recently, Atesh said it had carried out reconnaissance work this week after a Ukrainian strike on a possible radar station in Yevpatoria.
Military bloggers in Russia dismiss the network as an online invention of Ukrainian intelligence, designed to overstate levels of resistance.
Yet Russian media also report that Atesh is a terrorist organisation, banned by the Kremlin.
Through messaging apps and a handler for the group, the BBC has spoken with five men who say they're active agents for Atesh - including one who says he currently works for Russia's military.
While their accounts cannot be independently verified, a senior source within Ukraine's defence and intelligences services told the BBC that the testimonies are credible.
The agents say they're willing to speak to us because they want to show there is an active resistance movement.
""Crimeans are not all zombies and [are] ready to resist even in conditions of total censorship,"" Agent One says.
The Russian serviceman who the BBC spoke to - Agent Five - knows his double life is dangerous.
""The stakes are very high - no one wants to go to jail."" Those caught face treason charges and long prison sentences.
""Everything must be approached carefully and with your head. Mistakes in such activities are simply unacceptable.""
Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014, eight years before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Ethnic Russians have for many decades made up the majority of the population, but significant Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities remain.
The BBC contacted Atesh directly and spoke to a handler based in unoccupied Ukraine.
The men will not reveal their identities due to the risk of arrest.
""The Russian special services are constantly trying to identify partisans,"" Agent Two tells us.
He hides the work he is doing from even his closest family.
These men say they started carrying out reconnaissance work because of their opposition to Moscow's actions.
They tell us they provide intel on air defences, depots, military bases and soldiers' movements, sometimes staking out sites for weeks.
Agent Two says he's not paid for his work, but he is refunded for his expenses, like fuel.
Our main contact, the handler, would not comment on how the group is funded except to say there are ""several"" sources of income.
A different body - the National Resistance Centre, which operates under Ukraine's Special Operation Forces - is openly funded by the government and works with Atesh.
It insists Atesh is not a propaganda construct and that the intel is of high value.
""A missile attack with Storm Shadow or Himars is a very expensive thing,"" says its spokesman, who wears a mask and goes under the pseudonym of ""Ostap"".
""We can't let ourselves throw ammunition randomly as the Russians do. We have to verify the information we're getting.""
Agent Two describes driving more than 100km (62 miles) to survey a military site. He walked ""for a long time"", before managing to find a gap in a fence.
He squeezed through it, to gather photos and information on military vehicles.
""It's exciting,"" he says. ""Adrenaline rises incredibly powerfully at such moments.""
In the days that followed, he heard there had been a successful strike in that area.
""This is the moment I am most proud of,"" he says.
Huge attacks on Russian military targets in Crimea are seen by Kyiv as a key part of a counter-offensive that has faltered elsewhere, notably on the frontlines.
The peninsula is of high strategic importance as it is essentially an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"", says retired Ukrainian Navy Captain Andriy Ryzhenko.
Based in Crimea before the annexation and now in Kyiv, he says the peninsula is used by Russia to ""project power"" from the Black Sea towards the Mediterranean and Atlantic.
It has forced Ukraine to create a new sea route for grain ships to steer clear of the peninsula, after Russia pulled out of a deal to allow shipments.
Yet satellite imagery indicates Ukrainian strikes have caused Russia to move assets away from occupied Sevastopol and to the Russian port of Novorossiysk.
For Atesh, the threat of infiltration by pro-Russian operatives is very real, in a murky world of agents and double agents.
""We try not to disclose strategic plans to the agents who are at risk of being taken by the FSB,"" says our handler, in reference to Russia's Federal Security Service.
""A person knows only what he needs to know.""
A third agent tells us that ""filming the military of a country that is at war is suicide"", but the risk is justified because of Russia's ""criminal war"".
""If I am caught, then I will face the basements of the FSB and [accusations of being] a 'traitor' to the Motherland.""
But, with the risk, comes the possibility too of reward.
""We often see the fruits of our work,"" says Agent Four. ""Whenâ¦ Russian military [sites] are hit, so that only ashes remain.""
Sometimes it's just a quick photo or two. Sometimes Agent Four observes areas over a prolonged period.
""To find out all the routes of patrols, find out where all the exits and entrances are, what equipment is on the territory, or what exactly is stored at the facility.""
Each man tells us he works alone, contacting only a ""curator"" to whom the information is passed.
Atesh appeared as a network after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and is by no means the only resistance organisation in occupied areas.
It claims to be a grassroots movement that's grown from a small group which now numbers ""thousands"".
An ""oath"" posted on the Telegram messaging app in September 2022 said, ""I swear by my blood and my soul"" to be faithful to the Atesh movement and ""fight for the Ukrainian state"".
There are reported to be strong links to the peninsula's Turkic-speaking Crimean Tatar population - although representatives of that community who the BBC spoke to said they did not start Atesh.
The group regularly posts about its work on Telegram, even uploading photos.
While the movement mainly appears to provide logistical information, partisan activists also claim to have carried out violent attacks - such as killing 30 Russian soldiers in a military hospital and a car-bomb attack in Russian-occupied Kherson.
The handler we speak to concedes that they are keen to publicise the group - to recruit more agents and unnerve the Russians.
But all those the BBC spoke to say their priority is ending Russia's invasion and its occupation of Ukrainian land.
Agent One says that, in Crimea, they live in ""terrible conditions"" of propaganda and control.
""But I am absolutely sure that we are gradually bringing our liberation of Crimea closer.""

SFZV2EQ3UT-11,Flights cancelled as regulator grounds Boeing 737 Max 9s over blowout,By Thomas Mackintosh,3 days ago,20240107,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67905336,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'Trip from hell': On board flight during mid-air blow out
Thousands of passengers face flight cancellations after major US airlines grounded dozens of Boeing jets after a mid-flight blowout over Oregon.
The US aviation regulator said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9s must be grounded for checks after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday.
Alaska said flight disruptions are expected to last into next week. United Airlines has grounded 79 planes.
Disruptions are likely to primarily affect flights in the US.
It follows regulator the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordering ""immediate inspections"" of 737 Max 9s worldwide.
Required inspections would take around four to eight hours per aircraft, it said.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is following the FAA approach, but flight disruptions on the continent are expected to be minimal.
EASA said it believes no European airlines operate Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order.
One of the world's largest intercontinental airports, London Heathrow, said there was no impact on flights.
The bulk of the affected planes are owned by US airlines. United Airlines has grounded all 79 of its Max 9 planes.
Alaska said it cancelled 160 flights on Saturday, affecting about 23,000 passengers.
Other airlines which also fly the planes have temporarily taken them out of service.
Boeing said it welcomed the FAA's decision, adding its teams were in close contact with the regulator.
During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data.
Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off.
Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen.
One passenger said the gap was ""as wide as a refrigerator"" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing.

The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously.
""My heart goes out to those who were on this flight - I am so sorry for what you experienced,"" Alaska's CEO Ben Minicucci said after the firm volunteered to ground 65 of its 737 Max 9 planes.
""I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants,"" he added.
Alaska later said that, as of Saturday afternoon, it had cancelled 160 flights.
The airline said on Saturday that 18 of its Max 9 planes - about a quarter - had received ""in-depth inspections as part of heavy maintenance checks"" and were returned to service, but following the FAA's orders these have since been ""pulled from service"".
""We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service,"" Alaska said in a statement.
It added: ""The aircraft involved in flight 1282 was delivered to us on 31 October. The part of the aircraft involved in this event is called a plug door - a specific panel of the fuselage near the rear of the aircraft.""
The rear mid-cabin exit door is used in dense seating configurations on some Max 9 planes to meet evacuation requirements, but is ""plugged"" on other planes, including the Alaska flight.
United Airlines says it has carried out the inspections required by the FAA on some of its 737 Max 9 planes.
Removing some of its aircraft from service was expected to cause about 60 cancellations on Saturday, the airline said in a statement.
Turkish Airlines has grounded five of its 737 Max 9s.
Flydubai said its three 737 Max 9s were not affected as they had a ""different configuration"" compared to the Alaska Airline planes and have completed recent safety checks.
British regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said there are no registered Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in the UK and therefore the impact would be ""minimal"".
""We have written to all non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask for confirmation that inspections have been undertaken prior to any operation into UK airspace,"" a CAA spokesman said.
In the US, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has taken charge of the Alaska investigation and its chair confirmed no passenger had been sat next to the affected section.
""We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,"" Jennifer Homendy said.
Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door, which they believe fell to the ground in the community of Cedar Hills, about 11 km (seven miles) west of central Portland.
Boeing's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues.
The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other killing those on board.
Aviation expert John Strickland said the Alaska Airlines incident was very different to those crashes, adding that since the 737 Max came back into service it had ""a very good safety record"".
""While we know little evidence of why this section of the fuselage has come out - this has nothing to do with the aircraft being grounded for 18 months,"" he told BBC News.
""But, it is natural Alaska Airlines is taking a cautious approach grounding its fleet""
More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory.
About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows.
Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.

9QURDX8MWY-12,Palestinians must be able to stay in Gaza - Blinken,By George Wright,3 days ago,20240107,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67907336,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow.
Mr Blinken condemned statements by some Israeli ministers, who called for the resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere.
The US official was in Qatar on his latest Middle East tour.
His comments followed reports that up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
Footage from Jabalia showed bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children.
A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it ""acted against a military target in the strike"" and that it was ""not aware of the number of casualties mentioned"".
""In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,"" they said, adding that the IDF ""follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"".
More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis.
Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October.
Some 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage in the Hamas raids.
More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has reported at least 113 deaths over 24 hours of Israeli bombardment.
""Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,"" Mr Blinken said on Sunday. ""They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza.""
Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"".
And National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right politician, this week issued a call ""to encourage the migration of Gaza residents"" as a ""solution"" to the crisis.
The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.
Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Health officials said even medical facilities including hospitals are now unsafe.
Three international medical aid groups announced they were pulling out of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza after Israel issued evacuation orders.
A representative of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that they were ""hugely concerned by this development"".
""What it means is that a hospital that was already over-crowded and overloaded and well beyond its capacity is now without absolutely critical reinforcement to support it as it deals with an ever-increasing number of casualties,"" said Gemma Connell.
The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that more than 600 patients and health workers were forced to leave the hospital, according to its director.
""Their locations are not currently known,"" said Mr Tedros in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Mr Blinken's latest trip to the Middle East comes amid rising tensions in the region, with concerns that the war in Gaza could spread.
Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official, was assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement in Lebanon, described Arouri's assassination as a ""flagrant Israeli aggression"" that would not go unpunished.
Hezbollah then fired rockets into Israel on Saturday as a ""preliminary response"" to the killing of Arouri.
""This is a moment of profound tension in the region. This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Mr Blinken said.
Qatar's PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al -Thani said that the killing of Arouri had affected ""the complicated process"".
Mr Blinken also said that the death of journalist Hamza al-Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza., was ""an unimaginable tragedy"".
He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war.
Mr Blinken arrived in Qatar following stops in Jordan, Turkey and Greece. He went on to Abu Dhabi late Sunday, and on Monday is due to travel to Saudi Arabia.

527NZCIW13-13,China sanctions five US defence firms over Taiwan arms sales,By Peter Hoskins,3 days ago,20240108,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67909120,"China has announced sanctions on five Western defence firms over the latest round of US arms sales to Taiwan.
The announcement comes as Taiwan prepares to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 13 January.
US weapons sales to Taiwan are a frequent source of tension between Beijing and Washington.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, a claim Taiwan's government rejects.
Last month, the US State Department approved a $300m (Â£236m) sale of equipment to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that the sanctions were ""In response to these gravely wrong actions taken by the US"".
It also said the recent arms sales ""seriouslyâharm China's sovereignty and security interests,âundermine theâpeace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"".
The companies being sanctioned were named as BAE Systems Land and Armament, Alliant Techsystems Operation, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions.
China will freeze the assets of the companies and ban people and organisations in China from engaging them, the Foreign Ministry said.
The BBC has contacted the US embassy in Beijing for comment.
Beijing has ramped up its pressure on Taiwan ahead of the elections that could redefine the island's relationship with China.
In his annual New Year's Eve address, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his claim that Taiwan would ""surely be reunified"" with China.
He also struck a stronger tone than last year's message, when he spoke about Taiwan being part of the ""same family"".
China sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. Taiwan considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.

O4NDIZTCBM-14,Saudi Arabia interested in Israel normalisation deal after war,By David Gritten,1 day ago,20240109,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922238,"This video can not be played
Watch: The Saudi ambassador to the UK warns against a ""blind spot towards Israel""
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK says it is interested in normalising relations with Israel after the war in Gaza, but that any deal must lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.
Prince Khalid bin Bandar told the BBC a pact was ""close"" when the the kingdom paused US-brokered talks after Hamas's deadly attacks on Israel on 7 October.
Saudi Arabia still believed in establishing ties with Israel despite the ""deplorable"" casualty figures in Gaza, he said, but it would not ""come at the cost of the Palestinian people"".
The ambassador also warned that there was a ""failure of humanity"" over Gaza, with the international community not doing enough to end the fighting.
He also said he would like to see the UK ""moderate it's position"" and ""treat Israel the same way it treats everyone else"". ""The blind spot towards Israel is a real problem because it provides a blind spot to peace,"" he added.
Saudi Arabia is a leader of the Arab and Islamic world. It has never formally recognised Israel since its creation in 1948, and a deal normalising ties would represent a major breakthrough for the Jewish state.
In late September, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler had declared in a US television interview that ""every day we get closer"" to an agreement.
While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Palestinian issue was ""very important"" and that any agreement would have to ""ease the life of the Palestinians"", he did not declare that it would be dependent on advances towards the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
The public position of Palestinian leaders is that they will reject outright a deal if it does not leave them with a state, but earlier that month officials had said they were privately demanding a cash boost and more control of land in the occupied West Bank in return for engaging with the US-backed Saudi-Israel process.
Saudi officials reportedly asked the US to pause the three-way discussions a few days after the 7 October attacks, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage by hundreds of Hamas gunmen who infiltrated southern Israeli communities from Gaza.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 23,200 people have been killed in the territory during the military campaign that Israel subsequently launched with the aim of destroying Hamas.
After meeting Crown Prince Mohammed on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters he had brought up the subject of normalisation.
""There's a clear interest here in pursuing that,"" he said. ""But it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian state.""
In an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday, the Saudi ambassador in London confirmed that ""absolutely there is interest"" among his country's leaders for an agreement.
""[A deal] was close, there is no question. For us, the final end point definitely included nothing less than an independent state of Palestine. So, while we still - going forward after 7 October - believe in normalisation, it does not come at the cost of the Palestinian people,"" Prince Khalid said.
He added: ""We were close to normalisation, therefore close to a Palestinian state. One doesn't come without the other. The sequencing, how it is managed, that is what was being discussed.""
Asked if Saudi Arabia saw Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western countries - as part of that future Palestinian state, Prince Khalid said it ""requires a lot of thought"".
""There is always room for change if you have optimism and hope. But when there is a conflict the first thing you have to recognise is that both sides have lost,"" he added.
""The problem that we have today with the current government in Israel is there is an extreme, absolutist perspective which does not work to achieve compromise and therefore you are never going to end the conflict.""
He did not elaborate, but two far-right Israeli ministers were denounced by the US after they recently called for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza.
Prince Khalid also warned that there was a risk of radicalisation as a result of the war, which has not only left many thousands of civilians dead in Gaza but also caused widespread devastation and a deep humanitarian crisis.
""The unprecedented level of the violence that has been carried out by both sides - but in particular by what is meant to be a responsible state in Israel - over the past three months, I don't think I have seen anything like it in my life,"" he said. ""The numbers are deplorable, absolutely deplorable.""
""That is going to create a lack of hope amongst not just the Palestinian people, but disaffected people [across the world]. All see a failure of humanity in what is happening, because nobody has done anything to stop it. Efforts are being made, but it is not enough."""
