The Ministry of the Interior has set up a legislative project to amend the legislation on temporary protection in order to extend temporary protection for Ukrainian nationals and their family members even after 4 March 2025. The project will prepare the necessary amendments to the Aliens Act.
Temporary protection is based on the EU Temporary Protection Directive, which was activated for the first time on 4 March 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2024, the Council of the European Union decided to extend temporary protection until 4 March 2026.
Temporary protection will continue to be granted not only to Ukrainian nationals and their family members but also to third-country nationals who have been residing in Ukraine under a permanent residence permit or international protection.
However, Finland will no longer grant temporary protection to those third-country nationals fleeing Ukraine who have been residing in Ukraine without a permanent residence permit or international protection. The reason for their stay in Ukraine may have been, for example, work or studies. Temporary protection for these people will end on 4 March 2025. The legislative amendments are based on the decision made by the Government on 7 September 2023.
The provisions of the Aliens Act on temporary protection entered into force in 2004, and they are partly outdated in the current situation. By law, temporary protection can last up to three years, meaning that temporary protection granted on the basis of the war in Ukraine will cease on 4 March 2025. After that, extending temporary protection will require legislative amendments.
Granting temporary protection makes it possible to provide protection to a limited group of people through a swift process that is lighter than the asylum procedure.
In 2022-2024, Ukrainians have submitted a total of about 74,000 applications for temporary protection in Finland. There are around 46,000 Ukrainian beneficiaries of temporary protection in Finland now. Approximately 23,000 Ukrainians are registered in the reception system for asylum seekers, and about 23,000 Ukrainians have been allocated a municipality of residence. Others are thought to have returned to Ukraine or moved elsewhere in the EU.
The term of the project is from 3 September 2024 to 31 March 2025. The project will monitor and take into account what decisions are made in the EU regarding the extension of temporary protection. Finland's national decision must be in line with the decisions of the EU and other Member States. The government proposal is scheduled to be submitted to Parliament during the 2024 autumn session. The legislative amendments must enter into force on 5 March 2025.
