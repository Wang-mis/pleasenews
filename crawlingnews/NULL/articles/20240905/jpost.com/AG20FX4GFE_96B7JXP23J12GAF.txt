For the first time since the October 7 massacre, family members of Nova Festival survivors will be able to access professional counseling subsidized by Israel's National Insurance Institute.On October 7, Hamas terrorists attacked the Nova music festival in Reim, resulting in the deaths of approximately 350 civilians and 17 policemen. Many festival-goers were physically injured, and those who survived the massacre continue to face significant mental health challenges and post-traumatic stress.The trauma experienced by survivors often extends to their families, who also struggle with the aftermath. According to a report by Maariv, these families will soon have access to subsidized psychological counseling.  In early December 2023, Yossi Shelli, Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office, met with representatives of the survivors' families. During the meeting, he pledged to promote a government decision to aid survivors of the October 7 massacre at the Nova Festival.The decision was approved on February 26, allocating an additional 20 million shekels to support survivors. This funding will address mental health needs, employment assistance, rights realization, and the creation of therapeutic spaces.
