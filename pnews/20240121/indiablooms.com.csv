At least 25 civilians have been killed and 20 more wounded as a result of a Ukrainian shelling of Donetsk on Sunday, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic Denis Pushilin told Sputnik.
He has described the attack as ""atrocious"", stressing that the market was shelled on the day when it was especially crowded.
Ukraine did not comment on the shelling so far.
Increase in civilian casualties in Ukraine in recent weeks
Recent weeks have seen a steep increase in civilian casualties in Ukraine following an intensification of Russian attacks, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in the country, HRMMU, said in a new report issued on Tuesday (January 9, 2024).
Hundreds of people across the country were killed or wounded in drone and missile strikes in the 10-day period between 29 December and 8 January alone.
“Civilian casualties had been steadily decreasing in 2023 but the wave of attacks in late December and early January violently interrupted that trend,” said Danielle Bell, head of the monitoring mission.
Next month marks two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has left 40 per cent of the population, 14.6 million people, in need of humanitarian assistance.
More than four million people are internally displaced and 6.3 million have sought refuge elsewhere, mainly in neighbouring countries."

Yahya Rasool, a spokesman for the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces, told the Iraq News Agency that the bombing injured an Iraqi soldier and caused material damage.
""A number of missiles fell near the headquarters of the 29th Brigade, 7th Division, affiliated with the Al-Jazeera Operations Command, within the Iraqi Ain Al-Assad base, wounding a soldier and causing damage to the headquarters,"" he said.
Since the beginning of the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the bases of the US-led international coalition in Iraq, as well as US troops in Syria, have come under regular attack, with armed Shiite groups operating in Iraq claiming responsibility.
On Oct 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip, while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians.
As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages.
Over 24,900 people have been killed so far in Gaza as a result of Israeli strikes, local authorities said.
On Nov 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on Dec 1."

The event marked the culmination of a five-day immersive storytelling workshop at the American Center Kolkata, that brought together ten LGBTQIA+ activists-participants from Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Jharkhand, and West Bengal to share their personal stories and express their voices through short videos.  Addressing the gathering American Center Director Elizabeth Lee said, “Building support for and protecting universal human rights is at the very heart of our diplomacy, and we remain committed to advancing human rights for all, with a special focus on LGBTQI+ individuals. Since 2018,our Rainbow Dialogues project has provided a safe space for LGBTQI+ community members to discuss issues related to inclusive society, generating employment, and helping build a strong alliance across South Asia for LGBTQIA+ peoples. Dovetailing on a strong U.S. support, this conclave seeks to empower LGBTQI+ individuals who are advocates for inclusive educational and training opportunities as well as safe public spaces.”

She added, “It is really heartening today that our gathering brought together both LGBTQI+ representatives and allies.  Being an ally is a choice.  It is about choosing to stand up for the basic human rights visibly and vocally, call out bias and unacceptable behavior, and use your voice to effect change.”  The conclave- initiated conversations towards social acceptance, inclusion, and employment opportunities for LGBTIQA+ individuals through evidence-based dialogues, storytelling and network-building. It is the first state-level advocacy conclave under the ‘Rainbow Dialogues: All in this Together’ project, which is being implemented in seven East and Northeast Indian states: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Odhisa, and West Bengal. The conclave will share findings and insights from the perception survey of 1000+ respondents from the LGBTQ+ community and 200+ from employers, educators, and service providers, across the seven states.  The conclave was an advocacy event which was a culmination of a week-long (January 10-15, 2024) immersive storytelling workshop, jointly facilitated by Amy Hill, Silence Speaks Director, StoryCenter, U.S.A., and Raymond Caldwell, Producing Artistic Director, Theater Alliance, U.S.A., that witnessed participation from LGBTQ+ identified individuals from all the seven states.  During the event today, Amy Hill introduced the project objectives.
Some participants presented their personal powerful stories through videos, and digital stories, and it was followed by an interactive panel on ""What are we doing for inclusion in our own spaces"".
The panel was designed based on the survey findings that showed that these four areas - home, education space, workspace, and public/popular media, are the most important spaces that the LGBTQ+ individuals felt as key spaces where advocacy for inclusion are needed, and crucial for a life of dignity and safety.  There was also a presentation on 'Evidence from seven project states' by Prithviraj Nath, Director, BRIDGE India.  Amy Hill said, ""At a time when trans rights in the U.S. are under fire, StoryCenter and Theater Alliance are proud to be standing in solidarity with queer and trans communities in India, supporting them in building community and sharing stories for advocacy."""

Danger and constraints
“Following the abhorrent Hamas attacks on 7 October, the wholesale destruction of Gaza and the number of civilian casualties in such a short period are totally unprecedented during my mandate,” the Secretary-General said, noting that the UN has also been affected as 152 staff have been killed.
Although humanitarians are doing their best to deliver aid, they face constant bombardments and daily dangers, amid enormous constraints posed by damaged roads, communication blackouts and access denials.
Meanwhile, disease and hunger are deepening, he said.
He said people are dying not only from bombs and bullets, but from lack of food and clean water, hospitals without power and medicine, and gruelling journeys to ever-smaller slivers of land to escape the fighting.
Prevent conflict spillover
“This must stop. I will not relent in my call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,” Mr. Guterres said.
“And we must do all we can to prevent spillover of this conflict across the region — in the West Bank, across the Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon, and in Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea.”
He added that refusal to accept the two-State solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable.
“This would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security; exacerbate polarization; and embolden extremists everywhere,” he said.
NAM leadership
The NAM was established in the midst of the Cold War, when leaders of newly independent countries sought a neutral stance and avoided joining either of the two major power blocs, headed by the United States and the Soviet Union.
Mr. Guterres said the “swirl of uncertainty and instability” in the world today offers new opportunities for countries and the organization to lead the way towards deeper cooperation and shared global affluence – the theme of the summit.
As global affluence depends on peace which requires institutions that reflect today’s world, he pointed to the need to reform bodies such as the UN Security Council which is “paralyzed by geopolitical divisions that block effective solutions.”
Recalling that the NAM has long highlighted the issue, he said the UN Summit of the Future in September offers a unique opportunity to consider reforms and promote ideas to rebuild trust and strengthen multilateral collaboration.
Sustainable development
Meanwhile, countries are moving backwards in achieving sustainable development, another requirement for peace.  People are going hungry and communities lack access to basics such as healthcare, clean water, proper sanitation and education.
Guterres repeated his call for reforming the “outdated, unjust and unfair global financial system” so that all countries benefit, and urged governments to invest in education, health, nutrition and social protection systems.
Last September, world leaders meeting at the UN demonstrated support for both a $500 billion annual stimulus package to boost sustainable development and his call to reform the global financial system.
At the COP28 conference two months later, countries operationalized the long-awaited Loss and Damage Fund to support nations that are most vulnerable to climate change. However, contributions so far have been limited, and developed countries have not fulfilled many of their longstanding commitments on climate finance, he said.
The Secretary-General urged the NAM to hold leaders to keep these promises this year."

If elected to power, Modi, under whose leadership the Bharatiya Janata Party seized power at the Centre in Delhi after thrashing the Congress-led UPA government in 2014 general polls, will create a hattrick of victory.

Pran pratishtha or consecration of the idol is a Hindu tradition when the murti (idol) is infused with life as a deity in a Hindu temple. Chanting of hymns invites the deity to be a resident guest, and the murti's eye is opened for the first time.
From celebrities to politicians and seers, Ayodhya is currently overwhelmed by people from far and wide places who hope to witness a watershed religious event that will mark the course of the nation in the coming months. Many of them arrived in private jets for the ceremony.

The temple site remained an issue of bitter contest between Hindus and Muslims with both the religious factions laying claim to it for nearly seven decades.
It also witnessed violence in 1992 when a mob destroyed a 16th-century mosque which stood at the site, which was built over a Hindu temple according to the court's final verdict.

Central declares half-day
The central government declared a half-day of closing of offices on January 22 on the occasion of Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha (consecration ceremony). Many BJP-ruled states have also followed suit.
Congress declines to attend ceremony
Country's key opposition Congress has dubbed the temple opening ceremony as a BJP-RSS event, with its senior leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi declining to attend the event.
Many other opposition leaders have also decided to give the ceremony a miss stating they will visit the Ram temple after January 22 or once the temple construction is complete.

The family of the teen, who is battling a combination of a brain tumour and a stroke, desperately sought an air ambulance to airlift him from the remote island of Wilmington in Gaaf Alif Villingili to Maldives capital Male, where he could have got advanced medical care, the report said.
The incident happened on Wednesday night when the child suffered a stroke, prompting his family to request an aerial transfer to the capital.
However, their distress calls went unanswered until Thursday morning, when the country's aviation authorities finally responded. The delay, reportedly lasting 16 crucial hours, sparked protests near the hospital in Gaaf Alif Villingili.
""We called Island Aviation to get him to Male immediately after the stroke but they did not answer our calls. They answered the phone at 8:30 am on Thursday. The solution is to have an air ambulance for such cases,"" the father told local media outlet Adhahu.
He was finally transferred to Male but by then the child's health was rapidly deteriorating. Upon arrival, the boy was immediately admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Aasandha Company Limited, the company responsible for medical evacuations, issued a statement indicating that they had initiated the evacuation process promptly upon receiving the request. However, they cited a last-minute ""technical glitch"", leading to a delay.
""It is with deep regret that we acknowledge the unfortunate passing of the patient involved in the emergency medical evacuation incident from GA Vilingili on January 18, 2024. The entire management and staff of Aasandha Company extend our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them, seeking solace in Allah (SWT) for the departed's eternal rest in Jannatul Firdaus,"" the company said in a statement.

Local Maldivian media reported protests outside the hospital where the child died.
""People shouldn't have to pay with their lives to satisfy the President's animosity towards India,"" Maldives MP Meekail Naseem posted on X.
The incident comes against the backdrop of strained diplomatic relations between India and Maldives.
The diplomatic ties between both countries hit a new low recently after Maldivian Minister Mariyam Shiuna’s disparaging comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""clown"" and ""puppet"" in posts on X, which have since been deleted.
The tweets were removed following criticism and backlash on the micro-blogging site.
The row erupted also under the shadow of strained India-Maldives ties after President Mohamed Muizzu, who is seen as a pro-China politician, came to power."
Z6GOEYL3U2_PU2E4WYNHXIWHHY,Nirmala Sitharaman claims Tamil Nadu govt has bannned live telecast of Ayodhya Ram Mandir programmes,India Blooms News Service,"21 Jan 2024, 06:04 pm",20240121,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/N/94435/nirmala-sitharaman-claims-tamil-nadu-govt-has-bannned-live-telecast-of-ayodhya-ram-mandir-programmes.html,"The finance minister also alleged that the state police were stopping private temples from organising events commemorating the consecration ceremony of the temple in Ayodhya.
""TamilNadu government has banned watching live telecasts of #AyodhaRamMandir programmes on January 22. In Tamil Nadu, there are over 200 Shri Ram temples. In HR&CE-managed temples, no puja/bhajan/prasadam/annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are stopping privately held temples from organising events,"" she said on a social media post on X.
She further added, ""They are threatening organisers that they will rip off pandals. Strongly condemn this anti-Hindu, hateful action"".
""TN govt is unofficially claiming law and order issues to justify the live telecast ban. False and fake narrative! There were no L&O issues on the day of the #Ayodhya verdict. Not even the day when PM @narendramodi laid the foundation, in any part of the country.""
""The groundswell and the voluntary participation of people to celebrate #ShriRam in TN has rattled the anti-Hindu #DMK "" she further added.
Hitting back at the politician, the Tamil Nadu government said the BJP is propagating erroneous information to divert people's attention from the DMK Youth Conference in Salem.
HR & CE Minister P K Sekarbabu said it was unfortunate that a person like Nirmala Sitharaman, who holds “high position” was indulging in spreading news that is “blatantly false and fake.”
