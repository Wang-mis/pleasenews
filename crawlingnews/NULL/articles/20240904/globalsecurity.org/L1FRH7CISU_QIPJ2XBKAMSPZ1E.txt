Earlier today, Russian missiles struck a military training facility and a hospital in Ukraineâkilling more than 50 people and injuring dozens more. I condemn this deplorable attack in the strongest possible terms.
This assault is a tragic reminder of Putin's ongoing and outrageous attempts to break the will of a free people. But for two and a half years, the people of Ukraine have stood unbowed. And the United States will continue stand with themâincluding providing the air defense systems and capabilities they need to protect their country.
Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war. The people of Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United States stands with them.
