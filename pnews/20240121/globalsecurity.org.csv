Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Saturday released the following press statement:
The UN Security Council, at the brigandish demand of the U.S. and its vassal states, convened a closed-door negotiation to discuss the hypersonic missile test-fire which was conducted as a part of the DPRK's regular efforts for bolstering up its defence capability.
As already clarified, the test-fire conducted by the DPRK was a part of the regular development research work in the field of national defence science and gave no harmful affect to the security of neighboring countries and it had nothing to do with the present regional situation.
Nevertheless, the U.S. brought up it into discussion of the UNSC, taking issue with the regular and legitimate activities of sovereign state. Moreover, it, again, dispatched the nuclear carrier task force into the waters around the Korean peninsula and staged provocative and threatening joint military drills together with its vassal forces.
This is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK, an unpardonable provocation and an irresponsible act of deliberately escalating the critical situation on the Korean peninsula.
We deeply regret that the UNSC has brought the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's sovereign right to the discussion without any expression of concern, far from detention and restraining of the grave military threat of the U.S. and its vassal states that breaks peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, and strongly denounce it.
The first issue to pay the closet attention to and be dealt with by the UNSC at the present time is the situation in the Middle East where unprecedented humanitarian disaster is taking place due to the illegal infringement upon the sovereignty, interference in internal affairs and armed attack of aggression by the U.S. and its followers.
If the UNSC truly feels responsibility for international peace and stability, it should take issue with the intentional and premeditated military provocations of the U.S. and the Republic of Korea that are driving the security environment in the Korean peninsula and the surrounding area to the brink of a crash and put it in question.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never tolerate the abnormal repeated practice of the UNSC which illegally brands the efforts for bolstering up its own capabilities to be certainly necessary for defending itself as an illegal one but will firmly safeguard its sovereign right and legitimate interests through stronger and more obvious action choice. -0-"

Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign Minister's assistant office on Jan. 20 made public the following press release as regards the results of her visit to the Russian Federation:
The government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea headed by Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui paid an official visit to the Russian Federation from January 15 to 17, 2024 at the invitation of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a time when the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have definitely entered the course of a new comprehensive development.
During the visit, Choe Son Hui paid a courtesy call on Russian President Vladimir Putin, had a talk with her counterpart Sergei Lavrov and met with Alexandr Nobak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation.
Choe Son Hui courteously conveyed warm greetings of Kim Jong Un , president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to Vladimir Putin, president of the Russian Federation, and President Putin asked her to convey his New Year greetings to President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Kim Jong Un .
President Putin expressed deep thanks once again for the invitation of President of the State Affairs Kim Jong Un to visit Pyongyang at a convenient time and expressed his willingness to visit the DPRK at an early date.
During the visit both sides discussed the issues of continuously taking practical action measures for comprehensively and thoroughly implementing the agreements reached at the historic DPRK-Russia summit held in September 2023 and of ushering in a new efflorescence of the DPRK-Russia friendship by vitalizing bilateral exchange and cooperation in all fields this year marking the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of the agreement on the DPRK-Russia economic and cultural cooperation.
Both sides also had deep strategic communication on various regional and international issues including the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia and reached a consensus of views on them. They expressed their strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order based on independence and justice.
Both sides recognized that the friendly and cooperative relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation, independent sovereign states, serve as a powerful strategic fortress and a traction engine in defending international peace and security and promoting the building of a multi-polarized world. They also reached a consensus and satisfactory agreement in the discussion of practical issues of putting the bilateral relations on a new legal basis in the direction of strategic development and expanding and developing them in an all-round way.
The DPRK side highly appreciated the important mission and role of the powerful Russian Federation in maintaining the strategic stability and balance of the world and expressed expectation that the Russian Federation would continue to adhere to independent policies and lines in all fields in the future, too, and thus make a great contribution to international peace and security and the establishment of an equal and fair international order.
The Russian Federation side expressed deep thanks to the DPRK for extending full support and solidarity to the stand of the Russian government and people on the special military operation in Ukraine.
Both sides expressed serious concern over the negative influence of the U.S. and its allied forces' irresponsible and unjust provocative acts, which seriously threaten the security environment of the Korean peninsula and the sovereign right and security interests of the DPRK in particular, on the peace and security of the region and the rest of the world, and agreed to deal with the regional situation through close cooperation and concerted action of foreign policy bodies of the two countries based on the spirit of the UN Charter and other international laws.
The DPRK foreign minister's successful visit to the Russian Federation, which was held as part of the practical implementation of the agreement reached at the historic DPRK-Russia summit in September 2023, serves as an important step for promoting the reliable development of the strategic and future-oriented DPRK-Russia relations.
The DPRK government warmly welcomes President Putin to visit Pyongyang and is ready to greet the Korean people's closest friend with the greatest sincerity.
The traditional relations of friendship and cooperation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation, which have been consolidated in all trials and storms of history, will steadily develop into the invincible comradely relations and the eternal strategic relations under the deep friendship and special care of Kim Jong Un , president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Vladimir Putin, president of the Russian Federation. -0-"

Tehran, IRNA -- Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has announced that the number of its military advisors martyred in a terrorist attack by the Israeli regime in Syria has risen to five.
The IRGC made the announcement on Saturday evening, saying that the fifth military advisor, Mohammad Amin Samadi, died of his wounds sustained in the attack.
The four other martyrs include Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi and Saeed Karimi. The IRGC announced their martyrdom earlier on Saturday.
The Iranian military advisors and several Syrian forces lost their lives after the Israeli regime conducted an airstrike on a residential building in a neighborhood of the capital Damascus earlier in the day.
The strike came days after the IRGC fired ballistic missiles at Syrian bases of terrorists involved in recent terror attacks in Iran, as well as an Israeli espionage center in Iraq's northern Kurdistan region.
The IRGC had said in a statement that the center of the Zionist regime's Mossad spy agency was totally destroyed in the strike in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region.

Tehran, IRNA -- The Islamic Resistance of Iraq has announced that it had targeted the US Ain al-Asad base in western Iraq by a large number of rockets.
According to the Iraqi sources on Saturday, the Iraqi Islamic Resistance claimed responsibility for the attack on the illegal US Ain al-Asad base in western Iraq.
Resistance groups based in Iraq have repeatedly hit US bases on Iraqi and Syrian territories with missiles and drones over the past weeks in retaliation for the Israeli regime's crimes against Palestinians in Gaza.
The groups are also outraged at the US military presence in the region, which they see as a source of instability, as well as Washington's support for the Israeli regime in its ongoing war on Gaza.
Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq Secretary General Qais al-Khazali said on X, formerly Twitter, that in clear violation of Iraq's sovereignty, the American enemy targets the facilities, headquarters of the military, security forces, and Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in different parts of the country, resulting in a large number of Iraqi citizens killed and wounded.
Due to such crimes, the existence of American forces in Iraq and throughout the region is a threat to the countries' sovereignty and dignity, he said, adding that it should be used all tools to expel American enemies.

2WAM8JM3UR_9PWVQHU0UEZ24D9,"Airfields are disappearing, suggesting a shift to drones",_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2024/dprk-240120-rfa01.htm,"Satellite imagery shows 9 airfields have vanished or been converted into farms or horseback-riding fields.
By Cheon Soram and Han Dukin for RFA Korean 2024.01.20 -- Satellite imagery reveals that North Korea has demolished or repurposed nine runways or airfields, a move that experts say could signal a shift away from manned aircraft in favor of missiles and drones.
Four of the airfields were found to have been converted into parks for horseback-riding - a hobby of supreme leader Kim Jong Un - or property with other buildings, images show.
Other airfields were transformed into greenhouse farms for vegetables.
Uiju airfield in North Pyongan province, meanwhile, is being used as a coronavirus quarantine center, and Kumgang Airport in Kangwon province has been neglected to the point where no trace of the runway can be found.
Without clear indications about what is behind the changes, experts are seeking to discern the motives and strategies at work.
""I think North Korea first decided to reduce the importance of its military aircraft because of their vulnerability, and initially transitioned heavily to ballistic missiles,"" Bruce Bennett, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based RAND Corporation told RFA Korean. ""Now the North has been adding cruise missiles and drones.""
While Pyongyang has not abandoned its pursuits in aviation, ""it has certainly downgraded them, especially commercial aviation and the dispersal airfields for its combat aircraft,"" Bennett said.
North Korea could be reducing its reliance on its outdated aircraft, said Bruce Songhak Chung, a researcher at the South Korea-based Korean Institute for Security and Strategy, told Radio Free Asia.
North Korea may be intending to concentrate its dispersed air power, said Yang Uk, a research Fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in South Korea.
""Airfields and runways are disappearing in North Korea, but General Secretary Kim Jong Un knows how important air power is, so this could be a process of modernization,"" he said. ""It is quite possible that they are now seriously preparing to dispose of outdated aircraft, strengthening existing power, or introducing a new strategy.""
Yang also said that the possibility of introducing additional aircraft with Russia's help cannot be ruled out as North Korea strengthens military cooperation with Russia.
Changes to specific aircraft seem to point to this, said Cho Han Bum, a senior researcher at the South Korea-based Korea Institute for National Unification.
""We have detected evidence at Pyongyang International Airport that the IL-76 [Ilyushin-76] aircraft are being converted into early warning aircraft, but this is impossible without Russia's help,"" said Cho. "" There is a possibility that the relationship between Russia and North Korea will accelerate significantly in 2024.""
Drone power
North Korea may be trying to strengthen its asymmetric power, such as nuclear weapons and missiles, and replace its aging jets with drones or other unmanned aerial vehicles.
""The Kim Jong Un regime is trying to diversify its threats to attract more international attention,"" said Bennett. ""It is a big possibility that North Korea, having seen Russia use drones in the war in Ukraine, will develop them and use them for provocations against South Korea.""
Kim showed great interest in attack drones during his visit to the military exhibition hall in Vladivostok, during the North Korea-Russia summit in September.
He received five suicide drones - attack aircraft not designed to return to base - and one surveillance drone as gifts from the governor of Primorsky Krai.
In addition, the North Korean military unveiled the Saetbyol-4 strategic unmanned surveillance aircraft and the Saetbyol-9 attack drone last year. The military was also seen training with new drones in frontline areas.
Unmanned aerial vehicles are advantageous in that they can take off and land on narrow and shorter runways than regular fighter planes.
""It depends on the type [of drone],"" Yang said. ""The quadcopter does not need a separate space for loading and unloading. For fixed wing drones, you may need a runway, but it varies depending on the size.""
He said the Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 can take off and land on normal or slightly shorter-sized runways, but the drones smaller than these can be launched from the ground or on trucks.
Drones have been actively used in Russia's war in Ukraine and in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. North Korea has also experimented with drones.
In December 2022, five North Korean drones crossed the Military Demarcation Line into South Korean territory.
In that incident, the drones crossed into areas to the north and northwest of Seoul, including over the cities of Gimpo and  Paju, and also over Ganghwa Island, in the Yellow Sea. It was later revealed that some drones even flew into the airspace around the presidential office in Seoul's Yongsan district.
The three airfields that appear to be converted into horseback riding parks are Wonsan in Gangwon Province, Mount Myohyang in Jagang province, and Sinchon Airfield in South Hwanghae province, experts say.
Three airfields that now seem to be greenhouse farms include Yeonpo in South Hamgyong province, Kyongsong in North Hamgyong province, and Kangdong in Pyongyang.
Limited capabilities
Evaluations of North Korea's drone technology have drawn mixed results.
The North Korean drones that infiltrated South Korea in 2022 were Chinese-made commercial drones, Yang said, making it difficult to view them as indicative of North Korea's technological capabilities.
The level of strategic threat is low because real-time control is not possible,"" he said. ""Even if they were converted to attack, there is a limited number of bombs that could be loaded on them.
On the other hand, Kim Tae Woo, the president at the Korea Institute for National Unification, noted that if North Korean drones can infiltrate South Korean airspace, they can also be used for attacks at any time and pose a potential threat.
""For example, even if a small can of anthrax, a biochemical weapon, is carried and detonated over Seoul, it would be a huge catastrophe,"" said Kim. ""As drones become larger and develop increased capacity, small nuclear warheads can be attached to them.""
He said that even a simple surveillance mission is threatening to South Korea.
""But if a drone is made to self-destruct and it is loaded with biochemical substances or nuclear warheads, it poses a huge threat to South Korea,"" said Kim.
However, replacing the combat power of an air force with unmanned aerial vehicles is impossible, Yang said.
""The question is to what extent North Korea can expand its unmanned aerial vehicles,"" he said. ""In the end, I think North Korea will find its own optimal solution by looking at the cases used in the recent war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war.""

China has been making active efforts to ease the tension in the Red Sea from the very beginning, calling for an end to the attacks on civilian ships and urging relevant parties to avoid adding fuel to the tension in the Red Sea, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in an interview with the media after concluding his trip to Africa.
Wang also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, had recently concluded his visits to Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire from January 13 to 18.
During his visit to Africa, Wang said he communicated and coordinated with the Arab side on dealing with the spillover effects of the Gaza conflict, especially in maintaining the security of the Red Sea shipping route.
""We should jointly uphold the security on the sea lanes of the Red Sea in accordance with the law and also respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries along the Red Sea coast, including Yemen,"" Wang said during the interview with Chinese media on Friday.
Additionally, Wang held in-depth communication with Egypt, Tunisia, and the League of Arab States Secretary-General on the Palestinian question. Wang said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for over a hundred days, resulting in large-scale casualties among innocent civilians and a severe humanitarian crisis.
China has actively advocated and strongly condemned all acts that harm civilians, opposed any practices that violate international law, and supported all efforts aimed at preventing the escalation of the conflict and promoting the restoration of peace.
Arab and Islamic countries highly appreciate China's position. The ordinary people we encountered on the streets also praised China's just stance and hoped that China would continue to promote a ceasefire and alleviate the humanitarian crisis, Wang noted.
The Chinese foreign minister underscored that the Palestinian question has always been at the core of the Middle East issue, which is related to the peace and stability of the Middle East and challenges human moral conscience.
China firmly supports the just cause of the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights and firmly supports the long-cherished wish of the Palestinians to achieve independent statehood. Justice may be delayed, but it should not be absent forever, he said.
China also calls for the convening of a more extensive, larger-scale, and more effective international conference as soon as possible.
Regardless of how the regional and international situation changes, China will continue to firmly stand on the side of peace and justice and make unremitting efforts to promote security and stability in the Middle East, Wang said."

Saturday, 20 January 2024 1:37 PM
Lebanon's media outlets say 2 members of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas have been killed in an Israeli drone strike targeting a car in the south of the country.
The media outlets, citing local sources, reported that the strike was carried out on Saturday afternoon as the vehicle was traveling along a road linking the Bazourieh area to Burj el-Shemali region in the southern district of Tyre.
The Israeli drone attack came amid strikes by fighters from Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah against Israeli military positions in response to the ongoing Israeli genocidal campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip.
It has been a string of assassinations by the regime in the recent past.
On January 2, senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was assassinated in a ""treacherous Zionist strike"" on Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh, the Gaza-based resistance movement announced on its official channel. Hamas politburo member Izzat al-Rishq called it a ""cowardly assassination.""
Arouri was known to be deeply involved in Hamas' military affairs. He had previously headed the group in the occupied West Bank.
Also on Saturday, an Israeli military aircraft targeted a house in Marwahin town on the border with the 1948-occupied territories.
Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that the building has been repeatedly bombed as cross-border fighting has escalated since the start of Israel's hostilities in Gaza early October.
Israeli fighter jets, meanwhile, carried out a wave of airstrikes against Odaisseh village in southern Lebanon.
The Israeli military alleged in a statement that the attacks targeted an observation post, a rocket launch position and other infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah.
Israeli artillery shelling also targeted the outskirts of Alma al-Shaab and al-Dhayra villages as well as the Marjeyoun plain and the Hamames hill.
Hezbollah strikes Israeli outposts in solidarity with Gaza
For its part, Hezbollah announced an attack on Israeli forces stationed at an outpost in the town of Zar'it, close to the border with Lebanon.
Lebanese resistance fighters also targeted gatherings of Israeli troops at the Hounine and Dhayra areas.
The Israeli regime launched its devastating hostilities in the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023, after the Hamas-led Palestinian resistance groups carried out surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity.
The Israeli military has also been carrying out attacks against the Lebanese territory since then, prompting retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah. The movement has vowed to keep up retaliatory operations as long as the regime continues its onslaught on Gaza.
The regime has killed more than 24,700 people, most of them women and children, in Gaza since."

Tehran, IRNA -- Major General Yahya Rasoul, the spokesman for the Commander-in-Chief of the Iraqi Armed soldiers, has said that the reports that spoke about the entry of additional foreign forces into Iraq are not true.
Work on the joint committee between Iraq and the international coalition to schedule the coalition's withdrawal from Iraq and reconsider the nature of the relationship in general is about to be activated imminently, Rasoul said on Saturday, local media reported.
He stressed that no foreign soldiers are required on the Iraqi soil.
The foreign presence in Iraq is gradually coming to an end, the official added.
Iraqi officials argue that the role of the international coalition is limited to training and consulting.

4FLSTRMZQW_BZYUMXM3KXU9K6S,Russian Parliament To Consider Seizing Property Of Citizens Who Criticize War,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/01/russia-240120-rferl02.htm,"By RFE/RL January 20, 2024
The head of Russia's parliament said he plans to submit legislation next week that would allow the state to seize the property of ""scoundrels"" who criticize the war in Ukraine.
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Duma, an institution controlled by the Kremlin, said he planned to submit the bill on January 22.
""Anyone who tries to destroy Russia, betray it, must be accordingly punished and compensate the state with their property for the damage caused,"" he said in a Telegram post on January 20.
The bill, if passed, would be the latest in a series of harsh measures aimed at stifling any dissent inside Russia as it struggles on the battlefield in Ukraine.
The bill comes less than two months before Russia holds presidential elections that incumbent Vladimir Putin is expected to easily win.
Public frustration with the war, which has killed at least 42,000 Russian soldiers and seriously injured tens of thousands of more, has been growing as Russia makes little progress.
Wives and mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine have staged small-scale protests in recent months demanding their loved ones be demobilized.
In the weeks following the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin signed into law bills criminalizing any criticism of the Russian armed forces and the war in Ukraine.
Those convicted of such ""crimes,"" which can be anything that does not adhere to the official state narrative about the war, face up to 15 years in prison.
Russia has opened more than 350 cases into alleged ""discreditation"" of the army or spreading ""false"" information.
Putin last year increased the maximum punishment for ""treason"" to life in prison. Russia last year opened a record number of treason cases since the fall of the Soviet Union, including one against a high-school student.
In his Telegram statement denouncing ""scoundrels,"" Volodin singled out Russian cultural figures in particular. The law also includes a provision to strip Russian citizens of any state awards, a likely direct attack on prominent cultural figures.
Some of Russia's leading musicians and artists, including Soviet-era pop star Alla Pugacheva, have publicly come out against the invasion of Ukraine. Such cultural critics have largely relocated abroad amid fear of prosecution.
Russia will hold presidential elections on March 15-17. The vote is largely for show as the result is predetermined, experts say.
The Kremlin has jailed the most prominent opposition figures and banned others from running against Putin, who is seeking his fifth term as president.

Pakistan has announced a complete restoration of diplomatic relations with Iran following an unprecedented escalation of cross-border tensions over counterterrorism operations.
Tehran-ISNA- The announcement was made on Friday after caretaker Prime Minister Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar of Pakistan held an emergency security meeting with the military and intelligence chiefs to discuss the recent turbulences.
Pakistan's media reports said Islamabad agreed to resume its full level of diplomatic relations with Iran and that the ambassadors of Iran and Pakistan will soon be sent to their missions.
Kakar on Friday said that it was in the interest of both Iran and Pakistan to take steps to restore their relationship to the levels before the recent tensions.
The prime minister said that it was ""in the interest of both countries to take steps to restore the relationship to what it was prior to Jan. 16.""
Kakar added that Pakistan would ""welcome and reciprocate all positive measures from the Iranian side"" in the above regard.
He said Pakistan and Iran were ""two brotherly countries that have historically enjoyed fraternal and cooperative relations marked by respect and affection.""
Kakar added that Pakistan was a ""law-abiding and peace-loving country"" that sought friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, particularly its neighbors.
Earlier in the day, Pakistani Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian held a phone conversation, calling for closer cooperation in various fields, including fighting terrorism and boosting border security.
""Jilani expressed Pakistan's readiness to work with Iran on all issues based on [a] spirit of mutual trust and cooperation,"" said a statement by Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. ""He underscored the need for closer cooperation on security issues.""
The Iranian foreign minister also said in a statement that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan is of ""great concern to us and it is imperative that the two countries work together to neutralize and destroy terrorist camps in Pakistan.""
Pointing to the recent Iranian operation against the Jaish ul-Adl terrorist group in Pakistan, Amir-Abdollahian said the operation was carried out to neutralize an imminent terrorist threat.
On January 16, the Islamic Republic launched simultaneous drone and missile attacks on two bases of Jaish ul-Adl, a terror outfit that was formed in 2012 and has conducted several attacks on Iranian soil in recent years.
The group claimed responsibility for an attack in December 2023 on a police station in the southeastern city of Rask that killed at least 11 Iranian police officers. On January 10, another attack by the group on a police station in the city killed one officer.
Pakistan carried out strikes on Thursday against what it called bases of the separatist Baloch Liberation Front and Baloch Liberation Army in regions close to Iran's border, with Tehran condemning the attack as unacceptable and unbalanced.

Tehran, IRNA -- Deputy Secretary General of Lebanon's Hezbollah Resistance Movement Sheikh Naim Qassem has warned Israel against waging a large-scale war on his country, saying that the regime would receive a heavy slap in the face and a strong response if such a war happened.
""If the Zionist regime decides to expand the war, it will receive a strong slap and an unforgettable lesson, because the enemy knows that the confrontation and [Hezbollah's] response will be very extensive,"" Sheikh Qassem said, according to an Saturday report by the IRNA, citing Elnashra website.
The senior Hezbollah official made the comments after the chief of staff of the Israeli armed forces, Herzi Halevi, said on Wednesday that the likelihood of a war with Lebanon in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.
Sheikh Qassem said that threats against Hezbollah are useless and do not change anything, stressing that the resistance movement is fully prepared if the regime extends the war.
The Hezbollah official also reiterated the movement's support for the Palestinians in Gaza where the Israeli regime has been pressing ahead with its military campaign since early October.
He said that the Israeli regime is the enemy of Palestine, Lebanon, the Arab world and Muslims, adding that Hezbollah continues to back the Palestinian resistance in their fight against the regime.
Sheikh Qassem meanwhile criticized the United States for supporting the Israeli regime in its war on Gaza, saying that the war is going ahead with the greenlight of the US, which is helping Tel Aviv achieve its goals.

A senior official of the Lebanese Hezbollah resistance movement has warned Israel against waging an all-out war on Lebanon, emphasizing that the occupying regime should expect a ""strong slap in the face"" if it underestimates his group's defensive capabilities and commits an act of adventurism.
Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem described Israeli threats against his movement as hollow, saying, ""If the Zionist regime decides to expand the Gaza war, it will receive a strong slap and learn an unforgettable lesson. The enemy knows that the response will be very decisive.""
He added that Hezbollah will continue its strikes against areas in the northern part of the 1948 Israeli-occupied territories as long as the Gaza war continues.
""The enemy must know that we are at the apex of preparedness. We are the men of struggle and martyrdom,"" Sheikh Qassem said.
The top Hezbollah official described the Israeli regime as the enemy of Palestine, Lebanon, the Arab world and Muslims.
""We stand shoulder to shoulder with Palestinian resistance factions against this great oppression. This amounts to supporting Palestine, Lebanon as well as the Axis of Resistance and destroying Israel,"" he said.
Sheikh Qassem also denounced the United States' unconditional support for the Israeli onslaught on the Gaza Strip, stating that the ground and air strikes are ongoing with the green light of Washington.
""The differences between the United States and the Zionist regime are merely tactical. Americans are seeking to advance the agendas of the Zionist regime. Assertions that Washington cannot stop the Gaza war and that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is opposed to its cessation are simply crude attempts to escape responsibility in this conflict,"" the high-ranking Hezbollah official said.
He stressed the need for the immediate stoppage of Israeli attacks on Gaza, noting that stability in Lebanon and the West Asia region will be restored once the Tel Aviv regime's brutalities in the Palestinian coastal region end.
The Israeli regime launched its devastating hostilities in the Gaza Strip on October 7 after the territory's Hamas-led Palestinian resistance groups carried out a surprise retaliatory attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, against the occupying entity.
The Israeli military has also been carrying out attacks against the Lebanese territory since then, prompting retaliatory strikes from Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah in support of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.
The movement has vowed to keep up its retaliatory operations as long as the Tel Aviv regime continues its onslaught on Gaza.
The Israeli campaign in Gaza has killed at least 24,762 people, most of them women and children. Another 62,108 individuals have also been wounded."

Tehran, IRNA -- After two days, an American official confirmed that a US MQ-9 Reaper drone crashed near Balad Air Base in the north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
According to the Iraqi Alsumaria TV network, the US defense official said on condition of anonymity that the drone crashed on Thursday afternoon local time.
Pointing to the issue that the drone was recovered by Iraqi security forces, the American official said that it is unclear if the damaged drone has been returned to US custody yet and if the drone crashed or if it was shot down, so authorities continue to investigate the reason behind the incident.
Earlier, some armed Iraqi groups announced that they had shot down a US MQ-9 drone, which was used for spying and bombing purposes, over Iraqi airspace.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq also published a breaking news on its Telegram channel on Saturday and announced the downing of another unidentified UAV in Iraq. The umbrella group of Iraqi anti-terror fighters has not published any information about the details of the incident yet.
On Friday night, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq also issued a statement and took responsibility for shooting down an American drone in eastern Iraq. The downed UVA was flying from Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait towards Diyala Governorate in eastern Iraq.
Following the onset of the Israeli regime's aggression against the Gaza Strip on October 7, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq conducted numerous attacks on the US military bases in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for Washington's all-out support for the Israeli crimes in the war.

The rapid breakdown of a Beijing-mediated cease-fire in northern Myanmar has exposed the limits of Chinese influence in the region, even as it seeks to turn recent military gains by a rebel alliance to its advantage.
The ""Haigeng agreement,"" announced January 12, was less than a day old when witnesses reported widespread gunfire in northern Shan state, bordering China.
The rebel Three Brotherhood Alliance â comprising the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army or MNDAA, the Arakan Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army â released a statement the day after the talks, accusing the military of launching attacks at multiple locations.
The largest took place near Kyaukme, a small but bustling town along the Mandalay-Lashio Road in a mountainous area near China's southwestern border. The area has long been a trade route between the two countries and has seen significant infrastructure investment by China in recent years.
A humanitarian assistance worker in Kyaukme, speaking anonymously for security reasons, told VOA this week that he could hear the hourslong gunbattle the morning after the cease-fire. ""It was a shootout in Kyaukme,"" he said. ""Civilians started fleeing for safety as the attacks were coming from both sides of town.""
An updated statement from the alliance nearly a week later described continuing attacks by the Myanmar military, including 16 airstrikes on villages in northern Shan state. Witnesses on the ground have confirmed the use of airstrikes to VOA by phone.
The alliance statement blamed the military for the failure of the cease-fire, which grew out of the third attempt at dialogue since December, largely with China as mediator.
""From the day the 'Haigeng agreement' was reached until today, our side has been in compliance,"" the statement read. ""We have been patient and showed restraint by not engaging in battle. Otherwise, we would have already implemented operational targets and city-occupation battles that had been planned before the cease-fire.""
The reports of cease-fire violations belied remarks made earlier by junta spokesperson Major General Zaw Min Tun.
""We have plans to further discuss and strengthen the cease-fire agreement,"" he said immediately after last week's announcement. ""We will engage in further discussions between Myanmar and China to reopen border trade zones.""
VOA has been unable to reach the junta spokesperson's office for a response to the alliance statement. As of Friday, there had been no official statement from the junta regarding the latest developments.
China's interest in trade routes
According to Than Soe Naing, a China-Myanmar expert and former member of the Communist Party of Burma, Beijing's primary interest in peace talks lies in its desire to reopen trade routes between Myanmar and China's Yunnan state.
""The Chinese perspective suggests that dealing with cities on the trade route between China and inland cities like Mandalay, such as the town of Lashio, with a similar approach as the one taken with the Laukkai matter, could potentially open up the trade route,"" Naing said. However, he added, ""whether the military junta will accept such intervention is doubtful. If Lashio is filled with military forces, there will certainly be fierce battles.""
Laukkai, a border town that is infamous for gambling, prostitution and cybercrime, was captured by the Three Brotherhood Alliance on January 5 as part of a successful offensive begun in October and known as the ""1027"" operation. The alliance established a special regional self-government in the town this week.
""China would also encourage this kind of development in Lashio,"" Naing suggested. Lashio is the largest town in northern Shan state and lies at what was once the end of the ""Burma road,"" a historically significant thoroughfare connecting Lashio to southeast China's Yunnan state. It is also the site of a large military base, which is thought to be one of the alliance's next targets.
""The main reason [the Three Brotherhood Alliance] agreed to the cease-fire was their hope to come to some sort of compromise on Lashio's capture,"" Naing said. ""A forceful occupation of Lashio would lead to extensive fighting and turmoil in the region; a military withdrawal would avoid that.""
Jason Tower, the country director for the Myanmar program at the U.S. Institute of Peace, told VOA he believed China was looking for a compromise in which the junta would concede some territory in the north while the alliance would roll back some of its war aims.
""I think what [China] ultimately hopes for is that the military will pull back from some of these territories, and to make the case as to why the brotherhood should stop its movement to eradicate military dictatorship and instead focus on working with the military to stabilize the situation, especially for Chinese projects,"" Tower said this week.
""I think where things are interesting is that the military does not want to give up control and give up a strong presence in the north of Shan state and wants to try to retain some of the positions that it still has.""
China has invested in several infrastructure projects in the area, such as the Upper Yeywa hydroelectric dam on the Shweli River, which has remained uncompleted since before an earlier military government ceded power to a civilian government in 2015. The current junta restarted the project.
China playing both sides
""The Chinese side is both helping the brotherhood to make some advances toward more narrow political objectives, but also helping the military by putting pressure on the brotherhood at the same time,"" Tower said.
""China presently is, at least in the northern part of the country, favoring the brotherhood to take over control of territories in the immediate border area,"" he continued.
""However, it's also putting a lot of pressure on the brotherhood to do business with the military ... and to limit its involvement in broader revolutionary activity, pushing the brotherhood to limit its dealings"" with a shadow government comprising members of Aung San Suu Kyi's ousted democratic administration and associated military forces.
The Chinese are still doing business with the military, Tower said, citing as an example a deep-water port project in Rakhine state known as the Kyaukphyu project. These are ""things that a more responsible Myanmar government would not sign on to,"" he said. ""The Myanmar military is useful to China for doing those sorts of things.""
Hla Kyaw Zaw, a Burma-China scholar based in China, told VOA that Beijing's policy generally ""is to be open to all sides.""
""In the case of Sudan, for example, the Chinese government has good relations with both sides of the conflict. They were able to convince both sides to cease fighting so it could evacuate its embassy staff.
""They deal with various groups in every country. In the case of Myanmar, China is mainly dealing with the military junta that is currently in power, just as it is also dealing with the ethnic armed groups to serve its own purposes.""
From cybercrime crackdown to energy security
China also hopes that by stabilizing the border region it can more effectively pursue its fight against cybercrime, which is prevalent in the Kokang region and mostly targets Chinese citizens. With the success of the ""1027"" operation in the region, Beijing sees an opportunity to work with the Three Brotherhood Alliance to go after the scam artists.
""I think the Chinese side is satisfied enough"" with control of the region by the alliance, China-Myanmar expert Than Soe Naing said in an interview. ""China aims to reopen trading posts and has expressed contentment with the North Shan region being in the hands of the MNDAA,"" one of the three alliance members.
Naing added that China ""recognizes the fact that cybercriminal gangs have been protected by the Burmese military, making it harder for China to stop these gangs from targeting victims in China."" The Myanmar military claims to have been working with the Chinese government ""to eradicate online fraud,"" according to its spokesperson, Major General Zaw Min Tun.
Tower said that China's interest in the region ""is certainly much bigger than just cracking down on criminal activity.""
""The bigger interest here is China's energy security, because you have the single source of piped natural gas to China, in the form of the Chinese-Myanmar pipeline project, which is now supplying gas to four Chinese provinces in the southwest and contributes significantly to Yunnan's gross domestic product,"" he said.
""This is another reason why China is pushing the brotherhood alliance to disengage with broader revolutionary activity and to deal with the Myanmar military."""

Biden told reporters they discussed possible paths for an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a non-militarized government. Biden said Netanyahu was not opposed to all two-state solutions, noting that some UN members do not have armies.	A source familiar with the phone call told CNN that Netanyahu told Biden that when he made a statement seemingly rejecting any Palestinian state was not meant to prevent such a possibility from ever occurring. 	Netanyahu publicly responded to Biden claiming that he actually told the president that ""Palestinian independence clashes with Israel's security need for control of the Gaza Strip.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he would not give up full Israeli security control over all the lands west of Jordan. Netanyahu had said that Israel would maintain its security control over the Gaza Strip, after eliminating the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), stressing that security control is to ensure that Gaza does not pose any future security threat to Israel.
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office denied what CNN reported about Netanyahu's commitment to the Palestinian state, during his call with US President Joe Biden, stressing that Netanyahu repeated to Biden his firm position regarding the Palestinian state. Biden had confirmed that Netanyahu did not oppose the issue, pointing out that the two-state solution was not impossible with Netanyahu in power. The US President's statements came after his first call with the Israeli Prime Minister in about a month, during which they discussed the issue of the two-state solution.
The Associated Press quoted American officials as saying that Biden's frustration with Netanyahu during their recent call had become more apparent. In this context, the Palestinian presidency called on the United States to recognize the State of Palestine and not just talk about a two-state solution, stressing that the Palestinian people will not give up their legitimate rights, Jerusalem and its sanctities, and the establishment of their independent Palestinian state, no matter how long it takes. The statement published by the Palestinian News Agency (Wafa) said that the occupation government still refuses to acknowledge the fact that peace will not be achieved without the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
On the 106th day of the Israeli war in the Gaza Strip , Israeli bombing and fierce clashes continued between the Palestinian resistance and the occupation forces in various areas of the Gaza Strip.  In the West Bank, the IDF raided several areas there, and settlers continued their attacks on Palestinian citizens for the second day in a row. In the axes supporting the Palestinian resistance in Gaza, the Ain al-Assad base, which houses American forces in Iraq, was bombed with dozens of missiles, while the Lebanese Hezbollah announced that it had targeted many Israeli sites. As for Yemen, an American bombing targeted a Houthi anti-ship missile in the Gulf of Aden.
In several European countries, massive demonstrations took place in solidarity with Gaza, calling for an end to  the Israeli aggression against the Strip, which has continued since the seventh of last October.
A member of the South African advisory group before  the International Court of Justice said  that the team expects a ruling on the case against Israel within a week.

Operational Update   		  The Israeli military questions the authenticity of The New York Times report, which cites Israeli commanders who have complained about the IDF's failures in the Gaza Strip. The New York Times reported  that doubts have been raised by the Israeli military's high command regarding the feasibility of their objectives in Gaza, particularly in light of the limited progress in their proclaimed objective of ""uprooting"" Hamas from the Gaza Strip.  		  According to the report, Israel was unable to meet its goals of occupying large areas of the Gaza Strip and has had to settle for less than it had originally planned, which raised concerns among some commanders regarding the effectiveness of the Israeli war cabinet's strategy. The slow pace of the operation has led to private expressions of frustration among some Israeli commanders, according to NYT. The report suggests that some commanders are contemplating prioritizing the retrieval of Israeli captives held by the Palestinian Resistance, at the cost of backing away from the political command's goal of ""dismantling"" the Palestinian Resistance.  		  The Resistance's expansive tunnel network has proven to be an intricate maze, filled with booby traps that have cost Israeli special forces heavy losses since the ground invasion into the Gaza Strip was initiated. In fact, the Resistance's tunnels have been the main focus of the occupation's military, as they are regarded to be essential strategic infrastructure to the Palestinian Resistance's work. Despite the goal of destroying the tunnel network, the Israeli military has not succeeded. Brigade after brigade attempted to crack the puzzle but failed. This includes multiple Combat Engineering Brigades and the Yahalom Special Comabt Engineering Unit, whose ranks have been substantially reduced.  		  NYT also points to a reality that has contradicted the occupation's timeframe. Essentially, the IDF had expected to take ""full control"" of major cities in the Gaza Strip, such as Gaza City, Khan Younis, and Rafah by late December. According to the report, ""Israel"" is yet to even launch a ground invasion into Rafah, while it faces mounting difficulties in Khan Younis. Moreover, the IDF has also failed to ""eliminate"" many of the Resistance leaders that it had vowed to kill, including Yahya al-Sinwar, Mohammad Deif, Marwan Issa, and others.  		  The Israeli military command responded to the testimonies of several commanders given to NYT by saying that the sources were ""not known"" to the military and ""do not reflect"" its position.  		    		  Military expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi said that the Israeli occupation army began a broader ground operation north of Gaza in implementation of the warnings of Prime Minister Herzi Halevy a few days ago, in which he spoke about the possibility of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) rebuilding its combat strength. Halevy had confirmed a few days ago that Hamas is capable of rebuilding its combat capabilities in the north, indicating that this matter may require implementing a broader operation than the previous one.  		  According to Al-Duwairi, Israel began this broader operation that the Chief of Staff spoke about, as the occupation forces attacked the Al-Daraj and Al-Tuffah neighborhoods during the past 48 hours with a force consisting of an armor battalion supported by the Nahal battalion, an artillery company, and an engineering effort, a force approaching an entire brigade.  		  Currently, fighting is raging in the northern sector, extending from Street 10 to the fence area, as Israeli forces are trying to penetrate the Tawam and Intelligence Towers areas, but they are taking place to a lesser extent than at the beginning of the ground operations, according to Al-Duwairi. Israel also pushed a similar force into the Jabalia area, but Al-Duwairi said that it is difficult to know whether this is a new force or whether the force that tried to penetrate into the north during the past two days failed to achieve any goal and was directed to another area.  		  Regarding the resistances handling of this new attack, Al-Duwairi said that it will continue to rely on the idea of lone wolves that surprise the forces in a specific place and time according to the available information.      		    		    		  In the northern axis of the Gaza Strip, the Al-Qassam Brigades said that they repelled incursion attempts by the occupation forces and targeted their vehicles in the Al-Jaabari camp. Jabalia also witnessed Israeli bombardment focused on the Tal al-Zaatar area and the Tal al-Salatin area in Beit Lahia, where martyrs and wounded were recorded. In Gaza City, confrontations took place during which the Al-Quds Brigades were able to snipe soldiers. The Brigades also announced that a number of military vehicles had been trapped in what it called a carefully engineered ambush with high-explosive devices east of Gaza, which resulted in soldiers being killed and wounded.  		  Al-Aqsa satellite channel said that violent clashes have been taking place for hours between the Palestinian resistance and the Israeli occupation forces in the Karama and Intelligence Towers areas west of Gaza City. The IDF artillery fired heavy flares into the airspace of Gaza City in conjunction with the clashes, while the occupation aircraft continued to launch air strikes on residential neighborhoods.      		  In the central region, fierce confrontations took place, whether in the Nuseirat camp, where the Al-Quds Brigades destroyed a Merkava tank, or the Bureij camp, where the Al-Qassam Brigades said they bombed Israeli army positions with heavy-caliber shells. A scene was also repeated in Al-Maghazi camp, which witnessed intense clashes.  		  To the south, Khan Yunis was subjected to Israeli bombing, resulting in martyrs. The city of Rafah was also subjected to a raid that targeted a car, resulting in 4 martyrs. Khan Yunis is also the center of gravity in the southern region, where strong confrontations took place, as the Al-Qassam Brigades and the Al-Quds Brigades announced the bombing of sites where Israeli forces were stationed.  		  Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets on the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, bearing pictures of Israelis detained in the Gaza Strip, and called on the Palestinians to inform the Israeli army if they recognized any of them. On the other hand, the Israeli army announced that 16 soldiers were wounded in the Gaza battles.   		  It also announced that it had discovered and destroyed a number of rocket launchers equipped with long-range missiles in the northern Gaza Strip, in addition to destroying a missile manufacturing facility belonging to the Islamic Jihad movement. The Israeli army also announced that its soldiers found dozens of war machines and explosive materials used in manufacturing missiles and that they were destroyed.  		  The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported on its page on the X website that 800,000 Palestinians in Gaza are suffering from a scarcity of basic materials, as Israel continues its siege of the Strip and prevents the arrival of aid.    		  The Israeli military expert, Alon Ben David, expressed the astonishment of the Israeli occupation army and the Shin Bet at the enormous size of military industries in the Gaza Strip. This astonishment was even doubled with the discovery of the unimaginable scope of Hamas capabilities to produce weapons and underground infrastructure. The expert pointed out to the Hebrew newspaper Maariv, Hamas's endless capabilities in strengthening its ranks with new people. The Israeli military expert added that the coming days will witness the end of the intense phase of fighting in Gaza, and the beginning of a new phase characterized by the same amount of challenge.  		  Alon Ben David explained that the 98th Division of the Israeli occupation army will end its operations in Khan Yunis, south of Gaza, while the army hopes that its forces will be able to achieve an achievement from this operation, represented by reaching the leadership of the Hamas movement or releasing the Zionist detainees, but achieving these goals Unsecured.  		  The expert believes that after controlling Khan Yunis, the occupation army will have operational control over about 80% of the territory of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of the Rafah area, the Nuseirat camp, and the city of Deir al-Balah. Most of the forces will leave, but some of them will remain, and will continue to divide the sector between north and south. He pointed out that 90% of Hamas's military capabilities are produced inside Gaza, in addition to the local production of advanced RPG launchers and drones.  		  Alon Ben David claimed that a very small portion of weapons reaches the Gaza Strip by smuggling through Egypt, and therefore the current challenge for the occupying army in the coming years is to destroy the huge quantities of Hamas weapons and dismantle its ability to manufacture military industries, warning of the movements ability. It continues to support its ranks with new people.      		    		    		    		    		    		    		  In the occupied West Bank, settlers attacked Palestinian farmers near the village of Ramoun, wounding some of them. They also continued their attacks on Palestinian shepherds and farmers in Masafer Yatta, threatening them with displacement. Israeli forces stormed - at dawn on Saturday - Balata camp, east of Nablus in the West Bank.  		  The Palestinian News Agency ""Wafa"" reported the outbreak of ""violent confrontations with the occupation forces, who stormed several neighborhoods in the camp, led by a military bulldozer that carried out acts of sabotage on the internal roads. The occupation soldiers also raided several homes and tampered with their contents."" Later, Israeli forces sent military reinforcements to the camp, amid continuing violent clashes.  		  The Israeli occupation forces also stormed the Al-Dhahr area in the town of Beit Ummar, north of Hebron in the West Bank. The occupation forces set up military barriers. They began searching citizens' vehicles and phones, and assaulted a young man before stopping him.  		  Israeli forces stormed the city of Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank . This was accompanied by an increase in settler attacks on Palestinian villages since the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood and the ongoing Israeli aggression against the besieged Gaza Strip, which led to the displacement of hundreds of Palestinians. Human rights reports also revealed an increase in the number of detainees in the West Bank, and an increase in their abuse in the occupation prisons.  		  Al Jazeera's correspondent reported that the Israeli occupation forces stormed the ""Traffic Circle"" area in Ras Al-Joura in the city of Hebron in the West Bank, and closed all entrances to the area. Earlier, the reporter reported that the occupation forces stormed the city of Yatta, south of Hebron, assaulted citizens and confiscated a number of vehicles.  		  In a related context, a citizen was injured after dozens of settlers attacked Palestinian farmers in the village of Ramoun, east of the city of Ramallah in the West Bank. Local sources said that a group of armed settlers stormed the entrances to the village and - protected by members of the occupation army - attacked Palestinian farmers while they were on their lands located between the villages of Deir Dibwan and Ramon. They attempted to steal sheep and destroy buildings that had been erected by Palestinians about 20 years ago.  		  Settlers also attacked - for the second day in a row - Palestinian citizens in Susya in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron. Settlers prevent sheep herders from reaching their pastures and threaten them with weapons and forcible displacement from their homes. Susiya and other population centers in Masafer Yatta are subjected to continuous attacks by the occupation forces and settlers, but the frequency of attacks has increased significantly since the seventh of last October.  		  In the same context, the National Office for Land Defense and Settlement Resistance revealed that settlers view the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip as a golden opportunity for displacement and ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians in the West Bank. The weekly settlement report explained that settlers are using violence, with the help of the occupation army, to displace Palestinian communities from areas classified as (C). It pointed out that the ""settlers' terrorist practices"" worsened after October 7, 2023, and prompted more than 1,500 Palestinian citizens from at least 25 communities to flee their homes and areas, raising the percentage of those displaced during the past year to three times that of 2022.  		  According to the report, the settlers have turned into military and paramilitary formations in times of war, armed and directed by Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir , financed by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , and receiving clear sponsorship from the state, army and occupation police. Israeli human rights organizations reveal that the current settler violence aimed at displacement is unprecedented in terms of frequency and intensity, especially in the south of Hebron Governorate.  		  The report explained that, in the context of the aggression against the Gaza Strip , terrorist settler groups began to become active in the West Bank, announcing their goals with complete clarity. These are groups of price tag sisters who carry out their activities without restrictions on social media networks and call on Palestinians to immigrate to Jordan.  		  One of these groups is an organization that calls itself Migrate Now and on its Facebook page calls on Palestinians in the West Bank to immigrate to Jordan before it is too late. This page publishes a picture of a map that includes Palestine and part of Jordan, showing parts of Jordanian territory within the new Israeli map, which Smotrich presented in Paris last year, and in the middle of it is the logo of the ""Aragon"" organization known for its criminal history in Palestine.  		  In light of Israel's policy of persecution and its attempt to prevent operations against it in the West Bank, the occupation authorities arrested at least 22 Palestinians from Friday evening until Saturday morning, including children and a woman from Jerusalem. A joint statement by the Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs Authority and the Palestinian Prisoners Club stated that the total number of arrests since October 7 has risen to about 6,115, including those who were arrested from homes and at military checkpoints, those who were forced to surrender themselves under pressure, and those who were held hostage.  		  The arrest campaigns were accompanied by widespread raids and harassment, in addition to widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens homes, the destruction of infrastructure, and the confiscation of money and vehicles. The report indicated that the total number of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons until the end of December 2023 amounted to about 8,800 citizens, including more than 80 female prisoners.  		  Within the framework of the occupations policy of abusing detainees, which has increased in frequency since the Al-Aqsa Flood, the Palestinian Prisoners Club stated in a statement that Megiddo Prison was one of the most prominent prisons in which detainees witnessed the most severe torture and abuse, in addition to what happened in Negev Prison. The statement explained that the detainees were subjected to brutal, systematic and collective torture and abuse.  		  In addition to the brutal and horrific attacks in prison, the prison administration continues its policy of starvation, which has affected their health conditions, in addition to the extreme cold, which has greatly exacerbated their suffering, and the accompanying deprivation of prisoners of sufficient clothing and blankets, in addition to the severe overcrowding that Departments witness it. The report stated that the majority of detainees sleep on the floor, and that no group was exempt from beatings and abuse, including children, in addition to the insults and profanity that the detainee receives during his assault.  		  In light of the attack on the Palestinians by the occupation army and its settlers, the Permanent Representative of Palestine to the United Nations , Riyad Mansour, sent three identical letters to the Secretary-General, António Guterres , the President of the Security Council , and  the  President of the United Nations General Assembly, regarding the continuation of Israel, the occupying power, in Deliberately targeting Palestinian children. The letter stated, ""Children in the Gaza Strip are exposed to killing, wounding, mutilation, starvation, orphanage, displacement, and disease and cold, while children in the West Bank are exposed to persecution and terror by soldiers and colonizers, in addition to being shot, beaten, arrested, and tortured.""  		  Mansour appealed to the international community, including the Security Council, including its Group on Children in Armed Conflict, the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the International Court of Justice  and the International Criminal Court,  to take immediate and very rapid action in accordance with international law.      		  At least 5  Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisers were killed in an air strike on the Mezzeh suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus. The five advisors were killed as a result of what the official Syrian news agency described as an Israeli air aggression targeting a residential building in the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus. Iranian media revealed that the Syrian Quds Force intelligence commander and his deputy were killed during the attack.  		  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard announced the killing of 4 of its military advisors in the Mezzeh area in Damascus, and later confirmed the death of a fifth advisor who succumbed to his wounds. The Revolutionary Guard published the names of the four advisors who were killed immediately: Hojatollah Amidwar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, and Saeed Karimi, noting that two Syrian soldiers were killed in the air strike. Iranian media reported that among the dead were a Syria front intelligence official in the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force and his deputy.  		  Sources told Al Jazeera in Damascus that the targeted building located near the Political Security Division had completely collapsed. Regarding the circumstances of the assassination, the Syrian News Agency said that at 10:20 a.m. local time, Israel carried out an air attack on a residential building in the Mezzeh neighborhood, resulting in the martyrdom of a number of people. The agency added that Syrian air defenses responded to the attack and shot down a number of Israeli missiles.  		  In reactions, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement condemned what it called the Israeli aggression that targeted leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Damascus. The movement said - in a statement - that ""this step expresses the occupation's attempt to export its military failure by expanding the scope of the war,"" as it put it.  		  In Iranian reactions, President Ibrahim Raisi said that Tehran will not leave the Israeli crime unanswered, adding that the Zionist entitys crime violated international decisions and was carried out with the support of the arrogant powers, including Washington. 	  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said that ""the activity of Iranian military advisors in combating terrorism and ensuring the security of the region will continue strongly."" 		    		  In a statement published by its spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, hours after the air strike, the Iranian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned what it called the criminal act carried out by the Zionist entity, and said that the repeated Israeli violations of Syrian sovereignty are a desperate attempt to spread instability and insecurity in the region. The statement also said, In addition to the political, legal and international prosecution of these aggressive and criminal acts, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to respond to the organized terrorism of the false Zionist entity at the appropriate time and place.          		    		  Iraqi media reported that 40 missiles were fired at the Ain al-Asad base, which houses American forces in the Iraqi Anbar Governorate. A security source in the tribal mobilization in Anbar Governorate, west of Baghdad, confirmed that the Ain al-Assad base was targeted with missiles launched from the Al-Baghdadi area, close to the Ain al-Assad base. The source added that the international coalition forces responded by bombing the area from which the missiles were launched with about 18 missiles, without knowing the extent of the losses between the two sides.  		    		  Naim Qassem, Deputy Secretary-General of the Lebanese Hezbollah, said that if the party waits for Israel to finish what it wants in Gaza, the next turn will be for the party in Lebanon. Naeem Qassem added that the partys work in southern Lebanon is a defensive action to support Gaza and Lebanon. On the ground, Lebanese Hezbollah announced that it targeted a gathering of occupation soldiers in the vicinity of the Al-Dhahira site and caused injuries. They also attacked two other gatherings of soldiers in the vicinity of Hunin Castle and Zarit Barracks. For his part, Al Jazeera's correspondent reported that the outskirts of the town of Al-Adisa in southern Lebanon were subjected to two Israeli raids. He said that Israeli artillery also bombed the surroundings of the towns of Yaroun, Aitaroun, and the Marjayoun Plain.  		  The Civil Defense in southern Lebanon said that two people were martyred in an Israeli raid that targeted a car in the town of Al-Bazouriya in the Tire region in southern Lebanon. Al Jazeera's correspondent indicated that a drone bombed a car as it passed through the town of Al-Bazouriyah, which led to the car being completely burned. Ambulance teams transported the victims to the hospital.  		    		    		    		    		      		  US airbase Ain al-Asad in Iraq's western Anbar Province has been targeted by at least 15 missiles, Iraqi news agency Shafaq reported on Saturday, citing a security source. The missiles were launched from the Iraqi city of Albaghdadi, the source said, without giving further information. Yahya Rasool, a spokesman for the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces, told the Iraq News Agency that the bombing injured an Iraqi soldier and caused material damage.  		  ""A number of missiles fell near the headquarters of the 29th Brigade, 7th Division, affiliated with the Al-Jazeera Operations Command, within the Iraqi Ain Al-Assad base, wounding a soldier and causing damage to the headquarters,"" he said. A number of US soldiers are being examined for traumatic brain injuries after ""Iranian-backed militants"" carried out a missile attack on US airbase Al-Assad in western Iraq's Anbar Province, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Sunday, adding that the US is also assessing the damage caused to the base.  		  ""At approximately 6:30 p.m. (Baghdad time) time Jan. 20, multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in Western Iraq targeting al-Assad Airbase. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the bases air defense systems while others impacted on the base. Damage assessments are ongoing. A number of U.S. personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. At least one Iraqi service member was wounded,"" the CENTCOM said on X.   		  Since the beginning of the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the bases of the US-led international coalition in Iraq, as well as US troops in Syria, have come under regular attacks, with armed Shiite groups claiming responsibility in Iraq. However, this attack is reported to be one of the most massive since the the start of the recent turmoil in Gaza.    		    		    		  In Yemen, the US Central Command said that it launched - at dawn on Saturday - an air strike on a Houthi anti-ship missile that was prepared for launch and targeting the Gulf of Aden, adding that the missile represented a threat to commercial ships and US Navy ships in the region, and that it destroyed it in self-defense.  		  ""As part of ongoing efforts to protect freedom of navigation and prevent attacks on maritime vessels, on Jan. 20 at approximately 4 a.m. (Sanaa time), U.S. Central Command forces conducted airstrikes against a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch. U.S. forces determined the missile presented a threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region, and subsequently struck and destroyed the missile in self-defense. This action will make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels.""  		  In a related context, Reuters reported from regional and Iranian sources that commanders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah are in Yemen to help direct and supervise Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The sources said that Iran intensified its arms supplies to the Houthis in the wake of the war in Gaza, and that it provided them with advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles.   Maps   All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.   	  	But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.  	Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.   	Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.               Bystanders   			  Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper revealed that Egypt is taking steps to reach a new agreement, which includes concluding a long truce, through which a number of prisoners from both the Palestinian and Israeli sides will be exchanged. The newspaper quoted informed Egyptian sources as saying that the proposal being consulted on takes into account the interests of various parties, and takes into account the current difficulties and declared positions.  			  The sources indicated that the new proposal will not be a substitute for the comprehensive Egyptian proposal to stop the war and arrangements for the next stage, but rather it will be part of the efforts to create the atmosphere to stop the fighting, alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip, and then move to the next stage. It added that Egypt received positive indicators despite the difficulty of the current situation, but the final crystallization of the agreement is still in the maturation stage, according to the sources.      			    			    			  Several European countries witnessed massive demonstrations in solidarity with  the Gaza Strip  and calling for an end to  the Israeli aggression against the Strip  that has been ongoing since the seventh of last October, which claimed the lives of more than 24,000 martyrs and more than 62,000 wounded, most of whom were children and women.  The Palestinian journalist residing in  Berlin, Majid Al-Zeer, said that the demonstrations that took place today in the German capital, Berlin, have been continuing for 105 consecutive days in victory for the Palestinian right, and 19 other demonstrations were also launched throughout  Germany , as well as in most European countries, in denunciation of the European policy towards the aggression against the Gaza Strip. Gaza.		    During the  Non-Aligned Movement summit in Uganda , United Nations Secretary-General  Antonio Guterres stressed  the necessity of recognizing the right of the Palestinians to build their state, in light of a stream of statements by Israeli officials and ministers who expressed their categorical rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state. Guterres said in his speech at the summit  that ""refusing to accept a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and denying the right of the Palestinian people to establish a state, is unacceptable.""    Axis of Resistance   The Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said: The Al-Aqsa Flood has engraved itself deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has collapsed, and the issue that they worked so long to stifle has returned to the top of all the worlds merits.  In a letter addressed by Sayyed Nasrallah to the Twelfth International Forum,  Gaza: Symbol of Resistance , which was read by Mr. Abdullah Safi al-Din , representative of Hezbollah Lebanon in Tehran : Titled your conference with the slogan Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, and timing it at a crucial historical stage that is going through In which the Palestinian resistance is a major confrontation to the Zionist war of annihilation, it only demonstrates the sense of responsibility of those involved in managing the conference and their blessed call to stand by the Palestinian people, their cause, and their resistance, which requires all of us to have grave responsibilities and constant alert to mobilize the nations capabilities in support of the Palestinian people and in support of their valiant resistance that is being written today. Truly, through its sacrifices, its heroism, the blood of its men, and the steadfastness and steadfastness of its people, it creates the future of the nation, preserves its dignity, and consolidates its strength.  He added that what Israel has lost to date in Gaza in terms of officers and soldiers at the hands of Palestinian resistance groups is many times greater than what it lost in the 1967 War. The Israeli army, which occupied more than 69,000 km2 in the Six-Day War, is being defeated today over part of the Gaza area. It is unable to achieve a goal, declare an occupation, or come close to victory. Rather, it retreats and retreats under the title of moving to a new stage. Therefore, it is natural and correct for the conferences slogan to be Gaza is a symbol of resistance. Gaza today is the symbol because in Gaza there is an honorable, brave and proud resistance.  He explained: Gaza is the symbol because it expresses, through its resistance, the pride, pride, pride, ambitions and hopes of our peoples who are thirsty for pride and victory. If Gaza had not resisted, it would not have been a symbol and symbol of pride. Resistance is what honors its people and the bearers of its banner. Resistance is the secret of pride, the secret of dignity, and the key to victory. Gaza is geographically small, but it is gigantic in its magnificence and heroism. Today, Gaza is more generous, more powerful, and prouder than the entire world.  He said: Since the occupation of Palestine, the enemy and its masters have worked on two paths. The first is the path of legitimizing the occupation internationally and polishing its image and demonstrating it as a model civilized entity that can be emulated as a role model for the region. In the first track, they recorded outstanding successes due to the capabilities they possess and their dominance over major international institutions and the Wests regimes and its effective and influential forces. As for the other path, its conclusion was to weaken and stifle the resistance of the Palestinian people and liquidate its cause, leading to its removal from the arena of global circulation by relying on force to eliminate the resistance forces and relying on the option of normalization, which guaranteed them the removal of influential regimes from the arena of confrontation.  He continued, saying: The option of normalization was and remains a project to subjugate the will of the nation... a project to waste its central cause, and a project to shatter the unity of its options until the issue of Palestine, which is the issue of the nation, almost turned into an exclusive Palestinian issue, an orphan, a stranger, a stranger among its people, its people, and its brothers. The choice of normalization with the enemy has placed the Palestinian cause and the right of the Palestinian people to their land in the circle of targeting, or even in the circle of imminent danger, and on a downward path that warns of every danger due to the connivance and betrayal of the Palestinian people that normalization with the enemy entails, and the abandonment of their right, their cause, their resistance, and their future.  He said: At this fatal moment, the flood of Al-Aqsa resistance came to shuffle all the cards, change all calculations, and turn the threat into an advanced existential opportunity and a turning point in the paths that the enemies had worked on for a long time. The flood has engraved deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has been shattered, and the issue that they had worked so long to stifle has returned to the forefront of all the worlds merits, to awaken the world once again, to restore momentum and a resounding presence, and to reveal itself as a global issue. Extensive and present in all geography of the world and its corridors.  He added: The resisting flood of Al-Aqsa dealt a harsh blow to all attempts to write off the Palestine issue and confirmed that the issue that was conspired against by many of the West and many of the East, many of the far away and many of the closest ones, would not have survived without its resistance, its rifle and its sacrifices. No one has a presence in this brutal, brutal world except to the extent of his resistance, and if the truth is armed with strength, faith, and the will to resist and persevere, it cannot be defeated, no matter how oppressive and powerful the enemy is.  He said that the Israeli enemy, which today continues with massacres and crimes, killing tens of thousands of children and women, waging a comprehensive war of annihilation against humans, stones and life, and committing atrocities that are the greatest in modern history, is doing all of this to cover up defeats with massacres and to take away, with images of massacres and destruction, the humiliated image of Israel on the Day of Judgment. October 7, and to take revenge for destabilizing his project, to which he and his masters have made every effort for more than 50 years.  He added: In its attack on our region, the West, led by the United States of America and Britain, has exhausted the body and thought of the nation, length and breadth, with projects of fragmentation, misinformation, deception, and fragmentation, aided by brute tools, sinful pens, hired voices, and hired minds. It has torn apart, with sectarianism, racism, and sectarianism, a unified whole, and deepened the fragmentation of every fragmented one, so the nations commonalities were absent. The great ones are in favor of their small differences at a stage in which the nations identity, capabilities, role and existence are exposed to profound and stormy dangers... They have worked to tear our peoples apart and preoccupy them with issues of fragmentation, but Palestine alone remains a valve of unity, a path of convergence, a base for revival, and a crossing path to the future that our peoples yearn for, a future. Strength, pride, freedom, sovereignty, stability and well-being.  He stated: After decades of focused efforts, with full American and Western support, to dismember, fragment, and dissolve the Palestinian issue, victory for Gaza came from the arenas of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen, broader than the enemys expectations, and the resistance factions succeeded in besieging the usurping entity with fire for more than 100 days. This is unprecedented.  He stressed that the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Lebanon, the blood of the martyrs of defending Gaza in Syria, the blood of martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iraq, the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Yemen, and the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iran, the last of which was the blood of Major General Sayyed Radhi al-Moussawi, all these bloods unite, coalesce and integrate. With the blood of the martyrs of Gaza and the West Bank. It is the unity of blood, rifle, arena and target, which is what worries our enemies, and which is what we must continue and work to increase, deepen and extend. Whoever believes that this nation has an option other than resistance is wrong and very, very delusional.  He said: Israel did not occupy Palestine with diplomacy, but with weapons and force, and it did not occupy Beirut in 1982 with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. It does not threaten the nation today with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. Israel was not defeated from Lebanon in 1982 by diplomacy, but rather by resistance, just as it will not be defeated from Gaza and Palestine by diplomacy, but by resistance. We, as a nation, have no choice but to resist. We have nothing but resistance. There is nothing we can bet on but resistance.  He added that the confrontation with the enemy is not a confrontation for one or two days, but rather it is an ongoing, continuous and cumulative confrontation, and we must remain present in this confrontation. The gathering of the fleets of arrogant countries in support of Israel only confirms its weakness and instability, which must harden our will to adhere to the option of resistance. If the conditions for liberating Palestine are not available today, then we must prepare and prepare for tomorrow and the day after.  He stressed: Betting on international institutions and the so-called international community, as you have witnessed and we have witnessed repeatedly, is a failed and disappointing bet that has produced nothing but heartbreak, loss, disappointment and bitterness, adding that these international institutions are out of the bet because they are dependent on the will of the American administration, and the last farce and complicity of these institutions was the decision. Which condemned Yemen for its targeting of Israeli ships in defense of Gaza and legitimized the American-British targeting of the Ansar Allah brothers and ignored with all insolence and malice two million Palestinian citizens who were martyred, wounded, detained, hungry, thirsty, and displaced in the open, as a result of Israeli massacres and attacks.  He said: From your blessed conference, I extend my thanks to the brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the leadership and people, for their pioneering and supportive stances, and for the authentic and wise stances of His Eminence the Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (may his soul rest in peace), and I thank your conference, your stance, and your support for the resistance.  He stressed: The pledge of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon is to remain in the position of supporting Gaza until the victory of Gaza. We pledged to our great Imam Khomeini (may God sanctify his secret) that we would keep his commandments, abide by his path, and continue on his path, the outcome of which would be nothing but victory, pride, and dignity. It is noteworthy that the twelfth international forum, Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, continues its work with the participation of a group of families of resistance martyrs, martyrs of defenders of the holy shrines, nuclear martyrs, elite officials and military leaders, guests from the Global Resistance Front, and activists in the field of the Palestinian cause.   Allied for Democracy   		    Israelis gathered in downtown Tel Aviv to protest the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu's government in managing the war on Gaza. The protesters raised banners demanding the dismissal of the Israeli government, immediate elections, and the formation of a new government seeking what they described as unifying the Israeli ranks. This comes as the families of the prisoners continue to demonstrate in front of Netanyahus house in Caesarea as an attempt to pressure him to conclude a deal to release their detained children in the Gaza Strip.  		    		  		Chief of Staff of the Israeli army, Herzi Halevy, said that some reserve forces are being demobilized due to what he called the tension of the battlefield and the demands of life. Recently, Israeli media reports reported the demobilization of reserve units to reintegrate them into the economic cycle in view of the damage caused to the Israeli economy as a result of the war on Gaza, while official statements reported the withdrawal of some forces from the Gaza Strip, including a unit in the Golani Brigade .    The Israeli Walla website revealed that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tried to storm Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office , and the situation almost deteriorated into a fist fight. Gallant threatened Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to bring in the Golani Brigade to control the situation in the war council. Dermer, who renounced his American citizenship to serve as economic envoy in Washington before becoming ambassador there, is considered one of Netanyahu's closest associates.  According to the Walla website, Netanyahu's crew monitored Gallant's crew while recording the course of the security meetings on an audio tape. Israeli media reported that Gallant left the war cabinet meeting last Saturday because his office director was prevented from attending, amid increasing tension within the council. At the time, Israeli Channel 12 quoted a source as saying that the ministers withdrawal came after he arrived at the meeting headquarters and his assistant was prevented from entering with him, but when he entered the room he found 5 of Netanyahus aides.  The source added, ""Netanyahu told Gallant that as long as my assistant did not attend, your assistant should not attend, despite the presence of 5 of his employees in the place,"" and this is what prompted the Defense Minister to withdraw. According to the channel, Netanyahu believes that the army is leaking some information related to the bilateral talks or discussions. As the Walla website reported, Gallant sometimes refrains from answering calls from Netanyahus office for entire days. The Israeli Channel 13 revealed that Gallant asked Netanyahu not to ""disrupt"" his work within the government.   In a related context, the British newspaper The Times reported, quoting an unnamed Israeli security official, that the Israeli war government is on the verge of collapse and Netanyahu is hesitating and wasting time. During recent months, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Gallant and Netanyahu, related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  Many Israeli analysts point out that each member of the War Council only thinks about his political future and not Israel's interests. Ofer Shelah, a researcher at the National Security Research Institute, believes that the members of the War Council have been preparing themselves for the aftermath of the war since the first day of the war, and this is because the ghost of October 7th is haunting them, and each one of them is running ugly media campaigns on satellite channels saying that he is doing well but the others are wrong.     The intensity of the differences within the Israeli government and war council widened, after more than 100 days of war on the Gaza Strip, while voices calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down grew louder. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted Gadi Eisenkot, former chief of staff of the Israeli army and minister in the Israeli War Council, as saying that the behavior of the Israeli government before and after October 7, 2023 is characterized by a major failure. It added that Netanyahu and everyone who was in a military and political position on the seventh of last October and 10 years before that bears a clear responsibility, and that the Israeli leadership is not telling the truth to the people.  For its part, the New York Times quoted Eisenkot as saying that Israel did not overthrow the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved, indicating that reaching an agreement with Hamas is the only way to release the detainees. He stressed that every effort should have been made to maintain the temporary ceasefire last November. Eisenkot promised that his presence in the emergency government prevented the outbreak of a comprehensive war with the Lebanese Hezbollah , which would not have represented a grave strategic mistake, as he put it. Earlier, Eisenkot said that Tel Aviv must stop lying to itself, and conclude a deal that returns those detained by the Palestinian factions, instead of continuing the war on the Gaza Strip.  For his part, the head of the Yisrael Beytenu party ,  Avigdor Lieberman , said  that the current Israeli government is no longer capable of leading the people, indicating the necessity of forming a new government.  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted a source in the security mini-ministerial council as saying that there is no future for the war on the Gaza Strip. He added that Netanyahu is clearly stalling to buy time, and is evading responsibility, as he put it. For his part, opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israeli Radio that Netanyahu does not care about the State of Israel, and that all he cares about are his personal political interests, and he must be changed quickly.  A few days ago, the participation of Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz in a massive demonstration in Tel Aviv opposing the government and attacking its handling of the issue of Israeli prisoners in Gaza raised many questions about the cohesion of the Israeli government after more than 100 days of war. Recently, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Netanyahu and his Defense Minister  Yoav Galant , related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  These tensions in the government coincide with the demonstrations taking place in various areas in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, demanding that the Israeli government conclude a deal to release detainees held by the resistance in Gaza. The families of Israeli detainees in the Gaza Strip said that they had lost confidence in Netanyahu's government, and that they would make their own moves, without indicating what they were, according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority.  According to political analysts, there is a widespread belief that Netanyahu is running this war for personal political motives, and his opponents do not just accuse him of failing to achieve any of its goals; But also by falling hostage to the far-right ministers whose presence he buys at any cost, so that the government, whose popularity polls indicate a decline in popularity, does not collapse.        		  The Israeli newspaper ""Israel Today"" said that the administration of US President Joe Biden is currently working on formulating a major regional deal to stop the war in the Gaza Strip and reduce tension in the region. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Israeli source as saying that the deal includes a ceasefire, the establishment of a new regime in the Gaza Strip, the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world, and the release of prisoners.  The newspaper said that the aforementioned Israeli source confirmed that the deal includes several principles aimed at achieving long-term stability as part of the post-war reality. It pointed out that the deal is part of what US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke about at the Davos Forum this week when he said that Israel needs to make difficult decisions.   The newspaper pointed out that the deal is still in its initial stages, and it is not yet clear how much of it has been formulated, or whether it will lead to an agreement that will end the war and launch a political process to resolve the conflict. So far, no official comment has been issued by the concerned parties regarding what was revealed in the Israeli newspaper report.  Talk about this deal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced yesterday that he informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any scenario for the post-war period in Gaza, and his insistence on continuing the war in the Gaza Strip until victory over the Hamas movement, which is a position that contradicts the American desire.   The United States called on Israel to reduce its attack on Gaza, and said that the establishment of a Palestinian state must be part of the post-war phase, which Netanyahu announced his explicit rejection of, demanding full Israeli control over the Strip.    The American network ""NBC News"" reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rapidly losing the support of American lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the network, supporters of Israel in both the Democratic and Republican parties are sounding the alarm about their loss of confidence in Netanyahu and his handling of the war against the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip.  The network indicated that one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose name was not revealed, said, It has become difficult to defend Netanyahu or justify his political strategy, and that there is a real lack of confidence in his leadership, not to mention questions about his ability to lead. The same source added, ""He believes on a personal level that Netanyahu's political interest is to remain involved in the conflict, whether it is with Hezbollah or in Gaza, since any ceasefire, peace agreement, efforts to rebuild, or going out of the way will harm him."" ""Politically.""  She pointed out that progressive lawmakers in the US Congress constantly criticize Netanyahu and the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, but now these criticisms are coming from pro-Israel lawmakers who work on the main national security committees, and they are now expressing their frustration about Netanyahus leadership, albeit quietly. The network touched on the statements of 3 American lawmakers who wonder whether the 74-year-old Netanyahu has a strategy to end the bloody war in Gaza, and they indicated that the unpopular Netanyahu may be deliberately trying to prolong it in order to remain in power.  Earlier, NBC reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu rejected US Secretary of State  Anthony Blinken's proposal for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper revealed that the United States warned the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel's long-term security will only be guaranteed through the establishment of a Palestinian state . The newspaper said, quoting Reuters, that US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that there is no way to solve Israels security problems in the long term, as well as organize the Gaza reconstruction process at the end of the war, without establishing a Palestinian state.     		  The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that Israel should have security control over Gaza after the war, in the context of conflicting statements between Washington and Tel Aviv regarding plans after the end of the fighting. The Bureau denied the content of a CNN report that stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed US President Joe Biden - in a phone call yesterday, Friday - that he did not rule out the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state.  The Israeli statement said, ""During his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after the destruction of Hamas, Israel must maintain security control over Gaza to ensure that it will no longer pose a threat to Israel, which is inconsistent with the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""   This is a rare statement from the Prime Ministers Office, which usually avoids making a statement on the holy Sabbath holiday for religious Jews, and it came hours after a call made by Biden and Netanyahu on Friday, their first in nearly a month. Biden said after the call that the Israeli Prime Minister does not oppose all solutions based on two states, considering that the matter is not impossible with Netanyahu in power. The US President indicated that there are ""a number of possible patterns"" for this solution, and that some UN member states do not have armed forces, in reference to the possibility of establishing a demilitarized Palestinian state.  White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Netanyahu had been trying to arrange the phone call for some time, denying that it was a reaction to statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister - the day before yesterday, Thursday - in which he expressed his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Netanyahu stated that he informed Washington of his opposition to any Palestinian state that does not guarantee the security of Israel, as he put it. He said, ""Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. This is a necessary condition.""  On the other hand, Hamas rejected the US President's statements regarding ""possible patterns"" for establishing a Palestinian state. A member of the movement's political bureau, Izzat Al-Rishq said in a statement that ""selling the illusion that Biden is trying to talk about a Palestinian state (...) does not deceive our people."" Al-Rishq added, ""Biden is a full partner in the war of genocide, and our people do not expect anything good from him."" He said, ""These people think of themselves as the guardians of the Palestinian people. They want to choose for them the type of state that suits them.""  For its part, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry confirmed its refusal to comment on the Israeli Prime Ministers Office on press reports regarding Biden and Netanyahus call. The Ministry stressed in a statement that repeating these statements and demanding Israeli security control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a blatant challenge to the declared positions of the American administration and its efforts to resolve the conflict and achieve security and stability in the region.  Israel continues its war on Gaza for the 106th day with broad political and military support from the United States, which supplies it with thousands of tons of weapons and ammunition via an air bridge. But there are discrepancies between Biden and Netanyahu regarding the management of the war and plans for the so-called next day after the end of the fighting, especially in light of the failure to achieve the main declared goals of the war, which are the elimination of Hamas and the recovery of Israeli prisoners.  Netanyahu is also facing escalating internal disputes, as the official Israeli radio quoted senior security and military leaders as agreeing with the ministers, Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, and Yoav Galant, that the absence of a political vision for the day after the war on Gaza will prevent Israels victory over Hamas.      		    The British Financial Times newspaper explained that US President Joe Biden's strong support for Israel risks harming his re-election prospects for a new presidential term, explaining that his apparent indifference to the Palestinians may be costly. Writer Edward Luce mentioned in his article that thousands of children were killed in the war on Gaza , according to Save the Children. However, Bidens recent statement calling on the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) to release the hostages did not refer to what the Palestinians are suffering.  He added that acknowledging the plight of the Palestinians seems to cast doubt on Biden's ""sincere sympathy for the Israeli victims in the attack launched by Hamas on October 7,"" so Washington avoids it, knowing that this upsets many young Americans who will need Biden badly. To their enthusiasm next November, it will also disturb the Arab Americans, who constitute a major voting bloc in many swing states.  The writer explained that progressive Democrats are not the only ones who feel dissatisfied with Biden's silence regarding what Israel is doing, as many of his most trusted allies in the US Senate are also upset.  In a meeting in Davos this week, the US Senator from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, and Biden's closest friend in politics, said that the United States should consider setting conditions on military aid to Israel. In a letter to Biden before Christmas, a group of Democrats - some of them former CIA employees - urged the use of influence for an immediate and significant shift in military strategy and tactics in Gaza.  The writer stated that White House officials insist that Biden is secretly doing what he can to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but there is little evidence to prove this. Israel has received more than 100 bunker-busting bombs from the United States since October 7, noting that these bombs are intended for destruction and not for precise targeting of terrorists in urban areas.  The writer believes that the answer is summed up in Bidens deep feelings towards Israel. Since his first days in politics, he was one of its strongest allies in the Capitol , and he has always admired the approach of both Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin, but now he faces a contradictory model represented by Benjamin Netanyahu, and despite this, he continues. In support.  Edward Luce said that Biden was a strong critic of the efforts of US President George H.W. Bush for the peace process in 1992 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . He also attacked Bush Sr.'s threat to withdraw American loan guarantees if Israel went ahead with building settlements in the occupied territories. The pressure exerted by Bush helped overthrow the Likud government in Israel at the time and bring Rabin to power, and this led to the Oslo Peace Accords, explains Edward Luce.  According to the article, Biden - while serving as vice president - had undermined President Barack Obama's attempt in 2010 to apply similar pressure on Netanyahu's government, and partly because of Biden's own reassurances, the Israeli prime minister mocked Obama.  The writer emphasized that Biden could oust Netanyahu by imposing strict conditions on American aid if he wanted to, and in doing so he would gain the respect of the Israelis, the Arab world, and the majority of Jewish Americans. This would also make him regain some of the ground that Washington lost in the global South because of its double standards. A large part of the world believes that America cares more about European victims such as the Ukrainians than it does about civilians in the Middle East or anywhere else.  The writer emphasized that the longer Netanyahu clings to power, the worse it will be for Biden. However, it appears that Biden's actions were designed to ensure this.    		  		  The American website The Intercept confirmed in a report that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) donated about $95,000 to Republican Representative Mike Johnson last November, according to the websites analysis of Federal Election Commission records. The Intercept added in a report by journalist Catherine Caruso that the pro-Israel lobby is considered the largest donor to Johnson in 2023 after he led the passage of a large aid package for Israel.  The Intercept said that most of the payments received by the US representative came after the beginning of the war on Gaza. According to the website, Johnson - who refused to speak to The Intercept - received small donations in late October, which quickly increased significantly during the month of November.  The Intercept confirmed that this increase came after Johnson led the passage of significant support for Israel, estimated at $14 billion, when he presided over the House of Representatives, where he struggled to accelerate the passage of that support by separating it from the bill to provide aid allocated to Ukraine, and resorting to using IRS funds to finance it. Once the bill passed the House, Johnson urged the Senate to approve it as quickly as possible.  The website confirmed that Johnson has always expressed his direct public support for Israel, and he previously confirmed on a trip to Israel in 2020 that it is not true that the Palestinians suffer from injustice in the region, and he continued, ""We never see any of that.""   The website confirmed that AIPAC is considered an influential intermediary in the Capitol , as it provides money to legislators from the Republican and Democratic parties in order to continue maintaining pro-Israel policies, and in the recent period the organization has focused on members of the Democratic Party who are critical of Tel Avivs policies.  The Intercept quoted the head of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby, as saying that AIPAC's contributions to election campaigns have two purposes, the first of which is to reward candidates who support Israel's interests, and the second is to use them as a stick to keep politicians aligned in one row. On foreign policy, this is probably the single issue where money has the biggest negative impact, said Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard Kennedy School.  Even as a growing number of Democrats are willing to buck the pro-Israel consensus in Washington and reject AIPAC's influence, they still suffer from a significant lack of resources, according to the American website. The problem, Walt told The Intercept, is that there are no similar groups on the other side, as no pro-Palestinian or pro-Arab-American PAC has the same resources.    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 24,927  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,388. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th to 195, and 529 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of the same month. Among them are 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that 2,438 soldiers - including 355 seriously injured - have been injured since the beginning of the war on Gaza, including earlier reports of 576 moderate, and 1,161 minor. The number of wounded since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip on October 27 had risen to 1,042.  At least 13,340 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	The New York Times quoted Israeli military commanders as saying that retrieving the hostages is possible through diplomatic, not military, means. Israeli military leaders added to the newspaper that recovering the hostages and destroying Hamas have now become incompatible goals, and that the long battle aimed at destroying Hamas will likely cost the lives of the hostages. Israeli leaders stressed that the diplomatic path to recovering the hostages would be the fastest method. They said the strategic impasse exacerbated the military's frustration about the indecision of the political leadership. The Israeli military expressed to the newspaper their fear that the length of the military campaign, without a post-war plan, would lead to the erosion of allied support.  On the other hand, the New York Times said that it had seen documents indicating that Israel had imposed its control in Gaza on a smaller portion than it had envisioned in the battle plans since the beginning of the war. The documents indicated that Israeli plans included controlling the cities of Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah by late December.      	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address

The Israeli military questions the authenticity of The New York Times report, which cites Israeli commanders who have complained about the IDF's failures in the Gaza Strip. The New York Times reported  that doubts have been raised by the Israeli military's high command regarding the feasibility of their objectives in Gaza, particularly in light of the limited progress in their proclaimed objective of ""uprooting"" Hamas from the Gaza Strip.
According to the report, Israel was unable to meet its goals of occupying large areas of the Gaza Strip and has had to settle for less than it had originally planned, which raised concerns among some commanders regarding the effectiveness of the Israeli war cabinet's strategy. The slow pace of the operation has led to private expressions of frustration among some Israeli commanders, according to NYT. The report suggests that some commanders are contemplating prioritizing the retrieval of Israeli captives held by the Palestinian Resistance, at the cost of backing away from the political command's goal of ""dismantling"" the Palestinian Resistance.
The Resistance's expansive tunnel network has proven to be an intricate maze, filled with booby traps that have cost Israeli special forces heavy losses since the ground invasion into the Gaza Strip was initiated. In fact, the Resistance's tunnels have been the main focus of the occupation's military, as they are regarded to be essential strategic infrastructure to the Palestinian Resistance's work. Despite the goal of destroying the tunnel network, the Israeli military has not succeeded. Brigade after brigade attempted to crack the puzzle but failed. This includes multiple Combat Engineering Brigades and the Yahalom Special Comabt Engineering Unit, whose ranks have been substantially reduced.
NYT also points to a reality that has contradicted the occupation's timeframe. Essentially, the IDF had expected to take ""full control"" of major cities in the Gaza Strip, such as Gaza City, Khan Younis, and Rafah by late December. According to the report, ""Israel"" is yet to even launch a ground invasion into Rafah, while it faces mounting difficulties in Khan Younis. Moreover, the IDF has also failed to ""eliminate"" many of the Resistance leaders that it had vowed to kill, including Yahya al-Sinwar, Mohammad Deif, Marwan Issa, and others.
The Israeli military command responded to the testimonies of several commanders given to NYT by saying that the sources were ""not known"" to the military and ""do not reflect"" its position.
Military expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi said that the Israeli occupation army began a broader ground operation north of Gaza in implementation of the warnings of Prime Minister Herzi Halevy a few days ago, in which he spoke about the possibility of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) rebuilding its combat strength. Halevy had confirmed a few days ago that Hamas is capable of rebuilding its combat capabilities in the north, indicating that this matter may require implementing a broader operation than the previous one.
According to Al-Duwairi, Israel began this broader operation that the Chief of Staff spoke about, as the occupation forces attacked the Al-Daraj and Al-Tuffah neighborhoods during the past 48 hours with a force consisting of an armor battalion supported by the Nahal battalion, an artillery company, and an engineering effort, a force approaching an entire brigade.
Currently, fighting is raging in the northern sector, extending from Street 10 to the fence area, as Israeli forces are trying to penetrate the Tawam and Intelligence Towers areas, but they are taking place to a lesser extent than at the beginning of the ground operations, according to Al-Duwairi. Israel also pushed a similar force into the Jabalia area, but Al-Duwairi said that it is difficult to know whether this is a new force or whether the force that tried to penetrate into the north during the past two days failed to achieve any goal and was directed to another area.
Regarding the resistances handling of this new attack, Al-Duwairi said that it will continue to rely on the idea of lone wolves that surprise the forces in a specific place and time according to the available information.
In the northern axis of the Gaza Strip, the Al-Qassam Brigades said that they repelled incursion attempts by the occupation forces and targeted their vehicles in the Al-Jaabari camp. Jabalia also witnessed Israeli bombardment focused on the Tal al-Zaatar area and the Tal al-Salatin area in Beit Lahia, where martyrs and wounded were recorded. In Gaza City, confrontations took place during which the Al-Quds Brigades were able to snipe soldiers. The Brigades also announced that a number of military vehicles had been trapped in what it called a carefully engineered ambush with high-explosive devices east of Gaza, which resulted in soldiers being killed and wounded.
Al-Aqsa satellite channel said that violent clashes have been taking place for hours between the Palestinian resistance and the Israeli occupation forces in the Karama and Intelligence Towers areas west of Gaza City. The IDF artillery fired heavy flares into the airspace of Gaza City in conjunction with the clashes, while the occupation aircraft continued to launch air strikes on residential neighborhoods.
In the central region, fierce confrontations took place, whether in the Nuseirat camp, where the Al-Quds Brigades destroyed a Merkava tank, or the Bureij camp, where the Al-Qassam Brigades said they bombed Israeli army positions with heavy-caliber shells. A scene was also repeated in Al-Maghazi camp, which witnessed intense clashes.
To the south, Khan Yunis was subjected to Israeli bombing, resulting in martyrs. The city of Rafah was also subjected to a raid that targeted a car, resulting in 4 martyrs. Khan Yunis is also the center of gravity in the southern region, where strong confrontations took place, as the Al-Qassam Brigades and the Al-Quds Brigades announced the bombing of sites where Israeli forces were stationed.
Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets on the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, bearing pictures of Israelis detained in the Gaza Strip, and called on the Palestinians to inform the Israeli army if they recognized any of them. On the other hand, the Israeli army announced that 16 soldiers were wounded in the Gaza battles.
It also announced that it had discovered and destroyed a number of rocket launchers equipped with long-range missiles in the northern Gaza Strip, in addition to destroying a missile manufacturing facility belonging to the Islamic Jihad movement. The Israeli army also announced that its soldiers found dozens of war machines and explosive materials used in manufacturing missiles and that they were destroyed.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported on its page on the X website that 800,000 Palestinians in Gaza are suffering from a scarcity of basic materials, as Israel continues its siege of the Strip and prevents the arrival of aid.
The Israeli military expert, Alon Ben David, expressed the astonishment of the Israeli occupation army and the Shin Bet at the enormous size of military industries in the Gaza Strip. This astonishment was even doubled with the discovery of the unimaginable scope of Hamas capabilities to produce weapons and underground infrastructure. The expert pointed out to the Hebrew newspaper Maariv, Hamas's endless capabilities in strengthening its ranks with new people. The Israeli military expert added that the coming days will witness the end of the intense phase of fighting in Gaza, and the beginning of a new phase characterized by the same amount of challenge.
Alon Ben David explained that the 98th Division of the Israeli occupation army will end its operations in Khan Yunis, south of Gaza, while the army hopes that its forces will be able to achieve an achievement from this operation, represented by reaching the leadership of the Hamas movement or releasing the Zionist detainees, but achieving these goals Unsecured.
The expert believes that after controlling Khan Yunis, the occupation army will have operational control over about 80% of the territory of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of the Rafah area, the Nuseirat camp, and the city of Deir al-Balah. Most of the forces will leave, but some of them will remain, and will continue to divide the sector between north and south. He pointed out that 90% of Hamas's military capabilities are produced inside Gaza, in addition to the local production of advanced RPG launchers and drones.
Alon Ben David claimed that a very small portion of weapons reaches the Gaza Strip by smuggling through Egypt, and therefore the current challenge for the occupying army in the coming years is to destroy the huge quantities of Hamas weapons and dismantle its ability to manufacture military industries, warning of the movements ability. It continues to support its ranks with new people.
In the occupied West Bank, settlers attacked Palestinian farmers near the village of Ramoun, wounding some of them. They also continued their attacks on Palestinian shepherds and farmers in Masafer Yatta, threatening them with displacement. Israeli forces stormed - at dawn on Saturday - Balata camp, east of Nablus in the West Bank.
The Palestinian News Agency ""Wafa"" reported the outbreak of ""violent confrontations with the occupation forces, who stormed several neighborhoods in the camp, led by a military bulldozer that carried out acts of sabotage on the internal roads. The occupation soldiers also raided several homes and tampered with their contents."" Later, Israeli forces sent military reinforcements to the camp, amid continuing violent clashes.
The Israeli occupation forces also stormed the Al-Dhahr area in the town of Beit Ummar, north of Hebron in the West Bank. The occupation forces set up military barriers. They began searching citizens' vehicles and phones, and assaulted a young man before stopping him.
Israeli forces stormed the city of Hebron, south of the occupied West Bank . This was accompanied by an increase in settler attacks on Palestinian villages since the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood and the ongoing Israeli aggression against the besieged Gaza Strip, which led to the displacement of hundreds of Palestinians. Human rights reports also revealed an increase in the number of detainees in the West Bank, and an increase in their abuse in the occupation prisons.
Al Jazeera's correspondent reported that the Israeli occupation forces stormed the ""Traffic Circle"" area in Ras Al-Joura in the city of Hebron in the West Bank, and closed all entrances to the area. Earlier, the reporter reported that the occupation forces stormed the city of Yatta, south of Hebron, assaulted citizens and confiscated a number of vehicles.
In a related context, a citizen was injured after dozens of settlers attacked Palestinian farmers in the village of Ramoun, east of the city of Ramallah in the West Bank. Local sources said that a group of armed settlers stormed the entrances to the village and - protected by members of the occupation army - attacked Palestinian farmers while they were on their lands located between the villages of Deir Dibwan and Ramon. They attempted to steal sheep and destroy buildings that had been erected by Palestinians about 20 years ago.
Settlers also attacked - for the second day in a row - Palestinian citizens in Susya in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron. Settlers prevent sheep herders from reaching their pastures and threaten them with weapons and forcible displacement from their homes. Susiya and other population centers in Masafer Yatta are subjected to continuous attacks by the occupation forces and settlers, but the frequency of attacks has increased significantly since the seventh of last October.
In the same context, the National Office for Land Defense and Settlement Resistance revealed that settlers view the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip as a golden opportunity for displacement and ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians in the West Bank. The weekly settlement report explained that settlers are using violence, with the help of the occupation army, to displace Palestinian communities from areas classified as (C). It pointed out that the ""settlers' terrorist practices"" worsened after October 7, 2023, and prompted more than 1,500 Palestinian citizens from at least 25 communities to flee their homes and areas, raising the percentage of those displaced during the past year to three times that of 2022.
According to the report, the settlers have turned into military and paramilitary formations in times of war, armed and directed by Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir , financed by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , and receiving clear sponsorship from the state, army and occupation police. Israeli human rights organizations reveal that the current settler violence aimed at displacement is unprecedented in terms of frequency and intensity, especially in the south of Hebron Governorate.
The report explained that, in the context of the aggression against the Gaza Strip , terrorist settler groups began to become active in the West Bank, announcing their goals with complete clarity. These are groups of price tag sisters who carry out their activities without restrictions on social media networks and call on Palestinians to immigrate to Jordan.
One of these groups is an organization that calls itself Migrate Now and on its Facebook page calls on Palestinians in the West Bank to immigrate to Jordan before it is too late. This page publishes a picture of a map that includes Palestine and part of Jordan, showing parts of Jordanian territory within the new Israeli map, which Smotrich presented in Paris last year, and in the middle of it is the logo of the ""Aragon"" organization known for its criminal history in Palestine.
In light of Israel's policy of persecution and its attempt to prevent operations against it in the West Bank, the occupation authorities arrested at least 22 Palestinians from Friday evening until Saturday morning, including children and a woman from Jerusalem. A joint statement by the Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs Authority and the Palestinian Prisoners Club stated that the total number of arrests since October 7 has risen to about 6,115, including those who were arrested from homes and at military checkpoints, those who were forced to surrender themselves under pressure, and those who were held hostage.
The arrest campaigns were accompanied by widespread raids and harassment, in addition to widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens homes, the destruction of infrastructure, and the confiscation of money and vehicles. The report indicated that the total number of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons until the end of December 2023 amounted to about 8,800 citizens, including more than 80 female prisoners.
Within the framework of the occupations policy of abusing detainees, which has increased in frequency since the Al-Aqsa Flood, the Palestinian Prisoners Club stated in a statement that Megiddo Prison was one of the most prominent prisons in which detainees witnessed the most severe torture and abuse, in addition to what happened in Negev Prison. The statement explained that the detainees were subjected to brutal, systematic and collective torture and abuse.
In addition to the brutal and horrific attacks in prison, the prison administration continues its policy of starvation, which has affected their health conditions, in addition to the extreme cold, which has greatly exacerbated their suffering, and the accompanying deprivation of prisoners of sufficient clothing and blankets, in addition to the severe overcrowding that Departments witness it. The report stated that the majority of detainees sleep on the floor, and that no group was exempt from beatings and abuse, including children, in addition to the insults and profanity that the detainee receives during his assault.
In light of the attack on the Palestinians by the occupation army and its settlers, the Permanent Representative of Palestine to the United Nations , Riyad Mansour, sent three identical letters to the Secretary-General, António Guterres , the President of the Security Council , and  the  President of the United Nations General Assembly, regarding the continuation of Israel, the occupying power, in Deliberately targeting Palestinian children. The letter stated, ""Children in the Gaza Strip are exposed to killing, wounding, mutilation, starvation, orphanage, displacement, and disease and cold, while children in the West Bank are exposed to persecution and terror by soldiers and colonizers, in addition to being shot, beaten, arrested, and tortured.""
Mansour appealed to the international community, including the Security Council, including its Group on Children in Armed Conflict, the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the International Court of Justice  and the International Criminal Court,  to take immediate and very rapid action in accordance with international law.
At least 5  Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisers were killed in an air strike on the Mezzeh suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus. The five advisors were killed as a result of what the official Syrian news agency described as an Israeli air aggression targeting a residential building in the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus. Iranian media revealed that the Syrian Quds Force intelligence commander and his deputy were killed during the attack.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard announced the killing of 4 of its military advisors in the Mezzeh area in Damascus, and later confirmed the death of a fifth advisor who succumbed to his wounds. The Revolutionary Guard published the names of the four advisors who were killed immediately: Hojatollah Amidwar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, and Saeed Karimi, noting that two Syrian soldiers were killed in the air strike.

In reactions, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement condemned what it called the Israeli aggression that targeted leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Damascus. The movement said - in a statement - that ""this step expresses the occupation's attempt to export its military failure by expanding the scope of the war,"" as it put it.
In Iranian reactions, President Ibrahim Raisi said that Tehran will not leave the Israeli crime unanswered, adding that the Zionist entitys crime violated international decisions and was carried out with the support of the arrogant powers, including Washington. 	  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said that ""the activity of Iranian military advisors in combating terrorism and ensuring the security of the region will continue strongly.""
In a statement published by its spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, hours after the air strike, the Iranian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned what it called the criminal act carried out by the Zionist entity, and said that the repeated Israeli violations of Syrian sovereignty are a desperate attempt to spread instability and insecurity in the region. The statement also said, In addition to the political, legal and international prosecution of these aggressive and criminal acts, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to respond to the organized terrorism of the false Zionist entity at the appropriate time and place.

A security source in the tribal mobilization in Anbar Governorate, west of Baghdad, confirmed that the Ain al-Assad base was targeted with missiles launched from the Al-Baghdadi area, close to the Ain al-Assad base. The source added that the international coalition forces responded by bombing the area from which the missiles were launched with about 18 missiles, without knowing the extent of the losses between the two sides.
Naim Qassem, Deputy Secretary-General of the Lebanese Hezbollah, said that if the party waits for Israel to finish what it wants in Gaza, the next turn will be for the party in Lebanon. Naeem Qassem added that the partys work in southern Lebanon is a defensive action to support Gaza and Lebanon. On the ground, Lebanese Hezbollah announced that it targeted a gathering of occupation soldiers in the vicinity of the Al-Dhahira site and caused injuries. They also attacked two other gatherings of soldiers in the vicinity of Hunin Castle and Zarit Barracks.

Ambulance teams transported the victims to the hospital.
US airbase Ain al-Asad in Iraq's western Anbar Province has been targeted by at least 15 missiles, Iraqi news agency Shafaq reported on Saturday, citing a security source. The missiles were launched from the Iraqi city of Albaghdadi, the source said, without giving further information.

""At approximately 6:30 p.m. (Baghdad time) time Jan. 20, multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in Western Iraq targeting al-Assad Airbase. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the bases air defense systems while others impacted on the base. Damage assessments are ongoing. A number of U.S. personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. At least one Iraqi service member was wounded,"" the CENTCOM said on X.
Since the beginning of the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the bases of the US-led international coalition in Iraq, as well as US troops in Syria, have come under regular attacks, with armed Shiite groups claiming responsibility in Iraq. However, this attack is reported to be one of the most massive since the the start of the recent turmoil in Gaza.
In Yemen, the US Central Command said that it launched - at dawn on Saturday - an air strike on a Houthi anti-ship missile that was prepared for launch and targeting the Gulf of Aden, adding that the missile represented a threat to commercial ships and US Navy ships in the region, and that it destroyed it in self-defense.
""As part of ongoing efforts to protect freedom of navigation and prevent attacks on maritime vessels, on Jan. 20 at approximately 4 a.m. (Sanaa time), U.S. Central Command forces conducted airstrikes against a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch. U.S. forces determined the missile presented a threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region, and subsequently struck and destroyed the missile in self-defense. This action will make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels.""
In a related context, Reuters reported from regional and Iranian sources that commanders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah are in Yemen to help direct and supervise Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The sources said that Iran intensified its arms supplies to the Houthis in the wake of the war in Gaza, and that it provided them with advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles.

Maps   All maps are lies. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it is essential, wrote cartographer Mark Monmoneir in his book How to Lie with Maps. He showed that condensing complex, three-dimensional spaces onto a two-dimensional sheet of paper is bound to be reductive.   	  	But it is impossible to comprehend the war in Gaza without reference to maps, otherwise the entire conflict is reduced to an endless series of meaningless acts of random violence and the suffering of civilians. The first characteristic of guerrilla warfare is the loss of a front line.  	Evidently, different mappers have different ideas of how to depict the war in Gaza, notably those that seek to depict Israeli progress in the ground campaign. Part of the problem is latency. The news that forms the basis of the maps takes time to filter out to mappers, and the cartographers take time in crafting their maps, and it takes time to curate them. These processes are uneven among mappers, so their maps may differ in detail. Probably there is some ideological bias, or at least thematic apperception, which is understandable in wartime. It may come as no surprise that al-Jazeera maps depict rather less Israeli territorial progress than other sources.   	Finally, there remains the epistemological question of just exactly what are the colored in areas depicting. Naively, this might be understood as areas of Israeli control, that are no longer contested by the HAMAS. Or possibly these are areas of Israeli presence, in many of which the possibility of an RPG-wielding HAMAS militant popping out of a tunnel unexpectedly remains a live possibility. With the ""zero-range"" combat characterized by small unit tactics on both sides, maps may be prey to a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.

Bystanders   			  Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper revealed that Egypt is taking steps to reach a new agreement, which includes concluding a long truce, through which a number of prisoners from both the Palestinian and Israeli sides will be exchanged. The newspaper quoted informed Egyptian sources as saying that the proposal being consulted on takes into account the interests of various parties, and takes into account the current difficulties and declared positions.  			  The sources indicated that the new proposal will not be a substitute for the comprehensive Egyptian proposal to stop the war and arrangements for the next stage, but rather it will be part of the efforts to create the atmosphere to stop the fighting, alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip, and then move to the next stage. It added that Egypt received positive indicators despite the difficulty of the current situation, but the final crystallization of the agreement is still in the maturation stage, according to the sources.      			    			    			  Several European countries witnessed massive demonstrations in solidarity with  the Gaza Strip  and calling for an end to  the Israeli aggression against the Strip  that has been ongoing since the seventh of last October, which claimed the lives of more than 24,000 martyrs and more than 62,000 wounded, most of whom were children and women.  The Palestinian journalist residing in  Berlin, Majid Al-Zeer, said that the demonstrations that took place today in the German capital, Berlin, have been continuing for 105 consecutive days in victory for the Palestinian right, and 19 other demonstrations were also launched throughout  Germany , as well as in most European countries, in denunciation of the European policy towards the aggression against the Gaza Strip. Gaza.		    During the  Non-Aligned Movement summit in Uganda , United Nations Secretary-General  Antonio Guterres stressed  the necessity of recognizing the right of the Palestinians to build their state, in light of a stream of statements by Israeli officials and ministers who expressed their categorical rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state. Guterres said in his speech at the summit  that ""refusing to accept a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and denying the right of the Palestinian people to establish a state, is unacceptable.""    Axis of Resistance   The Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said: The Al-Aqsa Flood has engraved itself deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has collapsed, and the issue that they worked so long to stifle has returned to the top of all the worlds merits.  In a letter addressed by Sayyed Nasrallah to the Twelfth International Forum,  Gaza: Symbol of Resistance , which was read by Mr. Abdullah Safi al-Din , representative of Hezbollah Lebanon in Tehran : Titled your conference with the slogan Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, and timing it at a crucial historical stage that is going through In which the Palestinian resistance is a major confrontation to the Zionist war of annihilation, it only demonstrates the sense of responsibility of those involved in managing the conference and their blessed call to stand by the Palestinian people, their cause, and their resistance, which requires all of us to have grave responsibilities and constant alert to mobilize the nations capabilities in support of the Palestinian people and in support of their valiant resistance that is being written today. Truly, through its sacrifices, its heroism, the blood of its men, and the steadfastness and steadfastness of its people, it creates the future of the nation, preserves its dignity, and consolidates its strength.  He added that what Israel has lost to date in Gaza in terms of officers and soldiers at the hands of Palestinian resistance groups is many times greater than what it lost in the 1967 War. The Israeli army, which occupied more than 69,000 km2 in the Six-Day War, is being defeated today over part of the Gaza area. It is unable to achieve a goal, declare an occupation, or come close to victory. Rather, it retreats and retreats under the title of moving to a new stage. Therefore, it is natural and correct for the conferences slogan to be Gaza is a symbol of resistance. Gaza today is the symbol because in Gaza there is an honorable, brave and proud resistance.  He explained: Gaza is the symbol because it expresses, through its resistance, the pride, pride, pride, ambitions and hopes of our peoples who are thirsty for pride and victory. If Gaza had not resisted, it would not have been a symbol and symbol of pride. Resistance is what honors its people and the bearers of its banner. Resistance is the secret of pride, the secret of dignity, and the key to victory. Gaza is geographically small, but it is gigantic in its magnificence and heroism. Today, Gaza is more generous, more powerful, and prouder than the entire world.  He said: Since the occupation of Palestine, the enemy and its masters have worked on two paths. The first is the path of legitimizing the occupation internationally and polishing its image and demonstrating it as a model civilized entity that can be emulated as a role model for the region. In the first track, they recorded outstanding successes due to the capabilities they possess and their dominance over major international institutions and the Wests regimes and its effective and influential forces. As for the other path, its conclusion was to weaken and stifle the resistance of the Palestinian people and liquidate its cause, leading to its removal from the arena of global circulation by relying on force to eliminate the resistance forces and relying on the option of normalization, which guaranteed them the removal of influential regimes from the arena of confrontation.  He continued, saying: The option of normalization was and remains a project to subjugate the will of the nation... a project to waste its central cause, and a project to shatter the unity of its options until the issue of Palestine, which is the issue of the nation, almost turned into an exclusive Palestinian issue, an orphan, a stranger, a stranger among its people, its people, and its brothers. The choice of normalization with the enemy has placed the Palestinian cause and the right of the Palestinian people to their land in the circle of targeting, or even in the circle of imminent danger, and on a downward path that warns of every danger due to the connivance and betrayal of the Palestinian people that normalization with the enemy entails, and the abandonment of their right, their cause, their resistance, and their future.  He said: At this fatal moment, the flood of Al-Aqsa resistance came to shuffle all the cards, change all calculations, and turn the threat into an advanced existential opportunity and a turning point in the paths that the enemies had worked on for a long time. The flood has engraved deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has been shattered, and the issue that they had worked so long to stifle has returned to the forefront of all the worlds merits, to awaken the world once again, to restore momentum and a resounding presence, and to reveal itself as a global issue. Extensive and present in all geography of the world and its corridors.  He added: The resisting flood of Al-Aqsa dealt a harsh blow to all attempts to write off the Palestine issue and confirmed that the issue that was conspired against by many of the West and many of the East, many of the far away and many of the closest ones, would not have survived without its resistance, its rifle and its sacrifices. No one has a presence in this brutal, brutal world except to the extent of his resistance, and if the truth is armed with strength, faith, and the will to resist and persevere, it cannot be defeated, no matter how oppressive and powerful the enemy is.  He said that the Israeli enemy, which today continues with massacres and crimes, killing tens of thousands of children and women, waging a comprehensive war of annihilation against humans, stones and life, and committing atrocities that are the greatest in modern history, is doing all of this to cover up defeats with massacres and to take away, with images of massacres and destruction, the humiliated image of Israel on the Day of Judgment. October 7, and to take revenge for destabilizing his project, to which he and his masters have made every effort for more than 50 years.  He added: In its attack on our region, the West, led by the United States of America and Britain, has exhausted the body and thought of the nation, length and breadth, with projects of fragmentation, misinformation, deception, and fragmentation, aided by brute tools, sinful pens, hired voices, and hired minds. It has torn apart, with sectarianism, racism, and sectarianism, a unified whole, and deepened the fragmentation of every fragmented one, so the nations commonalities were absent. The great ones are in favor of their small differences at a stage in which the nations identity, capabilities, role and existence are exposed to profound and stormy dangers... They have worked to tear our peoples apart and preoccupy them with issues of fragmentation, but Palestine alone remains a valve of unity, a path of convergence, a base for revival, and a crossing path to the future that our peoples yearn for, a future. Strength, pride, freedom, sovereignty, stability and well-being.  He stated: After decades of focused efforts, with full American and Western support, to dismember, fragment, and dissolve the Palestinian issue, victory for Gaza came from the arenas of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen, broader than the enemys expectations, and the resistance factions succeeded in besieging the usurping entity with fire for more than 100 days. This is unprecedented.  He stressed that the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Lebanon, the blood of the martyrs of defending Gaza in Syria, the blood of martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iraq, the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Yemen, and the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iran, the last of which was the blood of Major General Sayyed Radhi al-Moussawi, all these bloods unite, coalesce and integrate. With the blood of the martyrs of Gaza and the West Bank. It is the unity of blood, rifle, arena and target, which is what worries our enemies, and which is what we must continue and work to increase, deepen and extend. Whoever believes that this nation has an option other than resistance is wrong and very, very delusional.  He said: Israel did not occupy Palestine with diplomacy, but with weapons and force, and it did not occupy Beirut in 1982 with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. It does not threaten the nation today with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. Israel was not defeated from Lebanon in 1982 by diplomacy, but rather by resistance, just as it will not be defeated from Gaza and Palestine by diplomacy, but by resistance. We, as a nation, have no choice but to resist. We have nothing but resistance. There is nothing we can bet on but resistance.  He added that the confrontation with the enemy is not a confrontation for one or two days, but rather it is an ongoing, continuous and cumulative confrontation, and we must remain present in this confrontation. The gathering of the fleets of arrogant countries in support of Israel only confirms its weakness and instability, which must harden our will to adhere to the option of resistance. If the conditions for liberating Palestine are not available today, then we must prepare and prepare for tomorrow and the day after.  He stressed: Betting on international institutions and the so-called international community, as you have witnessed and we have witnessed repeatedly, is a failed and disappointing bet that has produced nothing but heartbreak, loss, disappointment and bitterness, adding that these international institutions are out of the bet because they are dependent on the will of the American administration, and the last farce and complicity of these institutions was the decision. Which condemned Yemen for its targeting of Israeli ships in defense of Gaza and legitimized the American-British targeting of the Ansar Allah brothers and ignored with all insolence and malice two million Palestinian citizens who were martyred, wounded, detained, hungry, thirsty, and displaced in the open, as a result of Israeli massacres and attacks.  He said: From your blessed conference, I extend my thanks to the brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the leadership and people, for their pioneering and supportive stances, and for the authentic and wise stances of His Eminence the Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (may his soul rest in peace), and I thank your conference, your stance, and your support for the resistance.  He stressed: The pledge of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon is to remain in the position of supporting Gaza until the victory of Gaza. We pledged to our great Imam Khomeini (may God sanctify his secret) that we would keep his commandments, abide by his path, and continue on his path, the outcome of which would be nothing but victory, pride, and dignity. It is noteworthy that the twelfth international forum, Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, continues its work with the participation of a group of families of resistance martyrs, martyrs of defenders of the holy shrines, nuclear martyrs, elite officials and military leaders, guests from the Global Resistance Front, and activists in the field of the Palestinian cause.   Allied for Democracy   		    Israelis gathered in downtown Tel Aviv to protest the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu's government in managing the war on Gaza. The protesters raised banners demanding the dismissal of the Israeli government, immediate elections, and the formation of a new government seeking what they described as unifying the Israeli ranks. This comes as the families of the prisoners continue to demonstrate in front of Netanyahus house in Caesarea as an attempt to pressure him to conclude a deal to release their detained children in the Gaza Strip.  		    		  		Chief of Staff of the Israeli army, Herzi Halevy, said that some reserve forces are being demobilized due to what he called the tension of the battlefield and the demands of life. Recently, Israeli media reports reported the demobilization of reserve units to reintegrate them into the economic cycle in view of the damage caused to the Israeli economy as a result of the war on Gaza, while official statements reported the withdrawal of some forces from the Gaza Strip, including a unit in the Golani Brigade .    The Israeli Walla website revealed that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tried to storm Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office , and the situation almost deteriorated into a fist fight. Gallant threatened Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to bring in the Golani Brigade to control the situation in the war council. Dermer, who renounced his American citizenship to serve as economic envoy in Washington before becoming ambassador there, is considered one of Netanyahu's closest associates.  According to the Walla website, Netanyahu's crew monitored Gallant's crew while recording the course of the security meetings on an audio tape. Israeli media reported that Gallant left the war cabinet meeting last Saturday because his office director was prevented from attending, amid increasing tension within the council. At the time, Israeli Channel 12 quoted a source as saying that the ministers withdrawal came after he arrived at the meeting headquarters and his assistant was prevented from entering with him, but when he entered the room he found 5 of Netanyahus aides.  The source added, ""Netanyahu told Gallant that as long as my assistant did not attend, your assistant should not attend, despite the presence of 5 of his employees in the place,"" and this is what prompted the Defense Minister to withdraw. According to the channel, Netanyahu believes that the army is leaking some information related to the bilateral talks or discussions. As the Walla website reported, Gallant sometimes refrains from answering calls from Netanyahus office for entire days. The Israeli Channel 13 revealed that Gallant asked Netanyahu not to ""disrupt"" his work within the government.   In a related context, the British newspaper The Times reported, quoting an unnamed Israeli security official, that the Israeli war government is on the verge of collapse and Netanyahu is hesitating and wasting time. During recent months, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Gallant and Netanyahu, related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  Many Israeli analysts point out that each member of the War Council only thinks about his political future and not Israel's interests. Ofer Shelah, a researcher at the National Security Research Institute, believes that the members of the War Council have been preparing themselves for the aftermath of the war since the first day of the war, and this is because the ghost of October 7th is haunting them, and each one of them is running ugly media campaigns on satellite channels saying that he is doing well but the others are wrong.     The intensity of the differences within the Israeli government and war council widened, after more than 100 days of war on the Gaza Strip, while voices calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down grew louder. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted Gadi Eisenkot, former chief of staff of the Israeli army and minister in the Israeli War Council, as saying that the behavior of the Israeli government before and after October 7, 2023 is characterized by a major failure. It added that Netanyahu and everyone who was in a military and political position on the seventh of last October and 10 years before that bears a clear responsibility, and that the Israeli leadership is not telling the truth to the people.  For its part, the New York Times quoted Eisenkot as saying that Israel did not overthrow the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved, indicating that reaching an agreement with Hamas is the only way to release the detainees. He stressed that every effort should have been made to maintain the temporary ceasefire last November. Eisenkot promised that his presence in the emergency government prevented the outbreak of a comprehensive war with the Lebanese Hezbollah , which would not have represented a grave strategic mistake, as he put it. Earlier, Eisenkot said that Tel Aviv must stop lying to itself, and conclude a deal that returns those detained by the Palestinian factions, instead of continuing the war on the Gaza Strip.  For his part, the head of the Yisrael Beytenu party ,  Avigdor Lieberman , said  that the current Israeli government is no longer capable of leading the people, indicating the necessity of forming a new government.  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted a source in the security mini-ministerial council as saying that there is no future for the war on the Gaza Strip. He added that Netanyahu is clearly stalling to buy time, and is evading responsibility, as he put it. For his part, opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israeli Radio that Netanyahu does not care about the State of Israel, and that all he cares about are his personal political interests, and he must be changed quickly.  A few days ago, the participation of Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz in a massive demonstration in Tel Aviv opposing the government and attacking its handling of the issue of Israeli prisoners in Gaza raised many questions about the cohesion of the Israeli government after more than 100 days of war. Recently, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Netanyahu and his Defense Minister  Yoav Galant , related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  These tensions in the government coincide with the demonstrations taking place in various areas in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, demanding that the Israeli government conclude a deal to release detainees held by the resistance in Gaza. The families of Israeli detainees in the Gaza Strip said that they had lost confidence in Netanyahu's government, and that they would make their own moves, without indicating what they were, according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority.  According to political analysts, there is a widespread belief that Netanyahu is running this war for personal political motives, and his opponents do not just accuse him of failing to achieve any of its goals; But also by falling hostage to the far-right ministers whose presence he buys at any cost, so that the government, whose popularity polls indicate a decline in popularity, does not collapse.        		  The Israeli newspaper ""Israel Today"" said that the administration of US President Joe Biden is currently working on formulating a major regional deal to stop the war in the Gaza Strip and reduce tension in the region. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Israeli source as saying that the deal includes a ceasefire, the establishment of a new regime in the Gaza Strip, the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world, and the release of prisoners.  The newspaper said that the aforementioned Israeli source confirmed that the deal includes several principles aimed at achieving long-term stability as part of the post-war reality. It pointed out that the deal is part of what US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke about at the Davos Forum this week when he said that Israel needs to make difficult decisions.   The newspaper pointed out that the deal is still in its initial stages, and it is not yet clear how much of it has been formulated, or whether it will lead to an agreement that will end the war and launch a political process to resolve the conflict. So far, no official comment has been issued by the concerned parties regarding what was revealed in the Israeli newspaper report.  Talk about this deal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced yesterday that he informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any scenario for the post-war period in Gaza, and his insistence on continuing the war in the Gaza Strip until victory over the Hamas movement, which is a position that contradicts the American desire.   The United States called on Israel to reduce its attack on Gaza, and said that the establishment of a Palestinian state must be part of the post-war phase, which Netanyahu announced his explicit rejection of, demanding full Israeli control over the Strip.    The American network ""NBC News"" reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rapidly losing the support of American lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the network, supporters of Israel in both the Democratic and Republican parties are sounding the alarm about their loss of confidence in Netanyahu and his handling of the war against the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip.  The network indicated that one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose name was not revealed, said, It has become difficult to defend Netanyahu or justify his political strategy, and that there is a real lack of confidence in his leadership, not to mention questions about his ability to lead. The same source added, ""He believes on a personal level that Netanyahu's political interest is to remain involved in the conflict, whether it is with Hezbollah or in Gaza, since any ceasefire, peace agreement, efforts to rebuild, or going out of the way will harm him."" ""Politically.""  She pointed out that progressive lawmakers in the US Congress constantly criticize Netanyahu and the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, but now these criticisms are coming from pro-Israel lawmakers who work on the main national security committees, and they are now expressing their frustration about Netanyahus leadership, albeit quietly. The network touched on the statements of 3 American lawmakers who wonder whether the 74-year-old Netanyahu has a strategy to end the bloody war in Gaza, and they indicated that the unpopular Netanyahu may be deliberately trying to prolong it in order to remain in power.  Earlier, NBC reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu rejected US Secretary of State  Anthony Blinken's proposal for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper revealed that the United States warned the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel's long-term security will only be guaranteed through the establishment of a Palestinian state . The newspaper said, quoting Reuters, that US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that there is no way to solve Israels security problems in the long term, as well as organize the Gaza reconstruction process at the end of the war, without establishing a Palestinian state.     		  The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that Israel should have security control over Gaza after the war, in the context of conflicting statements between Washington and Tel Aviv regarding plans after the end of the fighting. The Bureau denied the content of a CNN report that stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed US President Joe Biden - in a phone call yesterday, Friday - that he did not rule out the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state.  The Israeli statement said, ""During his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after the destruction of Hamas, Israel must maintain security control over Gaza to ensure that it will no longer pose a threat to Israel, which is inconsistent with the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""   This is a rare statement from the Prime Ministers Office, which usually avoids making a statement on the holy Sabbath holiday for religious Jews, and it came hours after a call made by Biden and Netanyahu on Friday, their first in nearly a month. Biden said after the call that the Israeli Prime Minister does not oppose all solutions based on two states, considering that the matter is not impossible with Netanyahu in power. The US President indicated that there are ""a number of possible patterns"" for this solution, and that some UN member states do not have armed forces, in reference to the possibility of establishing a demilitarized Palestinian state.  White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Netanyahu had been trying to arrange the phone call for some time, denying that it was a reaction to statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister - the day before yesterday, Thursday - in which he expressed his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Netanyahu stated that he informed Washington of his opposition to any Palestinian state that does not guarantee the security of Israel, as he put it. He said, ""Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. This is a necessary condition.""  On the other hand, Hamas rejected the US President's statements regarding ""possible patterns"" for establishing a Palestinian state. A member of the movement's political bureau, Izzat Al-Rishq said in a statement that ""selling the illusion that Biden is trying to talk about a Palestinian state (...) does not deceive our people."" Al-Rishq added, ""Biden is a full partner in the war of genocide, and our people do not expect anything good from him."" He said, ""These people think of themselves as the guardians of the Palestinian people. They want to choose for them the type of state that suits them.""  For its part, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry confirmed its refusal to comment on the Israeli Prime Ministers Office on press reports regarding Biden and Netanyahus call. The Ministry stressed in a statement that repeating these statements and demanding Israeli security control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a blatant challenge to the declared positions of the American administration and its efforts to resolve the conflict and achieve security and stability in the region.  Israel continues its war on Gaza for the 106th day with broad political and military support from the United States, which supplies it with thousands of tons of weapons and ammunition via an air bridge. But there are discrepancies between Biden and Netanyahu regarding the management of the war and plans for the so-called next day after the end of the fighting, especially in light of the failure to achieve the main declared goals of the war, which are the elimination of Hamas and the recovery of Israeli prisoners.  Netanyahu is also facing escalating internal disputes, as the official Israeli radio quoted senior security and military leaders as agreeing with the ministers, Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, and Yoav Galant, that the absence of a political vision for the day after the war on Gaza will prevent Israels victory over Hamas.      		    The British Financial Times newspaper explained that US President Joe Biden's strong support for Israel risks harming his re-election prospects for a new presidential term, explaining that his apparent indifference to the Palestinians may be costly. Writer Edward Luce mentioned in his article that thousands of children were killed in the war on Gaza , according to Save the Children. However, Bidens recent statement calling on the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) to release the hostages did not refer to what the Palestinians are suffering.  He added that acknowledging the plight of the Palestinians seems to cast doubt on Biden's ""sincere sympathy for the Israeli victims in the attack launched by Hamas on October 7,"" so Washington avoids it, knowing that this upsets many young Americans who will need Biden badly. To their enthusiasm next November, it will also disturb the Arab Americans, who constitute a major voting bloc in many swing states.  The writer explained that progressive Democrats are not the only ones who feel dissatisfied with Biden's silence regarding what Israel is doing, as many of his most trusted allies in the US Senate are also upset.  In a meeting in Davos this week, the US Senator from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, and Biden's closest friend in politics, said that the United States should consider setting conditions on military aid to Israel. In a letter to Biden before Christmas, a group of Democrats - some of them former CIA employees - urged the use of influence for an immediate and significant shift in military strategy and tactics in Gaza.  The writer stated that White House officials insist that Biden is secretly doing what he can to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but there is little evidence to prove this. Israel has received more than 100 bunker-busting bombs from the United States since October 7, noting that these bombs are intended for destruction and not for precise targeting of terrorists in urban areas.  The writer believes that the answer is summed up in Bidens deep feelings towards Israel. Since his first days in politics, he was one of its strongest allies in the Capitol , and he has always admired the approach of both Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin, but now he faces a contradictory model represented by Benjamin Netanyahu, and despite this, he continues. In support.  Edward Luce said that Biden was a strong critic of the efforts of US President George H.W. Bush for the peace process in 1992 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . He also attacked Bush Sr.'s threat to withdraw American loan guarantees if Israel went ahead with building settlements in the occupied territories. The pressure exerted by Bush helped overthrow the Likud government in Israel at the time and bring Rabin to power, and this led to the Oslo Peace Accords, explains Edward Luce.  According to the article, Biden - while serving as vice president - had undermined President Barack Obama's attempt in 2010 to apply similar pressure on Netanyahu's government, and partly because of Biden's own reassurances, the Israeli prime minister mocked Obama.  The writer emphasized that Biden could oust Netanyahu by imposing strict conditions on American aid if he wanted to, and in doing so he would gain the respect of the Israelis, the Arab world, and the majority of Jewish Americans. This would also make him regain some of the ground that Washington lost in the global South because of its double standards. A large part of the world believes that America cares more about European victims such as the Ukrainians than it does about civilians in the Middle East or anywhere else.  The writer emphasized that the longer Netanyahu clings to power, the worse it will be for Biden. However, it appears that Biden's actions were designed to ensure this.    		  		  The American website The Intercept confirmed in a report that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) donated about $95,000 to Republican Representative Mike Johnson last November, according to the websites analysis of Federal Election Commission records. The Intercept added in a report by journalist Catherine Caruso that the pro-Israel lobby is considered the largest donor to Johnson in 2023 after he led the passage of a large aid package for Israel.  The Intercept said that most of the payments received by the US representative came after the beginning of the war on Gaza. According to the website, Johnson - who refused to speak to The Intercept - received small donations in late October, which quickly increased significantly during the month of November.  The Intercept confirmed that this increase came after Johnson led the passage of significant support for Israel, estimated at $14 billion, when he presided over the House of Representatives, where he struggled to accelerate the passage of that support by separating it from the bill to provide aid allocated to Ukraine, and resorting to using IRS funds to finance it. Once the bill passed the House, Johnson urged the Senate to approve it as quickly as possible.  The website confirmed that Johnson has always expressed his direct public support for Israel, and he previously confirmed on a trip to Israel in 2020 that it is not true that the Palestinians suffer from injustice in the region, and he continued, ""We never see any of that.""   The website confirmed that AIPAC is considered an influential intermediary in the Capitol , as it provides money to legislators from the Republican and Democratic parties in order to continue maintaining pro-Israel policies, and in the recent period the organization has focused on members of the Democratic Party who are critical of Tel Avivs policies.  The Intercept quoted the head of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby, as saying that AIPAC's contributions to election campaigns have two purposes, the first of which is to reward candidates who support Israel's interests, and the second is to use them as a stick to keep politicians aligned in one row. On foreign policy, this is probably the single issue where money has the biggest negative impact, said Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard Kennedy School.  Even as a growing number of Democrats are willing to buck the pro-Israel consensus in Washington and reject AIPAC's influence, they still suffer from a significant lack of resources, according to the American website. The problem, Walt told The Intercept, is that there are no similar groups on the other side, as no pro-Palestinian or pro-Arab-American PAC has the same resources.    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 24,927  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,388. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th to 195, and 529 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of the same month. Among them are 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that 2,438 soldiers - including 355 seriously injured - have been injured since the beginning of the war on Gaza, including earlier reports of 576 moderate, and 1,161 minor. The number of wounded since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip on October 27 had risen to 1,042.  At least 13,340 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	The New York Times quoted Israeli military commanders as saying that retrieving the hostages is possible through diplomatic, not military, means. Israeli military leaders added to the newspaper that recovering the hostages and destroying Hamas have now become incompatible goals, and that the long battle aimed at destroying Hamas will likely cost the lives of the hostages. Israeli leaders stressed that the diplomatic path to recovering the hostages would be the fastest method. They said the strategic impasse exacerbated the military's frustration about the indecision of the political leadership. The Israeli military expressed to the newspaper their fear that the length of the military campaign, without a post-war plan, would lead to the erosion of allied support.  On the other hand, the New York Times said that it had seen documents indicating that Israel had imposed its control in Gaza on a smaller portion than it had envisioned in the battle plans since the beginning of the war. The documents indicated that Israeli plans included controlling the cities of Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah by late December.      	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper revealed that Egypt is taking steps to reach a new agreement, which includes concluding a long truce, through which a number of prisoners from both the Palestinian and Israeli sides will be exchanged. The newspaper quoted informed Egyptian sources as saying that the proposal being consulted on takes into account the interests of various parties, and takes into account the current difficulties and declared positions.
The sources indicated that the new proposal will not be a substitute for the comprehensive Egyptian proposal to stop the war and arrangements for the next stage, but rather it will be part of the efforts to create the atmosphere to stop the fighting, alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip, and then move to the next stage. It added that Egypt received positive indicators despite the difficulty of the current situation, but the final crystallization of the agreement is still in the maturation stage, according to the sources.
Several European countries witnessed massive demonstrations in solidarity with  the Gaza Strip  and calling for an end to  the Israeli aggression against the Strip  that has been ongoing since the seventh of last October, which claimed the lives of more than 24,000 martyrs and more than 62,000 wounded, most of whom were children and women.
The Palestinian journalist residing in  Berlin, Majid Al-Zeer, said that the demonstrations that took place today in the German capital, Berlin, have been continuing for 105 consecutive days in victory for the Palestinian right, and 19 other demonstrations were also launched throughout  Germany , as well as in most European countries, in denunciation of the European policy towards the aggression against the Gaza Strip. Gaza.
During the  Non-Aligned Movement summit in Uganda , United Nations Secretary-General  Antonio Guterres stressed  the necessity of recognizing the right of the Palestinians to build their state, in light of a stream of statements by Israeli officials and ministers who expressed their categorical rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state. Guterres said in his speech at the summit  that ""refusing to accept a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and denying the right of the Palestinian people to establish a state, is unacceptable.""


Axis of Resistance   The Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said: The Al-Aqsa Flood has engraved itself deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has collapsed, and the issue that they worked so long to stifle has returned to the top of all the worlds merits.  In a letter addressed by Sayyed Nasrallah to the Twelfth International Forum,  Gaza: Symbol of Resistance , which was read by Mr. Abdullah Safi al-Din , representative of Hezbollah Lebanon in Tehran : Titled your conference with the slogan Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, and timing it at a crucial historical stage that is going through In which the Palestinian resistance is a major confrontation to the Zionist war of annihilation, it only demonstrates the sense of responsibility of those involved in managing the conference and their blessed call to stand by the Palestinian people, their cause, and their resistance, which requires all of us to have grave responsibilities and constant alert to mobilize the nations capabilities in support of the Palestinian people and in support of their valiant resistance that is being written today. Truly, through its sacrifices, its heroism, the blood of its men, and the steadfastness and steadfastness of its people, it creates the future of the nation, preserves its dignity, and consolidates its strength.  He added that what Israel has lost to date in Gaza in terms of officers and soldiers at the hands of Palestinian resistance groups is many times greater than what it lost in the 1967 War. The Israeli army, which occupied more than 69,000 km2 in the Six-Day War, is being defeated today over part of the Gaza area. It is unable to achieve a goal, declare an occupation, or come close to victory. Rather, it retreats and retreats under the title of moving to a new stage. Therefore, it is natural and correct for the conferences slogan to be Gaza is a symbol of resistance. Gaza today is the symbol because in Gaza there is an honorable, brave and proud resistance.  He explained: Gaza is the symbol because it expresses, through its resistance, the pride, pride, pride, ambitions and hopes of our peoples who are thirsty for pride and victory. If Gaza had not resisted, it would not have been a symbol and symbol of pride. Resistance is what honors its people and the bearers of its banner. Resistance is the secret of pride, the secret of dignity, and the key to victory. Gaza is geographically small, but it is gigantic in its magnificence and heroism. Today, Gaza is more generous, more powerful, and prouder than the entire world.  He said: Since the occupation of Palestine, the enemy and its masters have worked on two paths. The first is the path of legitimizing the occupation internationally and polishing its image and demonstrating it as a model civilized entity that can be emulated as a role model for the region. In the first track, they recorded outstanding successes due to the capabilities they possess and their dominance over major international institutions and the Wests regimes and its effective and influential forces. As for the other path, its conclusion was to weaken and stifle the resistance of the Palestinian people and liquidate its cause, leading to its removal from the arena of global circulation by relying on force to eliminate the resistance forces and relying on the option of normalization, which guaranteed them the removal of influential regimes from the arena of confrontation.  He continued, saying: The option of normalization was and remains a project to subjugate the will of the nation... a project to waste its central cause, and a project to shatter the unity of its options until the issue of Palestine, which is the issue of the nation, almost turned into an exclusive Palestinian issue, an orphan, a stranger, a stranger among its people, its people, and its brothers. The choice of normalization with the enemy has placed the Palestinian cause and the right of the Palestinian people to their land in the circle of targeting, or even in the circle of imminent danger, and on a downward path that warns of every danger due to the connivance and betrayal of the Palestinian people that normalization with the enemy entails, and the abandonment of their right, their cause, their resistance, and their future.  He said: At this fatal moment, the flood of Al-Aqsa resistance came to shuffle all the cards, change all calculations, and turn the threat into an advanced existential opportunity and a turning point in the paths that the enemies had worked on for a long time. The flood has engraved deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has been shattered, and the issue that they had worked so long to stifle has returned to the forefront of all the worlds merits, to awaken the world once again, to restore momentum and a resounding presence, and to reveal itself as a global issue. Extensive and present in all geography of the world and its corridors.  He added: The resisting flood of Al-Aqsa dealt a harsh blow to all attempts to write off the Palestine issue and confirmed that the issue that was conspired against by many of the West and many of the East, many of the far away and many of the closest ones, would not have survived without its resistance, its rifle and its sacrifices. No one has a presence in this brutal, brutal world except to the extent of his resistance, and if the truth is armed with strength, faith, and the will to resist and persevere, it cannot be defeated, no matter how oppressive and powerful the enemy is.  He said that the Israeli enemy, which today continues with massacres and crimes, killing tens of thousands of children and women, waging a comprehensive war of annihilation against humans, stones and life, and committing atrocities that are the greatest in modern history, is doing all of this to cover up defeats with massacres and to take away, with images of massacres and destruction, the humiliated image of Israel on the Day of Judgment. October 7, and to take revenge for destabilizing his project, to which he and his masters have made every effort for more than 50 years.  He added: In its attack on our region, the West, led by the United States of America and Britain, has exhausted the body and thought of the nation, length and breadth, with projects of fragmentation, misinformation, deception, and fragmentation, aided by brute tools, sinful pens, hired voices, and hired minds. It has torn apart, with sectarianism, racism, and sectarianism, a unified whole, and deepened the fragmentation of every fragmented one, so the nations commonalities were absent. The great ones are in favor of their small differences at a stage in which the nations identity, capabilities, role and existence are exposed to profound and stormy dangers... They have worked to tear our peoples apart and preoccupy them with issues of fragmentation, but Palestine alone remains a valve of unity, a path of convergence, a base for revival, and a crossing path to the future that our peoples yearn for, a future. Strength, pride, freedom, sovereignty, stability and well-being.  He stated: After decades of focused efforts, with full American and Western support, to dismember, fragment, and dissolve the Palestinian issue, victory for Gaza came from the arenas of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen, broader than the enemys expectations, and the resistance factions succeeded in besieging the usurping entity with fire for more than 100 days. This is unprecedented.  He stressed that the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Lebanon, the blood of the martyrs of defending Gaza in Syria, the blood of martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iraq, the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Yemen, and the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iran, the last of which was the blood of Major General Sayyed Radhi al-Moussawi, all these bloods unite, coalesce and integrate. With the blood of the martyrs of Gaza and the West Bank. It is the unity of blood, rifle, arena and target, which is what worries our enemies, and which is what we must continue and work to increase, deepen and extend. Whoever believes that this nation has an option other than resistance is wrong and very, very delusional.  He said: Israel did not occupy Palestine with diplomacy, but with weapons and force, and it did not occupy Beirut in 1982 with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. It does not threaten the nation today with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. Israel was not defeated from Lebanon in 1982 by diplomacy, but rather by resistance, just as it will not be defeated from Gaza and Palestine by diplomacy, but by resistance. We, as a nation, have no choice but to resist. We have nothing but resistance. There is nothing we can bet on but resistance.  He added that the confrontation with the enemy is not a confrontation for one or two days, but rather it is an ongoing, continuous and cumulative confrontation, and we must remain present in this confrontation. The gathering of the fleets of arrogant countries in support of Israel only confirms its weakness and instability, which must harden our will to adhere to the option of resistance. If the conditions for liberating Palestine are not available today, then we must prepare and prepare for tomorrow and the day after.  He stressed: Betting on international institutions and the so-called international community, as you have witnessed and we have witnessed repeatedly, is a failed and disappointing bet that has produced nothing but heartbreak, loss, disappointment and bitterness, adding that these international institutions are out of the bet because they are dependent on the will of the American administration, and the last farce and complicity of these institutions was the decision. Which condemned Yemen for its targeting of Israeli ships in defense of Gaza and legitimized the American-British targeting of the Ansar Allah brothers and ignored with all insolence and malice two million Palestinian citizens who were martyred, wounded, detained, hungry, thirsty, and displaced in the open, as a result of Israeli massacres and attacks.  He said: From your blessed conference, I extend my thanks to the brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the leadership and people, for their pioneering and supportive stances, and for the authentic and wise stances of His Eminence the Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (may his soul rest in peace), and I thank your conference, your stance, and your support for the resistance.  He stressed: The pledge of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon is to remain in the position of supporting Gaza until the victory of Gaza. We pledged to our great Imam Khomeini (may God sanctify his secret) that we would keep his commandments, abide by his path, and continue on his path, the outcome of which would be nothing but victory, pride, and dignity. It is noteworthy that the twelfth international forum, Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, continues its work with the participation of a group of families of resistance martyrs, martyrs of defenders of the holy shrines, nuclear martyrs, elite officials and military leaders, guests from the Global Resistance Front, and activists in the field of the Palestinian cause.   Allied for Democracy   		    Israelis gathered in downtown Tel Aviv to protest the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu's government in managing the war on Gaza. The protesters raised banners demanding the dismissal of the Israeli government, immediate elections, and the formation of a new government seeking what they described as unifying the Israeli ranks. This comes as the families of the prisoners continue to demonstrate in front of Netanyahus house in Caesarea as an attempt to pressure him to conclude a deal to release their detained children in the Gaza Strip.  		    		  		Chief of Staff of the Israeli army, Herzi Halevy, said that some reserve forces are being demobilized due to what he called the tension of the battlefield and the demands of life. Recently, Israeli media reports reported the demobilization of reserve units to reintegrate them into the economic cycle in view of the damage caused to the Israeli economy as a result of the war on Gaza, while official statements reported the withdrawal of some forces from the Gaza Strip, including a unit in the Golani Brigade .    The Israeli Walla website revealed that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tried to storm Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office , and the situation almost deteriorated into a fist fight. Gallant threatened Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to bring in the Golani Brigade to control the situation in the war council. Dermer, who renounced his American citizenship to serve as economic envoy in Washington before becoming ambassador there, is considered one of Netanyahu's closest associates.  According to the Walla website, Netanyahu's crew monitored Gallant's crew while recording the course of the security meetings on an audio tape. Israeli media reported that Gallant left the war cabinet meeting last Saturday because his office director was prevented from attending, amid increasing tension within the council. At the time, Israeli Channel 12 quoted a source as saying that the ministers withdrawal came after he arrived at the meeting headquarters and his assistant was prevented from entering with him, but when he entered the room he found 5 of Netanyahus aides.  The source added, ""Netanyahu told Gallant that as long as my assistant did not attend, your assistant should not attend, despite the presence of 5 of his employees in the place,"" and this is what prompted the Defense Minister to withdraw. According to the channel, Netanyahu believes that the army is leaking some information related to the bilateral talks or discussions. As the Walla website reported, Gallant sometimes refrains from answering calls from Netanyahus office for entire days. The Israeli Channel 13 revealed that Gallant asked Netanyahu not to ""disrupt"" his work within the government.   In a related context, the British newspaper The Times reported, quoting an unnamed Israeli security official, that the Israeli war government is on the verge of collapse and Netanyahu is hesitating and wasting time. During recent months, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Gallant and Netanyahu, related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  Many Israeli analysts point out that each member of the War Council only thinks about his political future and not Israel's interests. Ofer Shelah, a researcher at the National Security Research Institute, believes that the members of the War Council have been preparing themselves for the aftermath of the war since the first day of the war, and this is because the ghost of October 7th is haunting them, and each one of them is running ugly media campaigns on satellite channels saying that he is doing well but the others are wrong.     The intensity of the differences within the Israeli government and war council widened, after more than 100 days of war on the Gaza Strip, while voices calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down grew louder. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted Gadi Eisenkot, former chief of staff of the Israeli army and minister in the Israeli War Council, as saying that the behavior of the Israeli government before and after October 7, 2023 is characterized by a major failure. It added that Netanyahu and everyone who was in a military and political position on the seventh of last October and 10 years before that bears a clear responsibility, and that the Israeli leadership is not telling the truth to the people.  For its part, the New York Times quoted Eisenkot as saying that Israel did not overthrow the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved, indicating that reaching an agreement with Hamas is the only way to release the detainees. He stressed that every effort should have been made to maintain the temporary ceasefire last November. Eisenkot promised that his presence in the emergency government prevented the outbreak of a comprehensive war with the Lebanese Hezbollah , which would not have represented a grave strategic mistake, as he put it. Earlier, Eisenkot said that Tel Aviv must stop lying to itself, and conclude a deal that returns those detained by the Palestinian factions, instead of continuing the war on the Gaza Strip.  For his part, the head of the Yisrael Beytenu party ,  Avigdor Lieberman , said  that the current Israeli government is no longer capable of leading the people, indicating the necessity of forming a new government.  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted a source in the security mini-ministerial council as saying that there is no future for the war on the Gaza Strip. He added that Netanyahu is clearly stalling to buy time, and is evading responsibility, as he put it. For his part, opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israeli Radio that Netanyahu does not care about the State of Israel, and that all he cares about are his personal political interests, and he must be changed quickly.  A few days ago, the participation of Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz in a massive demonstration in Tel Aviv opposing the government and attacking its handling of the issue of Israeli prisoners in Gaza raised many questions about the cohesion of the Israeli government after more than 100 days of war. Recently, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Netanyahu and his Defense Minister  Yoav Galant , related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  These tensions in the government coincide with the demonstrations taking place in various areas in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, demanding that the Israeli government conclude a deal to release detainees held by the resistance in Gaza. The families of Israeli detainees in the Gaza Strip said that they had lost confidence in Netanyahu's government, and that they would make their own moves, without indicating what they were, according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority.  According to political analysts, there is a widespread belief that Netanyahu is running this war for personal political motives, and his opponents do not just accuse him of failing to achieve any of its goals; But also by falling hostage to the far-right ministers whose presence he buys at any cost, so that the government, whose popularity polls indicate a decline in popularity, does not collapse.        		  The Israeli newspaper ""Israel Today"" said that the administration of US President Joe Biden is currently working on formulating a major regional deal to stop the war in the Gaza Strip and reduce tension in the region. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Israeli source as saying that the deal includes a ceasefire, the establishment of a new regime in the Gaza Strip, the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world, and the release of prisoners.  The newspaper said that the aforementioned Israeli source confirmed that the deal includes several principles aimed at achieving long-term stability as part of the post-war reality. It pointed out that the deal is part of what US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke about at the Davos Forum this week when he said that Israel needs to make difficult decisions.   The newspaper pointed out that the deal is still in its initial stages, and it is not yet clear how much of it has been formulated, or whether it will lead to an agreement that will end the war and launch a political process to resolve the conflict. So far, no official comment has been issued by the concerned parties regarding what was revealed in the Israeli newspaper report.  Talk about this deal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced yesterday that he informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any scenario for the post-war period in Gaza, and his insistence on continuing the war in the Gaza Strip until victory over the Hamas movement, which is a position that contradicts the American desire.   The United States called on Israel to reduce its attack on Gaza, and said that the establishment of a Palestinian state must be part of the post-war phase, which Netanyahu announced his explicit rejection of, demanding full Israeli control over the Strip.    The American network ""NBC News"" reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rapidly losing the support of American lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the network, supporters of Israel in both the Democratic and Republican parties are sounding the alarm about their loss of confidence in Netanyahu and his handling of the war against the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip.  The network indicated that one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose name was not revealed, said, It has become difficult to defend Netanyahu or justify his political strategy, and that there is a real lack of confidence in his leadership, not to mention questions about his ability to lead. The same source added, ""He believes on a personal level that Netanyahu's political interest is to remain involved in the conflict, whether it is with Hezbollah or in Gaza, since any ceasefire, peace agreement, efforts to rebuild, or going out of the way will harm him."" ""Politically.""  She pointed out that progressive lawmakers in the US Congress constantly criticize Netanyahu and the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, but now these criticisms are coming from pro-Israel lawmakers who work on the main national security committees, and they are now expressing their frustration about Netanyahus leadership, albeit quietly. The network touched on the statements of 3 American lawmakers who wonder whether the 74-year-old Netanyahu has a strategy to end the bloody war in Gaza, and they indicated that the unpopular Netanyahu may be deliberately trying to prolong it in order to remain in power.  Earlier, NBC reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu rejected US Secretary of State  Anthony Blinken's proposal for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper revealed that the United States warned the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel's long-term security will only be guaranteed through the establishment of a Palestinian state . The newspaper said, quoting Reuters, that US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that there is no way to solve Israels security problems in the long term, as well as organize the Gaza reconstruction process at the end of the war, without establishing a Palestinian state.     		  The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that Israel should have security control over Gaza after the war, in the context of conflicting statements between Washington and Tel Aviv regarding plans after the end of the fighting. The Bureau denied the content of a CNN report that stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed US President Joe Biden - in a phone call yesterday, Friday - that he did not rule out the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state.  The Israeli statement said, ""During his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after the destruction of Hamas, Israel must maintain security control over Gaza to ensure that it will no longer pose a threat to Israel, which is inconsistent with the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""   This is a rare statement from the Prime Ministers Office, which usually avoids making a statement on the holy Sabbath holiday for religious Jews, and it came hours after a call made by Biden and Netanyahu on Friday, their first in nearly a month. Biden said after the call that the Israeli Prime Minister does not oppose all solutions based on two states, considering that the matter is not impossible with Netanyahu in power. The US President indicated that there are ""a number of possible patterns"" for this solution, and that some UN member states do not have armed forces, in reference to the possibility of establishing a demilitarized Palestinian state.  White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Netanyahu had been trying to arrange the phone call for some time, denying that it was a reaction to statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister - the day before yesterday, Thursday - in which he expressed his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Netanyahu stated that he informed Washington of his opposition to any Palestinian state that does not guarantee the security of Israel, as he put it. He said, ""Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. This is a necessary condition.""  On the other hand, Hamas rejected the US President's statements regarding ""possible patterns"" for establishing a Palestinian state. A member of the movement's political bureau, Izzat Al-Rishq said in a statement that ""selling the illusion that Biden is trying to talk about a Palestinian state (...) does not deceive our people."" Al-Rishq added, ""Biden is a full partner in the war of genocide, and our people do not expect anything good from him."" He said, ""These people think of themselves as the guardians of the Palestinian people. They want to choose for them the type of state that suits them.""  For its part, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry confirmed its refusal to comment on the Israeli Prime Ministers Office on press reports regarding Biden and Netanyahus call. The Ministry stressed in a statement that repeating these statements and demanding Israeli security control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a blatant challenge to the declared positions of the American administration and its efforts to resolve the conflict and achieve security and stability in the region.  Israel continues its war on Gaza for the 106th day with broad political and military support from the United States, which supplies it with thousands of tons of weapons and ammunition via an air bridge. But there are discrepancies between Biden and Netanyahu regarding the management of the war and plans for the so-called next day after the end of the fighting, especially in light of the failure to achieve the main declared goals of the war, which are the elimination of Hamas and the recovery of Israeli prisoners.  Netanyahu is also facing escalating internal disputes, as the official Israeli radio quoted senior security and military leaders as agreeing with the ministers, Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, and Yoav Galant, that the absence of a political vision for the day after the war on Gaza will prevent Israels victory over Hamas.      		    The British Financial Times newspaper explained that US President Joe Biden's strong support for Israel risks harming his re-election prospects for a new presidential term, explaining that his apparent indifference to the Palestinians may be costly. Writer Edward Luce mentioned in his article that thousands of children were killed in the war on Gaza , according to Save the Children. However, Bidens recent statement calling on the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) to release the hostages did not refer to what the Palestinians are suffering.  He added that acknowledging the plight of the Palestinians seems to cast doubt on Biden's ""sincere sympathy for the Israeli victims in the attack launched by Hamas on October 7,"" so Washington avoids it, knowing that this upsets many young Americans who will need Biden badly. To their enthusiasm next November, it will also disturb the Arab Americans, who constitute a major voting bloc in many swing states.  The writer explained that progressive Democrats are not the only ones who feel dissatisfied with Biden's silence regarding what Israel is doing, as many of his most trusted allies in the US Senate are also upset.  In a meeting in Davos this week, the US Senator from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, and Biden's closest friend in politics, said that the United States should consider setting conditions on military aid to Israel. In a letter to Biden before Christmas, a group of Democrats - some of them former CIA employees - urged the use of influence for an immediate and significant shift in military strategy and tactics in Gaza.  The writer stated that White House officials insist that Biden is secretly doing what he can to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but there is little evidence to prove this. Israel has received more than 100 bunker-busting bombs from the United States since October 7, noting that these bombs are intended for destruction and not for precise targeting of terrorists in urban areas.  The writer believes that the answer is summed up in Bidens deep feelings towards Israel. Since his first days in politics, he was one of its strongest allies in the Capitol , and he has always admired the approach of both Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin, but now he faces a contradictory model represented by Benjamin Netanyahu, and despite this, he continues. In support.  Edward Luce said that Biden was a strong critic of the efforts of US President George H.W. Bush for the peace process in 1992 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . He also attacked Bush Sr.'s threat to withdraw American loan guarantees if Israel went ahead with building settlements in the occupied territories. The pressure exerted by Bush helped overthrow the Likud government in Israel at the time and bring Rabin to power, and this led to the Oslo Peace Accords, explains Edward Luce.  According to the article, Biden - while serving as vice president - had undermined President Barack Obama's attempt in 2010 to apply similar pressure on Netanyahu's government, and partly because of Biden's own reassurances, the Israeli prime minister mocked Obama.  The writer emphasized that Biden could oust Netanyahu by imposing strict conditions on American aid if he wanted to, and in doing so he would gain the respect of the Israelis, the Arab world, and the majority of Jewish Americans. This would also make him regain some of the ground that Washington lost in the global South because of its double standards. A large part of the world believes that America cares more about European victims such as the Ukrainians than it does about civilians in the Middle East or anywhere else.  The writer emphasized that the longer Netanyahu clings to power, the worse it will be for Biden. However, it appears that Biden's actions were designed to ensure this.    		  		  The American website The Intercept confirmed in a report that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) donated about $95,000 to Republican Representative Mike Johnson last November, according to the websites analysis of Federal Election Commission records. The Intercept added in a report by journalist Catherine Caruso that the pro-Israel lobby is considered the largest donor to Johnson in 2023 after he led the passage of a large aid package for Israel.  The Intercept said that most of the payments received by the US representative came after the beginning of the war on Gaza. According to the website, Johnson - who refused to speak to The Intercept - received small donations in late October, which quickly increased significantly during the month of November.  The Intercept confirmed that this increase came after Johnson led the passage of significant support for Israel, estimated at $14 billion, when he presided over the House of Representatives, where he struggled to accelerate the passage of that support by separating it from the bill to provide aid allocated to Ukraine, and resorting to using IRS funds to finance it. Once the bill passed the House, Johnson urged the Senate to approve it as quickly as possible.  The website confirmed that Johnson has always expressed his direct public support for Israel, and he previously confirmed on a trip to Israel in 2020 that it is not true that the Palestinians suffer from injustice in the region, and he continued, ""We never see any of that.""   The website confirmed that AIPAC is considered an influential intermediary in the Capitol , as it provides money to legislators from the Republican and Democratic parties in order to continue maintaining pro-Israel policies, and in the recent period the organization has focused on members of the Democratic Party who are critical of Tel Avivs policies.  The Intercept quoted the head of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby, as saying that AIPAC's contributions to election campaigns have two purposes, the first of which is to reward candidates who support Israel's interests, and the second is to use them as a stick to keep politicians aligned in one row. On foreign policy, this is probably the single issue where money has the biggest negative impact, said Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard Kennedy School.  Even as a growing number of Democrats are willing to buck the pro-Israel consensus in Washington and reject AIPAC's influence, they still suffer from a significant lack of resources, according to the American website. The problem, Walt told The Intercept, is that there are no similar groups on the other side, as no pro-Palestinian or pro-Arab-American PAC has the same resources.    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 24,927  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,388. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th to 195, and 529 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of the same month. Among them are 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that 2,438 soldiers - including 355 seriously injured - have been injured since the beginning of the war on Gaza, including earlier reports of 576 moderate, and 1,161 minor. The number of wounded since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip on October 27 had risen to 1,042.  At least 13,340 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	The New York Times quoted Israeli military commanders as saying that retrieving the hostages is possible through diplomatic, not military, means. Israeli military leaders added to the newspaper that recovering the hostages and destroying Hamas have now become incompatible goals, and that the long battle aimed at destroying Hamas will likely cost the lives of the hostages. Israeli leaders stressed that the diplomatic path to recovering the hostages would be the fastest method. They said the strategic impasse exacerbated the military's frustration about the indecision of the political leadership. The Israeli military expressed to the newspaper their fear that the length of the military campaign, without a post-war plan, would lead to the erosion of allied support.  On the other hand, the New York Times said that it had seen documents indicating that Israel had imposed its control in Gaza on a smaller portion than it had envisioned in the battle plans since the beginning of the war. The documents indicated that Israeli plans included controlling the cities of Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah by late December.      	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
The Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said: The Al-Aqsa Flood has engraved itself deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has collapsed, and the issue that they worked so long to stifle has returned to the top of all the worlds merits.
In a letter addressed by Sayyed Nasrallah to the Twelfth International Forum,  Gaza: Symbol of Resistance , which was read by Mr. Abdullah Safi al-Din , representative of Hezbollah Lebanon in Tehran : Titled your conference with the slogan Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, and timing it at a crucial historical stage that is going through In which the Palestinian resistance is a major confrontation to the Zionist war of annihilation, it only demonstrates the sense of responsibility of those involved in managing the conference and their blessed call to stand by the Palestinian people, their cause, and their resistance, which requires all of us to have grave responsibilities and constant alert to mobilize the nations capabilities in support of the Palestinian people and in support of their valiant resistance that is being written today. Truly, through its sacrifices, its heroism, the blood of its men, and the steadfastness and steadfastness of its people, it creates the future of the nation, preserves its dignity, and consolidates its strength.
He added that what Israel has lost to date in Gaza in terms of officers and soldiers at the hands of Palestinian resistance groups is many times greater than what it lost in the 1967 War. The Israeli army, which occupied more than 69,000 km2 in the Six-Day War, is being defeated today over part of the Gaza area. It is unable to achieve a goal, declare an occupation, or come close to victory. Rather, it retreats and retreats under the title of moving to a new stage. Therefore, it is natural and correct for the conferences slogan to be Gaza is a symbol of resistance. Gaza today is the symbol because in Gaza there is an honorable, brave and proud resistance.
He explained: Gaza is the symbol because it expresses, through its resistance, the pride, pride, pride, ambitions and hopes of our peoples who are thirsty for pride and victory. If Gaza had not resisted, it would not have been a symbol and symbol of pride. Resistance is what honors its people and the bearers of its banner. Resistance is the secret of pride, the secret of dignity, and the key to victory. Gaza is geographically small, but it is gigantic in its magnificence and heroism. Today, Gaza is more generous, more powerful, and prouder than the entire world.
He said: Since the occupation of Palestine, the enemy and its masters have worked on two paths. The first is the path of legitimizing the occupation internationally and polishing its image and demonstrating it as a model civilized entity that can be emulated as a role model for the region. In the first track, they recorded outstanding successes due to the capabilities they possess and their dominance over major international institutions and the Wests regimes and its effective and influential forces. As for the other path, its conclusion was to weaken and stifle the resistance of the Palestinian people and liquidate its cause, leading to its removal from the arena of global circulation by relying on force to eliminate the resistance forces and relying on the option of normalization, which guaranteed them the removal of influential regimes from the arena of confrontation.
He continued, saying: The option of normalization was and remains a project to subjugate the will of the nation... a project to waste its central cause, and a project to shatter the unity of its options until the issue of Palestine, which is the issue of the nation, almost turned into an exclusive Palestinian issue, an orphan, a stranger, a stranger among its people, its people, and its brothers. The choice of normalization with the enemy has placed the Palestinian cause and the right of the Palestinian people to their land in the circle of targeting, or even in the circle of imminent danger, and on a downward path that warns of every danger due to the connivance and betrayal of the Palestinian people that normalization with the enemy entails, and the abandonment of their right, their cause, their resistance, and their future.
He said: At this fatal moment, the flood of Al-Aqsa resistance came to shuffle all the cards, change all calculations, and turn the threat into an advanced existential opportunity and a turning point in the paths that the enemies had worked on for a long time. The flood has engraved deeply in the conscience of the Zionists, a defeat that cannot be erased. The myth has been shattered, the model has been shattered, the prestige has vanished, the project has been shattered, and the issue that they had worked so long to stifle has returned to the forefront of all the worlds merits, to awaken the world once again, to restore momentum and a resounding presence, and to reveal itself as a global issue. Extensive and present in all geography of the world and its corridors.
He added: The resisting flood of Al-Aqsa dealt a harsh blow to all attempts to write off the Palestine issue and confirmed that the issue that was conspired against by many of the West and many of the East, many of the far away and many of the closest ones, would not have survived without its resistance, its rifle and its sacrifices. No one has a presence in this brutal, brutal world except to the extent of his resistance, and if the truth is armed with strength, faith, and the will to resist and persevere, it cannot be defeated, no matter how oppressive and powerful the enemy is.
He said that the Israeli enemy, which today continues with massacres and crimes, killing tens of thousands of children and women, waging a comprehensive war of annihilation against humans, stones and life, and committing atrocities that are the greatest in modern history, is doing all of this to cover up defeats with massacres and to take away, with images of massacres and destruction, the humiliated image of Israel on the Day of Judgment. October 7, and to take revenge for destabilizing his project, to which he and his masters have made every effort for more than 50 years.
He added: In its attack on our region, the West, led by the United States of America and Britain, has exhausted the body and thought of the nation, length and breadth, with projects of fragmentation, misinformation, deception, and fragmentation, aided by brute tools, sinful pens, hired voices, and hired minds. It has torn apart, with sectarianism, racism, and sectarianism, a unified whole, and deepened the fragmentation of every fragmented one, so the nations commonalities were absent. The great ones are in favor of their small differences at a stage in which the nations identity, capabilities, role and existence are exposed to profound and stormy dangers... They have worked to tear our peoples apart and preoccupy them with issues of fragmentation, but Palestine alone remains a valve of unity, a path of convergence, a base for revival, and a crossing path to the future that our peoples yearn for, a future. Strength, pride, freedom, sovereignty, stability and well-being.
He stated: After decades of focused efforts, with full American and Western support, to dismember, fragment, and dissolve the Palestinian issue, victory for Gaza came from the arenas of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen, broader than the enemys expectations, and the resistance factions succeeded in besieging the usurping entity with fire for more than 100 days. This is unprecedented.
He stressed that the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Lebanon, the blood of the martyrs of defending Gaza in Syria, the blood of martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iraq, the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Yemen, and the blood of the martyrs of supporting Gaza in Iran, the last of which was the blood of Major General Sayyed Radhi al-Moussawi, all these bloods unite, coalesce and integrate. With the blood of the martyrs of Gaza and the West Bank. It is the unity of blood, rifle, arena and target, which is what worries our enemies, and which is what we must continue and work to increase, deepen and extend. Whoever believes that this nation has an option other than resistance is wrong and very, very delusional.
He said: Israel did not occupy Palestine with diplomacy, but with weapons and force, and it did not occupy Beirut in 1982 with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. It does not threaten the nation today with diplomacy, but with weapons and force. Israel was not defeated from Lebanon in 1982 by diplomacy, but rather by resistance, just as it will not be defeated from Gaza and Palestine by diplomacy, but by resistance. We, as a nation, have no choice but to resist. We have nothing but resistance. There is nothing we can bet on but resistance.
He added that the confrontation with the enemy is not a confrontation for one or two days, but rather it is an ongoing, continuous and cumulative confrontation, and we must remain present in this confrontation. The gathering of the fleets of arrogant countries in support of Israel only confirms its weakness and instability, which must harden our will to adhere to the option of resistance. If the conditions for liberating Palestine are not available today, then we must prepare and prepare for tomorrow and the day after.
He stressed: Betting on international institutions and the so-called international community, as you have witnessed and we have witnessed repeatedly, is a failed and disappointing bet that has produced nothing but heartbreak, loss, disappointment and bitterness, adding that these international institutions are out of the bet because they are dependent on the will of the American administration, and the last farce and complicity of these institutions was the decision. Which condemned Yemen for its targeting of Israeli ships in defense of Gaza and legitimized the American-British targeting of the Ansar Allah brothers and ignored with all insolence and malice two million Palestinian citizens who were martyred, wounded, detained, hungry, thirsty, and displaced in the open, as a result of Israeli massacres and attacks.
He said: From your blessed conference, I extend my thanks to the brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the leadership and people, for their pioneering and supportive stances, and for the authentic and wise stances of His Eminence the Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (may his soul rest in peace), and I thank your conference, your stance, and your support for the resistance.
He stressed: The pledge of the Islamic resistance in Lebanon is to remain in the position of supporting Gaza until the victory of Gaza. We pledged to our great Imam Khomeini (may God sanctify his secret) that we would keep his commandments, abide by his path, and continue on his path, the outcome of which would be nothing but victory, pride, and dignity. It is noteworthy that the twelfth international forum, Gaza: Symbol of Resistance, continues its work with the participation of a group of families of resistance martyrs, martyrs of defenders of the holy shrines, nuclear martyrs, elite officials and military leaders, guests from the Global Resistance Front, and activists in the field of the Palestinian cause.

Allied for Democracy   		    Israelis gathered in downtown Tel Aviv to protest the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu's government in managing the war on Gaza. The protesters raised banners demanding the dismissal of the Israeli government, immediate elections, and the formation of a new government seeking what they described as unifying the Israeli ranks. This comes as the families of the prisoners continue to demonstrate in front of Netanyahus house in Caesarea as an attempt to pressure him to conclude a deal to release their detained children in the Gaza Strip.  		    		  		Chief of Staff of the Israeli army, Herzi Halevy, said that some reserve forces are being demobilized due to what he called the tension of the battlefield and the demands of life. Recently, Israeli media reports reported the demobilization of reserve units to reintegrate them into the economic cycle in view of the damage caused to the Israeli economy as a result of the war on Gaza, while official statements reported the withdrawal of some forces from the Gaza Strip, including a unit in the Golani Brigade .    The Israeli Walla website revealed that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tried to storm Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office , and the situation almost deteriorated into a fist fight. Gallant threatened Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to bring in the Golani Brigade to control the situation in the war council. Dermer, who renounced his American citizenship to serve as economic envoy in Washington before becoming ambassador there, is considered one of Netanyahu's closest associates.  According to the Walla website, Netanyahu's crew monitored Gallant's crew while recording the course of the security meetings on an audio tape. Israeli media reported that Gallant left the war cabinet meeting last Saturday because his office director was prevented from attending, amid increasing tension within the council. At the time, Israeli Channel 12 quoted a source as saying that the ministers withdrawal came after he arrived at the meeting headquarters and his assistant was prevented from entering with him, but when he entered the room he found 5 of Netanyahus aides.  The source added, ""Netanyahu told Gallant that as long as my assistant did not attend, your assistant should not attend, despite the presence of 5 of his employees in the place,"" and this is what prompted the Defense Minister to withdraw. According to the channel, Netanyahu believes that the army is leaking some information related to the bilateral talks or discussions. As the Walla website reported, Gallant sometimes refrains from answering calls from Netanyahus office for entire days. The Israeli Channel 13 revealed that Gallant asked Netanyahu not to ""disrupt"" his work within the government.   In a related context, the British newspaper The Times reported, quoting an unnamed Israeli security official, that the Israeli war government is on the verge of collapse and Netanyahu is hesitating and wasting time. During recent months, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Gallant and Netanyahu, related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  Many Israeli analysts point out that each member of the War Council only thinks about his political future and not Israel's interests. Ofer Shelah, a researcher at the National Security Research Institute, believes that the members of the War Council have been preparing themselves for the aftermath of the war since the first day of the war, and this is because the ghost of October 7th is haunting them, and each one of them is running ugly media campaigns on satellite channels saying that he is doing well but the others are wrong.     The intensity of the differences within the Israeli government and war council widened, after more than 100 days of war on the Gaza Strip, while voices calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down grew louder. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted Gadi Eisenkot, former chief of staff of the Israeli army and minister in the Israeli War Council, as saying that the behavior of the Israeli government before and after October 7, 2023 is characterized by a major failure. It added that Netanyahu and everyone who was in a military and political position on the seventh of last October and 10 years before that bears a clear responsibility, and that the Israeli leadership is not telling the truth to the people.  For its part, the New York Times quoted Eisenkot as saying that Israel did not overthrow the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved, indicating that reaching an agreement with Hamas is the only way to release the detainees. He stressed that every effort should have been made to maintain the temporary ceasefire last November. Eisenkot promised that his presence in the emergency government prevented the outbreak of a comprehensive war with the Lebanese Hezbollah , which would not have represented a grave strategic mistake, as he put it. Earlier, Eisenkot said that Tel Aviv must stop lying to itself, and conclude a deal that returns those detained by the Palestinian factions, instead of continuing the war on the Gaza Strip.  For his part, the head of the Yisrael Beytenu party ,  Avigdor Lieberman , said  that the current Israeli government is no longer capable of leading the people, indicating the necessity of forming a new government.  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted a source in the security mini-ministerial council as saying that there is no future for the war on the Gaza Strip. He added that Netanyahu is clearly stalling to buy time, and is evading responsibility, as he put it. For his part, opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israeli Radio that Netanyahu does not care about the State of Israel, and that all he cares about are his personal political interests, and he must be changed quickly.  A few days ago, the participation of Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz in a massive demonstration in Tel Aviv opposing the government and attacking its handling of the issue of Israeli prisoners in Gaza raised many questions about the cohesion of the Israeli government after more than 100 days of war. Recently, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Netanyahu and his Defense Minister  Yoav Galant , related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.  These tensions in the government coincide with the demonstrations taking place in various areas in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, demanding that the Israeli government conclude a deal to release detainees held by the resistance in Gaza. The families of Israeli detainees in the Gaza Strip said that they had lost confidence in Netanyahu's government, and that they would make their own moves, without indicating what they were, according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority.  According to political analysts, there is a widespread belief that Netanyahu is running this war for personal political motives, and his opponents do not just accuse him of failing to achieve any of its goals; But also by falling hostage to the far-right ministers whose presence he buys at any cost, so that the government, whose popularity polls indicate a decline in popularity, does not collapse.        		  The Israeli newspaper ""Israel Today"" said that the administration of US President Joe Biden is currently working on formulating a major regional deal to stop the war in the Gaza Strip and reduce tension in the region. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Israeli source as saying that the deal includes a ceasefire, the establishment of a new regime in the Gaza Strip, the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world, and the release of prisoners.  The newspaper said that the aforementioned Israeli source confirmed that the deal includes several principles aimed at achieving long-term stability as part of the post-war reality. It pointed out that the deal is part of what US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke about at the Davos Forum this week when he said that Israel needs to make difficult decisions.   The newspaper pointed out that the deal is still in its initial stages, and it is not yet clear how much of it has been formulated, or whether it will lead to an agreement that will end the war and launch a political process to resolve the conflict. So far, no official comment has been issued by the concerned parties regarding what was revealed in the Israeli newspaper report.  Talk about this deal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced yesterday that he informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any scenario for the post-war period in Gaza, and his insistence on continuing the war in the Gaza Strip until victory over the Hamas movement, which is a position that contradicts the American desire.   The United States called on Israel to reduce its attack on Gaza, and said that the establishment of a Palestinian state must be part of the post-war phase, which Netanyahu announced his explicit rejection of, demanding full Israeli control over the Strip.    The American network ""NBC News"" reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rapidly losing the support of American lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the network, supporters of Israel in both the Democratic and Republican parties are sounding the alarm about their loss of confidence in Netanyahu and his handling of the war against the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip.  The network indicated that one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose name was not revealed, said, It has become difficult to defend Netanyahu or justify his political strategy, and that there is a real lack of confidence in his leadership, not to mention questions about his ability to lead. The same source added, ""He believes on a personal level that Netanyahu's political interest is to remain involved in the conflict, whether it is with Hezbollah or in Gaza, since any ceasefire, peace agreement, efforts to rebuild, or going out of the way will harm him."" ""Politically.""  She pointed out that progressive lawmakers in the US Congress constantly criticize Netanyahu and the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, but now these criticisms are coming from pro-Israel lawmakers who work on the main national security committees, and they are now expressing their frustration about Netanyahus leadership, albeit quietly. The network touched on the statements of 3 American lawmakers who wonder whether the 74-year-old Netanyahu has a strategy to end the bloody war in Gaza, and they indicated that the unpopular Netanyahu may be deliberately trying to prolong it in order to remain in power.  Earlier, NBC reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu rejected US Secretary of State  Anthony Blinken's proposal for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper revealed that the United States warned the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel's long-term security will only be guaranteed through the establishment of a Palestinian state . The newspaper said, quoting Reuters, that US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that there is no way to solve Israels security problems in the long term, as well as organize the Gaza reconstruction process at the end of the war, without establishing a Palestinian state.     		  The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that Israel should have security control over Gaza after the war, in the context of conflicting statements between Washington and Tel Aviv regarding plans after the end of the fighting. The Bureau denied the content of a CNN report that stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed US President Joe Biden - in a phone call yesterday, Friday - that he did not rule out the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state.  The Israeli statement said, ""During his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after the destruction of Hamas, Israel must maintain security control over Gaza to ensure that it will no longer pose a threat to Israel, which is inconsistent with the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""   This is a rare statement from the Prime Ministers Office, which usually avoids making a statement on the holy Sabbath holiday for religious Jews, and it came hours after a call made by Biden and Netanyahu on Friday, their first in nearly a month. Biden said after the call that the Israeli Prime Minister does not oppose all solutions based on two states, considering that the matter is not impossible with Netanyahu in power. The US President indicated that there are ""a number of possible patterns"" for this solution, and that some UN member states do not have armed forces, in reference to the possibility of establishing a demilitarized Palestinian state.  White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Netanyahu had been trying to arrange the phone call for some time, denying that it was a reaction to statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister - the day before yesterday, Thursday - in which he expressed his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  Netanyahu stated that he informed Washington of his opposition to any Palestinian state that does not guarantee the security of Israel, as he put it. He said, ""Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. This is a necessary condition.""  On the other hand, Hamas rejected the US President's statements regarding ""possible patterns"" for establishing a Palestinian state. A member of the movement's political bureau, Izzat Al-Rishq said in a statement that ""selling the illusion that Biden is trying to talk about a Palestinian state (...) does not deceive our people."" Al-Rishq added, ""Biden is a full partner in the war of genocide, and our people do not expect anything good from him."" He said, ""These people think of themselves as the guardians of the Palestinian people. They want to choose for them the type of state that suits them.""  For its part, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry confirmed its refusal to comment on the Israeli Prime Ministers Office on press reports regarding Biden and Netanyahus call. The Ministry stressed in a statement that repeating these statements and demanding Israeli security control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a blatant challenge to the declared positions of the American administration and its efforts to resolve the conflict and achieve security and stability in the region.  Israel continues its war on Gaza for the 106th day with broad political and military support from the United States, which supplies it with thousands of tons of weapons and ammunition via an air bridge. But there are discrepancies between Biden and Netanyahu regarding the management of the war and plans for the so-called next day after the end of the fighting, especially in light of the failure to achieve the main declared goals of the war, which are the elimination of Hamas and the recovery of Israeli prisoners.  Netanyahu is also facing escalating internal disputes, as the official Israeli radio quoted senior security and military leaders as agreeing with the ministers, Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, and Yoav Galant, that the absence of a political vision for the day after the war on Gaza will prevent Israels victory over Hamas.      		    The British Financial Times newspaper explained that US President Joe Biden's strong support for Israel risks harming his re-election prospects for a new presidential term, explaining that his apparent indifference to the Palestinians may be costly. Writer Edward Luce mentioned in his article that thousands of children were killed in the war on Gaza , according to Save the Children. However, Bidens recent statement calling on the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) to release the hostages did not refer to what the Palestinians are suffering.  He added that acknowledging the plight of the Palestinians seems to cast doubt on Biden's ""sincere sympathy for the Israeli victims in the attack launched by Hamas on October 7,"" so Washington avoids it, knowing that this upsets many young Americans who will need Biden badly. To their enthusiasm next November, it will also disturb the Arab Americans, who constitute a major voting bloc in many swing states.  The writer explained that progressive Democrats are not the only ones who feel dissatisfied with Biden's silence regarding what Israel is doing, as many of his most trusted allies in the US Senate are also upset.  In a meeting in Davos this week, the US Senator from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, and Biden's closest friend in politics, said that the United States should consider setting conditions on military aid to Israel. In a letter to Biden before Christmas, a group of Democrats - some of them former CIA employees - urged the use of influence for an immediate and significant shift in military strategy and tactics in Gaza.  The writer stated that White House officials insist that Biden is secretly doing what he can to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but there is little evidence to prove this. Israel has received more than 100 bunker-busting bombs from the United States since October 7, noting that these bombs are intended for destruction and not for precise targeting of terrorists in urban areas.  The writer believes that the answer is summed up in Bidens deep feelings towards Israel. Since his first days in politics, he was one of its strongest allies in the Capitol , and he has always admired the approach of both Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin, but now he faces a contradictory model represented by Benjamin Netanyahu, and despite this, he continues. In support.  Edward Luce said that Biden was a strong critic of the efforts of US President George H.W. Bush for the peace process in 1992 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . He also attacked Bush Sr.'s threat to withdraw American loan guarantees if Israel went ahead with building settlements in the occupied territories. The pressure exerted by Bush helped overthrow the Likud government in Israel at the time and bring Rabin to power, and this led to the Oslo Peace Accords, explains Edward Luce.  According to the article, Biden - while serving as vice president - had undermined President Barack Obama's attempt in 2010 to apply similar pressure on Netanyahu's government, and partly because of Biden's own reassurances, the Israeli prime minister mocked Obama.  The writer emphasized that Biden could oust Netanyahu by imposing strict conditions on American aid if he wanted to, and in doing so he would gain the respect of the Israelis, the Arab world, and the majority of Jewish Americans. This would also make him regain some of the ground that Washington lost in the global South because of its double standards. A large part of the world believes that America cares more about European victims such as the Ukrainians than it does about civilians in the Middle East or anywhere else.  The writer emphasized that the longer Netanyahu clings to power, the worse it will be for Biden. However, it appears that Biden's actions were designed to ensure this.    		  		  The American website The Intercept confirmed in a report that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) donated about $95,000 to Republican Representative Mike Johnson last November, according to the websites analysis of Federal Election Commission records. The Intercept added in a report by journalist Catherine Caruso that the pro-Israel lobby is considered the largest donor to Johnson in 2023 after he led the passage of a large aid package for Israel.  The Intercept said that most of the payments received by the US representative came after the beginning of the war on Gaza. According to the website, Johnson - who refused to speak to The Intercept - received small donations in late October, which quickly increased significantly during the month of November.  The Intercept confirmed that this increase came after Johnson led the passage of significant support for Israel, estimated at $14 billion, when he presided over the House of Representatives, where he struggled to accelerate the passage of that support by separating it from the bill to provide aid allocated to Ukraine, and resorting to using IRS funds to finance it. Once the bill passed the House, Johnson urged the Senate to approve it as quickly as possible.  The website confirmed that Johnson has always expressed his direct public support for Israel, and he previously confirmed on a trip to Israel in 2020 that it is not true that the Palestinians suffer from injustice in the region, and he continued, ""We never see any of that.""   The website confirmed that AIPAC is considered an influential intermediary in the Capitol , as it provides money to legislators from the Republican and Democratic parties in order to continue maintaining pro-Israel policies, and in the recent period the organization has focused on members of the Democratic Party who are critical of Tel Avivs policies.  The Intercept quoted the head of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby, as saying that AIPAC's contributions to election campaigns have two purposes, the first of which is to reward candidates who support Israel's interests, and the second is to use them as a stick to keep politicians aligned in one row. On foreign policy, this is probably the single issue where money has the biggest negative impact, said Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard Kennedy School.  Even as a growing number of Democrats are willing to buck the pro-Israel consensus in Washington and reject AIPAC's influence, they still suffer from a significant lack of resources, according to the American website. The problem, Walt told The Intercept, is that there are no similar groups on the other side, as no pro-Palestinian or pro-Arab-American PAC has the same resources.    Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 24,927  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,388. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th to 195, and 529 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of the same month. Among them are 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that 2,438 soldiers - including 355 seriously injured - have been injured since the beginning of the war on Gaza, including earlier reports of 576 moderate, and 1,161 minor. The number of wounded since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip on October 27 had risen to 1,042.  At least 13,340 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.  The statement continued, ""In total, about 13,000 regular and reserve soldiers required accompaniment or medical treatment at some level during the fighting, and thousands of them were injured in the battles.""    Al Jazeera military and strategic expert Major General Fayez Al-Duwairi expressed his conviction that the numbers of dead and wounded announced by Israel cannot represent the truth, due to a discrepancy between the Israeli armys data and the Walla website, which is close to the army itself.    In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank. Its ammunition explodes and no one is left alive.  He added, ""The Israelis announce their dead only of those of Jewish origin and of the first race, meaning all Arabs, Falash, and those who are among them. They are not counted because they are of the second category. So I am sure that the number exceeds 4 thousand dead, and this is a very easy military calculation.""  He pointed out, ""The Palestinian resistance documented everything it did, unlike the Israelis. The resistance documented shooting at tanks and armored vehicles and destroying the houses in which the Israeli soldiers were holed up, and we saw them being killed... We saw the Kornet hitting the tanks, we saw Al-Yassin 105, so the difference is clear.""  Hostages   	The New York Times quoted Israeli military commanders as saying that retrieving the hostages is possible through diplomatic, not military, means. Israeli military leaders added to the newspaper that recovering the hostages and destroying Hamas have now become incompatible goals, and that the long battle aimed at destroying Hamas will likely cost the lives of the hostages. Israeli leaders stressed that the diplomatic path to recovering the hostages would be the fastest method. They said the strategic impasse exacerbated the military's frustration about the indecision of the political leadership. The Israeli military expressed to the newspaper their fear that the length of the military campaign, without a post-war plan, would lead to the erosion of allied support.  On the other hand, the New York Times said that it had seen documents indicating that Israel had imposed its control in Gaza on a smaller portion than it had envisioned in the battle plans since the beginning of the war. The documents indicated that Israeli plans included controlling the cities of Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Rafah by late December.      	  Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.  Over the course of 6 days, Israel has received 102 detainees, women and children, including 78 Israelis, in exchange for the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners, women and children.     Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, told reporters 01 December 2023:   Hamas still held 137 hostages from the October attacks, in addition to four others who went missing before the war	  The hostages include two children aged four and 10 months, who, Hamas now claims, are dead  117 male hostages are still kept in Gaza, including the two children, as well as 20 females  126 hostages are Israelis, and 11 others are foreign nationals  Foreign nationals are eight Thais, one Nepalese, one Tanzanian and one French Mexican citizen  Ten of the remaining hostages are 75 and older.   There are seven missing people since the October 7 attack  Hamas had released 110 hostages so far  86 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals.     Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Israelis gathered in downtown Tel Aviv to protest the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu's government in managing the war on Gaza. The protesters raised banners demanding the dismissal of the Israeli government, immediate elections, and the formation of a new government seeking what they described as unifying the Israeli ranks. This comes as the families of the prisoners continue to demonstrate in front of Netanyahus house in Caesarea as an attempt to pressure him to conclude a deal to release their detained children in the Gaza Strip.
Chief of Staff of the Israeli army, Herzi Halevy, said that some reserve forces are being demobilized due to what he called the tension of the battlefield and the demands of life. Recently, Israeli media reports reported the demobilization of reserve units to reintegrate them into the economic cycle in view of the damage caused to the Israeli economy as a result of the war on Gaza, while official statements reported the withdrawal of some forces from the Gaza Strip, including a unit in the Golani Brigade .
The Israeli Walla website revealed that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant tried to storm Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office , and the situation almost deteriorated into a fist fight. Gallant threatened Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to bring in the Golani Brigade to control the situation in the war council. Dermer, who renounced his American citizenship to serve as economic envoy in Washington before becoming ambassador there, is considered one of Netanyahu's closest associates.
According to the Walla website, Netanyahu's crew monitored Gallant's crew while recording the course of the security meetings on an audio tape. Israeli media reported that Gallant left the war cabinet meeting last Saturday because his office director was prevented from attending, amid increasing tension within the council. At the time, Israeli Channel 12 quoted a source as saying that the ministers withdrawal came after he arrived at the meeting headquarters and his assistant was prevented from entering with him, but when he entered the room he found 5 of Netanyahus aides.
The source added, ""Netanyahu told Gallant that as long as my assistant did not attend, your assistant should not attend, despite the presence of 5 of his employees in the place,"" and this is what prompted the Defense Minister to withdraw. According to the channel, Netanyahu believes that the army is leaking some information related to the bilateral talks or discussions. As the Walla website reported, Gallant sometimes refrains from answering calls from Netanyahus office for entire days. The Israeli Channel 13 revealed that Gallant asked Netanyahu not to ""disrupt"" his work within the government.
In a related context, the British newspaper The Times reported, quoting an unnamed Israeli security official, that the Israeli war government is on the verge of collapse and Netanyahu is hesitating and wasting time. During recent months, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Gallant and Netanyahu, related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.
Many Israeli analysts point out that each member of the War Council only thinks about his political future and not Israel's interests. Ofer Shelah, a researcher at the National Security Research Institute, believes that the members of the War Council have been preparing themselves for the aftermath of the war since the first day of the war, and this is because the ghost of October 7th is haunting them, and each one of them is running ugly media campaigns on satellite channels saying that he is doing well but the others are wrong.
The intensity of the differences within the Israeli government and war council widened, after more than 100 days of war on the Gaza Strip, while voices calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down grew louder. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted Gadi Eisenkot, former chief of staff of the Israeli army and minister in the Israeli War Council, as saying that the behavior of the Israeli government before and after October 7, 2023 is characterized by a major failure. It added that Netanyahu and everyone who was in a military and political position on the seventh of last October and 10 years before that bears a clear responsibility, and that the Israeli leadership is not telling the truth to the people.
For its part, the New York Times quoted Eisenkot as saying that Israel did not overthrow the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved, indicating that reaching an agreement with Hamas is the only way to release the detainees. He stressed that every effort should have been made to maintain the temporary ceasefire last November. Eisenkot promised that his presence in the emergency government prevented the outbreak of a comprehensive war with the Lebanese Hezbollah , which would not have represented a grave strategic mistake, as he put it. Earlier, Eisenkot said that Tel Aviv must stop lying to itself, and conclude a deal that returns those detained by the Palestinian factions, instead of continuing the war on the Gaza Strip.
For his part, the head of the Yisrael Beytenu party ,  Avigdor Lieberman , said  that the current Israeli government is no longer capable of leading the people, indicating the necessity of forming a new government.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted a source in the security mini-ministerial council as saying that there is no future for the war on the Gaza Strip. He added that Netanyahu is clearly stalling to buy time, and is evading responsibility, as he put it. For his part, opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israeli Radio that Netanyahu does not care about the State of Israel, and that all he cares about are his personal political interests, and he must be changed quickly.
A few days ago, the participation of Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz in a massive demonstration in Tel Aviv opposing the government and attacking its handling of the issue of Israeli prisoners in Gaza raised many questions about the cohesion of the Israeli government after more than 100 days of war. Recently, the Israeli media has repeatedly touched on ongoing disagreements between Netanyahu and his Defense Minister  Yoav Galant , related to how to manage the war on the Gaza Strip, and the aftermath of the war, in addition to Netanyahus repeated attempts to hold the army responsible for the war on the Gaza Strip.
These tensions in the government coincide with the demonstrations taking place in various areas in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, demanding that the Israeli government conclude a deal to release detainees held by the resistance in Gaza. The families of Israeli detainees in the Gaza Strip said that they had lost confidence in Netanyahu's government, and that they would make their own moves, without indicating what they were, according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority.
According to political analysts, there is a widespread belief that Netanyahu is running this war for personal political motives, and his opponents do not just accuse him of failing to achieve any of its goals; But also by falling hostage to the far-right ministers whose presence he buys at any cost, so that the government, whose popularity polls indicate a decline in popularity, does not collapse.
The Israeli newspaper ""Israel Today"" said that the administration of US President Joe Biden is currently working on formulating a major regional deal to stop the war in the Gaza Strip and reduce tension in the region. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Israeli source as saying that the deal includes a ceasefire, the establishment of a new regime in the Gaza Strip, the normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world, and the release of prisoners.
The newspaper said that the aforementioned Israeli source confirmed that the deal includes several principles aimed at achieving long-term stability as part of the post-war reality. It pointed out that the deal is part of what US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke about at the Davos Forum this week when he said that Israel needs to make difficult decisions.
The newspaper pointed out that the deal is still in its initial stages, and it is not yet clear how much of it has been formulated, or whether it will lead to an agreement that will end the war and launch a political process to resolve the conflict. So far, no official comment has been issued by the concerned parties regarding what was revealed in the Israeli newspaper report.
Talk about this deal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced yesterday that he informed the United States of his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of any scenario for the post-war period in Gaza, and his insistence on continuing the war in the Gaza Strip until victory over the Hamas movement, which is a position that contradicts the American desire.
The United States called on Israel to reduce its attack on Gaza, and said that the establishment of a Palestinian state must be part of the post-war phase, which Netanyahu announced his explicit rejection of, demanding full Israeli control over the Strip.
The American network ""NBC News"" reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is rapidly losing the support of American lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the network, supporters of Israel in both the Democratic and Republican parties are sounding the alarm about their loss of confidence in Netanyahu and his handling of the war against the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip.
The network indicated that one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose name was not revealed, said, It has become difficult to defend Netanyahu or justify his political strategy, and that there is a real lack of confidence in his leadership, not to mention questions about his ability to lead. The same source added, ""He believes on a personal level that Netanyahu's political interest is to remain involved in the conflict, whether it is with Hezbollah or in Gaza, since any ceasefire, peace agreement, efforts to rebuild, or going out of the way will harm him."" ""Politically.""
She pointed out that progressive lawmakers in the US Congress constantly criticize Netanyahu and the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, but now these criticisms are coming from pro-Israel lawmakers who work on the main national security committees, and they are now expressing their frustration about Netanyahus leadership, albeit quietly. The network touched on the statements of 3 American lawmakers who wonder whether the 74-year-old Netanyahu has a strategy to end the bloody war in Gaza, and they indicated that the unpopular Netanyahu may be deliberately trying to prolong it in order to remain in power.
Earlier, NBC reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu rejected US Secretary of State  Anthony Blinken's proposal for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper revealed that the United States warned the Israeli Prime Minister that Israel's long-term security will only be guaranteed through the establishment of a Palestinian state . The newspaper said, quoting Reuters, that US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that there is no way to solve Israels security problems in the long term, as well as organize the Gaza reconstruction process at the end of the war, without establishing a Palestinian state.
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that Israel should have security control over Gaza after the war, in the context of conflicting statements between Washington and Tel Aviv regarding plans after the end of the fighting. The Bureau denied the content of a CNN report that stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed US President Joe Biden - in a phone call yesterday, Friday - that he did not rule out the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state.
The Israeli statement said, ""During his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after the destruction of Hamas, Israel must maintain security control over Gaza to ensure that it will no longer pose a threat to Israel, which is inconsistent with the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""
This is a rare statement from the Prime Ministers Office, which usually avoids making a statement on the holy Sabbath holiday for religious Jews, and it came hours after a call made by Biden and Netanyahu on Friday, their first in nearly a month. Biden said after the call that the Israeli Prime Minister does not oppose all solutions based on two states, considering that the matter is not impossible with Netanyahu in power. The US President indicated that there are ""a number of possible patterns"" for this solution, and that some UN member states do not have armed forces, in reference to the possibility of establishing a demilitarized Palestinian state.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Netanyahu had been trying to arrange the phone call for some time, denying that it was a reaction to statements made by the Israeli Prime Minister - the day before yesterday, Thursday - in which he expressed his opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Netanyahu stated that he informed Washington of his opposition to any Palestinian state that does not guarantee the security of Israel, as he put it. He said, ""Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River. This is a necessary condition.""
On the other hand, Hamas rejected the US President's statements regarding ""possible patterns"" for establishing a Palestinian state. A member of the movement's political bureau, Izzat Al-Rishq said in a statement that ""selling the illusion that Biden is trying to talk about a Palestinian state (...) does not deceive our people."" Al-Rishq added, ""Biden is a full partner in the war of genocide, and our people do not expect anything good from him."" He said, ""These people think of themselves as the guardians of the Palestinian people. They want to choose for them the type of state that suits them.""
For its part, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry confirmed its refusal to comment on the Israeli Prime Ministers Office on press reports regarding Biden and Netanyahus call. The Ministry stressed in a statement that repeating these statements and demanding Israeli security control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a blatant challenge to the declared positions of the American administration and its efforts to resolve the conflict and achieve security and stability in the region.
Israel continues its war on Gaza for the 106th day with broad political and military support from the United States, which supplies it with thousands of tons of weapons and ammunition via an air bridge. But there are discrepancies between Biden and Netanyahu regarding the management of the war and plans for the so-called next day after the end of the fighting, especially in light of the failure to achieve the main declared goals of the war, which are the elimination of Hamas and the recovery of Israeli prisoners.
Netanyahu is also facing escalating internal disputes, as the official Israeli radio quoted senior security and military leaders as agreeing with the ministers, Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, and Yoav Galant, that the absence of a political vision for the day after the war on Gaza will prevent Israels victory over Hamas.
The British Financial Times newspaper explained that US President Joe Biden's strong support for Israel risks harming his re-election prospects for a new presidential term, explaining that his apparent indifference to the Palestinians may be costly. Writer Edward Luce mentioned in his article that thousands of children were killed in the war on Gaza , according to Save the Children. However, Bidens recent statement calling on the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) to release the hostages did not refer to what the Palestinians are suffering.
He added that acknowledging the plight of the Palestinians seems to cast doubt on Biden's ""sincere sympathy for the Israeli victims in the attack launched by Hamas on October 7,"" so Washington avoids it, knowing that this upsets many young Americans who will need Biden badly. To their enthusiasm next November, it will also disturb the Arab Americans, who constitute a major voting bloc in many swing states.
The writer explained that progressive Democrats are not the only ones who feel dissatisfied with Biden's silence regarding what Israel is doing, as many of his most trusted allies in the US Senate are also upset.
In a meeting in Davos this week, the US Senator from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, and Biden's closest friend in politics, said that the United States should consider setting conditions on military aid to Israel. In a letter to Biden before Christmas, a group of Democrats - some of them former CIA employees - urged the use of influence for an immediate and significant shift in military strategy and tactics in Gaza.
The writer stated that White House officials insist that Biden is secretly doing what he can to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but there is little evidence to prove this. Israel has received more than 100 bunker-busting bombs from the United States since October 7, noting that these bombs are intended for destruction and not for precise targeting of terrorists in urban areas.
The writer believes that the answer is summed up in Bidens deep feelings towards Israel. Since his first days in politics, he was one of its strongest allies in the Capitol , and he has always admired the approach of both Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin, but now he faces a contradictory model represented by Benjamin Netanyahu, and despite this, he continues. In support.
Edward Luce said that Biden was a strong critic of the efforts of US President George H.W. Bush for the peace process in 1992 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . He also attacked Bush Sr.'s threat to withdraw American loan guarantees if Israel went ahead with building settlements in the occupied territories. The pressure exerted by Bush helped overthrow the Likud government in Israel at the time and bring Rabin to power, and this led to the Oslo Peace Accords, explains Edward Luce.
According to the article, Biden - while serving as vice president - had undermined President Barack Obama's attempt in 2010 to apply similar pressure on Netanyahu's government, and partly because of Biden's own reassurances, the Israeli prime minister mocked Obama.
The writer emphasized that Biden could oust Netanyahu by imposing strict conditions on American aid if he wanted to, and in doing so he would gain the respect of the Israelis, the Arab world, and the majority of Jewish Americans. This would also make him regain some of the ground that Washington lost in the global South because of its double standards. A large part of the world believes that America cares more about European victims such as the Ukrainians than it does about civilians in the Middle East or anywhere else.
The writer emphasized that the longer Netanyahu clings to power, the worse it will be for Biden. However, it appears that Biden's actions were designed to ensure this.
The American website The Intercept confirmed in a report that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) donated about $95,000 to Republican Representative Mike Johnson last November, according to the websites analysis of Federal Election Commission records. The Intercept added in a report by journalist Catherine Caruso that the pro-Israel lobby is considered the largest donor to Johnson in 2023 after he led the passage of a large aid package for Israel.
The Intercept said that most of the payments received by the US representative came after the beginning of the war on Gaza. According to the website, Johnson - who refused to speak to The Intercept - received small donations in late October, which quickly increased significantly during the month of November.
The Intercept confirmed that this increase came after Johnson led the passage of significant support for Israel, estimated at $14 billion, when he presided over the House of Representatives, where he struggled to accelerate the passage of that support by separating it from the bill to provide aid allocated to Ukraine, and resorting to using IRS funds to finance it. Once the bill passed the House, Johnson urged the Senate to approve it as quickly as possible.
The website confirmed that Johnson has always expressed his direct public support for Israel, and he previously confirmed on a trip to Israel in 2020 that it is not true that the Palestinians suffer from injustice in the region, and he continued, ""We never see any of that.""
The website confirmed that AIPAC is considered an influential intermediary in the Capitol , as it provides money to legislators from the Republican and Democratic parties in order to continue maintaining pro-Israel policies, and in the recent period the organization has focused on members of the Democratic Party who are critical of Tel Avivs policies.
The Intercept quoted the head of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby, as saying that AIPAC's contributions to election campaigns have two purposes, the first of which is to reward candidates who support Israel's interests, and the second is to use them as a stick to keep politicians aligned in one row. On foreign policy, this is probably the single issue where money has the biggest negative impact, said Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard Kennedy School.
Even as a growing number of Democrats are willing to buck the pro-Israel consensus in Washington and reject AIPAC's influence, they still suffer from a significant lack of resources, according to the American website. The problem, Walt told The Intercept, is that there are no similar groups on the other side, as no pro-Palestinian or pro-Arab-American PAC has the same resources.


Butcher's Bill / Oasis of Martyrs   			   			    Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""  It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.  	    	  	      The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 24,927  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.   The number wounded was  62,388. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.    		   The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.    	  More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel. 	  	  Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.  	  The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th to 195, and 529 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of the same month. Among them are 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.  Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.  The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.  According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.   According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.  The Israeli army reported that 2,438 soldiers - including 355 seriously injured - have been injured since the beginning of the war on Gaza, including earlier reports of 576 moderate, and 1,161 minor. The number of wounded since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip on October 27 had risen to 1,042.  At least 13,340 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.   Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper had reported that 5,000 soldiers had been wounded since the beginning of the war on October 7, and that the Ministry of Defense had recognized 2,000 soldiers as disabled so far.    An estimate by the Israeli Ministry of Defense expected that the number of soldiers with disabilities in the war taking place in the Gaza Strip since October 7 of last year would reach 12,500 soldiers. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said that the Soldiers' Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense has dealt with 3,400 soldiers who were classified as disabled in the army since last October 7.  The Israeli army revealed  that about 9,000 of its soldiers have received psychological assistance since the beginning of the war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, and about a quarter of them have not returned to combat. This came according to a new statement revealed by the Army Medical Corps, according to Channel 12 and the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. According to the statement, nearly 9,000 soldiers have applied for psychological assistance since the beginning of the war, and approximately a quarter of them have not returned to combat.

In an interview with RT, Military strategist retired Tunisian Brigadier General Tawfiq Didi said that the number of Israeli army deaths in the Gaza battles is much greater than what Israel announces. Didi explained in an interview with the Best Saying program on RT channel, The number of people killed in battles can be easily known, as the equation in wars is that for every 3 wounded there is a dead person, and the numbers now in Israel hover around 12,500 wounded and disabled people, and when we divide by Three, we find that the death toll exceeds 4,000, especially after eliminating more than a thousand tanks and armored vehicles, and I know what happens when Kornet missiles hit a tank.

Israel had previously estimated there were 116 living hostages in Palestinian custody. Israel declared 20 out of 136 people in Gaza captivity dead in absentia, after announcing its forces had recovered the bodies of two hostages. By another count, 132 of them are still being held in Gaza, and 25 of them have been confirmed dead.  Israel considers those still held by Hamas to be hostages regardless of whether they are dead or alive.  Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy earlier had told reporters that Hamas still held 137 captives. The resistance released 10 Israeli detainees, 4 Thais and 2 Russian women, who were released outside the agreement.

Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. The Israeli military had not specified how many soldiers were captured, nor their ranks.    According to some estimates, Hamas was initially holding nearly 210 of the 240 hostages, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad was holding the remaining 30. About 40 Israelis remained missing. More than 40 hostages taken from Israel into Gaza on October 7th are not currently in the custody of Hamas, the group responsible for the attack, according to a CNN report based on a diplomatic source briefed on the negotiations, CNN's prior reports had indicated that an estimated 40 to 50 hostages were held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad or other unidentified groups or individuals.   Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Hamas telegram account that 23 bodies of the 60 missing Israel hostages were trapped under the rubble. It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza, he said.	  	  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club revealed that about 11,000 arrests were carried out by the Israeli army during the year 2023 in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, in addition to arrests from the Gaza Strip before the seventh of last October. The number of people arrested by the occupation in the West Bank since that date has exceeded 6,000. The total number of prisoners in Israeli prisons is 8,800, as documented by the club until the end of December 2023.  The Prisoners' Club stated that cases of arrest among women amounted to (300), and this toll includes women from the occupied interior detained after October 7, while the number of cases of children reached 1,085. The arrest campaigns affected all groups, including women and children, as the number of women who were arrested reached about 200, while the number of arrests among children until the end of last December exceeded 355 children. The number of administrative detainees in Israeli prisons reached more than 3,290, which is the highest percentage since the years of the 1987 Intifada.  Israel said on 14 January 2024  that, since the beginning of the war, approximately 2,650 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,300 of whom are affiliated with Hamas. On 08 January 2024 it was reported that more than 1,350 wanted persons had been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, more than 870 of whom are associated with the terrorist organization Hamas.             NEWSLETTER     Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list       Enter Your Email Address
Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of missiles at Israel and deployed its militants to infiltrate Jewish settlements near the countrys border with Gaza on 07 October 2023. The 1,200 Israelis killed on the first day would be the equivalent of 36,000 Americans killed in an attack, as a proportion to Israels population of 9.3 million people (compared to 332 million in the USA).  Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated: Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been killed in one day"". PM Netanyahu stated ""On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. Thats twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy.""
It is the second largest loss inflicted on the Israeli forces after the 1973 war, as the Palestinian resistance killed more than 1,200, wounded more than 5,132 others, and captured more than 250, most of them military personnel, some of whom were high-ranking officers in the army.
The HAMAS Ministry of Health in the besieged sector announced that the number of victims of the Israeli operation its beginning had risen to 24,927  martyrs, and the killing of nearly 10,000  Palestinian children and 6,600 women killed. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
The number wounded was  62,388. The Palestinian Government Media Office in Gaza had said much earlier that the number of missing people had risen to more than 8,000, including including 4,700 children and women,  amid expectations that the toll will be double thi figures.
The IDF intensified its military operations in the West Bank, and increased the pace of incursions and raids into cities, towns, and camps, resulting in the martyrdom of 342 Palestinians, the injury of about 3,950, and the arrest of 5,780, according to official HAMAS sources.  As of 17 January 2023, the Israeli escalation in the West Bank led to the death of 360 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 2,200, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the arrest of about 6,000, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club.
More than 130 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Lebanon during exchanges of bombing operations with Israel.
Israel revised down the death toll from the October Hamas attacks in southern Israel from 1,400 to 1,200. IDF had said previously it was holding 1,500 bodies of terrorists, a total that now would increas to about 1,700.
The officially announced number of deaths among the Israeli army since the start of the ground incursion on October 27th to 195, and 529 deaths since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on the 7th of the same month. Among them are 56 with the rank of platoon commander, 43 with the rank of company commander, 9 with the rank of battalion commander, and 5 with the rank of brigade commander. These officers constitute 23% of the total deaths of the Israeli army in the war on Gaza.
Israeli media reported that 27% of the Israeli military casualties in the war were officers. In detail, the media highlighted that three brigade commanders, four battalion commanders, and other senior officers have been killed in the war so far.
The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that 29 of the army's deaths were caused by ""friendly fire"" and operational incidents since the start of the ground war in Gaza, late last October. The Israeli authority explained that ""18 army soldiers were killed by friendly fire, two were killed as a result of gunfire (without explanation), and 9 Israeli soldiers were killed in ammunition, weapons, or run-over accidents."" The Jerusalem Post newspaper revealed that 15 soldiers were killed in the Strip without their bodies being found.
According to some reports statistics indicate that 20% of the Israeli losses were due to friendly fire. Because the nature of the battle has become completely different from what was expected, and it lacks a front line.
According to the latest data published by the army, the number of wounded soldiers and officers has risen to 1,152 since the start of its ground attack on Gaza on October 27, including 228 seriously wounded, while the total number has reached 2,602 wounded since the outbreak of the war on the 7th of October.
The Israeli army reported that 2,438 soldiers - including 355 seriously injured - have been injured since the beginning of the war on Gaza, including earlier reports of 576 moderate, and 1,161 minor. The number of wounded since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip on October 27 had risen to 1,042.
At least 13,340 Israelis were injured, according to i24 TV.

The European Union has announced that it will drastically increase its ammunition production this year amid Ukraine's growing request for Western support in the war with Russia.
The decision was revealed on Friday as the ongoing war with Russia nears its second year.
According to EU internal market Commissioner Thierry Breton, the bloc will be able to churn out at least 1.3 million rounds of ammunition by the end of this year.
""We will continue to enhance our production capacity, probably around 1.3 to 1.4 million... at the end of this year and continue to increase significantly next year,"" Thierry said.
""We are at a crucial moment for our collective security in Europe"" he said, adding ""Europe must and will continue to support Ukraine with all its means"".
The decision came after Ukraine said on Thursday that it was facing a ""pressing"" need for ammunition.
Russia has time and again criticized Western support for Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron announced this week that Paris was sending dozens of long-range missiles to Ukraine.
""We must amplify the transformation we have begun"" to respond more quickly to Ukraine's needs, Macron said in a New Year's address to the French armed forces.
On Friday, Russia summoned France's ambassador in Moscow and issued a formal complaint over his country's ""growing involvement"" in the conflict in Ukraine.
The move came just days after Moscow said it had killed a group of French mercenaries in a strike on the northeastern town of Kharkiv."

Good week. During the fighting in Khan Yunis, we located a tunnel where hostages were held. IDF soldiers identified the entrance of the tunnel based on precise intelligence in the house of a Hamas terrorist in Khan Yunis. The soldiers entered the tunnel where they encountered terrorists, engaging in a battle that ended with the elimination of the terrorists. The tunnel was rigged with explosives and blast doors designed to protect the terrorists and prevent the advancement in finding of our hostages.   Of course, when we reached inside this tunnel, there were no hostages, but hostages were held there in the past. After walking about a kilometer in the tunnel, at a depth of about 20 meters underground, the soldiers found a central chamber where, according to testimonies of hostages who returned from Gaza, we understand that they spent most of their time. In this chamber, we found evidence that the hostages were held there, including drawings made by 5-year-old Amelia Aloni, along with other hostages.   Further down the tunnel, we located five narrow prison cells, each with a toilet and mattress, and closed with bars. According to the testimonies we have, about 20 hostages were held in this tunnel at different times under harsh conditions without daylight, in dense air with little oxygen, and terrible humidity that makes breathing difficult. Some of them were released about fifty days ago, and some are still held in Gaza and may be under even harsher conditions, including very elderly people who need medication and help.  Yesterday, before we destroyed the tunnel, we documented the place and brought in journalists to show the world evidence that must not be forgotten - Hamas committed and continues to commit crimes against humanity, holding innocent people, children, women, men, some sick, very elderly people, in harsh and inhumane conditions. The return of the hostages is a supreme effort, and we are working in every way to bring them home.   Our operational activity combines technology, special units, special means, and intelligence, intelligence that we are constantly searching for and refining. We do not strike places where we know or even assume that hostages are held. Parallel to the underground fighting, IDF soldiers continue to fight above ground. In the Khan Yunis area, we continue to dismantle Hamas' military framework. There are still terrorists there. IDF soldiers are fighting them and advancing in the strike."
8J0NS3ES2O_AGK4BU6EQCR6AUV,Russia Overtakes Saudi Arabia To Become Largest Supplier Of Oil To China,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/01/russia-240120-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service January 20, 2024
Russia last year overtook Saudi Arabia to become the largest supplier of oil to China, Reuters reported, citing Chinese import data.
Russia supplied 107 million tons of oil to China in 2023, the equivalent of 2.1 million barrels a day, the agency said.
Saudi Arabia, China's top supplier for many years, delivered 86 million tons, a 2 percent drop compared with the previous year.
China is the world's largest net importer of oil, having overtaken the United States in 2017.
Western sanctions imposed on Russia for its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine has upended global trade, including the shipment of fossil fuels.
Europe, the biggest buyer of Russian oil prior to the war, banned imports of the fossil fuel, and, along with the United States, imposed a $60 price cap on Russian oil shipped using EU and U.S. services, such as transportation insurance.
The price cap was designed to keep Russian oil flowing to global markets to prevent a price spike while also limiting Russian budget revenue. Oil exports account for more than 30 percent of Russian federal budget revenues.
The Western oil ban forced Russia to pivot east to sell its oil. China and India willingly snapped up Russian crude sold at a discount to global prices.
Russia also became the biggest supplier of oil to India last year, accounting for nearly a third of its import demand.
Meanwhile, to offset lower sales to China, Saudi Arabia began shipping more of its oil to Western markets.
Russia and Saudi Arabia are the second- and third-largest oil producers in the world, trailing the United States.
Increasing U.S. oil production has offset attempts by Russia and Saudi Arabia to prop up the price of the fossil fuel via output cuts.
The European crude benchmark Brent is down nearly 8 percent over the past year to $77.75 a barrel.

Iran has condemned in the strongest terms the assassination of five of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) military advisors in an Israeli strike in Syria, saying it reserves the right to respond to the ""organized terrorism"" by the fake regime of Israel.
""In addition to political, legal and international pursuit of these aggressive and criminal measures, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its right to respond to the organized terrorism of the fake Zionist regime at an appropriate time and place,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kan'ani said in a statement on Saturday.
Five military advisors serving for the IRGC mission in Syria were martyred along with a number of Syrian forces in an Israeli attack on a three-story residential building in the Mezza neighborhood of Damascus, which houses several diplomatic missions.
The IRGC named its martyred advisors as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
Iran maintains an advisory mission in Syria at the request of Damascus with the aim of helping the war-torn Arab country vanquish the foreign-backed militants who have been fighting the democratically-elected Syrian government since 2011.
Kan'ani slammed repeated violations of Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the escalation of aggressive and provocative attacks on various targets in the Arab country by the regime.
He said Israel's criminal acts indicate its desperation in the fight against the resistance forces in the besieged Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank in more than the past 100 days and a ""desperate"" attempt to spread instability and insecurity in the region.
The Iranian official urged the international community and organizations, particularly the United Nations Security Council, to ""show an explicit reaction and categorically condemn"" the aggressive measures by the terrorist regime of Israel.
He said the Iranian advisors have always played a leading role in helping Syria fight terrorism and establish sustainable peace in the Arab country.
""The assassination of Iranian military advisors [in Syria] by the Zionist regime clearly shows a deep and organized bond between this terrorist regime and various terrorist groups, including Daesh, in the region,"" Kan'ani stated.
Israel frequently targets military positions inside Syria, especially those of resistance fighters who have played a key role in helping the Syrian army in its fight against the foreign-backed terrorists.
The regime has over the past months carried out airstrikes on various locations in Syria and Lebanon as the illegal entity attempts to expand its aggression against the Palestinians in Gaza to other fronts across the region."

Tehran, IRNA -- The public relations office of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has announced that during the air raid by the fighters of the aggressor and usurper Zionist regime, several Syrian forces and four military advisers of the Islamic Republic of Iran were martyred.
IRNA published the IRGC statement on Saturday.
The martyred military advisers include Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi and Saeed Karimi.
Syrian media had already said that an  Israeli strike had targeted a building in the neighborhood of Damascus. They also reported sounds of explosions across the Syrian capital.
The strike came days after the IRGC fired ballistic missiles at Syrian bases of terrorists involved in recent terrorist attacks in Iran, as well as an Israeli espionage center in Iraq's Kurdistan region.
The IRGC said in a statement afterward that the center of the Zionist regime's Mossad spy agency was totally destroyed in the strike.

Tehran, IRNA -- The actions of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Red Sea pose a threat to international shipping, according to a Yemeni official.
Yemen's response will lead to the defeat of the US and the UK, Lebanon's al-Mayadeen news network quoted the unnamed source as saying.
The source maintained that the two countries' attacks on Yemen's al-Hudaydah city show their shared desire to intensify the conflict and expand its scope.
The continuation of US and UK attacks against Yemen and the militarization of the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait is a dangerous threat to international shipping, the Yemeni official added.
The US and the UK have carried out several rounds of attacks on Yemen after the Yemeni armed forces began to block the passage of Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea in retaliation for the occupying regime's genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza.
The Zionist regime launched the deadly war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, after the Gaza-based Palestinian resistance groups carried out a military operation into the occupied territories for the regime's incessant aggression against Palestinians.
Regional resistance movements, including those of Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, have confronted the Zionist regime since it launched the Gaza war.

The head of Ukraine's presidential office dismissed the idea of pivoting to a defensive posture, saying it would only lead to a persistent stalemate.
""The transition to a defensive position often leads to the freezing of the conflict. We have seen this since 2014. We will never accept a frozen conflict with Putin,"" Andriy Yermak said in an interview with Le Figaro.
Some experts in the West have called on Ukraine to focus on a defensive posture after its much-anticipated 2023 summer offensive made little headway in driving Russian forces from their territory. Russia still controls about 20 percent of Ukraine's territory.
Those experts argue that Ukraine should focus on protecting the territory it still controls, claiming it lacks the resources to take back more land.
Yermak admitted constrained manpower and armaments shortages are hindering progress.
""At the front, troops complain about the lack of people and resources and say that they are no longer able to advance. This is definitely a problem, and there is no point in hiding it,"" he said.
Ukraine's parliament is debating a new mobilization bill as its armed forces have struggled in recent months to recruit new soldiers.
Meanwhile, the United States, Ukraine's biggest supplier of military equipment, has yet to approve a new aid bill, forcing Kyiv to conserve weapons use.
Congress has been debating a new $61 billion aid package for months. The bill, if passed, would ensure Ukraine receives military aid to get it through 2024.
Russia is readying to launch a new offensive in the summer, Ukrainian officials told the Financial Times, intensifying Kyiv's need for more men and weapons now.
Despite large-scale offensives by both sides last year, neither made much progress.
Experts have said it is unlikely that either side will make a breakthrough this year.

A multi-million-dollar British Royal Navy warship has crashed into another hi-tech combat vessel anchored at a port in Bahrain, facing risks of sinking.
In a video posted on the internet, the older Royal Navy ship HMS Chiddingfold, a hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel, was filmed smashing into the Royal Navy's minehunter HMS Bangor on Thursday, at an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf island state.
Triggered by a mechanical fault, the collision resulted in a gigantic hole in the hull of HMS Bangor, which was constructed of glass reinforced plastic, destroying nearly the galley and bedrooms.
""The understanding at the moment is when she was attempting to go astern, there was a malfunction,"" an source told Daily Mail.
""The crew couldn't alter her course so they were forced to look on helplessly as she careered into HMS Bangor's rear quarter bow first,"" it added. ""Her interior was ripped apart too. The ship won't be in action for a while.""
After the collision, the sailors got into efforts to stop the vessel from sinking, as it is teetered while being on the edge of sinking.
A British military spokesperson confirmed the embarrassing mishap and reported no causalities.
""We are aware of an incident concerning two Minehunters alongside in Bahrain. There are no casualties as a result of this incident and it would be inappropriate to comment further whilst investigations are ongoing,"" the spokesperson told the Daily Mirror.
Navy sources suggested there was no timeline yet for when the vessel can return to frontline duties, after the repair work is done.
The Bangor's standard crew of 39 includes mine warfare specialists and mine clearance divers.
According to the Ministry of Defense, Bangor is equipped with SeaFox unmanned underwater vehicles that trawl the ocean floor searching for mines.
Usually it is based at the Clyde naval base in Faslane, Scotland, but she has been on long-term deployment to the Persian Gulf, probably because of the rising tensions in the Red Sea."

Ethnic mass killings in one city alone in the West Darfur region of Sudan have left up to 15,000 dead, according to a UN report.
The UN report seen by Reuters on Friday said between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed last year in West Darfur State's El Geneina City.
In the UN report, ethnic violence carried out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and allied Arab militia fighting Sudan's Army led by the country's de-facto ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, was cited as the reason for the killings.
The RSF, however, has previously denied such reports, claiming that if any of its soldiers were found to be involved in ethnic violence, the perpetrators would be prosecuted and face justice.
Independent UN sanctions monitors attributed the death toll in El Geneina to ""credible"" intelligence sources.
Monitors wrote in the report, which was handed to the UN Security Council, that between April and June 2023, El Geneina experienced ""intense violence,"" blaming the RSF and allies for targeting the ethnic African Masalit tribe in attacks that ""may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.""
""The attacks were planned, coordinated, and executed by RSF and their allied Arab militias,"" the sanctions monitors wrote in their annual report. ""When reaching RSF checkpoints women and men were separated, harassed, searched, robbed, and physically assaulted.""
The monitors reported, ""The RSF and allied militias indiscriminately shot hundreds of people in the legs to prevent them from fleeing.""
""Young men were particularly targeted and interrogated about their ethnicity. If identified as Masalit, many were summarily executed with a shot to the head. Women were physically and sexually assaulted. Indiscriminate shootings also injured and killed women and children,"" the report added.
All the eyewitnesses interviewed by the monitors cited, ""many dead bodies along the road, including those of women, children, and young men.""
The Masalit tribe had been the majority in El Geneina until the RSF-led attacks forced their mass exodus, according to the report.
The monitors said the RSF takeover of most of Darfur relied on three lines of support, including Arab allied communities, dynamic and complex financial networks, and new military supply lines running through Chad, Libya, and South Sudan.
""Complex financial networks established by RSF before and during the war enabled it to acquire weapons, pay salaries, fund media campaigns, lobby, and buy the support of other political and armed groups,"" wrote the monitors, adding that the RSF used proceeds from its pre-war gold business to create a network of as many as 50 companies in several industries.
The monitors said after the power struggle between Burhan and his former deputy and RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo started in April, ""most of the gold which was previously exported to UAE, was now smuggled to Egypt.""
In its place, the new increased firepower acquired by the RSF ""had a massive impact on the balance of forces, both in Darfur and other regions of Sudan,"" the report pointed out.
""The whole world witnessed these rebel forces (RSF) committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in West Darfur and the rest of Sudan,"" Burhan told troops gathered in Port Sudan in a video released by his office on Friday.
He called Dagalo a ""clown,"" ""traitor,"" and ""coward."" He also firmly declined to accept the ceasefire agreement that Dagalo had signed in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, this week.
Burhan, during visits this week, criticized African nations such as South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya for considering Dagalo as a statesman. ""He is humiliating the Sudanese people, he is killing them, insulting them, and some people are clapping for him and laughing with him.""
Meanwhile, the United States claims that both the Army and the RSF have been committing war crimes.
International meditation attempts by Saudi Arabia and the US have been to no avail till now.
An attempt last month by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an African trade bloc, which persuaded Burhan and Dagalo to agree to an in-person meeting, also failed.
Since the conflict started on April 15, more than 7.5 million individuals have been displaced, fleeing across the country and to neighboring states, while huge areas of Sudan have been ravaged."

The Palestinian Red Crescent has said Israel bombed a hospital in Khan Younis, and the regime's army in the city reportedly threatened the few healthcare facilities still open in the besieged Gaza Strip.
The Red Crescent said on Friday that displaced people were injured ""due to intense gunfire from the Israeli drones targeting citizens at Al-Amal Hospital"" as well as the rescue agency's base, Reuters reported.
Israeli army tanks also approached Gaza's biggest remaining functioning hospital, Nasser, where people reported hearing shellfire from the west.
The Gaza health ministry said at least 142 Palestinians had been killed and 278 injured in Gaza in the past 24 hours in Khan Younis, taking the death toll from more than three months of war there to 24,762.
The World Health Organization said most of the enclave's 36 hospitals have been damaged by Israeli bombing. Only 15 are partially functioning and those are operating at up to three times their capacity, without adequate fuel or medical supplies, it says.
On Thursday, the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas announced the destruction of more than 390 schools, universities, and educational institutions in over 100 days of brutal bombardment of the besieged strip by the Israeli regime.
The resistance movement said, ""More than 390 schools, universities, and educational institutions have been destroyed in 100 days, the most recent of which was the bombing of Al-Isra University and the re-bombing of the Islamic University today.""
Hamas said that the destruction of school and university buildings in the Gaza Strip ""is a war crime and criminal behavior aimed at destroying all components of human life.""
The resistance group stated that Israel is deliberately targeting the education system to erode the national identity of Palestinians.
Gaza's Ministry of Education announced on Tuesday that 4,368 students have been killed while almost 8000 have been injured since the start of Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip on October 7.
The number of teachers killed is 231 teachers with 756 injured.
Israel's relentless bombardment has also targeted 65 schools affiliated with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Refugees (UNRWA)."

Nearly two years ago, police in Kyrgyzstan raided the offices of a media group famed for its investigations into political corruption, slapping narcotics charges on its leader.
As images of Temirov Live founder Bolot Temirov being manhandled by officers in SWAT gear were shared online on January 22, 2022, many predicted the start of an extended crackdown on independent media by the administration of President Sadyr Japarov.
That crackdown reached an alarming crescendo this week as nearly a dozen current and former staff of Temirov Live were arrested on suspicion of trying to foment unrest in the country, while one of the country's most popular news websites, 24.kg, was targeted in a separate raid.
For so long Central Asia's standout country for independent journalism, intrepid reporting, and media innovation, Kyrgyzstan fell fully 50 places in global media monitor Reporter Without Borders's most recent global ranking, sitting at 122nd place -- only 12 spots above its longtime authoritarian neighbor, Kazakhstan.
That plunge was in large part due to the authorities' decision to put severe restrictions on RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service -- including freezing its bank accounts -- in October 2022.
Local access to the website of Azattyk, as the service is known in Kyrgyzstan, was restored earlier this year, only for another well-respected outlet, Kloop, to come face-to-face with a similar block and potential liquidation.
And now, looming on the horizon, is the threat posed by a new law that experts say could spell the end of independent media in its current format.
But first to the darkest week for the profession in more than three decades of Kyrgyz independence.
'Misleading Society'
While Temirov was born in Kyrgyzstan and had spent most of his working life there, he no longer lives in the country.
His arrest came right after Temirov Live released an investigation into alleged corruption in the fuel business, which featured a relative of State National Security Committee (UKMK) Chairman Kamchybek Tashiev.
The narcotics charges pressed by authorities in 2022 caused a public outcry, and he was subsequently acquitted by a court. But in November of that year, another Bishkek court found him guilty of forging his Kyrgyz passport, and Temirov was bizarrely deported to Russia, where he also held citizenship.
He is since understood to have left Russia but remains unable to return to his homeland.
Yet even after his deportation, the outlet has continued its investigations and political discussions, earning millions of views across three YouTube channels that broadcast in Russian and Kyrgyz.
Kyrgyz authorities rarely come across positively in that content.
One investigation released in December targeted Interior Minister Ulan Niyazbekov, highlighting properties owned by the minister and his relatives and Niyazbekov's apparent ties to organized crime. It also featured detailed testimony from a businessman who said Niyazbekov had extorted him.
Two months before that investigation, the group indicated that a charity led by Japarov's wife received funding from foreign sources, even as authorities promote a Russian-style draft law that would allow them to register organizations receiving financing from abroad or foreign nationals as ""foreign representatives.""
In an interview with RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service on December 14, Temirov said that police were watching his team ""day and night"" since the investigation's release.
The subject for the charges on which 11 current and former Temirov Live staff have been arrested is a video published on YouTube last year by Ait, Ait Dese (Come On, Say It), a Temirov Live spinoff project.
According to the Interior Ministry, linguistic experts found evidence of calls for mass unrest in the broadcast. The ministry has yet to provide a more detailed explanation.
A court ruled on January 17 to keep the detainees locked up for two months pending investigation of the charges.
Among them is Temirov's wife, Makhabat Tajibek-kyzy, presenter Aike Beishekeeva, and three former Temirov Live journalists now working for other media outlets.
Speaking about the arrests for the first time this week in comments published by the state information agency Kabar on January 19, Japarov claimed his government supported freedom of speech and welcomed ""good quality"" media investigations.
""But in most cases, bloggers are busy distorting facts, making mountains out of molehills, or resorting to manipulation and misleading society,"" Japarov said.
Japarov also listed several media organizations that had received grants from organizations such as the U.S.-based National Endowment for Democracy, which he said sometimes amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
""We understand these grants are allocated as part of projects on freedom of speech, support for the media community, development of independent journalism, and so on. But in reality it turns out that the funds are not used for their intended purpose. A policy is being pursued to discredit the authorities, denigrate public policy, agitate society, [make] anticonstitutional statements, and disseminate fake information that poses a threat to national security,"" the president claimed.
Angry Reactions
Temirov has said that the real reason for the arrests of his colleagues is their investigations of top officials.
There are likewise suspicions that the criminal case being built against 24.kg is merely a pretext to force it to tone down its reporting.
The agency's general director, Asel Otorbaeva, and editors in chief Anton Lymar and Mahinur Niyazova were all taken away for interrogation after their office was raided on January 15, the day before the raids on former and current Temirov Live staff.
The three 24.kg journalists were released that evening.
The website is formally being investigated by the UKMK for ""war propaganda"" in relation to an unnamed article covering the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
24.kg's leadership has called the accusation baseless.
The website has been blocked by Russia's Roskomnadzor media regulator since September of last year.
24.kg does not do investigations of the Temirov Live type.
But it is known for its sometimes spiky headlines such as: Everybody Is Equal Under The Law. But The President's Relatives Are More Equal. And for casting doubt on the statements of officials and lawmakers.
Niyazova's sarcastic and government-critical posts on X, formerly Twitter, have turned her into something of a hate figure for pro-government trolls, meanwhile.
In a January 16 statement, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) raised alarm that Kyrgyz authorities were ""renewing their assault on key independent media"" through the raids and arrests.
The watchdog's Eurasia chief, Gulnoza Said, called the authorities' confiscation of equipment from the offices of 24.kg and Temirov Live ""deeply concerning,"" noting that confidential sources could be at risk.
Diplomatic ""statements of concern"" followed from the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union's delegation in the country.
Unfortunately, it appears that there will be plenty of fodder for such statements in the coming period.
At present, there are few critical media outlets without problems.
Kloop, which has investigated illegal enrichment schemes involving some of Kyrgyzstan's powerful people in the past, currently faces a legal battle to prevent the liquidation of its parent organization, Kloop Media.
Two other independent outlets, Kaktus and Politklinika, were as of last year tied up in civil cases initiated by pro-government and government-owned media.
But the biggest blow of all might be struck by the country's parliament, the pro-regime Jogorku Kenesh, where only a handful of lawmakers spoke out against the authorities' actions against Temirov Live and 24.kg.
That is because the legislature is due to consider a media law that sector experts have warned could do untold damage to Kyrgyz journalism.
In yet another condemnation of the crackdown, seven international human rights groups -- among them Human Rights Watch and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee -- called the draft law ""repressive"" and urged the parliament not to pass it in its current form.
""The draft law would significantly expand government control over the media and grant the authorities wide powers to deny media outlets registration, obstruct their work, and close them down,"" the rights groups said on January 16.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused the US-backed opposition and the CIA of planning ""terrorist attacks"" in order to destabilize the country ahead of the presidential election this year.
Maduro and leaders from the US-backed opposition signed an agreement last month, pledging to hold a competitive presidential election. The deal was signed in Barbados in an event facilitated by the Norwegian government and attended by US representatives.
""Venezuela is entering a period of presidential elections, but the mercenary extreme right and the parasitic opposition will not brook the election process. They will trigger a war to harm the people; they will wage a war and terrorist attacks. they are getting ready,"" Maduro said.
""The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States, as well as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), from its headquarters in Colombia, are preparing violent, coup-like and anti-constitutional actions against Venezuela,"" he added.
""The CIA and the DEA, agencies that operate independently, are criminal entities.""
On Thursday, Maduro ordered civilians, the army and the police across the country to activate the Furia Bolivariana or Bolivarian Fury Plan, under which everyone has the duty to fight against ""any terrorist attempt"" and ""defend the right to peace"".
""The order is given: maximum vigilance, unity and preparation for any internal and external aggression against the decorum, cohesion and absolute loyalty of the FANB (National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela),"" stated Maduro's instruction to Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino LÃ³pez.
""The enemies of Peace and the Homeland do not rest, they want to stop the recovery and economic tranquility. They wont be able!"" it added.
Maduro also stressed during a telephone speech at an event for workers in the state of Bolivar Amazon that the opposition was preparing ""coup attempts"" and ""violent protests"" as well as a ""war"" against electricity and public services.
""We should be ready like a boxer with both hands, so that if they go the wrong way, we will defeat them."""

Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps says five of its military advisors have been assassinated in an Israeli strike in the Syrian capital.
The IRGC said in a statement on Saturday that the advisors were ""martyred"" along with a number of Syrian forces in the attack in Damascus.
The attack targeted a three-story residential building in the city's Mezza neighborhood which houses several diplomatic missions.
""Once again, the barbaric and criminal Zionist regime launched an aggression on the city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, and a number of Syrian forces and four military advisers of the Islamic Republic of Iran were martyred during the air raid by the usurper regime's fighter jets,"" the statement said.
The IRGC had initially announced that four of its military advisors were assassinated in the Israeli strikes, but later said in a statement that a fifth succumbed to his injuries.
The IRGC named its martyred advisors as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
Israel frequently targets military positions inside Syria, especially those of resistance fighters, who have played a key role in helping the Syrian army in its fight against the foreign-backed terrorists.
The Tel Aviv regime has over the past months carried out airstrikes on various locations in Syria and Lebanon as the illegal entity attempts to expand its aggression against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip to other fronts across the region.
Iran maintains an advisory mission in Syria at the request of Damascus with the aim of helping the war-torn Arab country vanquish the foreign-backed militants who have been fighting the democratically-elected Syrian government since 2011.
Last month, an Israeli air attack on a suburb of Damascus killed Iranian general Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a longtime IRGC adviser in Syria.
Earlier in December, Israel also killed two IRGC military advisors â Mohammad Ali Ataee Shoorcheh and Panah Taqizadeh â in an attack in Syria.
The IRGC announced in a statement that the two officers were martyred against the backdrop of the relentless savagery of the ""fake and child-killing"" Israeli regime in Gaza."

In its report, the IEA has estimated Iran's total oil revenue in the first nine months of 2023 at $33.9 billion.
Iran's oil revenues in January-September 2023 were about 12% of the total income of OPEC in this period.
The IEA has also announced the production of over 3 million barrels of oil in Iran for the eighth consecutive month in 2023.
According to this report, in May 2023, Iran's oil production reached more than 3 million bpd for the first time since the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and in the following months, it has remained above 3 million bpd.

Iran's Navy has launched a new combat and training flotilla to the high seas with a multifaceted purpose.
Tehran (ISNA) - The fleet, which included the Bushehr and Tunb battleships, left the southern port city of Bandar Abbas on Friday during a ceremony attended by Rear Admiral Shahram Irani.
During the event, the Navy Commander stated that the flotilla was deployed on a ""heavy and multidimensional mission.""
He divulged that the Navy troops on board the fleet would be trained in the mission to prepare them to take on delicate tasks in the future, detailing that Iranian forces maintained a presence on the high seas and oceans despite the plans of their enemies.
On January 1, an advanced destroyer belonging to the Iranian Navy fleet entered the Red Sea through the Bab Al-Mandab Strait.
Irani cited the Navy's two important operations in recent months, including the capture of a US oil ship in the Sea of Oman, and stated that the Iranian Armed Forces and Navy remain unwavering in their protection of national interests.
Iran's navy has confiscated an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman waters following ""a court order"" authorizing the move, state media reported on Thursday.
The Admiral stated that four Iranian combat flotillas were also on international seas at the same time that the new fleet was being deployed.
In recent years, Iran's Navy has become self-sufficient in the production of surface and subsurface boats. It has also strengthened its presence in international waterways to safeguard naval channels and protect commerce ships and tankers.

ED9KBEF6MK_4J7OISTYNGOT2LJ,US Continues Preemptive Strikes Against Houthi Missile Launchers Near Red Sea,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240120-voa01.htm,"By Carla Babb, Jeff Seldin January 20, 2024
U.S. Central Command forces struck a Houthi anti-ship missile prepared to launch and aimed at the Gulf of Aden on Saturday.
In a statement on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, the U.S. Central Command said its preemptive strike ""will make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels.""
The incident â the latest amid growing tensions in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that have disrupted global trade and raised fears of supply bottlenecks â took place in the early hours of Saturday local time, the U.S. Central Command said.
It is the U.S. military's seventh strike against Houthi missile launchers in a week. The White House says the strikes are necessary to protect merchant ships and U.S. Navy vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the United States launched three strikes Friday to destroy ""Houthi missile launchers that were ready to launch attacks.""
Attacks show solidarity, say Houthis
Attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia on ships in and around the Red Sea for the past several weeks have bogged down trade between Asia and Europe and created fears of a widening war in the Middle East.
The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.
U.S. defense officials say the Houthis have carried out at least 31 attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Nov. 19, 2023.
Major shipping companies have responded by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa. The Red Sea route is a vital shipping link between Europe and Asia, carrying about 15% of the world's maritime traffic.
But a senior official of the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist group said Friday that Chinese and Russian vessels will have safe passage through the Red Sea.
Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi political leadership, said in an interview with the Russian outlet Izvestia that the shipping lanes around Yemen are safe to ships from China and Russia, as long as vessels are not connected with Israel, Agence France-Presse reported Friday, citing Izvestia.
Commanders from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC, and Lebanon's Hezbollah group are on the ground in Yemen helping to direct and oversee Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, four regional and two Iranian sources told Reuters.
Tehran has funneled money, training and advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, who started targeting commercial vessels in November in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, the sources said according to Reuters.
IRGC commanders and advisers also are providing technological know-how, data and intelligence support to determine which of the dozens of vessels traveling through the Red Sea each day are destined for Israel and constitute Houthi targets, all the sources said.
Washington also noted last month that Iran was deeply involved in planning operations against shipping in the Red Sea and that its intelligence was critical to enable the Houthis to target ships.
Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Foundation of Defense of Democracies' Center on Military and Political Power, criticized the U.S. administration's approach to the Houthi attacks, saying that knocking out existing missiles in Yemen without a comprehensive effort to counter Iranian weapons is ""like cleaning up puddles in your home while ignoring the leak in the roof.""
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani has repeatedly denied Tehran is involved in the Red Sea attacks by the Houthis. The IRGC public relations office did not respond to requests for comment.
US forces attacked
In addition to the dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes, there have been more than 140 attacks by Iranian-backed proxies against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack, triggering fears of a widening war in the region.
Missile attacks in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen on Saturday exacerbated the crisis.
Iran said five of its Revolutionary Guards commanders were killed in a missile strike on a house in Damascus that it blamed on Israel, and security sources in Lebanon said an Israeli strike there killed a member of Iran-backed Hezbollah.
Israel has not commented on the Syria attack.
Later Saturday,an American official said a missile or rocket attack had injured U.S. personnel at a base in Iraq, where Iran-backed groups have previously battled U.S. forces.

ERAG0YWFSS_LLWHSTHCR9LO0O0,Netanyahu Says No Compromise on Full Israeli Control in Gaza,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/01/mil-240120-voa02.htm,"By VOA News January 20, 2024
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he ""will not compromise on full Israeli control"" over Gaza and stated that ""this is contrary to a Palestinian state,"" rebuffing U.S. President Joe Biden's comment that creative solutions could bridge wide gaps between the leaders' views on Palestinian statehood.
Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions"" when he was asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, ""No, it's not.""
Biden said Friday he spoke with Netanyahu, the first call the White House had in nearly a month with the Israeli leader, about possible solutions for creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a nonmilitarized government.
""In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,"" a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office said.
The Israeli prime minister is facing increasing conflicting pressures at home.
Relatives of hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza protested outside his home Saturday, demanding his government take decisive steps to secure the release of their loved ones. They say they fear that escalating military activity further endangers the captives' lives.
Meanwhile, a divide over the direction of the war, now in its fourth month, is growing inside the Israeli cabinet.
Former Israeli army chief Gadi Eisenkot, a member of Israel's War Cabinet, has said a cease-fire is the only way to secure the hostages' release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel's current strategy not to let up on Israel's war on Hamas militants until their destruction.
Netanyahu also is under heat by members of his right-wing governing coalition who want an all-out war against Hamas, while the U.S., Israel's main ally, is calling for restraint in Gaza.
The Israeli leader has said he will push for ""complete victory"" against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it.
Critics have accused him of preventing a Cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say Netanyahu is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition.
A strike on a residential building in Damascus, Syria, Saturday killed five members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran said, blaming Israel.
Hours later, the IRGC issued statements identifying the five dead as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
Iran has vowed to carry out revenge attacks against Israel.
Syrian state television said the building, which was destroyed in the midmorning strike, was in a neighborhood of the Syrian capital where several embassies are located.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, which rarely acknowledges its actions in Syria.
The strike came as Israel hit targets across Gaza Saturday.
Israel said it targeted militants in northern Gaza who it said were trying to plant explosives and fire missiles at Israeli tanks.
In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, witnesses reported intense shelling overnight near Nasser Hospital. Israel said its troops raided a militant compound where it found explosives and destroyed rocket launchers.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israel. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and others, also took about 240 people as hostages.
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reported one of the largest single-day death tolls, including 165 Palestinians killed and 280 more wounded in the last 24 hours.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but most of the nearly 25,000 Palestinians killed since the war began are civilians, health officials say.
The unrelenting humanitarian crisis in Gaza ""remains dire,"" the Red Crescent said Saturday on X, formerly Twitter, ""with 800,000 Palestinians grappling with a severe scarcity of essential supplies.""
Women hit hard during war
Women have been particularly hard-hit in the Gaza crisis. Seventy percent of the nearly 25,000 people killed in Gaza have been women and children, a figure that includes two mothers per hour, according to a report issued Friday by U.N. Women, the U.N. agency for gender equality and empowerment for women and girls.
""We have seen evidenced once more that women and children are the first victims of conflict and that our duty to seek peace is a duty to them,"" Sima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Friday in a statement accompanying the report.
In the West Bank
Israel arrested 22 Palestinians overnight in the occupied West Bank, including a woman and children, according to Al Jazeera. The arrests were conducted in Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Bethlehem, Jenin and Jerusalem, it said.
The Palestinian Prisoners Club told Al Jazeera the arrests ""were accompanied by widespread raids and abuse, in addition to widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens' homes, the destruction of infrastructure, and the confiscation of money and vehicles.""

Saturday, 20 January 2024 3:00 PM
Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber says the country is interested in the promotion of political ties with Sudan following the restoration of relations after seven years.
Mokhber made the comment in a Saturday meeting with Sudanese acting Foreign Minister Ali al-Sadiq in Uganda's capital Kampala on the sidelines of the 19th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
Tehran and Khartoum decided to restore relations to serve the two countries' interests after Iran and Saudi Arabia signed a China-brokered agreement in March 2023 to resume ties following a seven-year hiatus.
Mokhber said Iran and Sudan have a common stance on the need to support the oppressed Palestinian people and called on Muslim countries to make more efforts to stop Israel's crimes in the Gaza Strip.
He said the Palestinian resistance groups have succeeded in crushing the hegemony of Israel and the United States as the regime's great benefactor in the region.
The Iranian official called for mounting international pressure to lift Gaza's blockade and provide immediate relief to its oppressed people.
Elsewhere in his remarks, the Iranian vice president warned against plots by outsiders such as the Israeli regime to stoke unrest in Sudan. He said support for the Muslim people of Sudan and its legal government with the purpose of establishing peace and stability in the country is a principled stance taken by Iran.
Sadiq, for his part, said Sudan was not interested in severing ties with Iran but it is now making efforts to boost mutual relations.
He held Israel and some of its regional allies responsible for the recent developments in Sudan and said his country has been victimized by foreign intervention.
The Israeli regime supported conflicts in Sudan because Khartoum refused to normalize ties with Tel Aviv, he said.
The top Sudanese diplomat said his country supported the Palestinian cause as a centerpiece of its political agenda and that Khartoum would continue its efforts to put an end to the ongoing crisis in Gaza and help its people."
FEPYSS3QTL_ZGFN9SICIA1IHX7,The Myanmar military's air superiority is slipping away amid sanctions and opposition attacks,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240120-rfa01.htm,"Like everything else in the nearly three years since the coup, the junta's air superiority is fading.
A commentary by Zachary Abuza 2024.01.20 -- One of the most important setbacks for Myanmar's military since an opposition alliance launched Operation 1027 last October has been the loss of three different aircraft: two jet trainers and an Mi-17 heavy-lift helicopter. An Mi-35 attack helicopter was also lost in 2023.
The Myanmar military should have total air superiority.
For the first two years of the conflict, the opposition National Unity Government's (NUG) best air defense was doxing Air Force pilots - publishing their addresses, as part of an assassination campaign.
Gradually, the NUG's People's Defense Force militias began to erode the junta's air superiority by effectively deploying armed drones.
Significantly, we're now seeing Ethnic Resistance Organizations (EROs) begin to deploy air defenses, at a time when the junta has become even more dependent on air attacks. That increased tempo of operations requires more maintenance on overworked airframes.
These military junta losses matter for three reasons.
First, while not small by regional standards, the Myanmar Air Force (MAF) certainly does not have excess capacity. At the top end, it has some 31 SU-29s and four  recently delivered SU-30s from Russia.
The recently delivered seven JF-17s multi-role fighters, jointly produced by China and Pakistan, are reportedly already grounded due to cracks in their airframes and other maintenance issues.
Airworthiness questions
On paper, Myanmar has approximately 40 other jet fighters, but these are old, Chinese-produced knock-off Russian jets from the 1990s. They are well beyond their service life.
The MAF is thought to have 20 Nanchang Q-5s, the Chinese version of the MiG-19, down from the 36 it imported from 1994-2001. It also has some 21 Chengdu J-7s, a Chinese produced MiG-21. That's down from some 60 that it had purchased from 1990-1999.
It's unclear how many of these fighters are still airworthy.
Myanmar's military has relied on its 18 Russian-built Yak-130 trainers for much of its combat operations. Since the February 2021 coup, Myanmar has taken delivery of some six Guizhou JL-9 jet trainers, referred to as FTC-2000G, which have a spotty performance and safety record.
The MAF also flies an unknown number of Chinese K-8 trainers that can be used for ground support.
Second, we should also assume that given sanctions on the Singapore-based companies that have been the key importers of spare parts, the overall lack of foreign exchange available to the junta, and other supply chain issues, including those caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, that around 20% of the aircraft are probably not operational.
In December 2023, the sanctioned director of Sky Aviator and two others were caught trying to  smuggle 508,925 Singapore dollars (US $382,380) in cash out of that city-state. Sky Aviator, which has an office in Singapore, had a large contract to purchase spare parts for the air force. Another sanctioned firm, Sky Royal Hero Company Limited, has the contract for the maintenance and spare parts for servicing the Russian jet fighters.
For nearly three years, the MAF has been flying at increased tempos without the scheduled maintenance they require.
Airstrikes ramping up
The military's promised counter offensive has not materialized. Over 4,000 troops have surrendered since Operation 1027 began, and well-documented recruitment issues mean the military does not have a sufficient number of troops to launch ground offensives across the multiple battle zones, which has forced them to rely on long range artillery and air strikes.
An independent research firm documented 336 airstrikes in December 2023, alone, with nearly half against the Three Brotherhood Alliance, the group of ethnic armies behind Operation 1027..
The loss of one of their 12 already over-taxed heavy lift helicopters is another important setback for the military's counter-offensive. One of their tactical advantages has been air mobility and resupply, especially given their loss of key roads.
Although the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) claims to have shot down the Guizhou JL-9/FTC-2000G on Jan. 17, there is little evidence to support this, Video footage that shows the plane falling from the sky, without smoke or any other sign of hostile fire, indicates likely engine failure.
That leads to the third implication: The MAF is losing aircraft to hostile fire.
While the military claims that it was a technical malfunction that brought down a K-8 trainer, Karenni forces claim to have shot it down.
The KIA claims to have shot down an Mi-17 transport helicopter, killing all six crew members on Jan. 3.
Both helicopters and the trainers, especially when they are being used for ground attacks, are vulnerable to small arms fire.
Eyes on Beijing
But these developments also beg the question: What weapons are being used to down the aircraft?
The only ethnic armed group that is known to have shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles (known as MANPADs) is the United Wa State Army (UWSA).
Until very recently, the UWSA has sat out the conflict, neither supporting the junta nor joining the NUG. It recently declared its neutrality in the Three Brotherhood Alliance's Operation 1027, though it did receive two townships from them.
Though the UWSA has quietly sold weapons to other ethnic armies and the NUG, it has, to date, refrained from selling MANPADs.
Has that changed? And if so, why now? It was long believed that they would not sell the weapons for fear of angering China. So did China approve the transfer, or are the groups now willing to incur Beijing's wrath?
The KIA claims that they shot down the Mi-17 helicopter with a Chinese made FN-6 MANPAD. The transfer of these weapons to the KIA has never been acknowledged, and may indicate a substantial shift in Chinese policy.
Even if the Jan. 17 crash was caused by a mechanical failure, the KIA is smart to claim credit for downing the aircraft - if for no other reason than to sow fear amongst the pilots.
But what is clear, is that at the same time Myanmar's military has become even more dependent on air strikes, it's confronted by international sanctions and cash shortages that have hurt the servicing of their planes. At the same time, opposition forces are now fielding a limited number of surface-to-air missiles.
Like everything else in the nearly three years since the coup, the junta's air superiority is slipping away.

Tehran, IRNA -- Sudan's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Sadeq Ali says severing diplomatic ties with Iran in 2015 was not his county's intention, expressing readiness to resume relations with Tehran.
He made the remarks in a meeting with Iran's First Vice-President Mohammad Mokhber which took place on the sidelines of a Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Uganda on Saturday.
The Iranian vice president, for his part, stressed the common stances of Iran and Sudan with regard to the Zionist atrocities going on in Gaza Strip and their support for the oppressed people of Palestine.
Mokhber also expressed regret about the recent unrest and conflict in Sudan which he said is a result of foreign intervention, including by the Zionist occupying regime and underscored Iran's support for the Sudanese people and the country's legal government.
The Sudanese top diplomat, in the meantime, said that the main reason for the Zionist regime's support for the unrests in Sudan is that the Sudanese government has not accepted to normalize relations with this regime.
Noting that supporting the cause of Palestine is one of the main stances of Sudan, he reiterated his country's efforts to put an end to the crisis in Gaza.

CAIRO/DAMASCUS (Sputnik) - One person was killed and three injured in an Israeli strike on a residential building in the Syrian capital Damascus, the director of Al Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus, Imam Amin, said on Saturday.
""One dead and three injured, including a woman, were admitted [to the hospital] as a result of an Israeli strike on a residential house,"" Amin was quoted by Syrian newspaper Al Watan as saying.
Two person killed by airstrike were information officers of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, according to information, obtained by AlMayadeen.
The building hit by the strike consisted of four floors and was completely destroyed by the strike, Syrian media reported.
According to Syrian media, the most-likely Israeli strike targeted a building in the Mazzeh neighborhood of Damascus, while another outlet reported explosions heard throughout the city.
Iranian advisers to the legitimate Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad were reportedly using the building, which was ""entirely flattened"". Lately, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps confirmed the death of four military advisers.
Israel has a long record of attacking Iranian-linked targets in Syria, and its attacks have become even more ruthless after the recent escalation of the conflict with Palestine.

Tehran, IRNA -- Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi has said that a fatal attack by the Israeli regime on Iranian military advisors in Syria shows how desperate and helpless the regime has become in dealing with the regional Axis of Resistance.
In a message issued on Saturday, Raisi said that Iran will definitely respond to Israel's ""cowardly terror act"" that killed five members of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) earlier in the day in the Syrian capital Damascus.
The Iranian president said the attack was a sign of defeat and lack of success for ""the illegitimate Zionist regime"" in its struggle to reach evil objectives, adding that hegemonic countries led by the United States are enablers of such crimes because they continue to offer support to the Israeli regime.
Raisi also said the attack would be another stain on the record of all governments who claim to be the advocates of human rights because it violated Syria's airspace and trampled on human and international laws.
The IRGC said on Saturday that five of its officers, who had been serving in Syria in an advisory capacity, had been killed in the Israeli attack on a residential building in Damascus.
Iranian authorities said the attack was an attempt by the Israeli regime to divert attention from its continued military campaign in Gaza where it has killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians since it launched the aggression in early October.

At least 42,284 Russian military personnel have been killed since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, according to research by journalists from Mediazona and the BBC Russian Service who have established the deceased soldiers' identities.
The number includes 5,089 mobilized soldiers and 7,810 inmates recruited from Russian prisons, the two media organizations said.
The journalists from Mediazona and BBC Russian Service also established that out of the total, at least 3,053 were officers and 349 of them had ranks of lieutenant colonel or higher.
The journalists based their research on data from open sources such as obituaries in the media and messages on social networks by relatives of the victims.
A breakdown by Russian regions showed that most of the identified troops killed in action were from the Krasnodar region, 1,640, followed by the Sverdlovsk region with 1,449, Bashkortostan with 1,353, and Chelyabinsk, 1,191.
Russia's capital, Moscow, lost at least 482 identified military personnel, while 480 deceased soldiers were from St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.
The Russian Defense Ministry does not disclose data on personnel losses and does not comment on figures reported by journalists.
Earlier this month, Russian media website Important Stories found out that starting from 2022, the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation prohibited employees of its regional branches from publishing information about those involved in the war in Ukraine who receive social benefits, since such data could be used to calculate the losses of the Russian Army.
In April, Important Stories wrote that the Russian Defense Ministry has stopped publishing information about military pensions for disability and for war widows and orphans for similar reasons.

Senior Hamas official Basem Naim affirmed that the Palestinian movement has not received any official communication from Arab countries regarding the proposed solution for the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.
Tehran (ISNA) - Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Naim pointed out that Hamas still believes that the US administration's stance on the Israeli aggression in Gaza ""has not changed fundamentally,"" emphasizing that the changes are ""only superficial"".
He mentioned that Washington calls for not expanding the conflict in the region while deploying fleets and assaulting Yemen.
The Palestinian official revealed that discussions during the meetings between the Hamas delegation and Russian officials in Moscow focused on the situation on the ground in the Gaza Strip and enhancing international efforts to stop the ongoing Israeli aggression.
Earlier, a Hamas delegation met with the Special Envoy of the Russian President to the Middle East and Africa, and the Deputy Foreign Minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, at the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow.
The Palestinian delegation engaged in political consultations with the Russian Foreign Ministry to discuss ways to achieve a ceasefire that would end the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people and clarify the movement's stance and policies regarding the file of the captives held by the Palestinian Resistance in Gaza since October 7.
In a related context, US National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby maintained the US position against a ceasefire in Gaza, as he explicitly said, ""The US still opposes a general ceasefire in Gaza,"" despite a death toll nearing 25,000, in addition to 62,108 injured.

Tajani commented on remarks by Italy's opposition Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein, who earlier called on the government to stop arms supplies to the Middle East, ""especially to Israel,"" so as not to fuel the ongoing conflicts there.
""Italy has stopped sending any kind of weapons to Israel since the beginning of the Gaza war. It's all blocked. The period when the most weapons were sent to Israel was during the premiership of [former Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe] Conte. But with the outbreak of hostilities, we suspended all deliveries of weapons systems and military equipment of any kind,"" Tajani said in an interview with Italian newspaper Quotidiano Nazionale, published on Friday.
On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip, while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages. Over 24,900 people have been killed so far in Gaza as a result of Israeli strikes, local authorities said.
On November 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on December 1.

Indonesia has filed a lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the regime's violations of international law in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Israeli regime's Hebrew language newspaper Maariv reported Friday that Jakarta filed the action against the regime at the ICJ in The Hague, as the regime's brutal bombardment of the besieged enclave continues.
Reports said earlier that Jakarta has asked a team of experts to help draft a case at the ICJ to hold Israel accountable for its ""policies and practices"" in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that expert advice is necessary to create a detailed legal opinion to show the world Israel's violations of international law.
Indonesia and Slovenia announced last week that they had decided to ""actively participate"" in the motion for an advisory opinion due to Israel's genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.
The ICJ is scheduled to conduct public hearings on February 19, when Marsudi and other parties will present their perspectives on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.
""Indonesia supports the efforts of the UN General Assembly to obtain an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice,"" Marsudi has said.
In December 2022, the UN General Assembly voted to request that the ICJ issue an advisory opinion as to whether Israeli policy in the territories violated international law.
Indonesian law expert Hikmahanto Juwana said the court's decision in the case is only advisory.
Jakarta's move to take Israel to the UN court comes after the ICJ held its first hearing in the case against Israel's ongoing genocidal war against the Gaza Strip earlier this month. The case was lodged by South Africa with the tribunal in late December.
Indonesia has not joined South Africa's case since it is not a party to the Genocide Convention. Foreign Minister Marsudi said Jakarta supports South Africa's efforts to report Israel's violations of the Genocide Convention to the UN court.
The court's decision on South Africa's request for provisional measures ""could be expected in February, if not before,"" Turkish news agency Anadodu reported, citing Italian lawyer Tiersisto Mariniello."

Tehran, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has strongly condemned a Zionist attack at a residential area in Damascus where four Iranian military advisors were martyred.
Kanaani said on Saturday that the governments and the international and regional organizations, including the UN Security Council, are expected to take strong measures in response to such acts of crime and terrorism.
He noted that the Iranian advisors are present in Syria upon invitations by the Syrian government and have played a key role in helping the country's government, army and nation in the fight against terrorism and helping to the establishment of peace, stability, and sustainable security in the country.
The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman added that the Zionist assassination of Iranian military advisors is indicative of a deep and organized connection between ""this terrorist regime"" and the different terrorist and Daesh groups in the region.
Noting that Iran will pursue the issue in the international organizations, he also stressed Iran's right to retaliate.

HEUFVT5W9P_IK107TR64RBBKE4,Zelenskyy Says He Is Fearful of Second Trump Presidency,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240120-voa01.htm,"By VOA News January 20, 2024
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed concern over the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House and said he considers the former U.S. president's claims that he could stop Ukraine's war with Russia in 24 hours ""very dangerous.""
In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News that aired Friday, Zelenskyy invited the former president and front runner for the Republican presidential nomination to visit Kyiv, provided Trump delivers on his promise in a way that can satisfy Ukraine.
""Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv,"" said Zelenskyy. ""If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come.""
The Ukrainian leader expressed concern over a potential Trump presidency where Trump's idea of a negotiated peace in Ukraine might involve Ukraine making major concessions to Russia.
""[Trump] is going to make decisions on his own, without ... I'm not even talking about Russia, but without both sides, without us,"" Zelenskyy said. ""If he says this publicly, that's a little scary. I've seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that's really making me a bit stressed.""
Trump has repeatedly stated that he is well-positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for almost two years, saying he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
Throughout his political career, Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
During a campaign rally in Georgia just days after Russian tanks moved into Ukraine, Trump described Putin as a ""smart"" political player and expressed admiration for Russia's swift takeover of a vast, ""great piece of land"" at the cost of what he suggested were relatively minor sanctions.
Agency warns of mines
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi warned Saturday that mines had been re-planted around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, just months after a team of international inspectors had reported the area had been cleared from mines.
In a statement on the agency's website, Grossi cautioned that mines in the plant's buffer zone, between its internal and external fences, go against the agency's safety standards.
The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Petro Kotin of Energoatom, called the alleged planting of mines as ""another crime"" by Russian forces that have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early weeks of the war.
In a Telegram update Saturday, Kotin said the situation at the plant ""will remain fragile and dangerous as long as the Russians remain there.""
The IAEA has repeatedly expressed concern the war could cause a potential radiation leak from the facility, which is one of world's 10 biggest nuclear power stations.
The plant's six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.
Russia has been in control of the site since 2022 and is refusing to allow IAEA experts access to some areas of the plant.
""Such access is needed to monitor nuclear safety and security,"" the IAEA statement said.
Lawmakers propose bill confiscating property
Russian lawmakers have prepared a bill allowing for the confiscation of money and property from people who spread ""deliberately false information"" about the country's armed forces, a senior member of parliament said Saturday.
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the measure would also apply to those found guilty of what he described as other forms of betrayal such as ""discrediting"" the armed forces, calling for sanctions against Russia, or inciting extremist activity.
""Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, who betrays it, must face deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country, at the cost of their own property,"" Volodin wrote on Telegram.
Wife calls for husband's return
Meanwhile, at the election headquarters of President Vladimir Putin, the wife of a Russian soldier delivered an emotional appeal Saturday for her husband's return from the front, a defiant gesture in a country where open criticism of the war is banned.
""Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has issued a decree that my husband has to be there [in Ukraine.] I'm interested to know when he will issue a decree that my husband has to be home,"" Maria Andreyeva said as campaign workers looked on.
Andreyeva became involved in a heated exchange with a woman who told her that Russian soldiers in Ukraine were defending the motherland, and she should pray for them.
""So, what's next? The Ministry of Defense has spent its money, now we need to squeeze everything out of our guys, get the last life out of them? So that they come back to us just as stumps?"" Andreyeva questioned.
""Will they give me the stump? What will I get back? A man without legs, without arms, a sick man? Don't you know what's happening there?"" she asked.
Some material for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters."

The Iranian Space Agency has successfully launched the Sorayya satellite into orbit at an altitude of 750 kilometers, the Iranian government announced on social media.
The Sorayya satellite was launched using a three-stage Qaem 100 rocket as part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' space program.
""The Sorayya satellite, owned by the Iranian Space Agency, was successfully launched using a three-stage solid-fuel carrier rocket Qaem 100 of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and put into orbit at an altitude of 750 kilometers,"" the government announced.
Eisa Zarepour, the Islamic Republic's Minister of Information and Communication Technologies, said in late November that Iran plans to launch five new satellites into space before the end of the Iranian calendar year [March 20, 2024].
Earlier, Hassan Salarieh, the head of Iran's space agency, said specialists from one of Iran's research centers had prepared a biocapsule for space launch. Zarepour announced in October that the country would conduct the first tests of a biocapsule designed to send astronauts in a month or two. He added that Iran is working to send a man into space in the next five years.
Earlier, the IRGC Space Force successfully launched the third military satellite Nur-3 into orbit, and Iran announced plans to launch two more satellites into orbit by the end of March 2024.

The Palestinian resistance movements Hamas and Islamic Jihad have strongly condemned an Israeli attack on a residential building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed five Iranian military advisors.
In a statement issued on Saturday, Hamas said the attack earlier in the day on the Mazzeh neighborhood was a violation of the Syrian sovereignty.
It said the attack once again laid bare the threat posed by the ""Nazi"" Zionist regime to the security and stability of the region.
The Islamic Jihad issued a statement, saying the attack was an attempt by the Israeli regime to divert attention from its failure in the campaign in Gaza and to expand the scope of aggression to other parts of the region.
It said the attack cannot dent the resolve of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) in its mission to fight Israel, adding that nor can it shake Syria's position as a major supporter of the Palestinian cause.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad offered condolences to the Iranian nation, the government and the IRGC for the loss.
The IRGC on Saturday confirmed the death of four of its officers in what it said was an Israeli attack on Damascus. A fifth officer was confirmed dead later in the day after he succumbed to injuries suffered in the attack.
IRGC forces have been serving in Syria in an advisory capacity and as part of a decade-long agreement with the Syrian government and armed forces.
The Israeli attacks on Syria come amid the regime's relentless genocidal campaign in Gaza where it has killed nearly 25,000 people since early October."

An Israeli air strike on January 20 that targeted a building in Syria's capital, Damascus, used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) killed four Iranians, including two senior officials, Iranian media and the IRGC said.
In an official statement, the IRGC named its four members who were killed in the attack as Hojatullah Omidhar, Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, and Saeed Karimi.
However, Nour News, which is thought to have close ties to the country's intelligence services, identified two of the dead as General Sadegh Omidzadeh, the intelligence deputy of the IRGC's expeditionary Quds Force in Syria, and his deputy, Hajj Gholam.
Separately, Sky News Arabic channel reported that one of those killed in the strike was Akram al-Ajuri, a senior member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organization.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition war monitor with a network of sources inside Syria, said at least six people -- five Iranians and a Syrian -- were killed in the strike that occurred during a meeting of from Iran-backed groups.
The monitor said four other people were still missing under the rubble.
There was no immediate explanation for the media reports' discrepancy in the numbers, names, and nationalities of those killed in the attack on the Damascus neighborhood known as a high-security zone home to lRGC leaders and pro-Iran Palestinian factions.
Israeli media reported the attack quoting Reuters news agency, but there was no immediate official confirmation that Israel was behind the strike.
The attack occurred four weeks after Razi Musavi, a high-ranking official in IRGC's elite Quds Force, was killed in a similar attack in the Zainabiyah neighborhood of Damascus.
Musavi was responsible for military coordination between Iran and Syria, according to Reuters, while Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC, reported that he had been one of the oldest advisers of the force in Syria and ""an associate"" of Qasem Soleimani, a former Quds commander who was killed in January 2020 in an air strike by U.S. forces near Baghdad.

Tehran, IRNA -- Five people have been killed in a suspected Israeli regime's attack against Syria, media outlets have reported.
The five were reportedly killed on Saturday in an explosion that hit a residential building in the Western Villas area at Al Mazzeh of Damascus on Saturday, reports said.
The cause of the explosion is unclear; however, initial reports suggest an Israeli airstrike was the cause of the blast, added the sources.
According to media reports, several more people have been injured in the explosion.
Meanwhile, Ismail Al-Sindawi, the representative of the Islamic Jihad movement in Syria, said that none of the members and offices of the movement have been targeted in the explosion in Damascus.

Six people were killed in two separate incidents in Pakistan's restive northwest late on January 19, police and officials said.
In the first incident, a doctor involved in polio vaccination efforts in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province was shot dead late on January 19, police said.
Abdul Rahman was the coordinator of the polio inoculation campaign in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bajaur district bordering Afghanistan.
He was traveling in his car on Friday evening when he came under attack from unidentified armed men. Rahman was gravely wounded and died later in a hospital in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Earlier this month, seven policemen who were protecting polio teams were killed in a roadside bomb attack claimed by the banned Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Islamist extremists frequently target polio inoculation teams and the security forces assigned to protect them, falsely asserting that immunization campaigns are Western plots to sterilize Muslim children.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in the world where polio has not been completely eradicated.
In the second incident, in the North Waziristan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan unidentified assailants killed five men late on January 19 before fleeing the scene, police officials and locals told RFERL's Radio Mashaal on January 20.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. North Waziristan police chief Rokhan Zeb said an investigation had been launched into the incident.
Police said the victims were non-local men who appeared to be truck drivers.
North Waziristan has long been a hotbed of militants operating on both sides of the border.
After the Afghan Taliban returned to power following the withdrawal of the U.S.-led forces from the war-wracked country, many TTP members have reportedly found sanctuaries in Afghanistan, using the country to launch more frequent attacks on Pakistani troops and civilians.
Pakistani military officials claim their mop-up operations in North Waziristan have cleared the area of the Taliban fighters and other militant groups.

The UK military has carried out some 50 spy missions over the Gaza Strip for the Israeli regime since last month, a new investigation has revealed.
In its latest report, Declassified UK, a news website focused on British foreign policy, said the flights have taken off from the UK's controversial Akrotiri air base on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
It said the military dispatched Shadow R1 surveillance aircraft to gather intelligence for Israel.
The news website also said in a report in November that the UK military transport aircraft flew daily from Akrotiri to Tel Aviv between October 13 and 26.
The base, located in southern Cyprus, is about 40 minutes flying time from Tel Aviv.
In early December, Britain's Ministry of Defense released some information on the flights between Akrotiri and the occupied territories but has refused to specify what is being transported.
It claimed at the time that the flights would only attempt to gather information on British hostages held by the Hamas resistance movement in Gaza.
""But the extraordinary number of flights, and the fact that they started nearly two months after the hostages were taken, raises suspicions that the UK is not collecting intelligence solely for this purpose,"" Declassified UK said.
Monitors and media reports also revealed recently that Britain is supplying Israel's military forces for the regime's onslaught on Gaza from the military bases in Cyprus.
Head of the Cyprus Peace Council Charis Pashias said last week that locals have seen a ""daily"" increase in the number of flights from Akrotiri since Israel launched its bombardment of the Palestinian territory on Oct 7, 2023.
He said people have also ""become aware of the illegal presence of thousands of American soldiers now stationed in Akrotiri.""
The UK military also refused to disclose details of US activity from Cyprus.
British lawmaker Kenny MacAskill, who has raised questions in parliament about the role of Akrotiri airbase in Israel's war on Gaza, said it was ""disgraceful"" that ""both UK citizens and a sovereign state are denied information as to what is being done.""
""The use of RAF Akrotiri does seem to allow the UK to deny information and complicity by saying it's the USA. Equally, the USA avoids disclosure by saying it's UK territory,"" he added.
Both the UK and the US have come under fire for supporting Israel in its genocidal war, whose main victims have so far been women and children, according to UN Women, the United Nations agency promoting gender equality."
MYKXA49DN9_0EN8N34E7ZIGVYK,Pressure On Ukrainian Media Threatens Zelenskiy's Messaging To The West,_,_,20240121,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/01/ukraine-240120-rferl03.htm,"By Todd Prince, RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service January 20, 2024
On January 16, a little-known news outlet called The People's Truth posted recordings of private phone calls between several Ukrainians discussing the purchase of drugs such as marijuana, MDMA, and methamphetamine along with surveillance video that showed them using the narcotics at a vacation lodge.
The people depicted all worked as camera operators for Bihus.Info, a Kyiv-based independent investigative news outlet that has produced some of the hardest-hitting reporting on corruption among the Ukrainian elite over the past decade.
Uploaded to The People's Truth YouTube page with the misleading title The Other Side of Bihus.Info: They Snorted Meth, Swallowed MDMA, Smoked Dope And Then Drove To Investigate, the video was clearly meant to discredit the news outlet, Ukrainian journalists and media watchdogs said.
Two days earlier, unidentified men tried to force their way into the home of Yuriy Nikolov, chief editor of Nashi Hroshi, or Our Money, an online news site known for its deep dives into government spending. They demanded Nikolov enlist in the military to fight against the Russian invasion.
The incidents are the latest in a series of pressure campaigns targeting Ukrainian journalists, raising concerns about a systemic problem. The onslaughts originate mainly in anonymous accounts on social media sites such as Telegram, making it difficult for victims to identify the perpetrator. Media outlets and watchdog groups suspect government involvement, including from Presidential Volodymyr Zelenskiy's administration.
Daria Zarivna, senior adviser to Zelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, rejected any notion of a connection to the anonymous Telegram channels.
The two incidents come at a critical moment for Zelenskiy, who is trying to convince the United States and Europe to keep military and financial aid flowing as Ukraine seeks to hold back the invading Russian forces and drive them out of the country. Zelenskiy has repeatedly argued in Washington, Brussels, and other Western capitals that his nation is on the front line in the global battle between democracy and authoritarianism.
A spending package that includes some $61 billion in mostly military aid for Ukraine has been stymied in the U.S. Congress for three months. While domestic issues in Ukraine are not the main stumbling block, some Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have highlighted what they say are concerns about corruption and the state of Ukrainian democracy.
""We as a state are defending democracy, defending values. We are like a democratic David fighting against the evil Russian totalitarian Goliath. And yet we have such things happening here that contradict the values we uphold,"" Oksana Romanyuk, director of the Kyiv-based Institute for Mass Information, told RFE/RL.
Denys Bihus, the founder of Bihus.Info, said a review of the videos and phone calls posted by The People's Truth indicates that his employees had been under surveillance by as many as 30 individuals for several months, if not longer.
He said someone installed the surveillance camera in the room a day before his employees arrived at the vacation lodge for a company party. He said he suspects Ukraine's intelligence services were behind the surveillance. Law enforcement authorities have opened an investigation into the incident.
Nikolov also accused the state of being behind the intimidating visit to his apartment, calling it ""the government's response to [my] criticism of the president.""
Nikolov broke one of the biggest stories of 2023 in Ukraine when he reported that the Defense Ministry had been buying eggs for troops at inflated prices. The corruption scandal raised fresh questions about how Western aid was being spent and prompted Zelenskiy to fire several top officials.
'Illegal Actions'
Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a deputy from the opposition party Holos and chairman of the free speech committee in Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, told RFE/RL that the wiretapping and surveillance of Bihus employees were ""definitely illegal actions"" and called for an investigation.
Mediarukh, or Mediamovement, an organization comprising journalists and media experts, called the events a ""clear violation of the right of journalists to privacy"" and said they undermine Ukraine's democratic credentials.
During his nightly commentary on January 17, Zelenskiy said that pressure on journalists was ""unacceptable.""
Hours earlier, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) said it opened an investigation into the actions that targeted Bihus.Info. But some journalists and media analysts and advocates are demanding more action.
Romanyuk called on Zelenskiy to personally oversee the investigation into the incidents. For decades, government critics have said Ukraine's justice system doesn't work when it comes to investigating and prosecuting alleged crimes by powerful people.
In its October 17 statement, Mediarukh noted that other outlets, including Ukrayinska Pravda, NV, Tsenzor, Vavilon, and Liga.net had also recently faced pressure.
Some of those cases involved personal attacks on journalists via anonymous Telegram channels that Ukrainian media experts charged are linked to the presidential administration.
The People's Truth, which published the compromising information about Bihus.Info, appears to be a fake outlet, according to experts, and the biographies of its editorial staff appear to be made up. Until a few months ago, it hadn't published anything on its YouTube page in five years.
Romanyuk told RFE/RL the media attacks appear to be systemic. She said the situation smacked of the days of Moscow-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych, when many reporters were pressured during the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests that led to his ouster.
Mykyta Poturayev, chairman of the parliamentary committee for humanitarian and information policy and a member of Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party, agreed with that assessment.
""This has not happened in the country for a long time. This has not happened since the time of Yanukovych,"" he told RFE/RL.
Free Media Concerns
Long before the current spate of pressure campaigns against journalists, there had been concern about the state of media freedom under Zelenskiy, a comic actor who co-owned a successful television production company.
Since he announced his presidential bid on national TV on December 31, 2018, Zelenskiy has often kept his distance from prominent Ukrainian media outlets, preferring to get his message to the public via social media.
He rarely holds press conferences with local reporters. He comes off as combative when asked tough questions at such events. Days after journalist Yuriy Butusov got into a heated argument with Zelenskiy at his 2021 press conference, law enforcement opened an investigation into one of Butusov's social media posts. Butusov called it retaliation, something the authorities denied.
Zelenskiy has also clashed with tycoons whose television stations were critical of his leadership. In 2021, as his ratings declined, Zelenskiy shut down three television stations believed to be owned by Viktor Medvedchuk, a friend and associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin's who was later detained on suspicion of treason and sent to Russia in a prisoner exchange. The stations, which bashed Zelenskiy, were accused of being Russian mouthpieces.
Months later, Zelenskiy pushed through parliament a controversial bill that could force the handful of billionaires who largely controlled the nation's media to sell those assets if they wanted to participate in political life. While the tycoons' dominance of the nation's media has been widely bemoaned, many experts voiced concern that the law could be selectively applied.
Following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the presidential administration used martial law to gain influence over key media assets.
Four leading stations owned by tycoons began cooperating with two state-owned channels to produce round-the-clock content -- partially state-funded and created with government input -- that they all shared. While the unified programming helped citizens in the early days of Russia's invasion, some experts fear it is turning into a public relations tool for Zelenskiy, who could seek another term once the war ends and elections are resumed.
Bihus.Info reported last year that some of the government funding for the unified TV programming was being subcontracted to a company owned by Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a former member of Zelenskiy's presidential administration and production company.
Nonetheless, Ukraine rose to an improved position in the 2023 annual ranking of nations by press freedoms as determined by Reporters Without Borders, jumping from 106th place to 79th.
With national TV channels mainly engaged in sharing war-related programming, the field of investigative journalism in Ukraine has been largely left to shoe-string outlets like Bihus and Our Money, making their survival critical for the nation's progress on talking corruption and strengthening democracy.

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]
The UK Ministry of Defence reported that   Ukraine maintains a presence on the left bank of the Dnipro River and has continued to repel Russian attacks despite logistical concerns. On 16 January 2024, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Southern Defence Forces remarked that logistical supply on the left bank of the Dnipro had faced difficulties.
Russia's Dnipr Grouping of Forces has been unsuccessful in all its attempts to dislodge the Ukrainian defenders, despite almost certainly having a significant advantage in the balance of forces on this axis. It is highly likely that the poor training and coordination of Russian forces in the area is limiting their offensive capabilities.
Forcing Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the left bank of the Dnipro remains a priority operational objective for Russia. It is highly likely Russia will persist with attacks in the Krynky area in the coming weeks despite growing personnel losses.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day of January 20, there were 72x combat engagements. Russian forces launched a total of 3x missile (with S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles at the civilian infrastructure of Novohradivka, Donetsk oblast) and 4x air strikes, carried out 25x MLRS attacks at the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements. Unfortunately, the Russian attacks have resulted in civilian casualties and injuries. Over 35x private residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure were destroyed and damaged.
Volyn and Polissya axes: no significant changes. No signs of formation of an offensive group. Certain units of the armed forces of Belarus continue their missions in the areas bordering Ukraine.  Sivershchyna and Slobozhanshchyna axes: Russia maintains its military presence in the areas of russia bordering Ukraine. Russia continues its sabotage and reconnaissance activities, shelling Ukrainian settlements from the territory of russia and increases the density of minefields along the state border of Ukraine. Russian forces launched an air strike near Chernats'ke (Sumy oblast). Around 40x settlements came under Russian artillery and mortar fire, including Hrem'yach (Chernihiv oblast), Seredyna-Buda, Pavlivka, Volodymyrivka, Basivka (Sumy oblast), Udy, Okhrimivka, Zemlyanky, Khatnje (Kharkiv oblast).  Kup'yans'k axis: the Ukrainian defenders repelled 21x assaults in the vicinities of Syn'kivka, Petropavlivka (Kharkiv oblast) and Stel'makhivka (Luhansk oblast). In that area Russian forces made attempts to breach Ukrainian defense. The Russian invaders fired artillery and mortars at more than 15x settlements, including Dvorichna, Masyutivka, Syn'kivka, Petropavlivka, Berestove (Kharkiv oblast).  Lyman axis: the Ukrainian defenders repelled 6x assaults near Terny, Yampolivka (Donetsk oblast), and 7x attacks in the areas of Serebryans'ke forestry, Bilohorivka (Luhansk oblast). Russian forces fired artillery and mortars at more than 10x settlements, including Karmazynivka, Nevs'ke, Dibrova (Luhansk oblast), Ivanivka, Verkhn'okam'yans'ke, Spirne (Donetsk oblast).  Bakhmut axis: the Ukrainian Defense Forces repelled 8x attacks in the vicinities of Bohdanivka, Andriivka and Klishchiivka (Donetsk oblast), where the Russian occupiers made unsuccessful attempts to improve their tactical situation. Around 10x settlements came under artillery and mortar fire, including Bohdanivka, Ivanivske, Klishchiivka, Andriivka, Kurdyumivka, New York (Donetsk oblast).   Avdiivka axis: the Ukrainian defenders repelled 6x Russian attacks near Avdiivka, and 11x more attacks south of Sjeverne, Vodyane, Pervomais'ke and Nevel's'ke (Donetsk oblast). In that area, the Russian occupiers made unsuccessful attempts to breach Ukrainian defense. Russian forces fired artillery and mortars at more than 15x settlements, including Novobakhmutivka, Avdiivka, Tonen'ke, Pervomais'ke, Netailove, Nevel's'ke (Donetsk oblast).  Mar'inka axis: the Ukrainian Defense Forces continue to hold back Russian forces in the vicinities of Mar'inka and Novomykhailivka (Donetsk oblast). In that area, the Russian adversary made 4x failed attempts to improve its tactical situation. The settlements of Krasnohorivka, Mar'inka, Heorhiivka, Pobjeda, Novomykhailivka, Paraskoviivka were under artillery and mortar fire of the Russian occupiers.  Shakhtars'ke axis: Russian forces conducted no offensives. Russian forces fired artillery and mortars at more than 10x settlements, including Vodyane, Vuhledar, Prechystivka, Zolota Nyva, Urozhaine (Donetsk oblast).  Zaporizhzhia axis: the Ukrainian defenders repelled 1x assaults west of Verbove (Zaporizhzhia oblast), where Russian forces made attempts to regain lost ground. More than 15x settlements, including Poltavka, Hulyaipole, Novoandriivka, Shcherbaky, Kam'yans'ke (Zaporizhzhia oblast), came under Russian artillery and mortar fire.  Odesa operational-strategic group, Kherson axis: Russian forces fired artillery at the city of Kherson, as well as the settlements of Dmytrivka, Ochakiv (Mykolaiv oblast).

Saturday, 20 January 2024 6:00 PM
Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi has strongly condemned the assassination of five Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) advisors in an Israeli missile strike in Syria, saying such ""cowardly"" acts will not go unanswered.
""Certainly, the continuation of such terrorist and criminal acts, which are indicative of the increasing failure and defeats of the illegitimate Zionist regime in achieving its malicious goals and the depth of its frustration with the fighters of the resistance front, will not go unanswered by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Raeisi said in a statement on Saturday.
The IRGC said earlier in the day that four of its members serving on a military advisory mission in Syria were assassinated in an Israeli strike on a residential building in Damascus. It said later than a fifth advisor had succumbed to his injuries.
The IRGC named its martyred advisors as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aqazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
""The recent crimes of the usurping Zionist regime, which.... are committed under the shadow of the support of hegemonic countries, chief among them the United States, and the silence of international organizations, will undoubtedly be another stain on the black record of all self-proclaimed human rights advocates,"" Iran's president said.
Raeisi also offered his condolences to the families of the martyrs, the Iranian leadership, and the entire nation.
Iran maintains an advisory mission in Syria at the request of Damascus to help the war-torn Arab country fight off the foreign-backed militants who have been fighting the democratically-elected Syrian government since 2011.
The Israeli regime has ramped up its airstrikes on Syria since early October, when it launched the ongoing genocidal war against the Gaza Strip."

Tehran, IRNA -- Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah says that the Al-Aqsa Storm Operation revived the Palestinian cause and made it hit the headlines.
In a message to the ""12th Conference of Gaza; Symbol of Resistance"" which was held in Tehran on Saturday, Nasrallah said that the Operation made the world aware of the significance of the Palestinian cause which the foes had tried for years to consign into oblivion.
Al-Aqsa Storm Operation turned the threats into opportunities, he further noted.
He reiterated the importance of resistance, noting, ""Those who suppose that the Ummah has an option other than resistance are completely wrong.""
Resistance is a key to victory when it comes to war in Gaza, he underscored.
The drops of blood shed in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran on the path of resistance have been in line with the sacrifices of fighters in the Gaza war, he pointed out.
This is called the unity of blood, weaponry, battlefields, and causes, he underlined.
Resorting to global organizations and the so-called international community has repeatedly proven futile, resulting only in regret, loss, failure, and bitterness.
Elsewhere in his message, he said that the normalization of relations with the Zionist regime has endangered the cause of Palestinians.
The families of the martyrs, military officials, and participants from the resistance front took part in the international event.
After more than three months of genocide in Gaza by the Zionist regime and the death of over 24,000 Palestinians, the European Parliament has finally issued a non-binding resolution in support of a ""permanent ceasefire"" in the besieged enclave.

The Palestinian Resistance is engaged in fierce confrontations against Israeli occupation forces on the 106th day of the conflict, according to the reports.
Tehran (ISNA) - Al Mayadeen's correspondent in Gaza indicated that the confrontations are concentrated in Khan Younis, south of Gaza, as well as in the center of the Strip, especially northeast of the Al-Bureij camp.
Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Hamas movement, announced that its Resistance fighters targeted an Israeli Merkava tank in Al-Bureij camp using a locally made Al-Yassin 105 shell and shelled the Israeli occupation forces in the camp with mortar shells.
Al-Qassam snipers also targeted an Israeli soldier in Al-Bureij using a homemade al-Ghoul rifle and targeted two other soldiers in Khan Younis.
East of Khan Younis, the Brigades targeted three Israeli Merkava tanks with a homegrown Explosively Formed Penetrator, Shawaz, killing two raiding soldiers, prompting an Israeli helicopter to land to evacuate the killed and wounded soldiers.
Al-Qassam Brigades released footage showing its fighters targeting Israeli forces advancing near the border of Gaza City with mortar shells and 107mm rocket artillery.
In addition, the Palestinian Resistance fighters blew up a tunnel with a number of Israeli soldiers inside, causing casualties among them after managing to lure them to Al-Tuffah neighborhood, east of Gaza City.
The Brigades also confirmed targeting a fortified building housing Israeli special forces with four RPG shells and engaged with Israeli soldiers using automatic weapons, in addition to targeting an Israeli soldier in the Sheikh Ajleen neighborhood, west of Gaza City, with snipers.
In Al-Zaytun neighborhood, southeast of Gaza City, Al-Qassam fighters targeted an Israeli tank with an Al-Yassin 105 shell, as well as an Israeli military vehicle with an RPG shell.
The Brigades also detonated an anti-personnel explosive device against an Israeli force and later engaged in direct confrontations with the force's soldiers in Jabalia, north of the Gaza Strip.
However, Israeli warplanes deliberately targeted Yahalomi again a few days ago with the intention of killing him, and despite their efforts to save his life, he was killed, the Resistance group's statement added.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - US airbase Ain al-Asad in Iraq's western Anbar Province has been targeted by at least 15 missiles, Iraqi news agency Shafaq reported on Saturday, citing a security source.
The missiles were launched from the Iraqi city of Albaghdadi, the source said, without giving further information.
Yahya Rasool, a spokesman for the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces, told the Iraq News Agency that the bombing injured an Iraqi soldier and caused material damage.
""A number of missiles fell near the headquarters of the 29th Brigade, 7th Division, affiliated with the Al-Jazeera Operations Command, within the Iraqi Ain Al-Assad base, wounding a soldier and causing damage to the headquarters,"" he said.
A number of US soldiers are being examined for traumatic brain injuries after ""Iranian-backed militants"" carried out a missile attack on US airbase Al-Assad in western Iraq's Anbar Province, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Sunday, adding that the US is also assessing the damage caused to the base.
""At approximately 6:30 p.m. (Baghdad time) time Jan. 20, multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in Western Iraq targeting al-Assad Airbase. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base's air defense systems while others impacted on the base. Damage assessments are ongoing. A number of U.S. personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. At least one Iraqi service member was wounded,"" the CENTCOM said on X.
Since the beginning of the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the bases of the US-led international coalition in Iraq, as well as US troops in Syria, have come under regular attacks, with armed Shiite groups claiming responsibility in Iraq. However, this attack is reported to be one of the most massive since the the start of the recent turmoil in Gaza.
On October 7, 2023, Palestinian movement Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip, while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages. Over 24,900 people have been killed so far in Gaza as a result of Israeli strikes, local authorities said.
On November 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on December 1.

A massive barrage of rockets has targeted Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq's western province of Anbar, where US military forces are stationed on alleged training and advisory missions.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of anti-terror fighters, in a statement published on its Telegram channel claimed responsibility for the attack on the Ain al-Asad air base, located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of the capital Baghdad, on Saturday evening.
It said the base was targeted by a large number of rockets and the projectiles ""directly hit their targets.""
The group said the large-scale rocket attack was carried out in retaliation for US support of Israel's bloody military campaign in the Gaza Strip.
There were no immediate reports about the extent of damage at the military facility, and possible casualties.
Sabereen News, a Telegram news channel associated with Iraqi anti-terror Popular Mobilization Units, later released video footage showing rockets flying in the sky toward the US-occupied base.
The development comes a day after the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for intercepting and shooting down an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US military.
It said in a statement that the unmanned aerial vehicle was brought down as it was hovering in the skies over Iraq's eastern province of Diyala. The aircraft had taken off from Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, situated 37 kilometers (approximately 23 miles) from the Iraqi border.
Iraqi resistance forces have conducted dozens of strikes on the US-run military installations in both Iraq and Syria amid growing anti-US sentiments in the region over Washington's support for the Israeli genocidal campaign in Gaza.
Israel launched hostilities in Gaza following a historic operation by the Gaza-based Hamas resistance group against the occupying entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people. More than 100 days into the campaign, the regime has achieved no objectives despite killing more than 24,900 people, mostly women and children.
The United States has supplied Israel with weapons and intelligence support, and blocked UN resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Palestinian territory."

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement has roundly condemned the latest EU Council sanctions against a number of individuals connected to the Gaza-based group and fellow Hamas movement, terming the measure as ""politically-motivated"" and in support of Israel.
The Islamic Jihad, in a statement released on Friday night, said the ""expected and worthless"" decision is strongly indicative of the complete and unqualified support that the European Union offers to the Zionist regime.
""This European decision is a politically-motivated cover-up for the massacre they have launched against our nation. This measure is far beyond the military and intelligence support that Europeans have been providing to Zionists in their attacks against the Gaza Strip, and disregards calls by all world nations for the immediate stoppage of this war,"" it added.
The statement noted that Palestinian resistance groups defend the rights of a nation, whose lands have been expropriated and has been struggling against all forms of mass killing and genocide for the past 76 years.
""These groups will continue their duty to defend Palestinians until final victory and [full] liberation of Palestine,"" the Islamic Jihad pointed out.
Earlier on Friday, the EU Council targeted a number of individuals connected to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, subjecting those listed to asset freezes and barring them from traveling to the European Union.
The first list of sanctioned people includes Sudan-based financier Abdelbasit Hamza Elhassan Mohamed Khair, Nabil Chouman, the former's son Khaled Chouman, senior Hamas financier Rida Ali Khamis, senior Hamas operative Musa Dudin and Algeria-based financier Aiman Ahmad Al Duwaik, according to a statement from the council.
""The new sanctions framework shall apply until January 19, 2025. It shall be kept under constant review and renewed or amended as appropriate,"" the statement added.
A senior EU official earlier said the first batch of sanctioned individuals was linked to providing funds to the group."

Tehran, IRNA -- Russia has called on Palestinian resistance movement Hamas to speed up releasing civilians seized during the attacks on October 7, 2023, media outlets have reported.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation issued a statement on Friday, informing that Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Mikhail Bogdanov had held talks with a member of the Hamas Political Bureau Mousa Abu Marzook.
During the meeting, both sides focused the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict that has propelled the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip to catastrophic proportions.
The Russian official stressed the need for expediting the release of civilians seized during the attacks on October 7, 2023, including three Russian citizens.
Moscow is making efforts to contact the warring parties to reach a ceasefire, he further noted.
Meanwhile, Hamas's delegation said that the atrocities committed by the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people and the region pose a serious threat to global peace and security.
The delegation also called for the right of the Palestinians to achieve freedom and return to their homeland and the right to resist the Zionist occupiers with all available methods and tools.
After more than three months of genocide in Gaza by the Zionist regime and the death of over 24,000 Palestinians, the European Parliament has finally issued a non-binding resolution in support of a ""permanent ceasefire"" in the besieged enclave.

The European Union said Friday it will ramp up its production of ammunition in response to Ukrainian calls for support as its war against Russia closes in on the two-year mark.
By the end of the year, EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said, the EU will be able to produce at least 1.3 million rounds of ammunition.
""We are at a crucial moment for our collective security in Europe, and in the war of aggression run by Russia in Ukraine, Europe must and will continue to support Ukraine with all its means,"" Breton told reporters during a visit to Estonia.
The announcement comes as NATO prepares for military exercises that begin next week, amid concerns that the war in Ukraine could tumble over into other European countries.
""We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day â most recently again against our friends in the Baltic states,"" German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Friday in the Tagesspiegel newspaper.
Next week NATO will mount its largest series of military exercises since the end of the Cold War. The Steadfast Defender 2024 will involve about 90,000 troops from all 31 NATO members and Sweden in the war games rehearsal that runs through May.
""We have to realize it's not a given that we are in peace,"" said Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, the NATO military committee chief, earlier this week in Brussels during a meeting of military chiefs. ""Expect the unexpected.""
Elsewhere Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Russia has surrounded the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant with landmines.
The agency said in a statement that the mines that had been removed in November ""are now back in place,"" a development it said is ""inconsistent with the IAEA safety standards.""
Russia, which has been in control of the site since 2022, is also refusing to allow IAEA experts access to some areas of the plant.
""Such access is needed to monitor nuclear safety and security,"" the statement said.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken hosted Mexican Foreign Secretary Alicia BÃ¡rcena yesterday at the Department of State to follow up on migration commitments made on December 27 in response to the invitation of President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador.
Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, and USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman joined Secretary Blinken for the meeting.
Foreign Secretary BÃ¡rcena was joined by Defense Secretary Luis Crescencio Sandoval GonzÃ¡lez; Secretary of the Navy Admiral Rafael Ojeda Duran; Secretary of Public Security Rosa Icela RodrÃ­guez Velazquez; Mexican Ambassador to the United States Esteban Moctezuma BarragÃ¡n; FÃ©lix Arturo Medina, Undersecretary of Human Rights, Population and Migration, SEGOB; Roberto Velasco, Head of the Unit for North America, SRE;  Commissioner for the National Migration Institute Francisco GarduÃ±o Yaez; and Alejandro Celorio, Legal Counselor, SRE.
During the meeting, Secretary Blinken and the U.S. delegation noted that our coordinated efforts with Mexico are demonstrating positive results at our shared border.  They discussed the positive impact of efforts to increase migration controls on bus and train routes, crack down on criminal smuggling networks, and scale up repatriations for those who do not have a legal basis to remain in our countries.
Secretary Blinken highlighted the peaceful transfer of power in Guatemala as one of the most significant developments in the region since the last meeting.  In close collaboration with the Government of Mexico, the United States stands ready to support the people of Guatemala and their new government on a wide range of issues including economic development and hemispheric migration management.
U.S. and Mexican officials also discussed their bilateral efforts to counter human smuggling and arms trafficking.  In addition, they reaffirmed the importance of further expanding lawful pathways and work opportunities, including between our two countries.
Migration is a hemispheric challenge.  The United States is committed to work hand in hand with Mexico and countries across the region to address the root causes of migration and advance economic opportunities in the spirit of Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection.
The two governments committed to continue their strong cooperation on migration, including in senior leader discussions on the margins of the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee meeting in Mexico City in early February."

The United Nations secretary-general urges all parties across the international community to recognize Palestinians' right to statehood.
Antonio Guterres made the remarks on Saturday, addressing a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in the Ugandan capital of Kampala.
He denounced ""the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people"" as ""unacceptable,"" asserting, ""The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all.""
The comments came amid an ongoing genocidal war by the Israeli regime against the Gaza Strip that began following an October 7 operation by the coastal sliver's resistance movements.
At least 24,927 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have so far died in the indiscriminate military campaign.
Refusal to accept the Palestinians' right to statehood, Guterres added, ""would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security...""
The regime has, since the onset of the war, been staging sporadic attacks against Lebanon too, which has sparked a firefight with the Lebanese resistance movement of Hezbollah.
Iraqi and Yemeni resistance movements have, meanwhile, been staging retaliatory strikes against Israeli and American targets as a means of protesting the onslaught and the United States' all-out military and political support for it.
In its final summit communiquÃ©, the Non-Aligned Movement also ""strongly condemned the illegal Israeli military aggression against the Gaza Strip,"" and called for ""a lasting humanitarian ceasefire.""
The assembled leaders in Kampala also called for ""the independence and sovereignty of the State of Palestine"" with East al-Quds as its capital.
NAM is a forum of 120 countries that are not formally aligned with any major power bloc."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The Russian military wreaked havoc on the positions of Ukrainian air defense systems in Odessa with several Soviet P-35B missiles, a source told Sputnik.
""Several Soviet-made P-35B missiles of the Utes and Redut systems were used to strike the positions of Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile systems near Odessa. Missiles with an original analogue control system and a television and radio command system were used, which, however, showed good effectiveness of hitting Ukrainian military targets,"" the source said.
P-35 is a Soviet supersonic anti-ship cruise missile weighing more than 4 tonnes with a maximum firing range of up to 400 kilometers. The first test launch of a prototype of such a missile took place in 1959; the missile system was put into service in 1964 on surface ships. Later, the latest modification of the missile, the P-35B, were also adopted into service as part of the Utes and Redut coastal stationary and mobile missile systems.
