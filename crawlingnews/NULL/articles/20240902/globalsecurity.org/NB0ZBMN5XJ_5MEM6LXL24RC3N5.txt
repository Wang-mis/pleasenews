Meanwhile in the #WestBank:
for more than six days now, #Jenin has been ravaged by violence + destruction.
This is causing loss of life & injuries including among civilians + severe damage to infrastructure.
Over more than 150 hours, people have been undergoing an Israeli military operation, armed clashes & the use of explosives by Palestinian armed groups.
Residents have limited access to food, water & medicine.
@UNRWA is working with humanitarian + local partners to deliver urgently needed aid.
I call for the immediate protection of civilians across the West Bank including in the north.
Both the Israeli army & Palestinian armed groups must uphold the protection of civilians + provide access to assistance
