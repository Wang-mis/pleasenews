Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba submitted his resignation Wednesday as part of an expected government reshuffle.
Parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk posted Kuleba's resignation letter on Facebook.
Lawmakers are expected to consider the resignation of multiple officials, including the deputy prime minister and the justice minister, with new appointments coming Thursday, officials said.
Kuleba, who became foreign minister in 2020, has helped lead Ukraine's outreach to the world throughout the Russian invasion that began in early 2022. He met regularly with Western officials, including European Union foreign ministers last week as Ukraine sought more military aid.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address Tuesday that Ukraine needs to "strengthen some areas" of its government and that "personnel decisions have been prepared."
"We need a new level of simultaneous information work, cultural and diplomatic. And a new level of relations with the global Ukrainian community," Zelenskyy said. "Now is the time to give new strength to Ukraine's governmental institutions, and I am grateful to everyone who will help."
