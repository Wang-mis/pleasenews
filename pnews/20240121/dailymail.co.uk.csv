Maisy, 23, was seen wearing a very relaxed outfit to combat the frigid cold that New York City is currently experiencing.
She paired an orange and black bomber jacket with a bright yellow beanie, and loose-fitting jeans. Other guests appeared to be dressed in similarly eclectic manners.
During the live taping of the show, Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che roasted the likely 2024 presidential nominees from both parties over their ages. Biden is 81 and Trump is 77.
'Guys I don't know if we should do this election,' said Jost. 'It's honestly starting to feel like elder abuse.'
'We should tell Trump and Biden that they both won' and then essentially send them out to pasture, he joked.

Both Donald Trump, 77, and Joe Biden, 81, have been described as too old for the country's top job. As their campaigns kick into high gear, increased scrutiny will be applied to any moments of confusion or error either experiences
Australian actor Jacob Elordi hosted the January 20 SNL show with musical guest Reneé Rapp, both of whom were in attendance at the afterparty.
Rapp, who is currently starring in the musical reboot of Mean Girls, wore black pants, a black jacket, white t-shirt and a big smile as she headed to the event.
Elordi's girlfriend, social media star and college admissions bribery scandal participant, Olivia Jade, was also in attendance.
The long-limbed beauty was snapped leaving the afterparty bundled up in a long white fur coat, which she wore over black tights and black platform heels.
Model and actress Cara Delevingne was also spotted in a hat and scarf paired with her characteristically downcast expression.
Also pictured entering the party was cast member Chloe Fineman, who was accompanied by comedian Sarah Sherman, and famed director Steven Spielberg, who braved the below-freezing temperatures in what appeared to be just a suede jacket.

Jacob Elordi and Olivia Jade have been dating on-and-off since 2021. Though breakup rumors about the stunning pair swirled this week, but all appeared well on Saturday night

During the SNL weekend update, Che, commenting on John Kerry's decision to leave his role as the administration's 'climate envoy' is a poor indicator for things to come on the Biden campaign trail.
'It's not a great sign that President Biden's campaign is a bigger emergency than climate change.' he said.
Jost detailed two moments on the campaign trail from last week.
Biden claimed to have had his picture taken with Congresswoman Deborah Ross at an event in North Carolina. She was, in fact, not at the event.
The gaffe was reminiscent of the tangibly awkward moment in 2022, when the president asked Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, a Republican from Indiana, to stand up. Walorski had tragically passed away in a car accident the month prior.
On the campaign trail in New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump seemed to sub rival Nikki Haley's name into a thought about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
'By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley … did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it?
'All of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security, we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down,' he said.
Trump and Biden are currently their respective party's presumptive nominees for the Oval Office.
Biden, despite a rocky first term and ongoing criticism about his old age and mental abilities, is not seriously being challenged by anyone inside the Democratic establishment for the nomination
That led Haley to question Trump fitness to serve as president, while Trump hit back at Haley's concerns.
Trump and Biden are currently their respective party's presumptive nominees for the Oval Office.
Biden, despite a rocky first term and ongoing criticism about his old age and mental abilities, is not seriously being challenged by anyone inside the Democratic establishment for the nomination.
Trump is facing several challengers, though the list has winnowed significantly and voting has only occurred in one state.
It is not remotely clear that either Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis have a path to the nomination, but the three will continue to duke it out in New Hampshire on Tuesday, followed by Nevada and South Carolina."

The former immigration minister was questioned on GB News about his recent personal makeover which has seen him shed the pounds and adopt a new businesslike haircut.
Westminster gossip suggests he might be lining up a leadership bid in the wake of a Tory election defeat, having taking an increasingly leading role in opposition to Rishi Sunak's Rwanda plans.
Mr Jenrick was one of just 11 Tories who voted against the Safety of Rwanda Bill last week, arguing the plan to deport Channel migrants to east Africa was not strong enough to work.
While MPs backed down from defeating the law, potentially toppling Mr Sunak's administration, Mr Jenrick's actions - which included writing several hardline amendments to the bill - have increased his appeal to the party right.
Asked by GB News whether he was positioning as a future leader if Mr Sunak steps down he said: 'I'm not giving that any though … I'm not ruling it out but that is not my intention, yet.'
It came as another potential leadership candidate broke cover to demand greater military spending.
Penny Mordaunt, who challenged both Mr Sunak and Liz Truss in the summer of 2022, warned that the Royal Navy must 'keep pace' with its rivals in a stark intervention in a row over the size of the fleet.
It came as Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was unable to say when the UK might hit its target of spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence, amid warnings about the shrinking size of the British Army.
The former immigration minister was questioned on GB News about his recent personal makeover which has seen him shed the pounds and adopt a new businesslike haircut.

Westminster gossip suggests he might be lining up a leadership bid in the wake of a Tory election defeat, having taking an increasingly leading role in opposition to Rishi Sunak's Rwanda plans.
Mr Jenrick told GB News he was just trying to 'make an argument' about illegal migration.
'I think that for too long, too few politicians have gone and argued that we need to take the most robust action.
'So if I can help the conservative party by making that argument very strongly then I will do. Because I think there is a path to victory at the next election, but it goes through taking the strongest possible approach on migration.'
Mr Sunak has said he is 'determined' to get his Rwanda legislation through Parliament, as ministers prepare for stiff resistance in the House of Lords to the flagship asylum policy.

Cabinet Minister Penny Mordaunt warned that the Royal Navy must 'keep pace' with its rivals in a stark intervention in a row over the size of the fleet.
Many peers have already expressed deep unease about the plan, with ministers braced for a battle with the Upper House over the Bill.
The Prime Minister, who has urged the Lords not to block the 'will of the people', said he wanted to get the scheme 'up and running' as soon as possible.
Peers could seriously frustrate that ambition, with Downing Street likely to face attempts by peers to introduce a range of amendments to the proposed legislation.
The Bill is likely to receive its second reading by the end of January, with February 12, 14 and 19 pencilled in for debate at the committee stage.
It is possible that the third reading of the Bill could happen around the middle of March.
Mr Sunak played down the prospect of having to pack the Lords with Tory peers to get the legislation through, adding that the country was fed up with the 'merry-go-round' on the issue."

But that's exactly what happened in recent days to actor Rainn Wilson when he took a flight that went through Portland International Airport.
While traveling Wilson, who played Dwight Schrute on the hit series The Office, unknowingly received a heartfelt message from a fan of the show that came in the form of a letter on a napkin.
He has since posted a photo of that napkin on his social media platforms, along with a message back to the woman, who turned out to be a flight attendant.
'The Office got me through some of the darkest days of my life. I can't thank you enough for that,' the message read from Melanie with Alaska Airlines.
Rainn Wilson, 57, shared a sweet message he received from a fan, who praised him and The Office for helping her 'get through some of the darkest days of my life'
Along with posting the photo of the message on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter), Wilson shared some more of the story behind her kind act, as well as a tribute to his former colleagues on The Office.
'I didn't even see who dropped this on my lap at the PDX airport, but I greatly appreciate the sentiment, flight attendant Melanie of Alaska Airlines,' he wrote in response. 'So humbled to be a part of a show that affected, touched, comforted and inspired. And continues to do so! It's so f***ing rare.'
It's at this point that the acclaimed actor, who earned three consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Comedy Series for his work on The Office, shared some of the praise from that woman with the cast and crew.
'A continuous thank you to the whole Office family, cast, writers, crew and especially AUDIENCE!' the Seattle, Washington native continued, before adding that 'this is not an open invitation to give me notes on napkins!'
The mockumentary series also starred the likes of Steve Carell, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, Ed Helms, Mindy Kaling, B. J. Novak, Leslie David Baker, Brian Baumgartner, Angela Kinsey, Oscar Nunez, Phyllis Smith, Kate Flannery, Paul Lieberstein, Ellie Kemper, David Denman, Melora Hardin, Creed Bratton, Craig Robinson, Rashida Jones, Zack Woods, Amy Ryan, Catherine Tate, James Spader, Clark Duke and Jake Lacy.
The show, which depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, ran on NBC for nine seasons from 2005 to 2013.
Based on the BBC series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted for American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer Saturday Night Live, King of The Hill and The Simpsons.
Like its British counterpart, the show was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track to simulate the look of an actual documentary.
The actor played fan favorite Dwight Schrute on the mockumentary sitcom for its nine season run on NBC from 2005 to 2013
Wilson maintained he didn't even see who dropped the sweet message on his lap at Portland International Airport this week

Novak (Ryan Howard), John Krasinski (Jim Halpert), Jenna Fischer (Pam Beesley), Rainn Wilson (Dwight Schrute), Steve Carell (Michael Scott)
The Office, which starred Steve Carell in the leading role of the boss Michael Scott, received 42 Primetime Emmy Award nominations that resulted in five wins; pictured in a scene from the show are Wilson, Carell and Krasinski
Overall, The Office received 42 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations that resulted in five wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series (season two), Outstanding Writing For A Comedy Series (Greg Daniels for Gay Witch Hunt), Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series (Jeffrey Blitz for Stress Relief), and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing For A Comedy Series (David Rogers and and Claire Scanlon for Finale).
While Carell never received an Emmy Award for his performance in the series, he did win a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor In A Television Comedy Or Musical (2006).
The series saw a resurgence in its popularity while everyone was in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in mid-March 2020, as reported by a number of publications, including People. Wilson discussed that affect the show has had on fans with Carell on the finale of his Instagram Live series, Hey There, Human.
'One thing that's been really gratifying for me is during this really dark time, I've heard from so many people that they've really appreciated having The Office there — that it has a warmth and humanity to it, kind of a family feel that makes it a special thing and that's helped them during this time, and even helped their mental health,' Wilson shared at the time."

The London Mayor said re-entering the trade alliance should be on the table when the Brexit deal with the EU comes up for review next year.
His comments came as shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy vowed that a future Labour government would treat Brussels as 'our closest friends and allies' rather than opponents.
Mr Khan told a Fabian Society conference in London: 'I'm not saying today we should rejoin the EU. What I'm saying is David Lammy is on to something when he's saying we should have a closer relationship with the EU.'
Asked if that meant the Customs Union, he replied: 'I think everything should be on the table.'
Sadiq Khan told a Fabian Society conference in London: 'I'm not saying today we should rejoin the EU. What I'm saying is David Lammy is on to something when he's saying we should have a closer relationship with the EU'
He criticised the Tory Government's 'extreme hard Brexit' and even appeared to hit out at Labour's 'omerta', or pact of silence, preventing the party from discussing potential economic reintegration with Brussels.
Mr Khan, who is seeking a third term in May's mayoral election, said in a statement: 'The Government's hard Brexit has done damage right across London, and it is young people who have been hardest hit in so many ways.
'Not only is it more difficult for young people to move abroad for work but the Government's wrongheaded decision to leave the Erasmus scheme has made it much harder for students to study abroad too.
'I'm clear that I'd be supportive of a youth mobility scheme, which would benefit us economically, culturally and socially.
'While the UK may no longer be part of the EU, London is and always will be a European city.'
The mayor wants young people to be able to study, travel and fill vacancies in key sectors of the economy such as hospitality, which has historically relied on EU workers and has faced staff shortages."

The 75-year-old monarch is currently resting at the 20,000 acre Sandringham royal estate in Norfolk with Queen Camilla ahead of the corrective surgery next week.
Well-wishers had gathered today in the hope of catching a glimpse of Charles walking to the 11am morning service at St Mary Magdalene church on the Sandringham estate.
But they found the gates to the paddock outside the church were locked, meaning they could not reach the roped off path where spectators are usually allowed to stand.
It comes after the Princess of Wales was said to be 'doing well' after going under the knife for her abdominal operation at London Clinic near Regent's Park this week.
Well-wishers gathered today in the hopes of getting a glimpse of the King walking to the St Mary Magdalene church on the Sandringham estate but found gates to the paddock outside were locked
Charles was last pictured (above) attending a service at the church on Sunday January 7, two weeks ago
Charles had been expected to walk the quarter of a mile from Sandringham House to the church, as he almost always does when his in his residence at his private retreat.
There was no sign of him appearing as the bells pealed and the service got underway in the 18th century church where members of the Royal family traditionally worship while on winter breaks.
Holiday lettings housekeeper Maxine Sykes, 44, and her mother Victoria Martin, 67, are holidaying in Norfolk and had hoped to see the King.
Maxine of St Neots, Cambridgeshire, said: 'We came up to Sandringham for a wander around and saw people waiting so we decided to investigate.
'We thought it would be nice to get a glimpse of the King, but unfortunately he has not come out.'
Victoria, of Rye, East Sussex, added: 'It's a shame we have not seen him, but it is understandable if he wants to keep quiet before going into hospital.
'He might also have thought it best to keep a low profile because of all the interest in his daughter-in-law Kate being in hospital, and the concerns for her.'
Other onlookers said it was 'highly unusual' to find the gates to the church paddock locked so nobody could get through.

One person, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was never locked when the old Queen was alive and it is usually open when Charles is here.
'The last time he was at the church was two weeks ago before he went to Scotland, and people could walk down and see him.
'I was a little disappointed that he didn't come because I wanted to wish him the best of luck for his surgery.'
Buckingham Palace revealed last Wednesday that Charles was due to undergo a corrective procedure next week after being diagnosed with a benign enlarged prostate.
He and Queen Camilla were at his Scottish home Birkhall when they received the shock news, just after it was disclosed that the Princess of Wales was in hospital.
The couple were flown more than 300 miles on Friday on an RAF jet from Aberdeen Airport to RAF Marham before being driven the final 15 miles to Sandringham.
Buckingham Palace shared the news about the King's procedure just 90 minutes after Kensington Palace said Kate had undergone abdominal surgery and would spend two weeks in hospital.
It is thought that the Princess of Wales will resume working in a reduced capacity once she is discharged from hospital. The Wales' are nevertheless said to be focusing on family
The Princess of Wales is said to be 'doing well' and will spend the next 10 to 14 days recovering in hospital
It has been revealed that Prince William will not seek to alter the status of the Church of England when he becomes King, despite being less religious than his father or grandmother
The King, who acceded to the throne 16 months ago and had his coronation at Westminster Abbey last May, will be admitted to an unidentified hospital next week.
Camilla revealed last week that the King was 'fine' and 'looking forward to getting back to work' as she made a solo visit to Aberdeen Art Gallery last week.
She spoke of her husband's health as she open the Gallery's new Safe Space, an initiative to provide help and guidance to people if they suspect someone is living with domestic abuse.
Camilla was reported as appearing cheery, and adopting the keep calm and carry on approach often associated with the late Queen.
The Princess of Wales was admitted to the private London Clinic hospital on Tuesday for successful abdominal surgery, which Kensington Palace said was planned.
She is said to be 'doing well' but will remain in the exclusive clinic for ten to 14 days, and is not expected to return to official duties until after Easter.
Prince William spent time at her bedside on Thursday in a low key private visit.
He has stepped back from official duties for several weeks to care for his wife and juggle looking after their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.
Joe Little from Majesty magazine, has said that the health troubles of Charles and Kate have compounded the problems facing the small band of working royals.
Mr Little said: 'The working members of the Royal Family have been under pressure to maintain the level of engagements undertaken by a much larger team in years gone by.
'Suddenly removing three of the most senior players because of health issues compounds the problem considerably, but at least the King will be out of action for only a relatively short period.'
Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment about King Charles' non-attendance at church"
0T29A3W2PH_45UJI9UEDIF3VRL,I was scammed by a taxi driver on a visit to Budapest - follow this golden rule to make sure you don't,Madison Burgess,"Published: 15:12 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 15:15 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-12977509/I-scammed-taxi-driver-visit-Budapest-follow-golden-rule-make-sure-dont.html,"An Irish tourist has revealed how to avoid being overcharged for a cab ride in Budapest after she was 'scammed' on holiday.
Kerry Mitchell, from Dublin, posted a TikTok under her handle @kerryeatsdub, and it has already been seen by more than 177,000 people.
She told viewers: 'So, last night I got scammed in Budapest. This is just a public service announcement to everyone - and I already knew this, but I still did it.
'Don't get a taxi that is not on an app, don't get a taxi from a rank, especially if you are getting one of the prosecco boat tours'.
An Irish tourist has warned others who are planning a getaway to Budapest, after a taxi scam left her bank card completely drained of money
The tourist recalled that after the tour she and her friends were freezing, drunk and hungry - wanting to get some food as soon as possible, so they opted not to walk.
She explained: 'I tried to order a Bolt because they use Bolt here mainly and he arrived but he was like a ten minute walk away, so I was like what the f***?
'And there was a taxi rank there, so we went over and asked if they take card.
'All of them wouldn't take card except one. They were like, 'oh go up to the Mercedes up there'.
'So we go up to the Merceredes and it is a man, he is so nice, asking us where we're from, is Budapest much more expensive than Dublin, is it cheaper, blah blah blah.
'He was making conversation, asking how long we're here for, all that stuff. I thought he was a nice man, also the ten glasses of prosecco did not help'.
The tourist's Revolut bank account had been completely drained of cash, which she later confirmed has 110 euros in it - she shared a photo of herself visibly upset after the shocking incident
However, she was cautious and admitted that she was looking at the meter 'the whole time' - having previously been warned about getting cabs in Budapest - so was 'keeping an eye' on it.
Kerry said: 'It shouldn't have been over €20, actually it shouldn't have been over €10.
'Anyway, so we get out, I tap my card, don't think anything of it and then we go for food, go to the bar and I go to buy a drink.
'I tapped my card and he was like, 'oh you don't have any money'.
'So, it's nearly a week later, this is actually me when I discovered I had no money. He took everything in my Revolut account'.
The tourist's Revolut bank account had been completely drained of cash, which she later confirmed has €110 in it - she shared a photo of herself visibly upset after the shocking incident.
However, luckily, she had only transferred €110 into her Revolut account - had there been more cash in there, matters could have been significantly worse.
She explained: 'I had to cancel it and I went on the live chat. After an hour and a half I'd say of me sobbing in the corner of the bar, I did get my money back, somehow.
'They managed to cancel the transaction. They told me many times they wouldn't be able to'.
The tourist had been on a prosecco boat tour in Budapest, before deciding to get a taxi from the local rank
She finished the video off with a stark warning: 'In conclusion, do not get taxis off the street in Budapest or anywhere really to be honest. Use Bolt if you're going to Budapest.
'All this aside, Budapest is 10 out of 10 and I do actually highly recommend'.
However, this TikToker is not the only one to fall to victim to taxi scams in Europe.
One viewer revealed: 'This happened to me and my boyfriend in Budapest, he tried to charge us over €100 and he tried to lock us in the car.
'I already had my door unlocked and told him to shove it and he ran up the road after us telling us he was going to find us'.
A second penned: 'Same happened to me €111 for a two-minute drive'.
Meanwhile, a third added: 'No I’m not even messing this is exactly what happened to us! Came off the Prosecco cruise and went straight to a ruin bar to see he had charged us €90 for a taxi!'
Someone chimed in with: 'Exact same thing happened to me and my boyfriend in Budapest, and again the man was really nice and chatty then absolutely ripped us off'.
Commenters shared their experiences with other destinations as well as Budapest, including Prague, Athens, Amsterdam and Rome.
One viewer wrote: 'Prague taxi drivers are the absolute worst I've ever had. Such an easy city to get around by tram but late at night you've no choice but to use taxis'.
Others added: 'Happened to us in Athens' and 'Yeah, beware of the overly friendly, chatty, guys - especially in Rome'.
The warning comes after an experienced travel blogger was charged six times the going rate for a taxi ride from Paris's Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG) to the city centre.
Melissa Hie, known online as girleatworld.net, recently blogged about an 'intimidating' situation she found herself in with a fake Parisian taxi driver who quoted €360 (£312/$387) for a ride.
After refusing to pay the obscene amount, she said the driver became 'aggressive' and followed her into her hotel - only backing down when she paid him €80 (£69/$85)."

Shannon Lane, 29, was sick of paying £900-a-month for a room in a three-bedroom apartment in Clapton, East London.
The artist said she was looking for somewhere 'more affordable' with space for her and her pug, Gilbert, two.
So, she took out a loan to buy a £24k 30ft narrowboat, which she moved into in January 2023.
The Londoner says she now saves £500-a-month, which is more than £6k a year, and travels around the Grand Union Canal - moving every two weeks.
A woman from London ditched her houseshare and quit the rat race to live off-grid in a narrowboat - and says it saves her £6k-a-year
However, it's not all been smooth-sailing and Shannon says she experienced 'boat blues' as she grappled with freezing weather, learning to move the boat, emptying the toilet and refilling her water.
The artist, who's currently based in Hackney, East London, said: 'I was paying £900-a-month for a room, I thought ""this is ridiculous"".
'I was thinking of other options that were more affordable with space that me and my dog could live in comfortably.
'As soon as I saw the boat advertised I knew it was one for me, I spent £24k and I worked out that my loan repayments are £300-a-month.
'That is a huge difference to what I was paying back in my house-share and this is something I now own.'
Shannon was living in a shared house with two friends - originally paying £900-a-month until her landlord upped her rent to £1,000-a-month.
She was walking around the Kings Cross canal in October 2022 when she came across a narrowboat for sale.
Shannon said it was a 'no-brainer' to move onto a boat and is now saving thousands a year.

She said: 'I saw the boat and thought 'what if?'.
'I texted the owner and we set up a viewing for the following week.
'As soon as I saw the boat itself I saw it was £24k and I worked out that paying my loan from the bank to afford it would be £300-a-month.
'That is a massive saving from what I was paying in my house-share.'
However, there were things Shannon was not prepared for and she found difficult within her new home.
She explained: 'It was a huge learning curve, I like to call it my boat blues.
'I thought it was going to be amazing and I would have all this freedom but when you come down to it you have all this hard work.
'It was January too so I was freezing, I didn't know how to move the boat, empty the toilet or fill up the water.
The Londoner says she now saves £500-a-month, which is more than £6k a year, and travels around the Grand Union Canal - moving every two weeks
'The best thing about boat life is the community, it is so nice to each other - if it wasn't for them I don't think I could have done it.'
Shannon said she loves the freedom of being on the boat and said her family weren't shocked by her decision.
She said: 'I am a spontaneous person, they were hesitant at first but they trusted my judgement.
'That solidified when they visited and they said it was such a nice way of life.
'I have made some of my best friends in the community, it is the freedom you get. I love the fact I can travel whenever I want and the summers are absolutely amazing.'
Now she's had a taste of this way of living, the 29-year-old revealed she would love to live on the boat for the rest of her life.
She said: 'I don't like the idea of going back and paying traditional bills.
'At the minute I am just filling up gas whenever I need and my electricity comes from my solar panel.
Shannon explained: 'I was thinking of other options that were more affordable with space that me and my dog could live in comfortably'
'But, in order to live with my boyfriend I might have to as I am not sure he wants to move onto the boat.
'In a dream world I would live to here forever but I am not sure that is what my partner wants.'
And Shannon isn't the only one swapping land for water - Amy Cross, 28, from Nottingham, and her partner, Wes Arthur, 30, were sick of their 40-hour working weeks in Sheffield.
In June 2021, pair quit the 'rat race' to live off-grid and travel full time in their boat - to 'take control' of their lives.
Set on choosing their own hours and avoiding overtime, they decided to overhaul their lifestyle - ditching their rented £675-a-month three-bedroom home and changing their jobs to have 'less responsibility and stress'.
They now work remotely from their boat and sail around the UK - having travelled through Wales, the Midlands, and down the entire length of the River Thames."

For years it was celebrated for helping to repeal this law, equalising the age of consent, lifting the ban on gay service personnel and introducing same-sex marriage.
But in the past decade the group has attracted controversy and even been attacked by one of its founders, Simon Fanshawe, on its 'extreme notion of self-identification' – allowing anyone to declare themselves as the opposite sex without having to provide evidence.
As well as its policies, the charity has also come under fire for its schemes that charge companies and the public sector for advice on how to become more inclusive.
Its 'Workplace Equality Index' tells employers how they measure up on 'lesbian, gay, bi and trans inclusion' compared to others.

It emerged recently that the Bank of England submitted a 103-page application to make it on to Stonewall's list of 100 top employers, boasting that it used the term 'birthing parent'.
In 2021 Liz Truss, then Equalities Minister, urged all Government departments to pull out of its employment scheme. And last year the MoS told how then Health Secretary Steve Barclay told NHS quangos to review their membership.
But Stonewall's annual report, revealed in the MoS today, shows it continues to exert its grip over the public sector.
More than 300 schools are signed up to its education scheme while 78 NHS trusts are in a similar project that rewards them for removing 'gendered language'.
Although the charity reported a deficit, it receives millions in grants, including almost £400,000 from the Foreign Office and the devolved Scottish and Welsh governments."

It is also claimed she helped Ant McPartlin's ex-wife Lisa Armstrong get a reported £31million pay-out in their divorce.
Catherine, who has been branded a 'pitbull' in American media, is due to represent Christine in London on Tuesday, it has been claimed.
A source told The Sun: 'Christine really wanted to work with a woman during her divorce and Catherine is one of the best in the business.
'Christine wants to stay in the house she’s lived in as a family for many years. She’s poured many hours of love, care and attention into it.
'It would be heartbreaking to have to leave the property after all this time and uproot her life.'
MailOnline has contacted a representative for Christine for comment.
Catherine, who is a senior partner with top London law firm Harbottle and Lewis, was also involved in billionaire royal ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's three-year legal battle with his ex-wife Princess Haya bint Hussein.
The Harbottle and Lewis website states: 'Depending on each client’s needs, Catherine’s approach is tailor made - whether that be successful negotiating outside of the court process or tough litigating within it.'

It comes after it was reported Christine was left 'devastated' after she found out her estranged Paddy is making a 'mockumentary about their divorce'.
According to The Sun, a friend close to Christine has revealed that she found out about Paddy's plan after ready about it online.
They told the publication: 'Christine is distraught that their divorce is going to be the butt of the jokes.
'She’s completely broken over the divorce and we are genuinely worried about her.
'Paddy didn’t tell her about the pilot. The fact she had to find out online, like everyone else, that he was doing this has broken her even more.'

Then work, work for myself and trying to carve out a career so that I can always look after my children and give them a future what they want and support them and their needs for as long as possible.

Gaylene Runey, a Washington County resident, was left without power for more than a week following the devastating storm.
When her electricity was finally restored on Friday, the aftermath of falling trees has now left her without water and heat.
Frozen pipes now add to her challenges, and despite the power being restored, the restoration of other essential services remains an ongoing struggle.
Runey said she is both physically and emotionally exhausted from the ordeal.

She fears she may move out of her historic $1.4M home of 47 years after the treers pierceed the roof of her property and cut off her water and electricity
She was napping in her bedroom when she noticed the trees starting to fall.
'I looked up, and I saw trees falling,' she told KPTV. 'I hit the deck. I landed on the floor and was waiting to be impaled. Then it was quiet.'
Her property, where a creek runs through, experienced multiple tree falls, causing extensive damage to her home.
'I always worried I'd have a tree falling,' she said to the outlet. 'I never dreamed I'd have 10.'
She believes the creek loosened the soil and caused some of the trees to fall. At least 13 trees fell on her property, she said.
'I'm exhausted, and my mind is hard to quiet,' she told KPTV.
Although she has lived in the house for 47 years, the extensive storm damage has led her to contemplate abandoning the family home.
The four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 6,870-square-foot home sits on a 1.7-acre lot and is worth an estimated $1,358,284, according to Redfin.
The recent weather in the Portland metro area has brought numerous challenges, leaving cleanup crews and residents with significant work ahead.
'At this point, I'm just ready to say, ""The heck with it,"" and fix it later,' she said.
The damage is taking a toll on her wallet, she added.
'I sure need some help getting through this. It's hard,' Runey told KPTV. 'I need to find a bag of money somewhere.'
Despite the overwhelming list of problems, Runey maintained a sense of optimism, and acknowledged the importance of remaining positive throughout the hardships.
Frozen pipes now add to her challenges, and despite the power being back, the restoration of essential services remains an ongoing struggle
'If you don't laugh, you'll cry,' she said to outlet.
Footage captured by Runey and shared on Facebook reveal the brutal extent of the damage.
Viewers expressed their sorrow and devastation over the severe magnitude of the destruction.
'Oh jeez laweez! And now the ice is coming,' one user commented.
Another opted to remain positive, stating, 'Bright side: I looks like it didn’t break the windows.'

At least 60 fatalities have been reported due to weather in the last few weeks. Among them, an 81-year-old woman who died in Alabama as the storm created tornados in the Southeast on January 9. The same system brought snow and travel headaches in the Midwest.
The mid-Atlantic has dealt with heavy rain and flooding. In North Carolina, more than 170,000 people lost power from the storm throughout the day. Parts of historic Alexandria, Virginia, were underwater as floods filled streets.
All 50 states were put on weather alerts because of the storm.
Of the 60 deaths, several of those fatalities have been attributed to hypothermia and car accidents on frozen roads as arctic conditions grip the nation. Tens of millions face the bitter cold from snowstorms that are set to continue into next week.

Most expensive private plates of 2023: We reveal which personalised registration plates were sold by the DVLA for the highest amounts last year - and compare them to the all-time priciest

* prices excluding auction fees and taxes
Personalised registration auctions will now be exclusively online, and the DVLA holds six sales a year.
Taking the 2023 number one spot at a DVLA auction was 'H1 NDU', which sold for £112,010 (excluding fees and taxes).
It's high sale price requires little explanation and the six-figure price is perhaps less unsurprising than some others that make-up the most expensive of last year.
The top 10 of was dominated by the trend for private plates with 'O', with half of the most expensive private registrations following this format.
This is becoming auction standard in the current private plate market.
Two 'DEO' plates featured in the most expensive list: '1 DEO' sold for £106,090 and 'DEO 1S' fetched £80,010.
Registrations featuring letters first and the number 1 in the sequence typically achieve the highest prices, based on the DVLA's historical records.
The 'DEO' inspired big hitters might be appealing because of the 'God' meaning behind them, but there's no definite answer.
It's the guessing game involved that makes private plates such as an interesting investment to many.
The greats of all time: the top 10 most expensive personalised DVLA plates sold at auction
2023 wasn't a particularly high performing year for DVLA registrations compared to the last five years.
Jon Kirkbright, sales director at number plate supplier Platehunter puts this down to the lower quality stock.
He told This is Money: 'The best plates were sold when the DVLA started its auctions back in the day.
'Now you're looking at a initial plate but you have three numbers after it because one to 99 have already been released.'
The top 10 from the last five years ranged from £308,253 for 'DEV 1L' down to £84,000 for '3 XRP'.
'DEV 1L' was also the third most expensive of all time, with collectors scrambling over the plate from Cruella De Vil's iconic car.
Five of the 10 were all above £112,000, but only one of these was sold in 2023: 'H1 NDU' that was the most expensive from last year.
Smokin': The DEV 1L plate from Cruella De Vil's iconic car was sold in 2021 by the DVLA for £308,253
Comparatively, the top 10 of all time were all above £150,000 (excluding fees and taxes) and sold as far back as 1989 - the year the agency first put on auctions for private plates.
The most expensive DVLA registration ever sold was '25 O' which reached £400,000 (excluding fees and taxes) on 27 November 27 2014.
It was a good furlong ahead of second place's '1 D' which came in at £285,000. No prizes for guessing which boy band that bidder was a fan of.
The first online auction of 2024 has already taken place, with 'L1 BYA' the standout lot going for £80,000 (just shy of £103,000 inclusive of auction fees and VAT).
CarReg, a UK business that specialises in the purchase and sale of private plates, told us: 'L1 BYA possibly could end up on a vehicle used by diplomats at the Embassy of Libya London as similar numbers have done so in the past.'
As of 2023, businesses operating in the sector valued the British personalised number plate industry to be worth over £2billion.
Jon Kirkbright, 45, is the founder of Plate Hunter
A total of 17,823 registrations were sold in last year's DVLA auctions and buyers spent almost £49m (including fees and taxes).
Platehunter saw a 25 per cent increase in turnover by the first 17 days of January on last year, with valuation requests per day up 100 on last year already.
Kirkbright is expecting this year to be the biggest yet: 'The second-hand plate market keeps going from strength to strength and 2024 will be no different.
'People are seeing worse plates sold by the DVLA go for the same price they paid for a better one at an auction years ago, and so are demanding two or three times the price for their plates now on the second hand market'.
Names, initials and words
Number plates that spell out - or almost spell out - names, initials and words are the most common reason for why people splash out on private registrations.
People either wish to express their individuality and personality, or an investor knows that certain words will continue to rise in value.
The Prince and Princess of Wales drove away from their wedding with 'JU5T WED' on the rear number plate of King Charles III's Aston Martin Volante.
Businessman Afzal Khan reportedly turned down £10 million for his 'F1' plate he bought for £440k in 2008.

Investment
Investors go where the returns are good, and the performance of private number plates is pulling investors away from traditional investments.
With higher returns than wine, watches, jewellery and classic cars and art, it's not surprising that personalised plates are creating bidding wars.
One specialist said a plate can double in value in 12 months.
Buyers turn over plates very quickly, and unlike investments like cars or art there's no storage costs. You can even drive your car with your plate on without it losing any value!
Covering up a car's age
While you can't customise and display a plate that makes your car look newer than it is, you can put private plate on that conceals the age of your car.
You don't have to drive around with a age-identifiable DVLA plate.
Power symbols
There's inner confidence and then there's needing to prove it.
Drivers with private plates resembling status such as success, money, or influence such as 'BO55' use short words or acronyms to project the image of themselves they want out there.
Sentimentality
Some people have a locket with a photo in, others a tattoo. But for some drivers, a  private plate is the best means to remember and commemorate special dates, events or references to loved ones.
And because these evoke personal memories, many believe it is worth paying a lot of money for the personalised number plate combinations they really want."

Sanchez, a successful helicopter pilot, wrote: 'Honored to have been in the presence of aviation legends who have shaped the history and future of flight,'
Harry previously served as a helicopter pilot in the British army in Afghanistan.
Despite not being behind the controls of an aircraft for almost a decade, Harry was presented with an award that declared him to be a 'living legend of aviation' by movie star and jumbo jet pilot John Travolta.
While she praised Harry in the caption, she also may have also been referring to her fiancée, Jeff Bezos, who is worth $174 billion and who owns a space exploration firm called Blue Origin.
Sánchez's praising of the prince came after she was also among those named for having 'significantly impacted' both the history and future of flight at the 21st Annual Living Legends of Aviation awards ceremony.

Sánchez, who runs an aerial filming company, was seen walking the red carpet alone before joining billionaire Bezos backstage where she posted a black-and-white photo featuring herself with her beau, Bezos, John Travolta and the Duke of Sussex all smiling during the awards show.
'What a beautiful evening last night. So grateful', she later wrote.
Bezos was inducted into the organization in 2019 after founding his Blue Origin spacecraft company, which sends its occupants 65 miles straight up to the edge of space.
Sánchez, herself, was hailed as a 'living legend' for her work as a helicopter pilot and awarded the Elling Halvorson Vertical Flight Hall of Fame Award at the ceremony and aviation businesswoman.
She owns the aviation filming company Black Ops Aviation, which she founded in 2016.

'The Living Legends of Aviation are pleased to announce that Lauren Sánchez will receive the Elling Halvorson Vertical Flight Hall of Fame Award at the 21st Annual Living Legends of Aviation Awards,' the institution wrote last month announcing the accolade.
'From Emmy Award-winning journalist to helicopter pilot and aviation businesswoman, Lauren Sánchez's achievements in aviation and unwavering commitment to advancing women in the industry inspire us all.'
Trailed by her own TV crew, Sánchez told how she was 'thrilled' to receive the award noting how it was 'only time' before another woman was inducted into the organization.
Currently, there are fewer than 10 female members.
'I just can't believe it!!!' Sánchez said. 'What a huge honor it is to be recognized by the Living Legends of Aviation. Flying is my passion and this is truly such an honor. You also have no idea how happy you made my dad who has been a pilot since I was a little girl.'
As for the prince, questions as to whether the duke deserved to be called a 'living legend of aviation' had been raised before the bash.
Harry's award citation described him as a 'humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate and environmentalist,' adding: 'He has dedicated his life to causes he is passionate about and that bring about permanent change.'
Travolta, himself a pilot, was reportedly the driving force behind Harry receiving the award after feeling an affinity for the prince after dancing with Diana – though the prince's nomination angered some military pilots who felt it was unearned.

On stage, Travolta asked him of his time flying for the Army: 'What can you remember about your first flight?'
Harry quipped back: 'It's classified.'
The Duke served in the military for 10years – rising to the rank of captain, and completing two tours of Afghanistan as a forward air controller and an Apache helicopter pilot.
Lord Alan West, a former head of the Royal Navy, had poured cold water on the accolade.
'He is not a living legend of aviation. To suggest he is, is pathetic. It makes the whole thing seem a bit of a nonsense.'
Colonel Richard Kemp, a retired British Army officer, said the ceremony was more about 'celebrities massaging each other's egos.'
Upon accepting his award, Harry spoke of his pride in his military career

The 39-year-old attended without his wife, Meghan Markle, for the awards ceremony. She was reportedly at home looking after their children, one of whom had taken unwell
Upon accepting his award, Harry spoke of his pride in his military career.
'For me, flying has been a transcendent experience. A close encounter with magic, an invitation to both protect freedom… and to feel free; and, funny enough, an opportunity to ground oneself, without actually being grounded,' Harry said.
He spoke movingly of his former career, saying: 'I had respect for the Apache in a hover and was in awe of it flying at night… so many moments as a pilot where you feel like you're walking on air.
'And throughout each flight during my military career, the one constant was always trust. Trust in the aircraft, trust in my fellow comrades, trust in my many mentors and, above all else, trust in myself. Flying taught me the power of discipline, the power of patience and, beyond that, the power of trusting your gut.'
His words saw him receive a standing ovation from the audience."

The 55-year-old king and his wife, 51, looked relaxed as they waved at those who'd turned out for the public meet-and-greet...as snow fell around Aarhus Cathedral.
Joining the King, dressed in full military regalia, and Queen Mary were the couple's four children: Crown Prince Christian, 18, Princess Isabella, 16, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 13.
The outgoing queen, 83-year-old Margrethe, also attended the change of throne service, looking relaxed and happy in a stylish faux grey fur ensemble and bright purple dress, as she made her way into the cathedral.
King Frederik - officially King Frederik X - ascended the throne last Sunday after his mother abdicated after 52 years as queen.

Tasmanian-born Queen Mary chose a purple dress coat and navy wool shawl for the service that celebrated the new king's reign, following his official coronation last Sunday
Inside the cathedral, Queen Mary walked a few paces behind her husband as the couple were escorted in
Queen Mary cut an elegant figure also in purple. The incoming queen wore a purple dress coast with a navy blue shawl, navy leather gloves and a purple pillbox hat.
The Danish royal wore her brunette locks in loose curls, complementing the look with a pair of drop diamond earrings.
The couple's daughters opted also for bright colours, with Princess Isabella in a pastel pink coat and her older sister Princess Josephine wearing a pale blue.
The king and queen's sons donned sharp navy blue suits for the regal occasion.
The Royal Family will participate in the celebratory service, led by the Royal Chaplain-in-Ordinairy and Bishop of the Diocese of Aarhus Henrik Wigh-Poulsen, according to the royal household.
Queen Margrethe's younger sister, Princess Benedikte of Denmark, 79, also observed the purple theme, and she looked sophisticated in a violet cape and matching pillbox hat.
The streets of Aarhus were still bedecked in red-and-white flags following the ceremony last Sunday to crown King Frederik.
Royal fans wrapped up in warm clothes and braved the snowy conditions in the hope to support their new monarch.

Two days ago, an official portrait of the family was released on the Danish Royal Family's Instagram page.
The celebratory image featured the king and queen, 51, in full regalia, alongside the couple's elegantly dressed four children; the family was photographed inside the royal Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen.

Margrethe's decision to vacate the throne in honour of her eldest son astonished many, as it comes amidst a controversial year for the royals who have been plagued by stripped titles and salacious rumours.
It comes as a resurfaced interview revealed how Queen Mary almost never met then-Prince Frederik.
'I nearly didn't go that evening,' she told Vogue.
'The taxi arrived, and I said, 'Oh, all right' at the last minute and just got in.'
The interview was conducted in 2004, but was recently republished.
Mary and Frederik's fairytale romance has been under scrutiny in recent weeks.
King Frederick has faced intense scrutiny since photographs emerged of the then prince enjoying a night out with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova in Madrid last year.
The glamorous socialite strenuously denied claims of a romantic tryst with Frederik, even going as far as to dub them 'malicious'.
However in the newly released image, the monarchs have shown no sign of sweat or adversity, and can be seen beaming excitedly for the camera.
And while the royal couple looked incredibly distinguished, it was their eldest son Crown Prince Christian who stole the show
According to a translated statement accompanying the image, the portraits were taken just moments after the king's ascension
According to a translated statement accompanying the image, the portraits were taken just moments after the king's ascension. It read: 'The Throne Hall at Christiansborg Castle forms the frame for the first official portraits of Their Majesties The King and Queen.
'The portrait series was taken by photographer Dennis Stenild a few moments after the King's proclamation, which took place from the balcony of Tronsalen on the 14th. January 2024
'The Royal Couple is pictured together with The Crown Prince, His Royal Highness The Crown Prince, and Their Royal Highnesses Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine'.
In the images the king looked exceptionally dapper dressed in black kingly robes and a sky blue sash.

The ensemble also featured gold and red detailing, as well stately gold medals and a waist belt. He also posed with a sword which he held in his left hand.
Standing beside him was his wife Queen Mary, who cut a stylish figure in a luxurious white gown.
She looked ethereal in the caped frock - an excellent choice as it highlighted her svelte figure.
The monarch teamed the look with a pair of nude high-heeled pumps and donned a gorgeous pair of bejewelled drop-down earrings.
Her brunette locks were styled neatly in a bun, while her make-up was the epitome of a natural, dewy glow.
And while the royal couple looked incredibly distinguished, it was their eldest son Crown Prince Christian who stole the show.
The charming prince - who's new status flags him as one of the most eligible bachelors in Europe - posed up a storm.
His modelesque pose was perhaps most eye-catching because he stood taller than the rest of his family, and most notably his father.
He looked suave in a navy blue suit, a crisp white shirt, a grey tie and black leather tie-up shoes.
The eldest son of Australian-born Queen Mary is now next in line to the Danish throne after his grandmother Queen Margrethe abdicated the throne five days ago.
Titled Crown Prince of Denmark, the 18-year-old is thought to be the only single royal with the prestigious status in the whole of Europe, meaning he's become quite the catch in high society."

His comments were made to highlight the need for Britain to increase its defence spending, but also demonstrated growing concern over current and future conflicts.
Relative peace in Europe was shattered in February 2022 with Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and the Middle East once again found itself in crisis 18 months later after Hamas's October 7 terror attack on Israel, and Israel's retaliation on Gaza.
And while these two conflicts have dominated the news cycle, others have also been wreaking havoc in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caucuses.
Meanwhile, there are mounting fears that the war in Gaza could spillover into the Middle East, and that China could invade Taiwan in the coming years - a conflict that has the potential to plunge the world into a third global war.
What's more, Thursday saw NATO admiral Rob Bauer warn that the military alliance is bracing itself for an attack by Russia within the next 20 years.
If it feels like the world is seeing a spike in deadly conflicts, the data is there to back up that notion. Figures compiled by the Peace Research Institute Oslo show more battle-related deaths from state conflicts in 2022 than in any year since 1984.
The data shows that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) accounted for the majority of the more than 204,000 recorded war-related deaths last year.
It was also the first year that fighting in Europe accounted for more than 25,000 of the world's deaths from state-based violence since the Second World War.
According to Justin Crump, an intelligence, security and defence expert and CEO of global risk analysis firm Sibylline, further regional conflicts can be expected in the years ahead, especially as climate change worsens and resources grow scarce, and as the world's superpowers clash with fight proxy wars with Grey Zone tactics.

Asked by MailOnline about the growing fears of a global conflict, Mr Crump said: 'I don't think this is inevitable, but I think the risks are mounting.
'If it's not next year, it'll be by the end of the decade, we'll be looking at a similar sort of problem. And unless something dramatically changes on the planet, the risk is just going to keep mounting. The tensions will keep mounting.'
Since 2020, there have been a number of regional conflicts in addition to those currently being fought in Ukraine and the Middle East.
The Tigray War saw tens of thousands of people killed across northern Ethiopia between November 2020 to November 2022 while an on-going civil war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, has also caused widespread death and destruction.
Africa has also seen a series of successful military coups. Governments have been overthrown in countries including Burkina Faso, Guinea, Chad, Mali, Gabon and Niger, and the Democratic Republic of Congo is also facing an on-going humanitarian crisis - the roots of which date back to the Rwandan genocide of 1994.
Another coup happened in 2021, this time in Myanmar, when the military overthrew the democratically elected government of Win Myint and Aung San Suu Kyi, plunging the country into a crisis. Rebels continue to fight back.
Nagorno-Karabakh proved to be another flash point in recent years, culminating in 2023 when Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive into the region, forcing the Armenian people there from their homes.
According to Mr Crump, we can expect more of these regional conflicts.
But while those listed above have largely been political, he says there is the growing likelihood that wars will be fought as a result of dwindling resources on account of climate change, such as water, and as more people are forced from their homes.
'We're definitely going to see more regional conflicts next year because the pressures are mounting, climate change is making people shift around,' he said.
'Guess what? They bump into each other. That causes problems. There isn't enough water. People are going to start fighting for water. This stuff is all going to happen.
'It's just the case, whether it's this year, next year or ten years hence.'
In Sibylline's annual report report analysing global risks, climate change is listed as one of five key drivers of political security, governance and criminal trends.
It points to rising temperatures exacerbating wildfire risks, driving erratic storms, and increasing the risk of floods and draughts.
'Given the increased exposure of human settlements to these risks, the impacts of our changing climate will continue to shift the locations and movement patterns of people – they will also drive competition over resources,' the report says.
Climate change, the firm adds, 'serves as a slow but steady driver of instability and change, exacerbating many other longer-standing sources of tension and increasing the likelihood of disruption and risk to life.'

Sub-Saharan Africa - already a region with extreme poverty and disease - will bear the brunt of rising temperatures sooner than others.
Agriculture is regularly disrupted by extreme weather in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, and the loss of livelihoods and increasingly scarce resources are 'intensifying inter-communal conflict, further militarising historic disputes and encouraging communities to mobilise along ethnic lines,' the report says.
Both Military governments and jihadist groups in the region are exploiting this, with the first marginalising already fringe societies and the latter using it to bolster recruitment. More extreme groups lead to more violence.
At the end of last year in Nigeria, almost 300 Christians were reported to have been killed in a wave of 'coordinated' attacks on Christmas Eve. Reports said the attacks were carried out by the Fulani Islamist militia, who in 2014 were named the fourth deadliest terrorist group in the world by the Global Terrorism Index.
While the attacks are believed to have been motivated by religion, other localised conflicts have been fought in Nigeria's Middle Belt over land rights between cattle herders and agrarian hamlets.
Sibylline's report also highlights the risk climate change poses to the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.
The region has to contend with extreme storms, unusually heavy rainfall and wildfires, as well as droughts, sandstorms and food insecurity. Turkey was also the victim of a deadly earthquake last year, displacing thousands of people.
Worsening conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa as well as across the north of the continent and the Middle East will continue to force people from their homes.
This will push them towards safer countries in Europe, where the issue of migration can inflame tensions - both between states and in domestic politics - fuelling border disputes and emboldening parties with more extreme views.
What's more, Africa is home to about one-third of the world's mineral resources, including minerals that are vital to the world's clean energy technologies.
Forecasts suggest that in the coming decades, the world will need many times more cobalt, copper and lithium than what is being produced for consumer goods and defence applications like phones, electric vehicles and satellites.
This poses a significant challenge to the United States and the rest of the West, due to China dominating the globe's critical supply of such minerals.
Infact, China accounts for 60 percent of world-wide production and 85 percent of processing capacity, according to the United States Institute for Peace.
China is already well entrenched in Africa, with Chinese entities now owning stakes in nearly all the producing mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, which supplies 70 percent of the world's cobalt.
Chinese mining companies have also invested heavily in lithium mines, and are behind lithium projects in countries including Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mali.
Estimates suggest Beijing could control one-third of the world's lithium capacity by 2025, leaving the US and other countries well behind. The West's need for the same resources will only serve to create further divisions with China.
Tensions between the US and China are already high amid fears that Beijing could order the invasion of Taiwan in the coming years.
China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its territory, and fears have grown in recent years that President Xi Jinping is planning an invasion in the coming years, in the face of increasingly hostile rhetoric and simulated blockades of the island.

There is no doubt that such an invasion would be devastating for the region from a humanitarian perspective, with some suggesting as many as 500,000 people could be killed in any such military action.
But experts have also warned of the devastating impact an attack would have from an economic perspective, particularly on the West.
Taiwan produces 90 percent of the world's advanced chips, the brains in all modern electronic equipment, and any shortage in semiconductors has been described as 'catastrophic' to both the UK and the global economy.
Should China seize Taiwan, then it would also corner the semiconductor market, giving the US and its allies multiple incentives to defend Taiwan - something Washington has signalled it would do in the event of an invasion.
China has been hostile to its other neighbours in recent years, too.
It has become increasingly aggressive in the South China Sea, with its navy and fishing vessels often coming into close contact with Filipino vessels.
It has also been accused of using its vast fishing fleet to dominate the South China Sea, which it claims should be under its control almost in its entirety.
An investigation by the New York Times last year highlighted how China's fishing boats - often armed with weapons - combined with its aggressive coastguard work to assert Beijing's presence more than 1,000 miles from China's coast.
Beijing has also clashed with Japan over the disputed Senkaku Islands, using its fishing industry to bolster its claim.
There have also been clashes between China and India in the Galwan Valley in the Himalayas which has seen soldiers fighting for the world's two largest nations, both of whom are armed with nuclear weapons, clashing with melee weapons.
In 2021, China admitted to losing four of its troops in the fighting.
Mr Crump says China's actions in the South China Sea is a prime example of 'Grey Zone' tactics - a type of unconventional warfare
Clementine G. Starling is the deputy director of the Forward Defense practice and a resident fellow in the Transatlantic Security Initiative, told the Atlantic Council think tank that she defines the 'grey zone' as 'a set of activities that occur between peace (or cooperation) and war (or armed conflict).
'A multitude of activities fall into this murky in-between - from nefarious economic activities, influence operations, and cyberattacks to mercenary operations, assassinations, and disinformation campaigns,' she added.
The West, Mr Crump says, should be concerned with such tactics from China.
'It's the fishing fleet, It's the Coast Guard. It's the way they're just pushing into this space and just making it theirs and basically saying: ""what are you going to do about it? Are you going to fire a missile at us? I don't think you are"".
'And it's really hard to come up with an answer and it's this sort of creeping penetration of geography, of societies, of thinking that's going on.'

As China's rhetoric around Taiwan grows increasingly more concerning, there are also fears that the on-going fighting between Israel and the Hamas terror group in Gaza could spill-over into the Middle East.
In recent months, we have seen Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacking ships passing through the Red Sea, between Asia and Europe - disrupting global trade.
In response, the US and UK have hit targets in Yemen with missiles, but have so far failed to deter further Houthi attacks.
The vital shipping route remains disrupted.
The Iran-back Hezbollah group have also been launching attacks into Israel from Lebanon, raising fears that a war could also break out between the Israeli Defence Forces and Hezbollah - a far superior fighting force to that of Hamas.
Meanwhile, Iran this week struck targets in Pakistan. Tehran said the attacks were against a terror group, but the move angered officials in Islamabad nonetheless.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan responded overnight on Thursday, striking back at targets in Iran it also said were home to terrorists, killing at least three people.
Currently, Mr Crump says that diplomatic efforts by the US and other countries in the region are doing enough to keep a lid on the crisis.
However, populations in the Arab world are growing more angry over the treatment of the people of Gaza by the IDF in their own efforts to eradicate Hamas.
There is a concern that some Arab governments in the region more sympathetic towards Hamas could be forced to act over fears of civil unrest at home, like that which was seen in the Arab spring that spread chaos in the 2010s.
While there are several potential flash-points - not to mention Russia's increasingly aggressive rhetoric about its designs on Easter Europe and NATO saying this week that it is bracing for a Russian invasion within the next 20 years, Mr Crump said he thinks its unlikely that World War Three would see the world's superpowers clash head-on in the foreseeable future.
Instead, he says it is more likely that nuclear-powered nations of the world will fight through proxies and with Grey Zone tactics.
Such tactics have been seen already. The Kremlin used 'little green men' to suddenly seize Crimea in 2014, while China has deployed cursive economic tactics through its Belt and Road initiative to vacuum up control over resources, as seen in Africa.
Cyber attacks, information campaigns and other forms of non-violent pressure are also being meted out by the world's superpowers in the shadows.
Using Taiwan as an example, Mr Crump says we can expect to see such tactics used more and more as the world's superpowers butt heads in the coming years.
'If China launches missiles and sends in amphibious warships [to invade Taiwan], then America might feel like they have to do something straight away,' he says.
Instead, he expects an attack on Taiwan to be 'subtle, insidious and creeping.'
'I think one of the points about this is you're seeing potentially lots of regional conflicts, lots of grey zone conflicts,' he adds.
'If you talk about the ""Third World War"", everyone's very scared because they picture mushroom clouds. But at no point does Russia actually want to cease existing over Ukraine. At no point does the US or China want to die in a fiery hell over Taiwan.

'No one's that madcap about this. So we're actually back to warfare the way it used to be, which is countries fighting over something (while at the same time) they can actually be almost cooperating on something, somewhere else,' Mr Crump said.
'You're fighting through proxies, which the US did in Vietnam, arguably. It did in Korea, arguably. We (the West) certainly fought proxies that were backed by China.
'But the US was never actually fighting China. It never struck the Chinese mainland. It's gonna be a bit like that - widespread regional conflict.
'I think that's more likely than an all-out World War,' he said."

During an appearance on the Patrick Bet-David's podcast last week, Beck revealed that Trump - the presumptive Republican nominee - called him to ask his opinion on his VP pick.
'I said Vivek,' Beck told the four podcast hosts, adding the former president asked him to explain his answer and said: 'That's the No. 1 response from everybody I've asked that question.'
Last week, Ramaswamy suspended his presidential campaign the night of the Iowa caucus and immediately endorsed Trump. He has since appeared alongside the former president at campaign events in New Hampshire, where primary voters will cast ballots Tuesday.
Trump says he's heard from most people he's asked that he should choose Vivek Ramaswamy (left) as his VP pick
Conservative pundit Glenn Beck said he told Donald Trump to pick Ramaswamy as his VP because he will defend the Trump message and carry it on in 2028
Beck explained he told Trump that Ramaswamy will be an effective surrogate for his campaign and its message, as well as being a skilled attack dog and defender of Trump's record and vision.
'He can defend you, he's right in your pocket,' said Beck. 'Some of his ideas are really, really good,' and he 'connects with the youth.'
'People are excited about something fresh and different,' he said of Ramaswamy, also making the case that young voters who supported Joe Biden in 2020 are not supporting the president anymore but haven't moved into Trump's camp yet. Vivek, he argued, may appeal to those voters.
Finally, Beck told the former president, 77, that Ramaswamy is someone who could potentially carry on his White House legacy, once he's termed out for good.
'In 2028, when you can no longer run, you continue for another eight years, and you get the credit for bringing this new fresh face in,' he said.
Beck noted Trump remained coy about where his own head is regarding his ultimate pick for his ticket partner.
'Well. We'll see,' Beck said was Trump's closing thought during their conversation.
At present, Vivek remains a strong odds-on pick for the veep slot, but currently ahead of him on US betting markets are South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, whose name has floated around Trump-world since early in his first term, and House GOP Chairwoman Elise Stefanik.
Noem is the current favorite, according to oddschecker.com, but the situation is dynamic and the primary is long.

Trump has reportedly seen New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as an up and coming star and has been impressed by her consistent loyalty
Last week, Trump spent Tuesday night with businessman and former rival Vivek Ramaswamy in New Hampshire - just one night after he won the Iowa caucus by 30 points and Ramaswamy suspended his campaign and immediately endorsed Trump.
Ramaswamy, 38, a charismatic multi-multi-millionaire, came in a distant fourth in the Iowa caucuses, behind Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.
After Ramaswamy pledged to help him beat President Joe Biden, Trump seemed to suggest that there was much the successful entrepreneur could do for his campaign.
'He's going to be working with us and he'll be working with us for a long time,' Trump said, as many in the crowd chanted for Ramaswamy to become the vice presidential nominee.
'He's a fantastic guy,' Trump said. 'He's got something that's very special because he started off with a zippo and he ended up very strong.'
'He did a great job. I was actually surprised when he called because he was doing well. And it's an honor to have his endorsement,' Trump added.
On Monday night, Trump was complimentary of Ramaswamy during the Trump campaign's victory celebration.
'I also want to congratulate Vivek because he did one hell of a job. He came from zero … that's an amazing job,' Trump said.
Later Trump commended Ramaswamy on Truth Social for endorsing him.
'Thank you Vivek, a Great Honor!' wrote the presumptive Republican nominee.
Trump and Vivek embrace at a campaign event in New Hampshire one day after the Iowa caucus, which Trump handily won. Ramaswamy dropped out after a fourth-place finish and immediately endorsed the former president
At a Mar-a-Lago dinner back in December, Trump reportedly called Stefanik a 'killer,' citing her loyalty and saying he's been impressed
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is also making her case for the ticket partner gig and Team Trump is reportedly listening.
At a Mar-a-Lago dinner back in December, Trump reportedly called Stefanik a 'killer,' citing her loyalty and saying he's been impressed.
'Stefanik is at the top,' said longtime Trump backer and 2016 chief strategist Steve Bannon, according to CNBC.
'If you're Trump, you want someone who's loyal above all else,' said one GOP operative. 'Particularly because he sees Mike Pence as having made a fatal sin.'
Stefanik is campaigning with Trump ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary but declined to comment when asked about the VP job.
But, during a recent Meet the Press interview, she certainly didn't say no.
'Well, I, of course, would be honored to serve in any capacity in a Trump administration,' Stefanik said.
Stefanik became the first member of Republican leadership to offer her endorsement of Trump's reelection bid, before the former president has even formally announced a run himself.
'Republican voters determine who is the leader of the Republican Party and it's very clear President Trump is the leader of the Republican party,' Stefanik said in a statement.
'I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President in 2024. I fully support him running again,' the New York Republican said."

Briell Decker appeared on a recent episode of the Cults To Consciousness podcast to discuss her experience within the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints Church (FLDS) - a break away group which branched off when mainstream Mormonism ceased practicing polygamy.
Having been born into the religion in Sandy, Utah, she was groomed from an early age to one day become a plural wife of Jeffs.
She was just 18 when she married the self-proclaimed prophet, who was more than 30 years her senior, and was punished for resisting his affections.
Jeffs has since been convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault for having sex with two girls aged 12 and 14.
Briell Decker appeared on a recent episode of the Cults To Consciousness podcast to discuss her experience within the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints Church
She was just 18 when she married the self-proclaimed prophet, who was more than 30 years her senior, but was punished for resisting his affections
Briell began by telling host Shelise Ann Sola how Jeffs had 'usurped authority to become the leader' just before her 18th birthday after his father Rulon passed away.
He claimed that he had been chosen by god and, despite dozens of his former students testifying in his favor, Briell said she 'saw red flags on the very first day.'
But she had little choice over their relationship.
'All the marriages in the church were decided by the leader - they were all arranged marriages and if you did choose, it was seen as really bad,' she explained.
Marrying the prophet was considered by many to be 'an honor' - a sentiment not shared by Briell's family.
The former FLDS explained: 'I was making dinner the day that [the wedding] happened, my father walked in the room and my mother recognized the look on his face and actually screamed ""no.""
'My parents were scared and they couldn't really express a lot.'
Briell explained: 'My wedding was definitely a secret wedding. My mother was not invited to it.
'Jeffs was running from the law so he didn't want anybody really to know about it except for he did invite my father. My father was crying when he took me there.'
The former FLDS member explained: 'My wedding was definitely a secret wedding. My mother was not invited to it'
Briell said that she was ultimately punished for her disinterest in Jeffs, who she claimed was 'controlling' and is estimated to have more than 80 wives
Briell (left) told host Shelise Ann Sola (right) how Jeffs had 'usurped authority to become the leader' just before her 18th birthday after his father Rulon passed away
She explained that it was not until she arrived at the ceremony that she was told she would be marrying Jeffs himself, adding: 'I was terrified of him. I was so scared of him.'
But Briell went through with it nonetheless despite having little understanding about relationships, sex education, anatomy or reproduction.
She said Jeffs, who had been the principal at her school, had been 'the one that prepped me for this day,' adding: 'He's the one that groomed me.'
The pair shared a kiss at the end before their nuptials came to an end and they were left alone for the first time as a married couple.
'He sent my father and his brother out of the room. He sat on a chair and he was like ""come sit on my lap"" and I hesitated because I was scared.
'I was kind of in shock after he confirmed that I was supposed to marry him. I went into a foggier feeling so I hesitated.
'I immediately saw the anger on his face. He was so angry.'
She explained that she eventually walked over and sat on his lap, adding: 'He did touch me all over and I was so numbed out.'
'I didn't really love him. I was actually not even attracted to him. I kind of believed in god when I married him but I didn't really love him.'
In 2011, Warren Jeffs was sent away for life after he was convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault for having sex with two girls aged 12 and 14
Having become Jeffs 65th wife, she admitted: 'It just became worse over time because he had a bunch of doctrines that said you're supposed to love your sister wives, you're supposed to sacrifice for them and in my situation I didn't love him so I never cared.
'He had tons of wives so I never would get a turn at all in any situation and it would infuriate him because over time he realized that I wasn't attracted to him.'
Briell explained that former leader Rulon had a 'rotation cycle where every wife got a turn after so many days' but his son did not employ such a system.
'When I went into his family he's like, ""God will tell me if you're ever worthy [for me to spend time with].""
'A lot of the wives, it did hurt them pretty bad I believe because they were always trying to do everything he said... but if he didn't like him then they weren't going to get a turn.
'It didn't matter if God said or not, it didn't really have anything to do with that.'
She continued: 'In my mind, I didn't like him so I didn't really care and I was pretty bold about saying I wasn't really hurt by polygamy itself.'
But Briell said that she was ultimately punished for her disinterest in Jeffs, who she claimed was 'controlling' and is estimated to have more than 80 wives.
Jeffs is currently serving a life sentence plus 20 years for the charges
The cult leader usually rotated household chores - such as cooking and sewing - among his wives every month but she was 'put on every single one of those for an hour every day.'
'He put me in survival mode form day one... I was literally running from one job to the the other and by the time I got home at night I would crash sleep and then in the mornings I wouldn't wake up on time because I was so tired.'
Nonetheless, Briell said she could never lie to Jeffs because as he was the leader 'the repercussion would be pretty great.'
Briell explained that she eventually 'turned on' her husband and was forced to go into hiding after attempting to leave.
She became subject to 'targeted harassment' from other members of the cult - claiming one had even been instructed to kill her - before eventually breaking free aged 26.
Briell concluded: 'When I realized I had freedom in my life for the first time after I escaped, it was such a big deal to me and it still is.
'I want that for everyone. I really want everyone to break these chains psychologically and even physically at times to where hopefully they will get a taste of freedom.'
In 2011, Warren Jeffs was sent away for life after he was convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault for having sex with two girls aged 12 and 14.

3VELPA4KKA_4K8EWTFBUTPYICA,Why building experts want this popular home design banned across Australia,Padraig Collins For Daily Mail Australia,"Published: 03:54 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 03:54 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988071/Why-building-experts-want-popular-home-design-banned-Australia.html,"A home design trend that has grown in popularity in recent years is facing calls for it to be banned because it increases the heat of the house, the area and power bills.
Dark, often black, coloured roofs have increased across Australian cities after regularly featuring on television shows such as The Block and in design catalogues.
Sam Austin, who was awarded NSW's Young Planner of the Year, said poor design choices made while constructing developments meant residents were now living on dangerous urban heat islands where temperatures were higher than in nearby areas.
In parts of western Sydney temperatures were 10C to 12C hotter than the rest of Sydney in summer, he said, with dark roofs which absorb heat partly to blame.
Mr Austin, in a video posted to social media, said 'these brand-new, identical houses being built across the country' were a mistake.
A home design trend that has grown in popularity in recent years is facing calls for it to be banned because it increases the heat of the house, the area and power bills. A female architect is pictured
'Most of these homes have black roofs and a tiny yard with no space for a tree,' he said.
He said black roofs were purely a 'decorative choice' but were in fact at least six degrees hotter than a white roof.
Millions of Australians have been warned to plan for the deadly impacts of the coming scorching summer on their own health and to talk to their relatives and doctors.
The planner is far from alone in pointing out the cost to the power bills and the environment of the trend for black roofs on houses.
One state taking the problem very seriously is South Australia, where dark roofs have been banned in all future homes in the Playford Alive urban renewal project in Adelaide's northern suburbs.
When it is completed, the $1billion project in Munno Para will house around 40,000 people.
Nick Champion, SA's Housing and Urban Development Minister, said most of the homes built here so far have dark-coloured roofs, but dark roofs will be banned from all future stages of the project.
'Encouraging the use of light-coloured roofs in home designs helps to reduce temperature fluctuations in the home – lowering electricity bills and minimising the environmental footprint associated with traditional building practices,' he said.
Mr Champion said it was vital to implement these changes now, to lessen any potential effects from urban heat islands.
A report by Seed Consulting, found homes in Adelaide's northern suburbs with light-coloured roofs were 4.3 degrees cooler on an average day than those with dark roofs.
Janine Strachan, chief executive of the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand, welcomed the South Australian government's move.
'This initiative of light-coloured roofs, when coupled together with roof blankets and ceiling insulation, will great improve the energy efficiency and comfort factor in these homes,' she told news.com.au.
Kym Morgan of the Master Builders Association, also supports what the SA government is doing.
Dark, often black, coloured roofs have increased across Australian cities after regularly featuring on television property shows such as The Block. An almost entirely black house is pictured
'Light-coloured roofing just makes sense, particularly out north where we know it gets hotter.
'It leads to significantly cooler homes and that ultimately means less time running air conditioners and lower energy bills.
'It also means cooler suburbs if consumers adopt lighter roofs en masse,' he said.
Mr Austin said the trend for black roofs on new build houses has been around for a long time in western Sydney and the outer fringes of other cities such as Melbourne and Adelaide.
'Fifteen or so years back, having a dark-coloured roof became really popular,' he said.
'They look stylish and modern, so people loved them. The problem is, that's a 150square metre surface sitting in the sun all day attracting and absorbing huge amounts of heat ... Just about every roof in western Sydney is black.'
The NSW state government had planned to update building standards to help reduce the temperature inside homes, but this has been put on hold until at least May.
Planning Minister Paul Scully said the cost impact on new builds during a housing and cost of living crisis was behind the decision.
Speaking at the time Mr Scully announced the delay, Associate Professor Sebastian Pfautsch of Western Sydney University said it would leave people vulnerable to Australia's 'silent killer'.

The trend for black roofs on new build houses has been around for a long time in western Sydney and the outer fringes of other cities such as Melbourne and Adelaide
'They've effectively thrown the tools they developed to combat urban overheating in the gutter,' he told News Corp.
'It is common knowledge that heat is the silent killer in Australia that costs more lives than those lost in all other natural disasters combined.
'All credible projections point towards more heat and in the recent past, western Sydney was already twice the hottest place on the planet.
'The government is knowingly leaving the people of western Sydney vulnerable to heat,' the professor, who has called for an 'outright' ban on dark roofs across Australia, said.
Plans to transform an empty lot into 'much-needed' affordable housing have been rejected over concerns it would 'adversely affect the heritage area'."

Entrepreneur Anatoly Evsyukov, 65 and his wife, Anna Evsyukova, 64, were aboard the Dassault Falcon 10 aircraft when it fell off the radar near the rural Badakhshan province, in northeastern Afghanistan, on Saturday.
Anna had become seriously ill on a luxury holiday in Thailand and was being flown back to Russia for treatment.
Her husband and business partner, Anatoly, was decorated by Vladimir Putin's regional governor for 'valiant' work building the economy in Rostov region.
After Anna had developed a mysterious infection, requiring ventilator treatment, her husband chartered a medical evacuation plane to move her from a hospital in Pattaya to fly back to Moscow.

Anna Evsyukova , 64, had become seriously ill on a luxury holiday in Thailand and was being flown back to Russia for treatment
Their son Vitali, 41, was not permitted on the small executive air ambulance as only one accompanying passenger was allowed.
He flew on a scheduled flight to Moscow, learning of the horrific crash after he landed.
One of the other victims, Arkady Grachev, was reported to be the ex-husband of Ekaterina Agapova, the head of the company which owned the plane.
They are believed to amongst the six passengers, including four crew members, killed on the ill-fated Dassault Falcon 10.
The charted ambulance flight left Thailand on Saturday and refuelled in India, but according to Shot media in Russia, the pilots reported problems with the engines and fuel while flying over Afghanistan.
Crew had alerted air traffic control about the fuel problem at 7.05pm local time on Saturday, and was seeking to land in Tajikistan on an unscheduled stop.
The couple were aboard the Russian-registered Dassault Falcon 10 aircraft when it fell off the radar near the rural Badakhshan province, in northeastern Afghanista
One engine failed at 19.19pm, and the other ten minutes later, before the jet disappeared from radar at about 19.30pm local time, 35 miles from Kulob airport in Tajikistan.
The aircraft was on a route traveling from Gaya, India, to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, before proceeding to Zhukovsky International Airport in Moscow.
Telegram channel, AviaSpotter, identified the wealthy couple, along with the crew named as Dmitry Belyakov, Arkady Grachev, Igor Syvorotkin and Pavel Popov - two of whom were paramedics.
The aircraft is registered in Russia, according to the country's Federal Air Transport Agency, and belongs to ATLETIK-GRUPP LLC, based in Lyubertsy, Moscow region, and a private individual.
The head of the company Ekaterina Agapova said: 'Nothing is known yet, now I'm trying to understand the situation and understand what happened. There is no confirmed data yet.'
Russian state and independent media highlighted footage purporting to show smoke rising from the crash site
Russian state and independent media highlighted footage purporting to show the crash site.
The footage purportedly shows smoke rising from the site at least 12 hours after the crash, which would have been in darkness.
The crash appears a first since Russian planes were subject to sanctions as a result of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
The sanctions have caused multiple emergency landings due to lack of spare parts and maintenance involving Western suppliers.
However it is unclear whether the sanctions would have been imposed on an air ambulance.
This is reported to be the ninth incident with a Russian plane since the beginning of the year and the eighth to occur during a flight in the last nine days.
India's civil aviation authority said that the plane crash was not a scheduled commercial flight or an Indian chartered aircraft and that 'more details are awaited.'"

The third generation business is 110 years old and credits its success with transforming and evolving by looking at how its customer base has developed.
It has its traditional base in Walworth, south London, but also delivers across the country and to Northern Ireland.
Owner and director Cheryl Arment told Mail Online: 'We've had to constantly transform, especially in the last few years.
'We see our customer base as being right across Britain now. It's all done via courier service and remains fresh and as tasty as ever.

'It's about keeping up with demands and trends.
'Our London customer base is still very strong but it has changed. The world is a different place to what it was 50 or 100 years ago. The dynamic of London has changed and people live different lives.
'It's still very busy with a great number of regular customers. But we've worked hard to keep the brand going and that has meant taking it out there across the country.
'We've listened to our customers. Many have moved out of London and we have kept in touch and deliver to them.'
Cheryl said as the cost of living crisis has started to hit, the company has kept value in mind.
She said: 'The great thing about pie and mash is it is very reasonable. We're able to provide a wholesome, fresh product and a substantial meal at a good price.
'It's still reasonably priced, whatever you're looking for. And it is fresh and good for you.
'Although we have changed and modernised, we have kept our traditional values.'
She said it was 'very sad' to hear of other businesses closing and talk of the industry in decline.
Owner and director Cheryl Arment told Mail Online: 'We've had to constantly transform, especially in the last few years. We see our customer base as being right across Britain now. It's all done via courier service and remains fresh and as tasty as ever'
She added: 'Our story is one of change. We have developed and kept up with the times.
'We are still a traditional family business and we're third generation with a plan in place for a fourth generation.
'We're very passionate about what we do.'
One customer said: 'I love Arments. They provide great food at great value. It's very traditional. It's like an old part of London.'
According to the Pie and Mash Club, the first shop, Blanchard's opened in Southwark, in 1844.
A spokesman said: 'Some 16 years later, Robert Cooke opened his first shop in Shoreditch and subsequently established the first significant franchise, the Cooke family soon opened shops in areas like Clerkenwell, Shadwell, Stratford, Dalston, London Fields, Westminster and most significantly Tower Bridge Road, which opened in 1892.'
After 10 years, the shop was taken over by Michele Manze, the son-in-law of the original owner. It is now the longest running and oldest pie and mash shop in business."

Three of those who died were all members of the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, while a fourth was serving with the Queen's Royal Hussars.
Two of the dead were colleagues serving in the second battalion of the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, based in Chester. Both soldiers are believed to have taken their own lives.
Private Kieran Heaney, 20, who had served on operations in Afghanistan as a teenager, was found dead inside his barrack room on January 4.
Private Josateki Kautani Matasere, known as Teki, died from a suspected suicide
LCpl Simon Hosell, a member of the Queen's Royal Hussars, died on December 29. The cause of death is yet to be determined
Pte Heaney, from Darlington, had joined the Army in 2019 and was the youngest soldier to take part in the 2021 evacuation of Afghan civilians who had worked for the British government.
His death came 19 days after his comrade Private Josateki Kautani Matasere, known as Teki, died from a suspected suicide while back visiting his home island of Fiji.
The 29-year-old soldier was an outstanding rugby league player and a member of the Army team and had recently attended the demanding sniper operator cadre's course.
Both Heaney and Matasere had previously served together in the battalion's Alma Company but Ministry of Defence sources have insisted that there is nothing to link to two deaths.
A source from within the battalion, however, said that members of the battalion were stunned by the double tragedy.
Text messages seen by the Mail On Sunday state: 'It's mental what the Army can do to you. Madness. That's two in two weeks. Something needs to be said.'
Another member of the regiment added: 'How can the Army not see what's going on.'
Lt Col Mike Wade-Smith, the commanding officer of 2 Yorks, described Pte Heaney as 'brave, resilient, disciplined, friendly, fun, and courageous'.

Private Apisalome Rawaidranu, a third member of the Royal Yorkshire Regiment serving with the 1st battalion died but from what have been described as 'natural causes'
He added 'Private Heaney had already demonstrated all these qualities in the operational and sporting arenas. Selfless in his service he will be missed by all members of the Battalion.'
The chairman of Army Rugby League, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Grover, described Pte Matasere as 'a tremendous talent and presence on the rugby field' .
He added: 'In just two seasons he saw success with the Yorkshire Regiment, became a champion with the Infantry, represented the Army and delivered scintillating and memorable performances.'

LCpl Simon Hosell, a member of the Queen's Royal Hussars, died on December 29. The cause of death is yet to be determined.
Last night members of his regiment praised LCpl Hosell describing him as an 'outstanding soldier'. One said: 'Can't believe you're gone mate.
The impact you had on everyone you met was outstanding. Full of laughter, banter and happiness. Rest easy now your demons are gone.'
The MoD set up a 24 hour hotline for troops suffering from combat stress after a campaign by the Mail on Sunday in 2018, prompted by a wave of suicides by serving soldiers.
But Colonel Phil Ingram a former Army Intelligence officer, last night said more needs to be done.
He said: 'The problem of suicide in the armed forces is now becoming acute and there needs to be a thorough investigation into why young men and women a in the armed forces keep on taking their own lives.
'The military are very quick to say suicide rates amongst serving personnel and veterans are no higher than the national average.
'It is and remains a disgrace that the MoD cherry picks statistics to avoid looking into issues that are killing our service personnel and veterans.'
Former Army Warrant Officer Jim Wilde, who campaigns for veterans rights, added: 'Since 2018, almost 450 serving and former members of the armed forces have taken their own lives.
'In any other population group that would be regarded as a disaster but it seems to be fine to allow suicide to be part of life in the armed forces.
'More needs to be done to prevent young servicemen and women from taking their own lives
An Army Spokesperson said: 'The death of any of our people is a tragedy that is deeply felt across the Armed Forces community.
'We recognise the profound impact that this has on families and friends and will always ensure that they are fully supported by trained officers and their Regimental network.'

The Hollywood star, left, has revealed that he is considering packing away his director's chair for good as taking the helm is too time-consuming.
Asked if he preferred being behind the camera or acting in front of it, George says: 'Probably not directing. I'm 62 and I've got kids at home and these things take a year, a year-and-a-half. It's a lot of time, so I'm not sure I'll be doing that much more.'

About an hour into his campaign event at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, a man in the crowd yelled at the former president: 'He's a dictator.'
'Get him out,' Trump said as security surrounded the man and removed him from the arena.
'Now we know that politics is getting serious,' Trump quipped. He has joked he would be a dictator for 'only one day' if he's elected for a second term to the White House in December.
A second man, dressed in a white KKK outfit, was removed from the rally site before he could get down into the crowd. A Daily Mail photographer captured him trying to enter and being removed by security near the arena entrance.
With four days to go until New Hampshire's primary, Trump spoke to his MAGA faithful for nearly two hours. He doubled down on his attacks on Nikki Haley, bringing in a group of lawmakers from her home state of South Carolina who have endorsed him, and got in some taunts at Ron DeSantis, quipping 'I think he's gone.'

He also hit back at Haley for questioning whether he is 'mentally fit' to be president after he appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing Haley of being in charge of security in the Capitol on the day of the January 6th insurrection.
'I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago. Is that possible?,' Trump said.
He also said he took another cognitive test in New Hampshire and 'aced it.'
He spent the early part of his rally doubling down on his attacks on Nikki Haley, bringing in a group of lawmakers from her home state of South Carolina who have endorsed him, and got in some taunts at Ron DeSantis, quipping 'I think he's gone.'
In addition to slamming his rivals, he called Joe Biden the 'worst' president in U.S. history and ran through his laundry list of campaign promises, including protecting the Southern border.
'I'm desperate to get your vote,' Trump told the crowd.
He targeted Haley the hardest. The former governor of South Carolina has seen some movement in the polls as she campaigns in New Hampshire even though Trump still leads by double digits.
'Almost every politician from South Carolina is endorsing me. How do you do that if you're governor?,' Trump swiped at Haley, who served as governor of the state for six years.
He then brought out South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and a slew of other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. Joining them were the state's Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry.
'You know what I'm doing? I'm kissing a**,' Trump said, noting South Carolina was the next primary in the Republican presidential contest.
McMaster told the cheering crowd the officials the group was there 'for one reason.'
'You've heard this, those great philosophers, the Spice Girls. Tell us what you want, what you really really want. Well, that's what we're here. To do to tell you what we in fact want, what we really really want' is Donald Trump, he said.
After the rally, Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller told reporters that Haley needs to drop out of the race and support Trump. He said polls show she has no where to go to win the nomination.
'There's nowhere for Nikki Haley. There's recent polling shows that she is down by 39 points in South Carolina,' Miller said, pointing to the South Carolina officials who had endorsed Trump. The state's Senator Tim Scott had endorsed Trump on Friday.
'There's nowhere for Haley to come. So after President Trump wins on Tuesday, Nikki Haley needs to drop out.'

Trump, meanwhile, spent the evening on the attack and brought up some of his old complaints, including his false charge the 2020 election was stolen from him and that he was a victim of government witch hunt with the legal cases against him.
He took multiple hits at DeSantis, who is trailing in the polls and left New Hampshire to campaign in South Carolina. DeSantis also canceled his scheduled appearances on the Sunday morning political shows.
'I haven't even mentioned the name of Ron DeSanctimonious yet — I think he's gone,' Trump said as the crowd roared.
Someone in the crowd yelled 'loser.' 'You did not just say that,' Trump joked back as the audience laughed.
But he continued on, saying of DeSantis: 'I think he is going to be out pretty soon based off what I'm hearing.'
He accused Haley of wanting 'to turn liberal voters into Republicans for about two minutes while they vote and then go back to being liberal voters.'
Trump has repeatedly accused Haley of courting New Hampshire Democrats to vote for her in the Republican primary.
'Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to fund a radical Democrat campaign operation that she's running,' he said.
'The Radical Left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley for one reason because they know she's very easy to beat. She's gonna be very easy to beat. She's down,' Trump said.
More voters in New Hampshire identify themselves as 'unaffiliated' - or Independent - than they do Republican or Democrat.
Those 'unaffiliated' voters can choose which party's primary they want to vote in and Haley has been courting that group hard.
Voters can also switch their affiliation if they want to change which contest they vote in - however the deadline to do that was in October, meaning there are no more switches allowed.
Ahead of the October deadline, about 3,500 Democrats in New Hampshire switched their party registration to unaffiliated, meaning they can vote in the Republican contest should they choose.

Trump told his crowd of devoted supporters they need to come out in droves for him on Tuesday.
'We need big margins because we have to send real unity as a message. Because with real unity they won't be able to cheat,' he said.
The former president also referenced his immunity battle with the Supreme Court. Trump is arguing he should be immune from prosecution on charges that he plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 election because he was president at the time.
'So a president has to be given immunity and this has nothing to do with me,' he told his rally. 'This has to do with every single president. As an example when Biden gets out , I'm that guy has got a list to go after. But you have to give a president immunity.'
He argued President Harry Truman would have never have dropped an atomic bomb without immunity.
But he also bragged about his prosecutors, saying: 'Every time the radical left Democrats boxes communists and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor.'
Trump also made an unusual move in his rally. He endorsed Rep. Dean Philips, who is challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, in New Hampshire's Democratic primary.
'I think Democrats should vote for the Congressman just to send a signal,' he said of Phillips.
He then touted his own endorsement, noting of Phillips: 'He just picked up a lot of votes by the way.'"

How could only one do justice to the ultimate chameleon, the muse of the top photographers and artists of the age?
The first, on the Caribbean island of Mustique with her loyal girl gang, including Sadie Frost and ex-model Rosemary Ferguson, involved spiritual, New Age rituals reflecting Kate's current persona as health brand founder.
Even so, I would hazard there were a few frozen margaritas on the menu, too.
The second party was a more classic Kate bash, in Paris, where she arrived in a crochet bodystocking-style dress and black knickers – mirroring the famous 1993 photograph of her in a transparent slip dress and black underwear.
And she's so right to celebrate. While turning 50 is certainly a milestone which, however hard even Kate Moss might try, has nothing youthful sounding about it, I have good news for her and anyone approaching that landmark date. Your 50s can be a great decade.
Like all periods of life, personal circumstance defines how you feel, but my own 50s were my best decade. I had the advantages of experience but none of the anxiety about whether I would ever have a home, a husband, a child or a satisfying job – subjects that dominated much of my 20s and 30s.
Naturally, Kate Moss celebrated turning 50 with two big parties
Kate celebrated on the Caribbean island of Mustique with her loyal girl gang, including Sadie Frost and ex-model Rosemary Ferguson, involved spiritual, New Age rituals reflecting Kate's current persona as health brand founder
In my 40s, I went through my first marriage and first divorce (I've not yet attempted a second of either), which was difficult and disconcerting, but by my 50s I'd seen my child come through teens into adulthood, lived with a lovely new partner and had a career which, though demanding, I knew I was good at.
Most importantly, I had learnt the value of contentment, which previously had appeared a very lacklustre emotion.
However, for many women it is the physical changes of ageing that cause the greatest dissatisfaction.
Most of us are not going to look like Kate Moss when we reach 50 but, what's new? We didn't when we hit 30 either. What we can do is to change our expectations of ourselves.
Gravitational pull, menopause and simply the stress of living will take their toll on how we look, but really, so what? In your 50s, it's much easier to accept physical shortcomings because the need to prove yourself to others and yourself is lesser.
With that in mind, who cares if you are a dress size larger, if your skin is a bit more wrinkly, if your belly is very far from an ideal size?
An awareness of mortality kicks in, giving a much kinder perspective on such things.
I'm not silly enough to say that getting older and passing through the menopause gains you the superpower of nonchalance, and that it's a relief not to care how sexually attractive you are.
Of course such concerns persist.
But so long as you don't obsess about your appearance in your 50s, you can relax and focus on what you want to do with the rest of your life, of which there will hopefully be many more years.
It's a great time to look forward. To consider making a change. Even Kate Moss is moving house.
On the subject of age, surely the solution to the ghastly prospect of a dangerous Trump or a doddery Biden winning this year's US presidential election is to put an age cap on holding public office.
I would suggest 75 max, though no doubt should you ask any 74-year-old if they agree, the answer would be a resounding 'No'.
I'm collecting clothes for a vintage sale in aid of Laurence's Larder, our local refuge charity, and hours of this past week have been spent pricing them up piece by piece.
There's a hell of a lot of Zara out there that people don't want to hang on to (stock image)
Does a genuinely vintage but non-designer label 1950s beaded dress have a greater or lesser value nowadays than a decade-old piece of Ralph Lauren?
How do people feel about resale White Company? How much can I ask for a nearly-new Jil Sander cashmere coat?
It's been a fascinating process and made me think about what clothes are worth and to whom?
One thing's for sure – if these donations are anything to go by, there's a hell of a lot of Zara out there that people don't want to hang on to.
What's more truthful – a biopic or documentary?
I ask because there seems to be a huge appetite for both, judging by the number being released.
For example, we have Sam Taylor-Johnson's upcoming biopic of Amy Winehouse, Sofia Coppola's Priscilla (about Elvis Presley and his wife) and Bradley Cooper's portrayal of the conductor Leonard Bernstein in Maestro.
Documentary-wise, we've had the hugely successful four-parter Beckham on Netflix, and there is the new depiction of fashion designer John Galliano, whose career exploded in anti-Semitic, alcohol-induced rants in a Paris cafe in 2010.
Ee have Sam Taylor-Johnson's upcoming biopic of Amy Winehouse Sofia Coppola's Priscilla and Bradley Cooper's portrayal of the conductor Leonard Bernstein in Maestro
It's tempting to believe in the veracity of biopics, even if much of the content is fictional, such as in Peter Morgan's script for The Crown.
But documentaries, even those featuring real-life subjects, are equally subjective, giving us not truth but the point of view of the director. They are fiction by omission.
Beckham's company made his eponymous series, guaranteeing that several awkward subjects, such as his relationship with Qatar, were swerved. Also, High And Low, John Galliano's story, was made with his collaboration – indeed he plays a huge part, though he didn't have ultimate control.
That kind of hybrid may be as close to the truth as any of these can get.
My new Oura smart ring tracks my heart rate, sleep and stress levels, relaying results to an app.
According to the data, I was super-calm all last week, even just after I found out that I'd booked the wrong flight to Rome for a weekend trip.
Given that I actually felt extremely stressed at discovering the error, I'm wondering what it takes for my stress levels to show up on the graph. Possibly when I discover I screwed up the return flight booking, too."

Love and Translation, which premieres on the network on Sunday, follows three American men as they move into a luxurious Dominican Republic villa with 12 women.
The snag? The women, who hail from all over the globe, can't speak English.
Ahead of the series launch, DailyMail.com spoke exclusively to the three bachelors, Tripp Bromley, Dylan Hodge, and Kahlil Haughton, as well as presenter Sangita Patel, and they revealed things got intimate as they were forced to explore other means of communication.
TLC's Love and Translation is set to be the steamiest show yet - as the singletons are forced to communicate via touch due to language barriers
One couple gets hot and heavy under the sheets judging by the racy trailer, with the three bachelors confirming to DailyMail.com 'touching was our most useful form of communication'
The trailer alone is packed full of skin on skin contact, including Tripp sharing a passionate snog with one of the women while in a body of water, while it appears Dylan gets frisky under the sheets with another.
'There's a lot of touch that happens,' Sangita teased, while promising this social experiment is 'unique' and that the trio had 'a lot of fun'.
'I think touch was the best substitute that we had,' 24-year-old contestant Kahlil said.
'You can make someone feel comfortable through touch, like dancing. And it feels natural.'
The Texas native continued: 'I feel like touching was our most useful form of communication in a way. And I mean, sometimes it would lead to like more kissing and some other extra stuff or something.
'I think it was one of the most the most useful things that we did.'
Speaking in agreement, Dylan, 21, added: 'When you can't use language, then you have to resort to other senses to be able to communicate.
'So, we used all the other options. Everything else in the tool belt was pulled out.'
Kahlil (pictured) revealed: 'Sometimes [touching] would lead to like more kissing and some other extra stuff'
None of the 12 women on Love and Translation can speak English - causing a road block
Presenter Sangita Patel told DailyMail.com: 'There's a lot of touch that happens', adding that the trio had 'a lot of fun'
Overall, the bachelors described their time on Love and Translation as 'really humbling' and 'grounding'
Californian native Tripp, 30, did point out that as the show develops, the trio do get 'a little bit more sophisticated with our nonverbal communication'.
He continued to DailyMail.com: 'One of the things that stood out is that I learned to communicate with just my eyes.
'You can do a lot more with that, listening, and communicating than doing the cavemen basics.'
The cameras didn't shy away from picking up the action as their romances deepen – and the bachelors weren't camera shy.
Tripp said: 'I registered that everything was under surveillance and I never thought about it.
'For all of us, [the cameras] were just a factor that was included in the situation, so we opted to focus on the presence of the moment here.'

Overall, Tripp noted that the overall vibe of the show was a 'true open love experience'.
He said: 'Everybody's got freedom everybody's heart is open or closed.
'It was really humbling and grounding experience for everybody in one way or another.'
While they kept the outcome of the series well and truly under wraps, Sangita hinted: 'Love is a universal language and I really think that comes through in the end.'
Love and Translation premieres on Sunday, January 21 at 10 pm ET/PT on TLC."

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Kevin Hollinrake described watching Mr Bates Vs The Post Office at home with his wife while Parliament was in recess.
'We were both shocked,' he said. 'I think I cried more than she did.'
The Minister's tears flowed in the courtroom scenes with Jo Hamilton, played by Monica Dolan, and when the sub-postmasters won their case, too, he told the MoS.
The ITV drama sparked nationwide outrage over what has been described as one of the most widespread miscarriages of justice in British history.
Mr Hollinrake wants the show to win all the awards at the Baftas and for actor Toby Jones to be given a knighthood – but not before Alan Bates, who Jones played in the drama, is awarded one first.

The Minister's tears flowed in the courtroom scenes with Jo Hamilton, played by Monica Dolan (pictured), and when the sub-postmasters won their case, too, he told the MoS
The MP for Thirsk and Malton said of the drama: 'Some people knew the scale of this, but not everybody recognised its depth and the impact on people's lives. It was beautifully portrayed.'
The scandal, which stemmed from problems with the Horizon IT system, saw hundreds of sub-postmasters being handed criminal convictions after the faulty accounting software made it appear as though money was missing from their branches.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said a new law will be introduced so that those affected are 'swiftly exonerated and compensated' and all victims handed an automatic £75,000 payment, too. Those whose convictions are quashed by the new law will then be eligible for compensation of at least £600,000.
The bill is set to cost the taxpayer as much as £1.5 billion, Mr Hollinrake revealed – up from the original £1 billion set aside. The rise is partly due to hundreds of new victims coming forward after the ITV drama. The Minister supports calls for part of the bill to be paid by Fujitsu – the company behind the Horizon system. The Japanese firm has assured it will contribute.
Mr Hollinrake said: 'We think it's right to keep our powder dry until we see the results of the inquiry. When we know the extent of its responsibility, then we will have a proper conversation about Fujitsu's contribution.
'We've got to be fair. I don't believe in any kind of witch-hunt. There's a joint responsibility here – including the Government as the only shareholder of the Post Office.'
Mr Hollinrake, who has been an MP for his North Yorkshire constituency since 2015, said addressing the scandal was his 'number one priority' when he became a Business Minister in 2022.
As for Lib Dem leader and former Post Office Minister Ed Davey, Mr Hollinrake admitted it was 'painful' watching him give an interview and refuse to say sorry ten times for his role in the scandal. 'I've apologised for what I've done and I've only been here for 15 minutes,' he said. 'I think we should all apologise.'"

The High Flying Birds musician, 56, has cut back on his drinking, giving up booze on New Year's Day and swapping it for peppermint tea, according to the Mirror.
But the former Oasis star plans to break his run of sobriety in the coming months after a London gig when he will celebrate by waving his underwear in the air.
The Cigarettes & Alcohol hitmaker said on the the Matt Morgan podcast: 'I’ve been drinking every day for four years, half a bottle of red wine a night.
'I’ve got a gig on March 21 at the Royal Albert Hall, so that’s the aim – to have a big blowout the night after that, go mad, swinging my undies round my head in the dressing room.'

Last year, Noel vowed to carry on boozing until he got a 'tap on the shoulder' from the doctor.
The songwriter - who, along with his now-estranged brother and former Oasis bandmate Liam, 51, were among the biggest caners of the 1990s - planned to continue his partying ways until he was told to rein it in.
Speaking to Dave Berry on the Absolute Radio Breakfast Show in January last year, he said: 'I was out last night, I accidentally had lots of alcohol when I was out and I feel pretty, pretty rough. I love getting on it, I love it.'
Asked if he's 'ever abstained', Noel replied: 'No, no, no. Dry January is for middle-aged women.
'Life is short, and life is fleeting, I think while you can, you should, because there’s gonna come a point where your doctor goes, ""I don’t think you should do that anymore"".

'I am on it until I get my tap on the shoulder. I’m still functioning perfectly as a human being, the old back's a bit sore.
'Going out is a big part of life, being sociable with one’s friends – I love it.'
Noel - who also planned to cut down on wine in 2021 after boozing too much during lockdown - famously declared taking drugs was 'like getting up and having a cup of tea in the morning'."

The former Strictly Come Dancing stars' daughter was rushed to A&E in December and was later diagnosed with pneumonia and tonsillitis.
And in a new update on Sunday, James, 45, shared a snap of the tot wrapped in a green blanket looking sad on her hospital bed.
He captioned the Instagram post: 'Back in hospital with my baby girl.'
In another image, Ola, 41, was seen giving her a big hug as they waited for further assistance.

Speaking to his followers in a video, he added: 'So we all had a really fun night last night. We took Ella to hospital because her cough was so bad, I might actually put a little video up after this to show you, it was horrendous.
'Anyway we got into hospital and they were absolutely amazing. The nurses were so lovely with her again and the doctor was fantastic.
'She has, apparently, croup. They gave her a steroid called Dexamethasone which helped but then this morn she woke up again at 9 o' clock - we didn't get home til half three - and she woke up and was horrendous again.
'We gave her some more which they gave us to take away but we can't seem to get on top of it at the moment unfortunately.'
It comes after Ola and James Jordan revealed their daughter Ella was diagnosed with a heart murmur as they shared a health update on the three-year-old.
Speaking to Hello! for the first time about her condition, the couple said it looks as though her illness before Christmas may have been linked to her heart issue.
During the interview, the parents revealed they were told a couple of years ago about Ella's heart condition.
They explained how they were told she might have a small hole in her heart - but that nothing could be done until she was 'older and stronger'.
However they also issued a positive update, with James, 45, sharing that Ella is now 'around 85 per cent better'.
'Ella was first diagnosed with a heart murmur a couple of years ago,' Ola, 41, revealed to the outlet.
'The, just before her second birthday, a doctor said: 'I'm not sure about her heart; there's a little hole that needs to be double-checked with another doctor.''
James added: 'We were told that if she does have a hole in her heart, they can't do anything until she's older and stronger, so they suggested we wait.'
James then shared the video from the night before of Ella coughing uncontrollably in bed while a distressed Ola looked on trying to help her
The Strictly Come Dancing professionals, who have been married since 2003 , welcomed Ella in February 2020 after a round of IVF
The family will know more after a follow-up appointment next month, but James said it would be a 'massive operation'.
But it would seem the youngster may be on the mend, as James said that while her energy levels are low, she is getting better.
'I took her to an indoor play centre the other day,' he said. 'That's the first time she'd done anything energetic since having pneumonia and it knocked her for six.
'You can see her energy isn't quite back yet but she's getting there.'
In December, James revealed that Ella, who turns four next month, had been rushed to hospital when she came down with an 'extremely high temperature' after initially being told by a doctor their daughter had a simple viral infection.
They felt the problem was more serious but took the doctors advice to continue giving her Ibuprofen.
However, Ella's condition did not improve over the next two days and so they took her back to A&E and were met by 'caring' nurses and an 'attentive' doctor.
Sharing several snaps of Ella in hospital, James wrote: 'My little warrior!! We are still at Pembury Hospital but she has finally turned a corner after 5 days and long nights of fighting an extremely high temperature.
'It started Monday but on Wednesday night things got pretty bad and temperature was 40+ so took her to A and E at roughly midnight where a doctor gave her a quick look over and said it was a viral infection and told us to continue with Calpol/Ibuprofen and take her home and it would take its course.
'I did try to say it seems more like a chest infection than a viral infection but I'm not the expert. He also told us that it wasn't because he had listened to her chest.
'After getting her home we kept a log of every time we gave her Calpol and then Ibuprofen (2 hours apart) alternating. After two more terrible nights of her temperature staying around 39 - 40 and her throwing up several times in her sleep.'
Speaking to Hello!, the couple said it looks as though Ella's illness before Christmas (seen in December) may have been linked to her heart issue - which they had not publicly spoken about before now
After returning to A&E, James and Ola discovered Ella (seen together in September) was actually suffering with a chest infection and tonsillitis
After returning to A&E, James and Ola discovered Ella was actually suffering with a chest infection and tonsillitis .
'And even though we felt we were maybe wasting the doctors and nurses time and would look like overprotective parents - we decided to take her back to A and E.
'WELL!! What a totally different experience - we were met by caring and fun nurses who were 100% attentive and by a doctor that was so thorough and taking nothing to chance.
'Ella clearly looked not well and was sent straight to X Ray - and almost immediately had bloods taken by a totally amazing team of nurses who I thank massively.
'The results came back as her having a chest infection and tonsillitis.'
Two days later, the couple shared that they would likely miss the Strictly Come Dancing final as Ella was still in hospital .
Taking to Twitter James who appeared as a professional on the series between 2006 and 2013, wrote: 'Hi guys Not sure if we're going to be home in time to watch Strictly LIVE which is a shame but we are still in hospital with Ella'.
He then went on to explain how her condition was thankfully improving saying: 'She is doing much better and slowly on the mend lots of Daddy cuddle when we get home.'
Later Ola, who also danced on the show between 2006 and 2015, took to Instagram to pay tribute to show finalists Ellie Leach, Layton Williams and Bobby Brazier.
The couple both joined the show in 2006 before James left for pastures new in 2013 and Ola following two years later (pictured in 2012)
Writing: 'Good luck to all the couples for the Strictly Final tonight. Here's a picture of me and Chris winning in 2009 (when Strictly was in black and white feels like life time ago).
'It was the most magical feeling knowing you all voted for us and we were the people's champions.'
She went on to say: 'That's what I love about Strictly - it's not always the best dancers that win but the ones the public fell in love with the most throughout the series or made the most improvement.
'I'm so excited for all of them and can't wait to catch up and watch it soon, Keep Dancing.'"

Chance Ford was found unresponsive at a property on Swamp Gum Place at Alfredton, west of Ballarat, after 9pm on Saturday.
Neighbours went to investigate after they heard screaming coming from the home and walked inside to find the lifeless baby on the living room floor.
'I went to investigate and the little boy was just lying on the floor of the lounge room,' one witness told The Courier.
'A neighbour was helping trying to resuscitate him but unfortunately the paramedics came and were not able to get him back.'
Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia that detectives are waiting for post-mortem results, due later on Monday, to determine the cause of death.
No arrests have been made and there is no suggestion the parents had anything to do with the boy's death.

Family friend, Angela Walker, told 7 News: 'The mum was just screaming that something had happened, and just crying and yelling.'
'It was pretty confronting, his dad was out the front pretty upset.'
'I'm not sure where his mum was but I imagine she was pretty upset, wherever she was.'
She described Chance as a 'beautiful boy'.
Chance's family had only lived at the home for about a year before the tragedy.
Other neighbours said the mother started knocking on doors asking for help at about 9pm.
One man told Daily Mail Australia she knocked on his door saying she had a fight with her boyfriend.

'She had no shoes, no phone, no bag, jeans and a shirt and didn't appear to have her wallet,' he said.
'She seemed scared and wanted to know if she could use my phone, and I didn't really want to give her my phone, so I said I'd call her a taxi.'
At the time, he did not know a child had died in the area.
He gave her a glass of water and ordered her a taxi to nearby Soldier's Hill, and said the woman sat on the couch and didn't say much.
The taxi arrived about ten minutes later and he called the police.

Finn Richardson has alleged that aged 15 he was 'whisked away' from his home in Washington, D.C., by two unknown men and taken to a treatment center for supposedly disobedient youths around 2,000 miles away in Syracuse, Utah.
He was held at Elevations RTC against his will from August 2021 to March 2022, according to a lawsuit filed in Utah's 2nd District Court last week.
Richardson claims the kidnapping was arranged by his father who was upset that his son was gay and wanted to live with his mother.
In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Richardson, now 18, has said the entire industry is 'inherently abusive' and should be 'shut down'.
Finn Richardson, pictured here at Elevations, a treatment center for 'troubled' youths in Utah, is suing the facility over claims it 'kidnapped' him when he was 15 after his father raped him
Ryan Faust, a therapist at the center, 'tortured' Richardson by taking away his personal belongings and also failed to report allegations of his father's rape, according to a lawsuit
A statement by the Elevations facility in Syracuse, Utah, denied it had 'kidnapped' Richardson and said Faust did report the rape allegations, but that the issue was over when he did so
Elevations has denied it 'kidnapped' Richardson.
The case has shone a light on Utah's 'troubled teen' industry, which is thought to worth around half a billion dollars a year to the Beehive State.
The state houses around a third of all teens that crossed state lines to enter a youth treatment center between 2015 and 2020.
Four deaths have occurred in these facilities since 2021, with 37 lawsuits filed against centers between 2010 and 2020.
It comes after Paris Hilton claimed that she was sexually abused after being forced to undergo cervical exams performed by staff members in the early hours of the morning while attending a Utah boarding school for troubled teens in the 1990s.
In August, another Utah teen facility was forced to close its doors after it was accused of ignoring 17-year-old student Taylor Goodridge's cries for medical attention in the days before her death.
State legislators have recently introduced regulations to improve standards at these centers.
But Meg Appelgate, CEO of Unsilenced, an advocacy group for former residents of youth treatment centers, said Richardon's case was symptomatic of a broken industry.
Utah is home to almost 100 youth residential centers, which cater to parents paying upward of $30,000 to find help for struggling teenagers.
Some are on juvenile probation or struggling with drug misuse and eating disorders.
Others, such as Richardson, are simply from broken homes.
Paris Hilton has detailed alleged sexual abuse she endured while attending a Utah boarding school for troubled teens in the 1990s
Hilton has campaigned for the closure of Provo Canyon School since 2020
Taylor Goodridge, 17, a student at Diamond Ranch Academy in Hurricane, Utah, died on December 20 from an 'easily treated' infection that led to sepsis after school staff allegedly ignored her cries for medical attention
Diamond Ranch Academy - an 108-bed teen treatment rehabilitation program in Hurricane - was sued by the girl's parents over her death. It described itself on its website as a 'world-class residential treatment center and therapeutic boarding school for teenagers'
The 'troubled teen' industry was born in Utah in the 1960s when a Brigham Young University student named Larry Dean Olsen started leading wilderness outings with his classmates.
It has since spread across the US, but the Beehive State remains the epicenter of the industry thanks to its pitch to rehabilitate wayward teens through living and hiking in its picturesque landscapes, as well its favorable laws.
Utah is considered a 'parent's rights state', which means that parents can make medical decisions on behalf of their children, who are unable to leave a facility without their guardian's consent.
It was this that allowed Richardson's father to have him 'abducted' from his home on August 11, 2021, and have him detained at the Elevations center in Utah at $25,000 a month.
Richard told a press conference in Utah last week that he was stripped and searched upon arrival at the center before he 'shrank' into a bed barely bigger than himself and broke down in tears.
He remembers the narrow, gray hallways, stained carpets and windows covered in hand marks from children banging on them desperate to get out.
Around 50 children aged between 13 and 18 were 'condemned' to monotonous days and frequently punished for minor offenses, such as having dust on their desks, Richardson claimed.
Richardson claims in his lawsuit that Faust 'began to torture' him by stealing his personal affects, including a gift card, 'so that he would feel even more powerless'.
Faust said he 'did not believe' Richardson when the boy told him that his father had raped him when he was 15 and failed to report the allegation to the authorities, according to the lawsuit.
Richardson, who is now back living in Washington, D.C, with his mother and in his final year of high school, said he hoped he was launching his case for 'all the survivors' of Elevations.
Richardson claimed youths at Elevations center were made to endure monotonous days and frequently 'punished' for minor infractions, such as having dust on their desks
He is now living with his mother at home in Washington, D.C, and is in his final year of school
Elevations said in a statement that Faust did report Richardson's allegation that his father had raped him, but 'the issue with the state was how soon' he did so.
It added: 'Knowing the allegation occurred at the home of the out-of-state parent and the alleged abuser was thousands of miles away, the therapist briefly delayed reporting while he reviewed the matter, taking into account the ongoing dispute and social dynamics between the parents.
'The therapist reported the allegation; the father was investigated, and no charges were filed.
'All of this occurred nearly two years ago under a state statute that has since changed to require reporting abuse allegations without delay for judgment or investigation.
'Our staff has been retrained to follow these new guidelines, and we will continue to behave within the law and in a way to protect the interests of our students, whose safety and well-being remain our primary priority.'
'We look forward to defending our program and staff against this unwarranted attack.'
Some teenagers have said they have been helped by their time at such centers.
But Appelgate, who has supported Richardson in his case, echoed his calls for the industry to be shut down.
'The very act of removing kids from their community, their home, their familial system, is not based on evidence,' she told DailyMail.com.
'Regardless of intentions, it is not regulated or reported on. These are not safe places for children.'

Utah State Senator Mike McKell (left) introduced new laws on the industry in 2021 to increase oversight and ban solitary isolation after 'a lot of kids had been harmed' by the practice
Utah State Senator Mike McKell (R.) helped bring in new laws in 2021 that placed limits on the use of medication and restraints in youth treatment centers and banned solitary isolation.
The regulations also increased the reporting requirement for facilities as well as the frequency of inspections.
McKell told DailyMail.com the laws were needed because 'a lot of kids had been harmed by the industry'.
'We had a half a billion dollar industry, outside any type of regulatory structure,' he added.
He said there were things happening that 'should never have been legal', including a young girl who was chemically restrained more than a dozen times at Provo Canyon School, the same institution Paris Hilton spent 11 months at when she was 17 years old.
The reality star has campaigned to regulate the industry after she alleged physical and mental abuse incidents at the school, which has been running since the 1970s."
6V12KUKVDZ_Q9TKNVKE48LPD0C,Ron DeSantis DROPS OUT of White House race: Florida Governor ends run and endorses TRUMP in stunning move BEFORE the New Hampshire primary,"Katelyn Caralle, U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com In Portsmouth, New Hampshire","Published: 19:59 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 23:51 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989483/Ron-DeSantis-DROPS-White-House-race-New-Hampshire-primary.html,"Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race for the White House and endorsed rival Donald Trump in a stunning move less than 48 hours before the New Hampshire primary.
The Florida Governor, widely considered the future of the Republican party and initially the favorite to take down Trump, announced he was suspending his campaign in a surprise video Sunday afternoon.
It followed mounting speculation that donors were fleeing and his campaign was struggling to find a path to make a dent in Trump's huge polling lead.
Trump said he was 'honored' by DeSantis' endorsement and called for Republicans to 'rally' behind the former president's 2024 White House bid.
DeSantis came second in the Iowa caucuses and largely avoided campaigning in New Hampshire so he could focus on South Carolina – the home state of 2024 candidate Nikki Haley.
But the writing was on the wall when the campaign fired half its staff, big-money backers were increasingly frustrated with his war on 'woke' and top brass were at each other's throats.
DeSantis channeled Winston Churchill in his farewell video and called Haley a 'repackaged form of warmed-up corporatism'.
His final warning was for Republicans not to go 'back to yesteryear' and confirmed he would support Trump, the opponent who has mocked and humiliated him for the last year.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential campaign on Sunday. Pictured: DeSantis at a campaign stop in Nashua, New Hampshire on January 19
Trump endorsed DeSantis in his 2018 bid for governor in Florida, using his coattails to help earn him the Republican nomination and eventually the win
'We don't have a clear path to victory,' DeSantis said in the video posted to X announcing his departure from the race. 'Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.'
Now the Republican primary is down to a two-person race with only former President Trump and his once-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley vying for the nomination.
'I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race,' Haley said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday afternoon. 'He's been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.'
Despite repeatedly bashing Trump for refusing to debate in the primary cycle and taking several hits from the ex-president calling him 'Ron DeSanctimonious', the governor decided to endorse his former rival.
Trump said during an unannounced stop at his New Hampshire campaign headquarters that after DeSantis' announcement on Sunday he has 'officially retired' the 'DeSanctimonious' nickname.
Throughout the campaign, Trump called DeSantis a 'traitor' for deciding to run for president in 2024 after the former president's endorsement is what led him to clinch the Republican nomination for governor in Florida in 2018.
'It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,' DeSantis said. 'They watch his presidency gets stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.'
He added: 'Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.'
'I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.'
The pledge in question is what the Republican National Committee (RNC) required all candidates to sign, vowing to support the eventual nominee if they wanted to participate in their four primary debates last year. Trump never signed the pledge and refused to show up for the debates.
'[W]e are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates,' Trump's campaign wrote in a statement Sunday afternoon. 'It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.'
'Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement,' the statement said, adding: 'She represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans.'
DeSantis' young family joined him for most of his time campaigning. Pictured: Ron, Casey, Madison, six, Mason, five, and Mamie, three, appear together on stage at a campaign event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Saturday, January 20 – the day before Gov. DeSantis dropped out of the race

After no guidance was sent for events on Sunday or Monday ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, speculation began to swirl over where DeSantis had landed after his Saturday swing.
The announcement of the end of his campaign was filmed in Florida, where it is now known he returned to after holding his last 2024 campaign event in South Carolina on Saturday.
Moments after the video went live, guidance was sent canceling DeSantis' meet and greet in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday evening.
DeSantis' campaign vehemently denied to DailyMail.com on Sunday any rumors that could emerge detailing DeSantis' plans to drop out – but just hours later, the governor released a video on X ending his bid.
'Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,' DeSantis said in a four-and-a-half video on his exit from the campaign. 'Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward.'
'If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,' he continued. 'But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources.'
It appeared that DeSantis would stay in the race until after South Carolina in hopes that Haley would do poorly in her home state and drop out.
But instead, he chose to exit before New Hampshire could weigh-in on Tuesday.
'[Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear – a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism – that Nikki Haley represents,' he said in slamming the former president's only remaining GOP contender.
DeSantis' launched his campaign in a disasterous Twitter Spacces event before CEO Elon Musk rebranded the website to X. Instead of starting off with the anticipated 'historic' social media announcement, the app experienced a series of glitches that wouldn't let the event kick-off
DeSantis' final days in the race had him frantically trying to figure out where his message might best resonate after he lost Iowa to Trump by 30 points.
After completing the 'full Grassley' in Iowa by traveling to all 99 counties and receiving the endorsement of the state's popular Gov. Kim Reynolds, DeSantis still couldn't turn ou the vote for a win in the caucuses on January 15.
The day after the Iowa caucuses DeSantis flew to Greenville, South Carolina to get a jump start in the fourth primary contest state in hopes voters would turn against Nikki Haley there.
After the quick South Carolina stop, DeSantis flew back to New Hampshire later that day before CBS News broke on Wednesday that the governor planned to leave the Granite State - possibly for good - to again campaign in South Carolina all weekend.
That trip, however, ended up lasting one day – with three events. It concluded with headlines on how DeSantis sparred with a fourth grade teacher over Haley's education record as governor.
On Sunday, instead of campaigning in South Carolina, DeSantis was expected to fly back to New Hampshire. But after canceling appearances on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's State of the Union in the process, it became clear something else was afoot.
Hours later on Sunday morning he dropped out of the race and canceled remaining events."

One student told how her college was 'adamant' it did not want police involvement after she informed them she had been sexually assaulted twice by the same person.
Another said she was dissuaded from involving police after someone at her college began a stalking campaign against her - and was then told she could not seek support from her college counsellor because the perpetrator was already seeing them.
Cambridgeshire Constabulary told MailOnline it 'encourages' all victims of sexual offences to report them, adding: 'We're here for you and we will look after you.'
Experts told Varsity that until six years ago, universities had no role in arbitrating or resolving allegations of sexual offences, but that they now run 'quasi-judicial processes, for cases up to, and including, sex without consent.'
Rose Stephenson, Director of Policy and Advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute: 'If universities were investigating murder, we'd all think that was totally inappropriate. Yet we're doing it for rape.'
The University of Cambridge has been accused of 'actively discouraging' students from reporting incidents of sexual assault to police
Victims are encouraged to report incidents of sexual assault to the University's Office of Student Conduct, Complaints and Appeals (OSCCA), through either a formal or informal procedure, or alternatively through their college
It is understood that victims are encouraged to report incidents of sexual assault to the University's Office of Student Conduct, Complaints and Appeals (OSCCA), through either a formal or informal procedure, or alternatively through their college, instead of reporting to police.
But investigations can take long periods of time which have left some victims feeling suicidal, and provide no formal justice.
An investigation by the university's newspaper spoke to multiple women who have been victims of sexual offences or stalking.
Ella said she was sexually assaulted twice by her then-boyfriend while studying at Cambridge.
She made the college aware of her allegations but described staff as 'very adamant' that they did not want police involved and says they instead repeatedly promoted the university's disciplinary body as offering a 'cleaner, faster, smoother alternative'.
Ella said she felt she was then congratulated for choosing the more informal process.
According to students who have been through these informal investigations, the process facilitates victims of sexual offences and alleged perpetrators to come to resolution agreements, such as by limiting the spaces in which each can go to avoid them coming across one another.
But Ella said this creates a situation in which it is the 'person who gets accused gets the most power… it was all very much on his terms.'
And although OSCCA says this informal procedure should take one to two months, it was eight months until Ella's case was resolved, by which time she felts suicidal.
She also criticised the arrangement for having no practical enforcement methods, saying she 'still sees him everywhere' and that he sits just rows away from her during lectures.
'I really hate it here,' she added. 'Genuinely, I don't think I've ever hated being in a place so much.'
University investigations can take long periods of time, and provide no formal justice
Alice told the paper she was stalked by 'someone in a position of power' at her college, someone who allegedly has a 'reputation' who had exhibited similar behaviours previously.
After being persuaded to allow the college to investigate instead of reporting it to the police, she said a contract was put in place within a month - but that the perpetrator violated the agreement within ten minutes by sending her a message on social media.
Alice said the stalking 'only got worse' and that the university's processes meant her stalker 'didn't take it seriously at all'.
While the stalking was ongoing, Alice attempted to see a counsellor at her college for mental health support - only to be told she couldn't see them because her alleged stalker already was. She was informed it would be a 'conflict of interest'.
She eventually took her allegations to police in Cambridge, and noticed an immediate improvement - but says it could have been stopped earlier if her college hadn't 'actively discouraged' her from involving officers.
She described the police response as 'great'.
The investigation also found that many students do not know that the university has an official reporting procedure or how it works.
One student told how they had been at university only a day when she was followed home by a man before being allegedly sexually assaulted.
Daisy was so traumatised by what happened that she developed an alcohol dependency and failed her first year exams.
She informed her college of what had happened, but says no-one suggested it should be reported either to police or the university.
Universities only became involved in potentially criminal issues involving its students in recent years.
Director of Policy and Advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute Rose Stephenson said: 'Overnight, universities went from not really dealing with this, to running quasi-judicial processes, for cases up to, and including, sex without consent.'
She added students may choose to go through university reporting systems to avoid the trauma of a long criminal investigation, but added it makes her 'uncomfortable' that institutions are effectively 'filling that gap' in the justice system.
Professor McCartan of the University of the West of England said that the sexual violence 'epidemic' is a problem across all universities, but the lack of a national framework means 'what you get is 130 universities all doing their own thing'.
He told MailOnline the role of universities in investigating sexual offences 'calls into question the role of universities' in students' lives, and raised concerns over the variation of punitive measures deployed by different universities.
'The question is what is within the remit of the university and what is within the remit of external organisations like the police.
'This raises the real issue of what students are. At times universities treat students as children, but at the same time they will turn round and say they’re adults, they can make their own decisions.
'Policing behaviour outside of the university setting is quite tricky. Universities need to do something: they need to engage in the process and they need to work together on this to prevent these great inconsistencies.'
He called for government ministers to 'sit down and lead the conversation' on whether it is appropriate for sexual offences to be investigated by educational institutions, and create a national framework of guidance.
A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: 'We encourage the reporting of rape or sexual assault to us. We know it can be difficult and we understand that there are lots of reasons people choose not to report, and it's always your choice.
'We're here for you and we will look after you whatever you decide to do. There is no time limit.'
A University spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Sexual misconduct has no place at Cambridge.
'Students who report any form of criminal misconduct to the University are made aware of their option to contact the police and support is available to them both via their College and the wider University.
'We have clear policies and processes in place about how claims of sexual misconduct are to be treated, and how students will be supported. Further information is available on the University’s Breaking the Silence and Student Complaints webpages.'"

Defence Secretary Grant Shapps today lambasted Netanyahu's 'disappointing' rejection of a Palestinian state as part of any post-war plan for Gaza.
Thousands of people demonstrated in central Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling for the return of hostages held in Gaza and early elections to oust Mr Netanyahu, who rules at the head of a coalition containing far-right nationalists.
He has has vowed to press ahead with the offensive in Gaza for many months despite mounting pressure on Israel to rein in its military action as the scale of death and destruction intensifies.
Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Shapps said: 'Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security. Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution."

John Fetterman broke with his party, stating that the border crisis is threatening to destroy the American dream as another 300,000 people approached the southern border in hopes of crossing into the U.S.
Fetterman voiced his concerns about the ongoing migration crisis and demanded a 'secure border' as he spoke to CNN's The Lead anchor Jake Tapper on Friday.
The Democratic senator, 54, from Pennsylvania said, 'I honestly don't understand why it's controversial to say we need a secure border.'
'And [what] I think about immigration is, we want to provide the American Dream for any migrant. However, it seems very difficult when you have 300,000 people showing up, encountered at our border, to achieve that,' he added.
His remarks come as the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol documented more than 302,000 attempts to cross the U.S. southern border in December, the highest total for a single month ever recorded in history.

The Democratic Pennsylvania senator, 54, said: 'I honestly don't understand why it's controversial to say we need a secure border'
Fetterman, whose wife arrived in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant at the age of 7, insisted he's a proponent of legal migration on Friday's show.
'I've been very clear, in fact, that was weaponized against me [by] Republicans in my race, that I'm very much a strong supporter of immigration, and you know, my wife's family, that's the origin story about that,' he added.
But he questioned why progressive critics from the left have issues with his pro-border security stance.
'I honestly don't understand,' he responded to Tapper's question, 'Why do you think you've been criticized by so many progressives?'
'And I think two things can be true at the same time. You can be very supportive of immigration, but we also need to have a secure border,' he said.
In recent weeks, Fetterman has broken from the far-left of his party by showing strong support for Israel since the October 7 Hamas terror attack.
He also stated that the U.S. should toughen up its southern border policy, a stance some on the left think is inhumane.

Fetterman, whose wife Gisele Barreto Fetterman arrived in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant at age 7, insisted he's a proponent of legal migration on Friday's show
'I'm not a progressive,' Fetterman told NBC News last month. 'I just think I'm a Democrat that is very committed to choice and other things.
'But with Israel, I'm going to be on the right side of that. And immigration is something near and dear to me, and I think we do have to effectively address it as well.'
Fetterman said it was 'not ideal to have this conversation' about immigration linked to funding Israel and Ukraine, he added that 'it's still one that we should have.'
'Progressives better do that because we can't leave Israel - we can't sell them out, and we can't sell Ukraine out, and we have to deliver on that,' Fetterman told the network. 'I just would very much like to get a deal to deliver this critical aid.'
As for immigration, Fetterman argued he can be both pro-immigration, while also favor policies to restrict the flow of immigrants across the southern border to a manageable level.
'It's a reasonable conversation - until somebody can say there's an explanation on what we can do when 270,000 people are being encountered on the border, not including the ones, of course, that we don't know about,' he said.
'To put that in reference, that is essentially the size of Pittsburgh, the second-largest city in Pennsylvania,' the Democrat added.
In a December interview with Politico, the lawmaker said:  'I hope Democrats can understand that it isn't xenophobic to be concerned about the border. It's a reasonable conversation, and Democrats should engage.'
Last fiscal year, the Biden administration saw the single highest number of encounters at the border on record
At least 2.4 million migrants streamed across the US' southern border in fiscal 2023, and that figure just represents the encounters border patrol agents had - there are plenty of illegal crossers who did not come into contact with DHS officers

Last fiscal year, the Biden administration saw the single highest number of encounters at the border on record.
At least 2.4 million migrants streamed across the southern border in fiscal 2023, and that figure just represents the encounters border patrol agents had - there are plenty of illegal crossers who did not come into contact with DHS officers.
The figure breaks down to an average of about 6,575 encounters per day, which means it would take just over two full weeks for 95,000 illegal crossers to enter the US.
Between Dec. 1 and December 31 2023, more than 302,000 migrants were documented attempting to cross the US southern border, which marks the first time migrant encounters have reached over 300,000.
Last week, as New York City braced for a snowstorm and cold front, city executives made the decision to keep students home from school for a day and instead use the Brooklyn facility to house migrants during the storm.
Mayor Eric Adams has repeatedly begged governors in border states to stop bussing migrants to NYC, where locals in midtown have been horrified for close to a year at the number of migrants being semi-housed in formerly expensive cosmopolitan hotels.
'We're getting close to anywhere from 2,500 to peaking at 4,000 a week,' Adams said recently in an interview, during which he also proclaimed in no uncertain terms that NYC in 'out of room' for the incoming migrants.
'We were not just saying we're out of room as a soundbite,' Adams answered, citing the more than 161,000 migrants who have arrived and sought city aid since spring 2022.
'We're out of room, literally', the Democrat declared. 'People are going to be eventually sleeping on the streets.'"

On Sunday, Baldwin was pictured zipping up his jacket while walking outside with his children in the Hamptons, just days after his indictment.
The 65-year-old appeared sullen wearing a navy puffer, black shirt, dark pants and sneakers as he braved the cold.
On Saturday, he posted on Instagram a video of the beach in Montauk, but nothing about the indictment. PEOPLE magazine reported the new involuntary manslaughter charges  have been 'frustrating' and 'very stressful' for the actor and his wife Hilaria.
A source said, 'They had a great Christmas and New Year. Hilaria also just turned 40. This is not how they wanted to start the new year.'

The indictment was returned on Friday and charges Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter for the 2021 set shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins (pictured)
'It's stressful for Hilaria. It's frustrating for them both that Alec is being recharged. They knew there was a possibility there would be a new indictment. The back and forth is hard. It's very stressful.'
Hilaria was spotted in New York City on Friday, keeping a low profile in sunglasses and a long black winter coat, the day the charges were announced.
The indictment was returned on Friday and charges Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter on the grounds of negligent use of a firearm and disregard for others' safety.
If convicted, Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison.
In a statement, Baldwin's attorneys Alex Spiro and Luke Nikas said: 'We look forward to our day in court.'
Gloria Allred, the attorney for Halyna's parents and sister, said in a statement: 'Our clients have always sought the truth about what happened on the day that Halyna Hutchins was tragically shot and killed on October 21, 2021.
'They continue to seek the truth in our civil lawsuit for them and they also would like there to be accountability in the criminal justice system.
'The grand jury has decided that there is sufficient evidence to indict Alec Baldwin on the charge of involuntary manslaughter.
'We are looking forward to the criminal trial which will determine if he should be convicted for the untimely death of Halyna.'
On October 21, 2021, Baldwin was filming a scene inside a church when he pulled the trigger on his Colt .45 revolver and fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
He's insisted that the gun fired spontaneously, as he struck director Joel Souza in the shoulder before he shot Hutchins.
Hutchins was taken to the hospital where she was later pronounced dead.
Baldwin was interviewed by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office following her death, as he showed tremendous emotions for his actions.
If convicted, Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison. In a statement, Baldwin's attorneys Alex Spiro and Luke Nikas said: 'We look forward to our day in court'

He was initially charged in January 2023 by First Judicial District Attorney of New Mexico Mary Carmack-Altwies, who launched her own media tour soon after filing charges.
Baldwin's team interpreted her enthusiasm for the case as a fame-hungry effort to boost her own career.
After hashing it out with his team in the court of public opinion, Carmack-Altwies stepped down from the case and a special prosecutor was appointed to take over.
In April last year, that team opted to drop the charges and Baldwin, who had already settled a wrongful death lawsuit launched by Hutchins' family, breathed a momentary sigh of relief.
Baldwin has always maintained that he followed gun safety laws, and that the fault lies with the armorer or crew who handed him a gun loaded with a live round."

The Alamance-Burlington School System announced this week that Southern Alamance Middle School had mirrors removed from its hallway bathrooms to reduce distractions.
The move came as the school officials observed many students using bathrooms seven or eight times a day, and in many cases, during class.
'Students were going to the bathroom for long periods of time and making TikTok videos,' Les Atkins, the public relations officer for ABSS, told WFMY News.
The removal of mirrors has proven to be effective so far, as school officials noticed fewer visits to the bathroom and students spending less time there.

'Since removing the mirrors, we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos,' Atkins said.
'[The school saw] not as many visits to the bathroom, and [students] not staying as long.' he said.
'And students are held accountable. When there's accountability, you see a great difference,' he added.
The school district also implemented Smart Pass, a digital hall pass system, to allow students to check in and out when they leave classrooms.
The system is part of the school's existing software; therefore, it won't add extra costs to the district.
'We strive to limit distractions so students can focus on learning. Though this is an adjustment, we believe these changes will foster a better learning environment by minimizing disruptions,' the school district said.

Parents and social media users support the school's approach, noting that there are too many distractions for middle school students.
A mother of a 12-year-old boy wrote: 'Am I the only mean parent of a middle schooler who won’t let them have a smart phone?'
She added that her son is using a Nokia, which 'has prevented a lot of issues.' She added, 'Why does a kid need anything more than the ability to place a phone call during an emergency while at school?'
Another person chimed in: 'Middle school age kids have no reason to even need a phone at school. It’s one big distraction.'
They said: 'I’m not saying they can’t have a phone. It should be treated as a reward or privilege rather. Give it to them when they get home from school as a reward for working hard at school. Problem solved.'
Other social media users offered their solutions, with one saying: 'I know a substitute that has the rule of in order to go to the bathroom they have to turn in their phone. They get it back when they return.'"

At the time, Amanda said: 'Lexi was approached last year and obviously we were waiting until she was 16 to sign anything.
'It's something she actually wants to do, so I'm taking the lead from her. She's a very quiet girl but she knows her own mind. She's very bright and wants to continue her studies.

Speaking on her Heart FM Breakfast Show with Jamie Theakston and Ashley Roberts, the trio discussed whether they would allow their kids on the show.
Ashley asked: 'Would you ever let your kids go on Love Island?' causing Amanda and Jamie to quickly shut down the idea: 'No! Absolutely not.'
Amanda continued: 'No way, my daughter’s 18 next year. It's just another way of being famous, isn't it really? It's not really about love. It's just about looking hot and just getting involved.
'It's just amazing telly, but it's not really for love so I don't want my daughter anywhere near it'.
Jamie replied: 'You don't go on that show to find love. Do you know what I mean? It's just manipulative'.

The clip has already been seen by more than 115,000 people, with commenters chiming in with their own opinions.
She captioned the TikTok: 'So many European destinations are hyped up excessively, but this is just my opinion so 100% go make your own mind up and tell me what you think! Which one’s do you wanna fight me on?'
An Australian travel influencer has taken to TikTok to share her most overrated and underrated destinations in Europe
Jacki, who posts under the handle @jetsetting_jacki , regularly makes videos for her 23,000 followers, featuring travel tips for different locations
Paris
Kicking off Jacki's overrated list is none other than the capital of France.
She admitted: 'So, honest opinion, I absolutely hate Paris.
'I've been to the city three times now and I felt unsafe. It was dirty, the people weren't very nice.
'I just did not enjoy my time in Paris at all and that is why it is on my overrated European places list'.
One viewer agreed: 'Paris is under-hated [sic] and overrated,' meanwhile a second insisted: 'I love Paris…you cannot change my mind. Certain areas over-hyped for sure, but it’s still a beautiful city'.
Amsterdam
She continues: 'Next, a bit controversial but joining Paris on the list is Amsterdam and I just thought the partying there was pretty overrated.
'It just was not as good as people hyped it up to be and yes, I know there are a few things that are legal there, that aren't legal in other places, but it just didn't make up for it - I don't know'.
However, commenters argued back on this one, with: 'Amsterdam is amazing, just avoid the tourist places after the first day' and 'Amsterdam is the best city I have been to'.
A third pleaded: 'Amsterdam is the best city in the world. You should give it another chance!'
In a recent video, she listed five places for each category and gave her reasons why - but not everyone agrees
Mykonos
Third on the list is a place that the influencer describes as 'totally overrated' and says she 'wouldn't even bother going' - Mykonos.
Jacki explained: I don't know if this is just because I am so in love with Ios but Mykonos was so expensive.
'It was busy, the people were really s***** and thought they were like amazing because they were in Mykonos and better than you.'
She added: 'Music was also s*** and the guys were so creepy, like so creepy'.
Magaluf
Fourth on the list is a popular British holiday destination, best known for it's wild nightlife - Magaluf.
The travel pro explained: 'Oh my God, I thought I was gonna be old going into it but I have never felt older in my life than going to Magaluf.
'I've heard really good things about the rest of Mallorca so maybe I need to go back and go there, but Magaluf was the trashiest, most disgusting place I've ever been'.
Commenters joked: 'How did Magaluf make this list?' and 'Who’s rating Magaluf?,' alongside laughing emojis.
A third wrote: 'Magaluf is well known across Europe as somewhere to not go - grimy and full of under-agers, it’s definitely not rated highly'.
Island of Capri
The final destination on Jacki's overrated list is the Italian island of Capri, located within the Bay of Naples.
She revealed: 'I do like it here on the island of Capri, it's beautiful, I've been twice now.
'But it's so busy and it's so tiny and all the shops and things are just so expensive.
'Like, I can't afford to be there - I think if you were rich and you had like a sugar daddy it'd be amazing'.
Sicily
Moving on to her five most underrated destinations, the TikToker named the Italian region of Sicily.
She reminisced: 'I went there a few years ago and I can't wait to go back.
'It was amazing, it was cheap, it was beautiful, way less tourists'.
One viewer agreed: 'Sicily is fantastic, amazing beaches and fantastic hidden gem villages'.
However, a different commenter argued: 'Went to Palermo Sicily in 2002, biggest dump I've been to'.
Another penned: 'Sicily is one of the poorest regions in Italy and there's almost nothing to see and do unless you just wanna stay all day long at the beach or eat pasta, a big no for me'.
Scandinavia
Jacki continues: 'Next, Scandinavia. I feel like a lot of Australians don't put this on their Europe itinerary but I spent six months studying in Sweden and it was amazing guys.
'I loved it there - I did Copenhagen, Norway, all of them were amazing.
'The only place I didn't love was Helsinki, but other than that, everything was so much fun'.
Although, viewers were quick to point out that Finland is not part of Scandinavia.
Another traveller chimed in with: 'Scandinavia is nice but don’t go to Oslo. So expensive and not that different to Gothenburg or Stockholm'.
Meanwhile, someone else argued: 'How are you bunching in Scandinavia as one place? It’s multiple countries'.
Malta
Third, she talks about Malta - famous for it's beautiful coastline and breathtaking landscapes.
Jacki revealed: 'Malta is literally one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.
'The beaches were stunning, the partying was really fun as well and I feel like it's still a little bit quieter than some other European destinations'.
Viewers had similar experiences, adding: 'Malta is a hidden gem, it’s a beautiful place. Going back this year' and 'Malta is amazing'.
Others wrote: 'Malta is the best' and 'Malta is my favourite place'.

San Sebastian
Fourth on the content creators underrated last is the Spanish city of San Sebastian.
She told viewers: 'Literally some of the best food I've ever eaten in my whole life - you have to go.
'It was so beautiful, it was chill, it was fun'.
Agreeing, a fellow fan penned: 'Agree on San Sebastian,  it’s the best. I could easily live there - good vibe, beaches, mountains close by, food is amazing'.
A second praised: 'San Sebastian is the nicest City in Europe, best food by a country mile'.
Iceland
Finally, the travel pro talks about Iceland, despite never having been there.
She explained: 'This is one that I haven't been to but I know it will be literally incredible and that is Iceland.
'I feel like a lot of people don't put this on their bucket list but it looks insane and I just know I'm gonna love it'.
But others believe it should have been on the overrated list, with one user writing: 'Iceland is a bit overrated, underrated really is Baltics the people there are amazing'.
Another agreed: 'Iceland is not underrated, it’s so popular now'."

Thomas Massie says campaign 'never had high expectations' for New Hampshire just two days before primary,"Katelyn Caralle, U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.com","Published: 19:19 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 19:19 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989327/The-REAL-fight-South-Carolina-Ron-DeSantis-surrogate-Rep-Thomas-Massie-says-campaign-never-high-expectations-New-Hampshire-just-two-days-primary.html,"Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) dismissed concerns over how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis might perform in New Hampshire in Tuesday's primary election, noting that there were 'never high expectations' in the first-in-the-nation state.
For weeks the DeSantis campaign has assured the governor plans to stay in the race through at least after the South Carolina primaries in late February.
But strategists have now determined that the Florida Governor is hoping Haley will perform poorly in South Carolina, drop out and turn the primary into a two-person race between DeSantis and former President Donald Trump.
'We never had high expectations for New Hampshire anyway,' Rep. Massie told Fox News Sunday. 'And Nikki's exploiting, you know, a quirk of their primary, which is that undeclareds – i.e. Democrats – can vote in a Republican primary.'
Rep. Thomas Massie, a top surrogate for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said Sunday that 'the real fight is in South Carolina' in downplaying concerns over how the 2024 hopeful will perform on Tuesday
Gov. DeSantis is in New Hampshire campaigning but some have criticized the campaign over spending more focus on South Carolina – specifically after he flew directly there after Iowa's caucuses earlier this month
Along with left-leaning independent voters who plan to cast their ballot for Haley, there is a mass write-in campaign from Democrats who are looking to put Joe Biden's name down during Tuesday's primary election.
Haley is polling second in New Hampshire, with other surveyed earlier this month putting her within single-digits of Trump – and one poll showing them in a tie with 40 percent each.
Two polls released on Sunday from Suffolk/Boston Globe and CNN put Trump in first by about 20 points, Haley in second and DeSantis in third with 6 percent support among Republican New Hampshire voters.
'You know, I'll be going to New Hampshire later today,' Massie said. 'But the real fight, I think, is in South Carolina. And that's where Nikki Haley, I think, stumbles'
'She's going to miss expectations and not even win her own state,' the DeSantis surrogate predicted.
DeSantis' team is banking on Haley doing poorly in her home state of South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011-2017 before joining Trump's administration.

South Carolina is holding the fourth Republican primary contest on Saturday, February 24 – almost exactly a month of the New Hampshire primary election. The Palmetto State is the last of the early primary states for Republicans and could be a make-or-break moment for DeSantis and Haley.
Candidates are expected to turn attention to Nevada after New Hampshire for the primary and caucus there before heading back to South Carolina.
Then 15 states will all vote in their respective primaries on March 5, 2024 in what is known as Super Tuesday."

The 35-year-old shared an old video of himself to Instagram which showed the shocking moment he flashed his genitals at a Jetstar plane as it landed.
Stripping completely naked as his buddies laughed in the background, the reality star could be seen standing on a boat as he waved at the plane.
Without an ounce of shame, Ryan stood with his legs spread and his privates in the wind while the aircraft touched down right near him on the landing strip.
'8 years ago today I gave everyone another reason not to fly Jetstar, this is why they make you open the shades before landing,' the father-of-one captioned his post.

Meteorologists warn of showers, fog and the accumulation of ice on slick surfaces that may complicate the Monday morning commute.
'The greatest wintry concern for next week will be for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast,' AccuWeather Meteorologist Dean DeVore said.
Over 120 million Americans were under winter weather alerts Friday and the National Weather Service warned of wind chill in several states including New York, Illinois, Georgia and Louisiana over the weekend.
Weather-related deaths surged over the last week, with most reported in Tennessee and Oregon.
A January thaw is setting in across the United States following an Arctic blast that left 61 dead (pictured: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, blanketed in snow and ice Thursday)
Over 120 million Americans were under winter weather alerts Friday (pictured: people walk through Central Park in New York City)
As weather systems shift, areas of fog and patchy rain may complicate travel in the Southeast (pictured: a snow-covered street in Florence, Alabama)
Now a thaw looms ahead for much of the country. Following sub-zero conditions Sunday morning, temperatures in Chicago may climb into the 30s each day from Monday to Wednesday.
Similarly, a low-teens Saturday night in New York City will be succeeded by highs in the 40s Tuesday and Wednesday.
But this warming introduces the possibility of ice-related problems in the southern Plains and part of the Mississippi Valley.
'With the ground likely starting well below 32 Fahrenheit and in areas where snow-packed roads and sidewalks remain, any moisture from fog or rain can cause sheets of clear ice to develop,' DeVore explained.
The NWS issued a Hard Freeze Warning in Louisiana and Mississippi through Sunday morning, urging residents to take steps to protect tender plants and outdoor pipes.
States from Texas to Illinois remain under the threat of icy rain, which can freeze and build on exposed surfaces.
Much of the Midwest and western U.S. were anticipated to see precipitation Sunday, according to the National Weather Service
Part of the zone from central and eastern Texas to western Tennessee is expected to see four to six inches of rain next week. (pictured: a child and his father enjoy the snow in Oak Ridge, Tennessee)
Precipitation and ice patches are expected to pose a risk for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast next week (pictured: snow falls Friday in Philadelphia)
A surge of moisture will trigger rain, ice and snow from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast from Monday night to Wednesday (pictured: the ground in Acworth, New Hampshire, blanketed in snow)
Illinois is under a Winter Weather Advisory through Monday afternoon as freezing rain sweeps into the area, leading to total ice accumulations of up to 1/10th of an inch.
It may take until Monday night for conditions to improve in much of the state.
'Icy conditions are likely to impact the Monday morning commute and could impact the evening commute as well,' the NWS warned.
The agency issued a lengthy advisory in North Carolina warning of an Arctic cold wave lasting across the central portion of the state through the weekend.
Residents are encouraged to limit their time outside, layer up and check on those who may be more susceptible to the chill, like the elderly.
A surge of moisture will trigger rain, ice and snow from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast from Monday night to Wednesday.
Localized pockets of ice are anticipated to impact regions of northeast Texas to Michigan and Pennsylvania, while significant icing may occur Sunday night from southeast Oklahoma into central Missouri.
Most of the precipitation in the Northeast will likely fall north of Interstate 80, but pockets of ice are possible farther south through the Appalachians.
Several inches of snow are forecast in the northern tier of the Great Lakes and into the Northeast Monday night into Wednesday

Forecasters predict a surge of moisture will trigger rain, ice and snow from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast from Monday night to Wednesday (a man shovels snow in Indianapolis)
To complicate matters in the Northeast, an Arctic cold air front will cross southern Canada over the next few days. Several inches of snow are forecast in the northern tier of the Great Lakes and into the Northeast Monday night into Wednesday.
In regions along the Ohio River, the simple action of milder air flowing over cold ground may produce fog, clouds and 'ground sweat' even if it is not raining.
Patches of ice may develop on colder, untreated surfaces due to the condensation, and areas of fog and patchy rain may complicate travel in the Southeast.
NWS Memphis issued a Special Weather Statement Saturday, urging extreme caution for commuters.
'Lingering frozen precipitation on area roads and temperatures below freezing will continue to result in black ice across the area through Sunday morning,' the advisory read.
There is more precipitation on the horizon, as AccuWeather data suggests that part of the zone from central and eastern Texas to western Tennessee may pick up four to six inches of rain next week.
This is enough to cause flooding even in drought areas, but it may also cause secondary river levels to rise significantly."

But on Saturday, he was given internal polling data that showed he had no chance of winning the state and would finish far behind former President Donald Trump, according to two sources familiar with discussions.
His aides canceled appearances on the Sunday morning shows as they debated what to do next.
And on Sunday afternoon, the Florida governor formally pulled the plug on his 2024 campaign.
'I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources, if we don't have a clear path to victory,' he said.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis surprised many by stepping away from New Hampshire to campaign in South Carolina over the weekend. He is seen here carrying his daughter Mamie while his eldest daughter Madison yawns and his son Mason watches ahead of an event in Myrtle Beach
The decision took donors and staff at a super PAC backing DeSantis by surprise.
They were traveling to New Hampshire as part of the last push before voters in the state made their decision.
But his prospects there were bleak.
A poll published Sunday morning found he was on course for just six percent of the vote, behind Trump on 50 percent and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on 39 points.
He was already digesting difficult numbers from South Carolina, where he had hoped to get his campaign back on track and where he campaigned at the weekend.
'I think that was the reason for the timing,' said a source familiar with discussions.
A second source close to the DeSantis camp told DailyMail.com: 'They were struggling to explain what the path to the nomination would even look like. That's how bad things were.'
The announcement came hours after Trump had delivered his own South Carolina show of strength.
Standing on stage before thousands of people at an arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump was joined by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster; Pamela Evette, the state's lieutenant governor; Alan Wilson, the state's attorney general; South Carolina House Speaker Murrell Smith; and Curtis Loftis, the state treasurer.
Recent polls showed DeSantis on only five or six percent in New Hampshire, finishing a distant third to former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley
DeSantis posed for selfies with supporters in Myrtle Beach Saturday
They were joined by three U.S. congressmen from the state: Reps. Russell Fry, William Timmons and Joe Wilson.
It was designed to try to knock Haley from the race, demonstrating her lack of support in her own state. It may have also reminded DeSantis of the uphill struggle he faced.
When it came, the decision took DeSantis world by surprise.
'We had people heading up to New Hampshire as this was happening,' said a staffer at Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis.
With the South Carolina primary not until February 24, he said donors were probably getting anxious about the financial outlay needed to even be competitive.
'They were probably looking at the prospect of having to pay everybody through South Carolina or let people go,' he said.
'That's still a month away. And so that was probably a big factor.'
DeSantis had once been seen as the next big political star of the Republican Party.

DeSantis' decision leaves Trump opposition to coalesce around Haley, but she faces an uphill battle to rein in the clear Republican frontrunner
He won a crushing reelection as Florida governor in November 2022. But he delayed launching his campaign until May, effectively giving Trump a six-month headstart.
His operation was bedeviled by internal turmoil, and constant headlines about tension between his campaign and Never Back Down.
Senior personnel were reshuffled and staff laid off as he struggled for traction in the polls.
Dan Eberhart, one of his donors, said his biggest problem was going up against Trump.
'I'm not shocked,' he said about Sunday's announcement. 'I think Trump is a generational figure and normal politicians struggle to get the oxygen to compete against him.'
Eberhart said he heard the news while en route to New Hampshire.
'He doesn't want to come in third against Nikki Haley,' he said. 'And it's all about preserving 2028 viability.'
Poll after poll showed that DeSantis was the second choice of many Trump supporters but simply could not lure support away from the former president.
And among attendees at Trump's Manchester rally on Saturday evening, many said they wished DeSantis had stood aside for Trump.
'If he would have just waited four years ... ' said Steven Apfel, 30, who accused DeSantis of disloyalty by challenging Trump.
'He was like the heir apparent and why he did that just goes to show how he's part of the establishment.'"
A3RGX39W74_BSEBGVFWM9STZFW,From Speedos to an alarm clock: Soldiers reveal the VERY unusual items they hide in their iconic bearskin hats as campaigners demand they are replaced with fake fur,Megan Howe,"Published: 13:32 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 16:42 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988751/Kings-Guard-bearskin-caps-Speedos-hiding-alarm-clock-fright.html,"Former King's Guards have revealed how the tall bearskins worn by guardsmen are 'multi-purpose' - and could be concealing something from public view.
In letters to The Times, Michael Scott, formerly of the Scots Guards and William McLean, formerly of the Coldstream Guards, Eyton on Severn, in Shropshire, have revealed what they used to hide under their bearskin caps.
Mr Scott recalled having to carry a pair of wet speedos under his hat, while Mr McLean was given a fright after a fellow soldier hid an alarm clock under his bareskin.
It comes as animal rights organisation PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has campaigned for the caps' fur to be replaced with a synthetic substitute since 2002, condemning the MoD's alleged 'support for the slaughter of Canadian black bears'.

The hats, which can be traced back to the Napoleonic wars, were worn by every gunner in the British and French military to make them appear taller and more intimidating.
Members of Napoleon's imperial guard wore the caps to mark their high status and when British forces defeated Napoleon's at the Battle of Waterloo, they took the hats as trophies. Nowadays, the use of the bearskin cap has been adopted by all Foot Guards for ceremonial purposes.
Writing in The Times newspaper, Mr Scott revealed: 'When on King's Guard at St James's Palace, two officers out of the three on duty are allowed to swim in the Royal Automobile Club's indoor pool in Pall Mall.
'To go there they must be properly dressed in bearskin, tunic and sword. But not, obviously, allowed to carry a parcel.'
Instead, Mr Scott, said guardsmen must take their bathing suits with them and subsequently 'secrete their Speedos' inside their bearskin caps for the journey back, which he admitted could sometimes 'present problems'.
Mr McLean recalled a time when he was doing his first guard at the Tower of London and was carrying out his tour of the sentries in the early hours.
'It was eerily quiet, the mist swirling up from the Thames through Traitors' Gate; visions of beheaded corpses popping up from behind a turret were close to mind', he said in The Times.
Eager to 'test his steadiness', he said, a fellow officer  hid a small alarm clock in his bearskin and as he walked around Traitor's Gate the alarm went off, giving him a fright.
Mr McLean added: 'It was good training for a tour six months later in South Armagh at the height of the Troubles.'

PETA threatened the MoD with legal action in 2022 in a row over replacing the King's Guards' bearskin caps with a faux fur alternative.
The MoD pledged to drop fur once an alternative was found, but recently said 'no faux fur meets the standards to provide an effective replacement'.
However, PETA say they have worked with luxury faux furrier ECOPEL to develop a suitable material that is waterproof and mimics real bear fur in both appearance and performance.
But the MoD has claimed that 'whilst faux fur samples have been presented for testing in the past, to date, and to the Department's knowledge, no faux fur sample has been produced which meets the standards required to provide an effective replacement for the bearskin ceremonial caps.'
In a letter to PETA in November 2023, the MoD's equipment team defended the use of fur and said: 'The furs used by the MOD are only procured via local Canadian suppliers with a 'Furmark' accreditation.
'This is a global certification and traceability system for natural furs that guarantees animal welfare and environmental standards, and in turn, ensures the ethical sourcing and sustainability of the fur.'

Members of the public take pictures of King's Guard soldiers marching outside Buckingham Palace during Queen Elizabeth funeral ceremonies in central London Monday, Sept. 19, 2022
But campaigners suggested the accreditation is just 'another attempt at greenwashing'. In 2021, Respect for Animals concluded in a report: 'Furmark® - the fur industry's 'certification', traceability and labelling scheme - lacks transparency and credibility and fails to address the environmental impacts of the fur industry.'
Senior Campaigns Manager Kate Werner said: 'Instead of aligning with the values and morals of the British public, who reject fur, and with the example set by the late Queen Elizabeth when she refused to buy fur for her wardrobe, the MoD is aligning itself with an accreditation scheme that attempts to greenwash and justify the slaughter of majestic bears.
'PETA urges the MoD to end its complicity with bear slaughter and fully evaluate the faux bear fur so it can be quick-marched into service.'
In October 2023, the group laid 498 cut outs to represent the Canadian black bears killed since PETA and ECOPEL made their faux fur offer in 2017.
A 2022 poll revealed that three quarters of voters considered bearskin caps - which have cost the taxpayer around £1million since 2015 - a 'bad use of government funds', with each cap costing £1,710."

Cabinet Office Minister John Glen has launched a review of Whitehall system that is set to force mandarins to carry out 'network activities' in their own time - before and after the working day, or in their lunch hour.
In an interview with the Telegraph he said departments had made 'significant progress in making itself representative of the country it serves'.
But ahead of a speech on Tuesday he added that there needed o be more focus on  'the core mission of the Civil Service'.
'We feel a responsibility, given that we're talking about what taxpayers' money is being spent on,' he said.
'People want to know that civil servants are spending their time on their primary job, not on network activities.'
The former management consultant, who was a middle ranking Treasury minister before being reshuffled last year, added: 'When I was in the private sector, these activities were things that we did at breakfast before we started work and in the evenings, and that to me is where the orientation of these things should be headed.'

But ahead of a speech on Tuesday he added that there needed o be more focus on 'the core mission of the Civil Service'.
However, FDA union general secretary Dave Penman hit out at the plans.
'This is the language of the ''enemy within'',' he said.
'Ministers pandering to an agenda demonising the civil service as a ''leftist wokerati'', undermining the will of the government. It's leadership by rhetoric, not reality, and only serves to undermine the people needed to transform our public services.'
Last week No10 scrapped plans to beef up rules for civil servants to prevent them from blocking Rwanda deportation flights.
Illegal migration minister Michael Tomlinson said the Government was considering tweaking the Civil Service code in the wake of concerns raised by the Tory Right.
Hardliners have suggested mandarins could hinder efforts to get aircraft off the ground if ministerial orders clash with rulings from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
However, after his remarks sparked a back lash from trade unions, the Prime Minister's spokesman said that new 'guidance' would be sent to the Home Office providing 'clarity' for staff.
Speaking to the Telegraph Mr Glen added: 'I expect and believe that civil servants will do their job as per the will of Parliament … I don't have any concerns because I believe that the Civil Service are (sic) professional and will follow the instructions of the legislation and the ministers that they are working under.'
However, addressing those who might have 'difficulties' with the law, he added that 'you live in a free society, there are other options available'."

Chris Sununu insists his preferred candidate Nikki Haley doesn't have to win his state to become the Republican presidential nominee.
Sununu told NBC's Meet the Press that New Hampshire's Tuesday primary is not 'make or break' for Haley after a poll released on Sunday shows her trailing former President Donald Trump by 19 percentage points.
The Granite State governor and top campaign surrogate also questioned whether Trump is mentally fit to serve another White House term after he appeared to confuse Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
New Hampshire voters are heading to the polls Tuesday, January 23 for the first-in-the-nation Republican primary election following Iowa's caucuses earlier this month.
Nikki Haley is looking to perform better in New Hampshire after a disappointing third-place finish in Iowa with 19.1 percent of the vote.

A few polls earlier this month put Haley within one-digit of Trump and one even put them in a dead tie with 40 percent each. Sununu says this is already a big feat with Trump's massive lead and hold over GOP voters and says even coming within the former president in Tuesday's election would be a massive win.
'Is this make or break for her to stay in this race?' NBC Meet the Press host Kristen Welker asked Sununu during a Sunday morning interview.
'No, no. She doesn't have to win,' Sununu replied. 'I mean, look, nobody goes from single digits in December to 'you absolutely have to win' in January. I think that's a media expectation that's being set out there.'
'The fact that it can happen at all, right? Trump said he was going to run the table and win all 50 states. And everyone said, 'Yep, it's a done deal.' It's not a done deal,' he added. 'She's challenging him here, and now she, again, gets to go to her home state where she's won a lot before, she knows how to do it on the ground.'
He said that Haley has a while until the primary in South Carolina, where she served as the first female governor from 2011-2017 before joining Trump's administration as his Ambassador to the United Nations. She has not ruled out running on the 2024 ticket as Trump's vice presidential candidate.
Sununu claims that in the weeks before South Carolina, Haley can make up ground even if she doesn't perform well in New Hampshire or Nevada.
'Nikki's going to have a lot of time to build on the momentum she's already created,' he insisted.
In an argument against Trump's candidacy, Sununu said he agrees with Haley when saying Trump is no longer fit to serve as president.
'Is Donald Trump mentally fit to serve as president?' Welker asked.
'Look, whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump, either one get off the teleprompter, they can barely make a cogent point,' Sununu replied.
She pushed: 'So is Trump mentally fit? You're saying he's not?'
'Not in that moment, he sure as heck wasn't,' Sununuy said. 'I mean, look, the point is you have two nearly 80-year-olds fighting this thing out. That's not what America wants. That is a great example of – this is not Donald Trump, the disruptor of 2016.'
'This guy has lost his fastball. You know, that's a great example of it,' the New Hampshire governor said. 'We always want to go forward in America, right? We always want that next generation. Neither of these guys represent the next generation.'
During a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire on Saturday, Trump touted his mental fitness
During a rally in New Hampshire, Trump appeared to confuse Haley with Pelosi in talking about the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.
'By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley – did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything. Deleted it, destroyed all of it – all of it – because of lots of things,' Trump said to thousands of his supporters.
'Like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered her 10,000 people – soldiers, National Guard soldiers – whatever she wanted.'
It appears Trump meant to reference Pelosi, who was House Speaker at the time of the riots at the U.S. Capitol and who the former president has repeatedly blamed for being in charge of security that day.
Haley tried to downplay her criticism of Trump, but did say that the latest gaffe is proof the 77-year-old is not fit to serve any longer.
'I'm not saying anything derogatory, but when you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this,' Haley said Saturday while campaigning in New Hampshire.
'I wasn't even in DC on January 6. I wasn't in office then,' she added. 'They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he was talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.'"

Detectives believe at least two people were involved in the brutal attack of Eddie Kinuthia (pictured) who was knifed to death in St Pauls, Bristol, on July 21, 2023

Eddie with his mother Irene Muthemba - the 19-year-old teenager was called 'the heart of the community' in the days after his death
Regional manager Karen MacDonald said: 'Our deepest sympathy for all of Eddie's family and friends.
'It would have been his 20th birthday on 22 January. It's clear how popular Eddie was to those who knew and loved him.
'They can do with our support at this time, six months after his tragic murder.
'We know that there were people present at the time of this appalling attack who have not yet come forward.'
A vigil was held for the victim four days after the attack, with friends and family calling the teenager 'the heart of the community'.
Wishes and prayers were written on a balloon which floated into the sky and dozens of flowers were left outside his home.
Lorna Da'Angel, a family friend, told BBC News: 'The whole community loved him - a happy, caring and kind young lad,
'What happened to him should not have happened - I wish we could see him again.'
Ms MacDonald added: 'Speaking up about crime can be scary so our charity understands why there can be a reluctance to come forward.
'With Crimestoppers, you can make a difference by passing on what you know whilst being protected by our guarantee of anonymity.
'That means no police, no courts, no witness statements.
'Put simply, when you contact our charity online or on the phone, there's no comeback.

BR2XJM3YFN_ILFCJHIU3NXOC2V,Perth entrepreneur builds $1.3million business at just 23 years old with her unique jewellery brand Eyes On You Co,Louise Allingham For Daily Mail Australia,"Published: 02:16 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 08:43 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/real-life/article-12976765/Perth-entrepreneur-builds-million-business-Eyes-unique-jewellery-brand.html,"A young businesswoman has built her small jewellery company to bring in a six-figure revenue in just three years.
Zahra Alhashimy, from Perth, started her accessories business Eyes On You Co while juggling part-time work at David Jones and studying commerce at university.
The 23-year-old wanted to create a line of high-quality waterproof jewellery in sentimental styles she designs herself.
Zahra started the business overnight using $2,000 of her savings and within three months was selling hundreds of units thanks to her viral TikTok videos attracting more and more shoppers.
She told FEMAIL, since launching in September of 2020, Eyes On You Co has made $1.3million in sales and has become one of the biggest homegrown jewellery brands in Western Australia.
'I feel so blessed to even have this be my job because I'm constantly able to express my art. I had no idea it was going to take such an amazing turn,' she said.

The 23-year-old wanted to create a line of high-quality waterproof jewellery in sentimental styles she designs herself
Zahra knew she hit it big when Eyes On You Co received hundreds of orders making more than $70,000 in just two days.
The business had been 'going steady' for months while she was posting about it on TikTok when one video blew up causing a buyer's frenzy bringing in more than 700 orders.
'My family helped me pack them up until 4am. We stayed up just packing the orders and everything. It was such a surreal moment,' she said.
The business grew exponentially after that moment and Zahra worked hard to keep things moving by setting up popup stalls around Perth which she would man full-time.
'I started doing more pop ups wanting to be more present with our customers and meet them,' she said.
'Whenever we have pop ups, it's very rare someone comes and they haven't heard of us.'
Zahra knew she had hit it big when Eyes On You Co received hundreds of orders making more than $70,000 in just two days
She then started travelling interstate to showcasing her stunning jewellery and captured the attention of influencers and style lovers across the country.
Zahra started Eyes on You Co after struggling to find high-quality 'meaningful' jewellery that didn't break the bank.
'I was such a big jewellery person I still am. I just love the process of waking up and putting on jewellery to match my outfit,' she said.
'But I found there was a gap in finding meaningful jewellery with what I wanted on it. I wanted to put something on that reminds me of things I love or that's sentimental, but without costing me thousands.'
The concept came to Zahra in the middle of the night and she got to work making her dream a reality right away.
'I went to my mum at 2am and said I have an idea, I want to start an online business focusing on meaningful jewellery that's also high quality and waterproof,' she said.
'I quite literally started the business overnight. At 3am I started making a website and looking up manufacturers and everything after my mum supported me on it.'
At the time Zahra was studying commerce at university. She landed on the major after chopping and changing degrees '10 times' in her first year.
'I found it very, very easy for me. I just had a good understanding of the concept but I just wanted to have something to use with my degree. Not just learn about marketing and only understand it at a surface level,' she said.

The business continued to grow exponentially and Zahra worked hard to keep things moving by setting up popup stalls around Perth which she would man full-time
She also had a job at David Jones and spent all her free time getting the business up and running with her $2,000 in savings.
Zahra launched Eyes on You Co in September of 2020 when she was just 19 and she started posting about her journey and jewellery on TikTok gaining the attention of millions.
'Things can turn out right even in bad situations, in ways we don't expect. Our first ever viral video got over 650,000 views but went viral because of mean comments!' she said.
'Although it hurt seeing this especially for something I had worked so hard to kick start, the publicity from it quickly turned into sales from other viewers who the video reached and the kindest comments followed shortly after.'
Just three months later, she was able to quit her job as the income from her side hustle could support her.
Zahra designs all the jewellery herself with many styles incorporating the evil eye amulet as a homage to her Iraqi heritage.
'The evil eye is found a lot of cultures, not just Middle Eastern but Greek and Mexican and heaps more. If you go through any of my TikToks, you can see people from every culture commenting so it's really nice that it ties all of us together,' she said.
'When you go to Middle East like Turkey, Iraq, where I'm from, Jordan, anywhere, it's what you see in every single jewellery store. It's a Middle Eastern love amulet people wear whether it's for the meaning or just for how beautiful it is.'

Zahra expanded the business in September 2022 by offering permanent jewellery in temporary stalls in shopping centres across Perth under the name Soldered On You.
'It was actually our customers who really wanted us to do it, we were getting messages asking 'Will you guys be able to do permanent jewellery?',' she said.
'I was scared going into it because it's a high investment. The machine cost thousands, we had to learn something new and we only had one business doing it in Perth. I wasn't sure how it was going go but I just decided to go for it.'
The sub-brand is one of Eyes On You Co's most in-demand services.
'We always have the permanent jewellery running and always get bookings every day as well as walk ins. You get people coming to get their third bracelet or ankle or buying gift cards,' Zahra said.
After running the company solo for three years, Zahra has now hired a team of seven staff allowing her to focus on the parts of the job she loves most.
'This year, specifically, I'm really looking forward to focusing on the creativity and the freedom because we have a good team now. Last year I had to do all parts of the admin. It was just me.
Zahra is not deterred by slow periods and dips in sales as they keep her motivated to come up with new ideas and ways to grow and improve the business
'Now they can take over the other parts, I'm able to put my own effort and imagination into each piece even more.'
She is not deterred by slow periods and dips in sales as they keep her motivated to come up with new ideas and ways to grow and improve the business.
'Every time I notice a drop in sales or engagement, it only gives me a push to do things better or even bring out new ideas and things to pick it back up, most of the time even stronger than before it dropped,' she said.
'If drops weren't to happen, we might not even think of those new concepts!'
This year, Zahra is also excited to set up Perth's first jewellery vending machine and is looking to start stocking her pieces in stores and boutiques around the country.
She said young Aussies wanting to start their own business should dream of and work towards growing their brand without rushing or taking too many big risks.
'Although every business owner dreams of the day they have their own warehouse, a big team, and sales coming through consistently, it's not always the best option to do those things so early on unless your business is ready for it,' she advised.
'Only three years later I've been prepared and ready to bring my business into a warehouse and have a team to help me further grow my business.'"
BS2EQO3EVI_FTS0UJ1XREBPI76,"Margrethe of Denmark's abdication was 'damage control' and a 'strategic move' to make her daughter-in-law Queen and avoid 'Mary divorcing Frederik' following 'affair' rumours, claims royal expert",Jessica Green For Mailonline,"Published: 08:47 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 10:46 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12979269/Margrethe-Denmark-abdication-stop-divorce.html,"There's nothing quite like a meddling mother-in-law - and it appears even a Queen isn't above trying to interfere with her son and daughter-in-law's relationship if it arguably means it will save the future of her country's monarchy.
Or at least, that's how Queen Margrethe II's abdication in favour of her scandal-hit son Frederik, now King of Denmark, may seem to some onlookers.
For royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, the former monarch's decision to step back from her role on January 14, when her eldest became ruler following his accession to the throne, and her daughter-in-law Mary, became Queen, was 'damage control'.
Margrethe's shock abdication was announced in her New Year's Eve speech - and came after the monarchy was rocked by pictures of the King enjoying a night out with Genoveva Casanova in Madrid in November.
The Mexican socialite, 47, was forced to deny 'malicious' rumours about her friendship with the then Crown Prince - and Queen Mary has remained tight-lipped.
But Mr Madsen suggested that to secure the monarchy amid the 'affair' rumours, Margrethe was left with 'no other choice' but to abdicate to 'remove the focus' from the speculation and 'at the same time give Mary the status of Queen' to perhaps avoid 'a royal divorce scandal'.

Speaking to FEMAIL, the royal reporter claimed: 'It can be difficult to forgive alleged infidelity in a relationship unless the price for turning a blind eye is suitably high.
'Against the background of the disclosure of Frederik's visit to Madrid and the documentation of the meeting with Genoveva Casanova, it is reasonable to believe that Queen Margrethe found the time to throw out a lifeline, before the relationship between the Crown Prince couple completely cracked due to the scandal.
'The Queen actually had no other choice: in a strategic move, the monarch succeeded in removing the focus from the affair rumours, and at the same time giving Mary the hyper rare status of queen.
'A royal divorce scandal of that magnitude could break the strongest royal house forever.
'The risk that the popularity and reputation the Queen has built up during her 52 years as monarch could be destroyed forever if she had not done damage control on the matter.'
Potential tensions possibly still in Frederik and Mary's marriage were revealed after they shared an awkward public kiss on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace after becoming King and Queen on January 14.
Body language expert Adrianne Carter told FEMAIL: 'When Mary joins Frederik we initially see quite a distance between the two of them as they hold hands, he moves closer which she accepts. A literal distance can often mean a distance in a relationship.
'When the children join them, they all move in together. Mary encompasses her children showing that's her important focus.'

However, when the King pulls Mary close as the children leave the balcony - the Queen is 'the first to pull away'.
Giving her interpretation of the footage, she continued: 'Frederik pulls her in for a kiss, which he tries to do a few times before it actually happens. This is something he has planned, rather than something spontaneous.'

Adrianne also noted that when Frederik tries to kiss Mary on the side of the forehead, she 'doesn't react in any way; she just accepts'.
The body language expert mused whether Frederik is 'still in the dog house' after rumours of an alleged affair with Mexican socialite Genoveva.
Adrianne said: 'We see Frederik pull in Mary and plant a kiss on the side of her forehead. She doesn't react in any way; she just accepts. Is Frederik still in the dog house I wonder?'
Margrethe shocked the nation and many royal watchers around the world when she used her annual New Year's Eve speech to announce live on television that she was stepping down as Queen after 52 years.
But timing of her abdication has raised questions, as it comes months after her son Frederik hit the headlines for his night out with Genoveva, who has since denied any suggestion of an 'affair' between the two.
In her address the 83-year-old said she had taken stock after undergoing back surgery last year and had decided it was it was time 'to leave the responsibility to the next generation' - namely her eldest son.
But speculation has continued to mount that the decision was made to keep Frederik's wife of 19 years, Mary, who is extremely popular with the public, on side.
Australian-born Mary has won over the Danish public with her dedication to royal duty and her fluency in the language, with a recent poll finding 85 per cent of Danes have a positive opinion of the 51-year-old.
Her husband is also similarly popular, having turned his public image around from being a rebel tearaway and party boy during his youth to becoming a 'woke' family man.
The abdication means Mary, who first met Frederik at a pub in Sydney, has now become the world's first Australian-born queen.
The Danish royal family yesterday appeared in a stunning new family portrait for the first time since their crowning (Pictured left to right: Princess Isabella, 16, Crown Prince Christian, 18, King Frederik, 55, and Queen Mary of Denmark, 51, twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 13)

She was working as an advertising executive when she first met Frederik in a packed city pub 23 years ago and had no idea the handsome European tourist she had been chatting to for hours was actually the future king of Denmark.
Now, married for 19 years and proud parents to four children, Mary has won her adopted country over by her dedication to royal duty and her fluency in the language.

And despite speculation about the state of the royal couple's marriage over the years, there is nothing concrete to suggest they are anything but happily married.
The pair was most recently rocked by rumours after photographs emerged of Frederik, 55, apparently enjoying a night out with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova in Madrid in October.
But despite allegations of an 'affair', Frederik and Mary have continued to put on a show of unity at various recent events.
The abdication may not come as a total shock to all: according to one source from 2021, stepping down has been on Margrethe's mind for quite some time now.
Speaking to Woman's Day, the insider explained that the royal had been slowly but surely guiding her daughter-in-law for the duties over the years.
And for several reasons, the timing for stepping down seemed appropriate.
For example, in February, Margrethe underwent a successful back surgery. 'The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,' she said in her speech.
In addition, the timing of the move has raised questions, as it comes just weeks after Frederik hit the headlines when he was pictured on a night out in Madrid with a Mexican socialite, sparking rumours of an alleged 'affair'.
Speculation is mounting that the decision was made to keep Frederik's wife of 19 years Princess Mary, who is extremely popular with the public, on side.
Princess Mary, who is set to become the nation's first Australian-born queen in a number of weeks, has won over the Danish public with her dedication to royal duty and her fluency in the language.

Her husband is also similarly popular, having turned his public image around from being a rebel tearaway and party boy during his youth to becoming a family man.
However, their relationship came under scrutiny last year when Frederik was spotted on a night out with Mexican reality star Genoveva Casanova in October.
While the Royal Household refused to comment on photos of the pair together, Genoveva issued a public statement denying any kind of romantic relationship and called the rumours 'malicious'.

Thanks to Mary's reported closeness to her mother-in-law, and her taking on advice and guidance, according to royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, Mary will 'play a very prominent role' and 'will not be an invisible queen'.
However, he also explained she may, to avoiding straying into political territory, need to be careful with initiatives around women's and children's rights abroad.
She and Frederik may also need to encompass causes Margrethe was passionate about, to expand their repertoire - 'so that it is not just the more modern topics'.
One of the trickier aspects Mary may find about being Queen is living so far from her native Australia.
While she has spent more than two decades in Denmark, her new responsibilities may mean she has less opportunity to visit home.
It is possible that Mary's new duties will affect how often she is able to visit her home in Australia.
And the royal appeared very emotional as she wrapped up her pre-Christmas break Down Under earlier this month.
Departing from Queenstown Airport in New Zealand after a four-day trip amid a visit to her native Australia, Mary appeared to wipe away a tear as she said goodbye to friends and prepared to make the journey back to Denmark.
She also shared a post about loneliness and the need for positive human connection during the festive period.
In the letter posted on the Mary Foundation website, the future queen reflected on the past year - and said she felt it was shorter than previous years.
'And at the same time, so much has happened that it is impossible to put it all into words,' she continued.
An excerpt shared on the official Instagram account for the Danish Royal House had some speculating the princess was using her foundation to hint at the affair rumours.
Meanwhile, body language expert Judi James told FEMAIL that Mary looked 'disengaged' when joining the Spanish King and Queen in Copenhagen in November. Her husband, meanwhile, appeared 'hesitant' towards his wife (pictured)
Last November, then Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik looked frosty in a photo shared by the Danish Palace, body language expert Judi James claimed
'We need each other if we are to succeed. And that's not only true in the working world and for those of us who are working to combat social isolation,' it read. 'This is true for all of us. Humans need humans.'
The touching words were shared alongside a stunning picture of the royal in the snow. She wore a purple jacket beneath a warm wool wrap and gave a soft smile towards the camera.

'The Danish royal family are lucky to have you. I hope your husband realises he has embarrassed you and his children immeasurably. You will make a fine queen,' one fan commented.
Another wrote: 'I think this is a sad year for Mary, her husband's (alleged) betrayal and it's public. What a brave woman, she can handle anything. I just adore her.'
The Danish King and his wife first met in her native Australia during the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
After an encounter at the Slip Inn, then 32-year-old Fred asked Mary, then 28, for her phone number and a romance blossomed.
'The first time we met we shook hands. I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, ""Do you know who these people are""?' Mary revealed in an interview about meeting the heir to the Danish throne.
They maintained a long-distance relationship for a year, with Frederik making secret trips Down Under before Mary moved to Denmark to study Danish language at Copenhagen's Studieskolen in 2001.
In early 2003, Frederik's mother Queen Margrethe publicly acknowledged the relationship and the couple announced their engagement at Amalienborg Castle later that year on October 8.
However, at least for now it looks like they are planning to continue living in their current residence.
Currently, Mary and her family reside in Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg.
She and Frederik took over the property from the State in 2010 - when a full refurbishment and restoration was completed after six years.
Today, it is their private residence with administrative and ceremonial functions.
They also reside at the Chancellery House at Fredensborg Palace. According to royal reporter Kenth G. Madsen, the couple will live in their current accommodation and have no plans to relocate."

Apsana Begum attacked the Conservatives just last week for having 'no solutions' to the housing crisis.
Yet she has been occupying a taxpayer-funded flat in a deprived London borough where 23,000 households are on the waiting list and desperate families face a three to six-year wait.
Left-winger Ms Begum, 33, whose MP's salary is £86,584 a year, was seen leaving her £330,000 riverside property funded by the public, typing on her phone.
The same day this month, she tweeted: 'From the NHS to housing, the Tories offer no solutions to the current crisis.'

Ms Begum moved into the flat in 2016, before she was MP, but now earns a salary of £86,584 per year and admitted two years ago that she 'probably' didn't need to live there
Ms Begum is a member of the left-wing Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs and is an ally of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn
Last night Peter Golds, her local Conservative councillor in Tower Hamlets, said: 'Well, of course there would be a very simple solution – she could lead by example and move out.
'She says she doesn't need that flat anyway, so why not give way to a family that genuinely does need it? She is so hypocritical. It is immoral that a person with an MP's salary, plus expenses, lives in publicly subsidised social housing which could and should be available to the neediest in society.'
Ms Begum moved into the block beside the Thames in March 2016 when she was a diversity officer earning about £30,000 a year. But in 2019, her salary leapt to around £80,000 when she became Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse.
In 2021, she was found not guilty of making fraudulent housing claims after being accused of using her connections as a council house adviser to jump the queue for the one-bedroom flat.
After being acquitted on all charges, she gave an interview to The Guardian in August that year.
Asked why she still had the flat, she admitted: 'I am probably in a much better position now than I was when I first contacted the council for support. So it is something that I am thinking about: is it something that I need?
'And it's probably not something that I need. It's something that I should maybe consider or think about moving on from.' The Guardian's interviewer suggested that 'an MP with an annual income nearly three times the average UK salary should not be taking social housing away from others in desperate need'.
Ms Begum moved into the block beside the Thames in March 2016 when she was a diversity officer earning about £30,000 a year
Mr Golds said there were 23,000 households on the local waiting list. The Tower Hamlets council website states: 'There is a large demand for social housing in Tower Hamlets.
'Most people who join the housing register will never be offered a social housing tenancy. Even if you qualify, you may have to wait a long time.' A table shows the waiting time for a one-bedroom flat is three to six years.
The income cap for those applying for social housing in the borough is £90,000 a year. There is no suggestion that Ms Begum has broken any rules.
According to official figures on the website of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, she was paid an 'uplift' of £4,310, known as the London Area Living Payment. MPs in the capital are entitled to this on top of their salaries.
It pushes her total income over £90,000, putting further pressure on her to explain her housing situation. Ms Begum has declined to comment."

The victims said they had enjoying a night out in London's West End when they were  set upon by a group of up to 20 men in the early hours of Sunday morning.
One of the them claimed she called the Metropolitan Police 10 times in fear for her life to be told by the operator: 'You are not the only one that called tonight'.
They said they were punched in the head and neck while the group of thugs chanted 'Free Palestine', before they were assaulted by '15 to 20 guys' - with one left needing hospital treatment for their injuries.
The Metropolitan Police is treating the attack as an 'anti-Semitic hate crime', adding it took 28 minutes for its officers to arrive at the scene.
The incident took place in Leicester Square in the early hours of Sunday, January 21. Pictured: An aerial view of people walking in Leicester Square
The vile attack took place at around 1.30am on Sunday morning as two Jewish men and one woman walked through one of Britain's busiest nightlife areas.
The woman, who gave her name as Tehilla, told the Telegraph the group were speaking Hebrew when men confronted them asking 'are you Jewish?'
The 28-year-old told the paper: 'I said 'yes, I'm Jewish,' and then they started chanting 'Free Palestine', and f*** Jews, all this kind of swearing at us.
'So we just tried not to get into trouble, to walk away, but they started following us and then all of a sudden, it started with like two or three guys, and all of a sudden, they called all their friends and 15 to 20 guys started attacking us physically.'
Tehilla, who claims she was hurt in the leg and hit on the neck, while her friends were punched in the head, added she was 'scared she was going to die'.
However, she added that when she rang the Met and told them she and her friends were being attacked because they were Jewish, police 'kept saying 'I'm sorry, it takes some time, you are not the only one that called tonight'.'
The Met Police told MailOnline that no one has yet been arrested in connection with the incident, which it is treating as a 'hate crime'.
Detective Supt Lucy O'Connor said: 'We are investigating this incident as an anti-Semitic hate crime.
'I know how upsetting such inexcusable violence is for anyone who was injured or who witnessed the incident, and also for the wider community. I share their concerns.
'Officers arrived at the scene some 28 minutes after they were called. Of course, I wish we could have come to their aid sooner.
'The police investigation will now focus on speaking with the woman and any other victims or witnesses, as well as following up all lines of enquiry including analysis of CCTV. I urge any witnesses to get in touch.
'I can assure Londoners, tackling anti-Semitic crime is a priority for the Met. There is no place for hate in our city.'
A spokesperson for the force added that police were called at 1.37am to reports woman was assaulted in the area of Leicester Square, who said she did no need an ambulance.
It said: 'The caller stated that she did not require an ambulance.
'Officers attended the location, arriving shortly after 02:00hrs, at which point all parties had left the scene.
'We understand that a woman subsequently attended hospital for treatment.
'The incident is being treated as a hate crime. Officers will speak with the victim to take a statement and identify any other victims and witnesses.
'A full investigation, which will include analysis of CCTV from the area, will be led by officers from the Met's Central West BCU.
'Any witnesses, or anyone with footage or other information that may assist police, are asked to call 101, ref 791/21jan.'"

After a Prime Minister's Questions session, the Business Secretary's staffer approached several other ministerial aides, criticised Mr Sunak's performance and suggested they should 'do something about it', a well-placed source told The Mail on Sunday.
This was seen as an 'open leadership bid' and flagged to No 10.
The approaches were made on December 6, after a PMQs in which Sir Keir Starmer was seen as having come out on top in the weekly exchange with Mr Sunak.
The source said: 'Spads [special advisers] were told – let's have our Ministers meet, we need to work out how to improve this situation.'

A second source familiar with the incident told the MoS: 'It's not clear if Kemi was aware of it or if [the aide] was freelancing. I assume she knows it was rumbled.'
Allies of Ms Badenoch have denied the claims.
The news comes as Ms Badenoch has been accused of 'playing to the Right-wingers' over Rwanda, after anonymous reports emerged saying she privately urged Mr Sunak to tighten the Bill.
The Times reported that Ms Badenoch wanted the Prime Minister to harden the legislation by preventing migrants from lodging individual appeals against their deportation.
A source told the newspaper: 'Kemi was aware that the Prime Minister faced a serious rebellion and he had to try to accommodate them, so she went in to see Liam [Booth-Smith, Mr Sunak's chief of staff]. She was trying to avoid the rebel MPs turning against the Government.'
She voted for the legislation in Wednesday's third reading of the Bill. A source told The Mail on Sunday: 'She's certainly playing up to the Right-wingers. But she's been on a slow burn this year – the Election does focus minds.'
Ms Badenoch last month topped a poll of Tory party members regarding who should become their next leader. She was followed by Penny Mordaunt and Suella Braverman. Several Cabinet members have been quietly drumming up support and sounding out MPs over future leadership challenges.
An ally of Ms Badenoch said last night: 'Kemi is 100 per cent behind the Prime Minister and anyone saying otherwise is doing it for their own benefit, not the country's.'"

Sydney-based software company Atlassian will let staff work on January 26 and allow them to take the day off on an alternative date.
The $95billion company joins two of the big four banks, ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank, and scores of other businesses making the change this year.
They are the most recent companies to make operational changes for the national holiday after Woolworths announced it won't be selling Australia Day merchandise.
January 26 is treated as a day of mourning instead of a day of celebration by many First Nations people as it marks the day that started colonial Australia.
Australia's largest tech company Atlassian (pictured, co-founder Scott Farquhar) will allow staff to choose another day in January to celebrate Australia Day
Atlassian's policy allows for staff to work on January 26 and in turn take the holiday on another day throughout the month.
While the tech company specifically states Australia Day as the holiday staff can swap, other companies let workers swap any legislated holiday.
Among those are professional services provider Deloitte, accounting firm EY Australia, Telstra, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank and NAB.
Another multinational professional service provider, KPMG, only allows for staff to change what day they celebrate holidays for religious, cultural or heritage beliefs and not for personal beliefs.
While the option is there, a Deloitte spokesperson said those taking the chance to change what day they celebrate Australia Day are in the minority.
'Based on experience, we expect the vast majority of our people will take advantage of the Australia Day public holiday,' A Deloitte spokesman told The Australian.
'If staff have to work on Australia Day due to client commitments they are entitled to take an additional day off in lieu of their choosing.'
The tech company is the latest in a raft of businesses to make policy changes related to January 26 (pictured, Australia Day revellers)
The revelations come after Woolworths sparked outrage for not stocking shelves with Australia Day merchandise.
A spokesperson said their focus was on offering food and produce for all occasions, including Australia Day.
'Customers across all our stores can also expect to see a large range of great value food offers and specials to enjoy with family and friends next week in the lead up to and for the Australia Day long weekend,' a spokesperson said.
Woolworths earlier said there had been a gradual decline in demand for Australia Day merchandise in recent years.
'At the same time there's been broader discussion about 26 January and what it means to different parts of the community,' their statement read.
'We know many people like to use this day as a time to get together and we offer a huge variety of products to help customers mark the day as they choose.
'Woolworths and BIG W celebrate the best of Australia every day, and we're proud to support the farmers, producers, and suppliers who work with us.'"

The Royal Caribbean Ultimate World Cruise is a 274-night journey that will visit more than 60 countries, with passengers seeing 11 wonders of the world - on a holiday that costs anywhere between £41,634 to more than £82,483.
Videos of passengers documenting their journeys have gone viral on social media with followers intrigued by their adventure.
MailOnline spoke to one of the content creators on board, who goes by @little_rat_brain on TikTok, but chooses to keep her real name private.
She revealed everything from how some guests aren't impressed with the food, to how passengers get all of their laundry done for them.
MailOnline spoke to one of the content creators on board the ultimate nine-month cruise, who goes by @little_rat_brain on TikTok, but chooses to keep her real name private
The American travel influencer has amassed more than 130,000 followers and more than a million views thanks to her videos on the cruise.
The ship, which is called the Serenade of the Seas, departed from Miami, Florida on December 10, 2023, and will return on September 10, 2024 - leaving plenty more time for fans to get an insight into what it's like.
She told MailOnline: 'Travel has always been a part of my life, so it was really easy to decide to take this particular cruise.
'One of my family's goals is to visit all fifty states and seven continents, and this cruise would fulfill that goal - or at least it will once we make it through the Drake Passage.
'It’s been a fantastic time so far. I’ve loved every minute both off and on the ship.
'I’ve been able to meet so many different people from different places, try new foods that I didn’t know existed, and see places that are hard to believe they’re on the same planet'.
The content creator admits that she was initially worried about making friends on the cruise, as she wasn't sure 'what the demographic would be like'.
However, so far she's met lots of people and is forming friendships, adding that: 'To their credit, the crew is excellent at setting up meetings for different social groups, so there are ways to meet people'.
The content creator told MailOnline: 'Travel has always been apart of my life, so it was really easy to decide to take this particular cruise'
She revealed that: 'There are more older and retired people than any other age group, but that is to be expected. However, the range of ages on the ship is 'actually quite surprising.
'We have families with young children, kids going to school, and some cruisers are even attending graduate school while onboard.
'I’m an artist, so my schedule is pretty flexible. This trip is truly letting me explore different places and gather inspiration for the next phase in my life.
'I think any challenges that I face at this point would mostly stem from my poor packing.
'I neglected to consider my personal temperature comfort zones, and forgot to bring any long pants that are comfortable for sea days. Other than that, it truly has been smooth sailing'.
When it comes to her newfound level of 'reality star' style fame, the passenger who goes by 'Little Rat Brain' admitted that it was 'definitely unexpected'.
The TikToker said: 'Not even two months ago, I only had 200 followers, and that’s now no longer the case. I get the interest though, if I wasn’t on the cruise, I would certainly be following everyone involved'.
Two of the most popular questions that followers of those on the cruise have are regarding the food and laundry situations.
The ship, which is called the Serenade of the Seas, departed from Miami, Florida on December 10, 2023, and will return on September 10, 2024
The passengers documenting their journey's on social media have seen their follower numbers shoot up as thousands of people from across the world tune in to see what's going on on the ship
She explains: 'People have been complaining about the food, but frankly, my refrigerator would never have this many options.
'The food varies each day, and the buffet always has so many different options. I am amazed at the logistics that it must take to feed everyone onboard and to make sure that minimal food goes to waste.
'The Indian food is consistently amazing and the desserts always surprise me'.
She goes on to reveal that there are two options for laundry, you can either do your own in the three laundry areas offered or send it out three times a week:
'Personally, I’ve opted to have mine done for me, as laundry is one of my least favourite activities to do back home.
'It’s also nice because it comes back folded, which would be quite the ordeal in my room'.
Commenting on her room, she added: 'My cabin is an interior room, which I love. Prior to sailing, I found out the dimensions of my room, so I was about to figure out how to shuffle the existing furniture around to make it have the best flow possible.
'I also painted large murals on cloth to hang on the walls, as well as added plant squares over the artwork to give a sense of the outdoors.
'Every bit of space has been looked at and converted into storage, with the help of magnets and boxes'.
At the time of writing, the cruise's inhabitants are experiencing their 'worst weather yet' going through the Drake Passage.
She exclaimed: 'The drake passage is notoriously rough, and we are definitely getting a taste of it.
'For the past two days, the ship has sailed through hurricane force winds, with the highest speed being over 90 knots.
The ship, which is called the Serenade of the Seas, departed from Miami, Florida on December 10, 2023, and will return on September 10, 2024
'The waves are also quite high, with some of them reaching the fifth deck and the spray of them have reached the tenth deck as well'.
It comes after a storm at sea caused major flooding to certain areas of the ship, just two days in.
While it wasn't severe, some cruisers were disgruntled by having to move rooms and put heat fans out to dry the carpet'.
She explained that so far, the passengers have seen 12 different countries and have 52 countries left.
She said: 'We started off in the United States, leaving from Miami, and then headed to Royal Caribbean’s private island in the Bahamas. I have to admit, I used this day to get the majority of my unpacking done.
'We then headed to Mexico, to see our first world wonder: Chichén Itzá-which was absolutely incredible.
'It’s hard to envision the scale and the science behind it when you read about it, but in person, it’s such an interesting place. After that, the ship headed towards the ABC Islands: Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao.
The traveller gushed: 'All of those islands are truly the definition of tropical paradise, the weather was fantastic and the water was such a pure shade of blue, it was unbelievable.
The American has amassed more than 130,000 followers and more than a million views on certain cruising videos
'Our next two stops were Barbados and Grenada, respectively. Both of those islands were unlike anything I’ve seen before. I wasn’t expecting Grenada to look so prehistoric and lush, although it makes sense that a tropical rainforest would be able to produce all the spices they are known for'.
She admitted: 'Unfortunately, due to safety concerns about weather, we had to skip French Guiana, but I think I’ll eventually make my way back there.
'Finally, we made it over to Brazil, which I cannot say enough good things about. I loved every single port that we went to.
'The vibrancy of the colors and the joyfulness of everyone that we met, along with the sheer amount of public art made it one of my top countries so far.
'Also, being offshore of Copacabana beach for New Year’s is something that I’ll truly cherish for the rest of my life.
'After that whirlwind of travel, the ship docked in Uruguay, which I didn’t expect to love nearly as much as I did. There is definitely some semi-serious consideration of moving there after this cruise is over.
'Finally, our last country so far is Argentina. Argentina has been a lovely area so far, especially since we saw our second world wonder-Iguazu Falls. I don’t have a country that I’m most looking forward to next, since I’m just truly excited to see every single port.
'The excursions are also pretty varied for each port, as they cater to a range of different interests and abilities. My favorite ones so far have been riding on a dune buggy on the beach of Morro Branco and seeing baby penguins in Puerto Madryn'.
With the bulk of the trip still to go, including destination across Asia, the Middle East, Europe and beyond, the cruisers won't return home until September of this year.

The actress shared the role she was supposed to play in the blockbuster film during an interview at the Variety Studio presented by Audible at the Sundance Film Festival.
'I was definitely going to be a Weird Barbie,' she said. 'I don't know how to take that. I would have been with Kate McKinnon, so that would have been nice. I had a scene but didn't ever get to do it, and it wasn't in the movie.
Saoirse – who has immense pride at being Irish – was asked what the scene was going to be and she admitted she wasn't quite sure.
'It was weird,' she said. 'I think I'd be the strange girl who talked to herself and always had her pet dog with her and always talked to the dog and wouldn't look at anyone.

The star shared the role she was supposed to play in the blockbuster film during an interview at the Variety Studio presented by Audible at the Sundance Film Festival
The Mary Queen of Scots star goes way back with Barbie director and co-screenwriter Greta Gerwig, 40.
She starred in the director's 2017 film playing the lead character, who was based on Gerwig as a teenager.
Gerwig has previously admitted that she'd like to revisit Ronan's character in Lady Bird, and the the Lovely Bones actress responded positively to the idea.
'She's based on Greta so, does she make Barbie? I don't know. We did discuss while we were making the film that we would love to revisit it,' she explained.
'I've heard she's started talking about it. I'll do everything with her for as long as she'll have me.'
The Little Woman star is at Sundance to premiere her new film Outrun, which is based on the novel of the same name by Amy Liptrot.
The story is about Rona, a recovering alcoholic who returns home to the Orkney Islands in Scotland after spending a hard-living decade in London to escape the temptations that led to her addictions.
She helps out on her father's sheep farm, where she isn't afraid to get her hands dirty.
'I delivered seven lambs,' she told Variety proudly. 'That was very terrifying. I didn't know if I was going to kill the lamb as I was pulling 'em out.'
'I was definitely going to be a Weird Barbie,' she said. 'I don't know how to take that. I would have been with Kate McKinnon, so that would have been nice. I had a scene but didn't ever get to do it, and it wasn't in the movie'; Pictured 2023
She was asked what the scene was going to be and she admitted she wasn't quite sure; Still from Barbie
'It was weird,' she said. 'I think I'd be the strange girl who talked to herself and always had her pet dog with her and always talked to the dog and wouldn't look at anyone'
She first became aware of the project during the COVID-19 lockdowns when her parter Jack Lowden, 33, handed her the book. A Scotsman himself, he produced the project.
'We were in lockdown a few years ago and he said, “You need to read this because this is the role you need to play.” I instantly fell in love with Amy's writing and how she captured the struggle of addiction,' she told the outlet.
She also spoke about the challenges of playing a role that is based on a real person that you actually know.
'You feel like there’s a lot of responsibility on your shoulders. We delve into her relationships with her family and friends, some of whom she lost along the way. To protect that while also still authentically showcasing her life was difficult to find the balance initially.'"
DBWBEH5B2L_COEZL9VCIRVI1PY,EXCLUSIVEPrivate investigator who is a descendant of poet William Wordsworth reveals he was stopped by police at Bristol City airport and quizzed for two hours over his links to Russia and Vladimir Putin,Mark Hookham,"Published: 12:31 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 12:49 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988753/private-investigator-police-russia-vladimir-putin-bristol-city-airport.html,"A descendant of the poet William Wordsworth was stopped at a UK airport and quizzed by police over his Russian links, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.
Andrew Wordsworth, one of Britain's leading private investigators, was asked whether he knew Vladimir Putin during a two hour interrogation at Bristol Airport.
The 61-year-old is a distant relative of the great Romantic poet and was once voted by society magazine Tatler as London's most eligible bachelor.
Described as a 'preeminent figure in intelligence' and an expert at gathering information in Russia, Mr Wordsworth co-founded private investigation firm Raedas in 2016.
His interrogation, which is believed to have been sanctioned by MI5, has sent shockwaves through Britain's booming 'corporate intelligence' industry.

A string of secretive firms, many of which are based in London's Mayfair, are paid up to £800 per hour by wealthy businesses, oligarchs and autocratic states to gather information on rivals, sometimes via surveillance.
This newspaper, however, has learnt that Britain's security services have launched a crackdown on intelligence firms suspected of helping oligarchs or organisations allied to the Kremlin.
Mr Wordsworth was not arrested and has faced no further action.
'I was stopped on my way through the airport almost a year ago,' he told the MoS last night.
'Although it was irritating, I am very supportive of the government's initiative. We are in a dangerous world and need to be vigilant.
'As was to be expected, there has been no follow up or other action taken against me or Raedas.'
While at his former investigations firm, GPW, Mr Wordsworth worked for Russian oligarch Vladimir Yakunin - an old friend of Putin who rose to become head of state-run Russian Railways
Andrew's interrogation is believed to have been sanctioned by MI5 and has sent shockwaves through Britain's booming 'corporate intelligence' industry
Mr Wordsworth, who began his corporate intelligence career in the mid-1990s, is described on his firm's website as having 'engaged in many of the last decade's most prominent disputes connected to Russia.'
It adds: 'Working with an ever-expanding network of well-placed sources in the region, we are experts at gathering evidence to be submitted in foreign courts.
'Our success in the region is grounded in our detailed and nuanced insights into the inner workings of the states of the Former Soviet Union.'
While at his former investigations firm, GPW, Mr Wordsworth worked for Russian oligarch Vladimir Yakunin - an old friend of Putin who rose to become head of state-run Russian Railways.
Mr Wordsworth was stopped last March as he passed through immigration at Bristol Airport after a flight from Paris and was quizzed by a Detective Inspector.

Britain's security services are now believed to have started closely scrutinising corporate intelligence firms as part of a wider crack-down on so-called 'enablers' of the Russian regime
As well as being asked 'do you know Putin', Mr Wordsworth was also quizzed about whether he had met Russian government employees, the MoS understands.
Last night Mr Wordsworth said that following Russia's invasion of Ukraine Raedas 'immediately refocused the business away from Russia leaving clients and revenue streams.'
'Any problems we suffered as a result are nothing compared to the pain and suffering being endured by the people of Ukraine,' he added.
Sources close to Mr Wordsworth - the great, great, great, great nephew of the poet - said he believes the probe may have been sparked by rivals in the corporate intelligence community making false claims against him.
Britain's security services are now believed to have started closely scrutinising corporate intelligence firms as part of a wider crack-down on so-called 'enablers' of the Russian regime.
One corporate intelligence insider said Russians 'have been the biggest employer for investigators for twenty-odd years.'
A Whitehall source said: 'The new National Security Act gives MI5 and counter-terrorism police greater powers to charge 'enablers' of oligarchs and foreign intelligence agencies, and this is why they should be worried.'
A spokesperson for Raedas said: 'We work for prominent clients in exceptionally difficult and hard-fought litigation throughout the world. We are typically retained and instructed by their lawyers, often the most highly regarded law firms in the sector.
'As it pertains to Russia, we apply a strict sanctions policy and comply fully with the UK, EU and US sanction regimes. Moreover, we fully support the UK government's efforts to enforce its policies and the rule of law more generally.'"

Joshua, 29, who originally appeared on the first series of Love Island in 2015, chose to couple-up with series three star Georgia, 29, after he entered the villa in South Africa during Thursday's show.
The pair have known each other for almost 10 years, with Georgia confessing they kissed the first time they met and then briefly dated in 2023, but things turned sour when they had a huge argument in Ibiza.
During Sunday's episode, Georgia appeared to have put any bad blood between them behind her, sharing a passionate kiss with Joshua.
But, despite choosing to be in a couple with Georgia, it seems Joshua's heart may not be completely in the pairing as the next morning he was seen flirting with Molly Smith, telling his fellow Islanders he wanted to lock lips with her.

Joshua took three female Islanders - Georgia Harrison, Hannah Elizabeth and Georgia Steele - on dates before arriving in the Love Island All Stars villa earlier this week.
And he decided to couple-up with Georgia H upon entering the villa, despite the fact she had previously blocked him.

The moment viewers, with some taking to social media to express their opinions
As Joshua began to pop the champagne on his date with Georgia H, he said: 'Thought I would save the best until last,' before admitting: 'I was upset when I got blocked.'
Putting their past aside, Georgia explained: 'Look you got cancelled for a bit but if you want to bring it up you really deserved it. But I found it in my heart to forgive you because I am spiritual.'
Recalling the last time the pair met up, Georgia wasn't afraid to speak her mind as she continued: 'I'm gonna paint my picture. So, I saw you at a party. We were having a nice day. I said ""I'm going to an amazing club later"" and I had the table sorted.
'You bumped me off my own table. You went in you didn't so much as look back. I didn't get so much as a text, not even till the next day, ""are you alright G"".'
Despite laughing, Joshua apologised as he confessed: 'I should have actually reached out. I hold my hands up, I am sorry.'
Georgia continued: 'I don't think we ever really fell out, and I think we both know that. But for my ego I just had to cancel you for a little bit after that.
'I'm glad you're here now.'
'I'm glad that I'm here, I'm glad that you're here and you look unbelievable', gushed Joshua.
While it seemed as though the pair had got their grievances out the way, Georgia went in for one last dig as she explained her situation in the villa and admitted that Anton Danyluk liked her.
'Anton really seems to like me and he seems like a right gentleman and I am trying to pick guys that aren't just leave me on the doorsteps of a club,' she laughed.

'Anton's in deep trouble here', he joked before Georgia agreed: 'He might be in trouble.'

Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? I'm a lot more confident in who I am and sure about exactly what I want from a relationship. I just want to have fun and meet a lovely boy.
How will you feel if you come across an ex in the Villa or someone you've dated from the show since appearing? It's always going to be awkward isn't it, it's always going to be weird seeing someone that you've been with getting with someone else. I wish my exes nothing but the best. I'm going to be focused on my own journey.
Kaz Kamwi

Georgia Harrison

AGE: 29
SERIES: 3
Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? This is the last year of my 20s so I want to go in the Villa and have some fun and hopefully meet someone that I can fall in love with. I'm lucky in the sense that I've got everything in my life that I could possibly wish for, apart from love.
If you had to pick your top Islanders from Series 1 to 10 to couple up with who would they be and why? Chris Taylor, he's hilarious and the main thing I'm attracted to is a man who can make me laugh. What a fun guy and like I said, I'm looking for someone to TikTok with so I reckon he'd be game for that sort of stuff!


Hannah Elizabeth

AGE: 33
SERIES: 1
Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? I'm returning to the Love Island Villa because I did it eight years ago and what an opportunity I never thought I'd get again. I'm not very good at finding love but I had a ball the first time, so I'm going to have a ball again.
You got engaged on the show last time, do you think wedding bells could be on the cards again this time round? Absolutely not, not in the Villa no. Maybe when I get out, but I'd need to give it a bit of time.

Georgia Steel

AGE: 25
SERIES: 4
Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? I'm 25, I have a house, a cat, a nice car - I have everything in life but a boyfriend, so why not give it as go.
You've been brave and honest in opening up about being conned by a former partner. How has this experience impacted the way in which you now approach dating?
I take that experience as a really positive reflection now. I look at it as something I had to go through to make me stronger and learn things in life for me to be able to learn what I want in my next partner.
Molly Smith

AGE: 29

Why are you returning to the Villa?
I found love last time, so I am back and ready to give it another go.
What will you do differently this time round?
Last time I did exactly what I wanted and got the girl that I wanted, so no I wouldn’t do anything different.

Why do you think the Villa is the perfect place to find love?
When you’re with someone 24/7 you really get to know them. It can be such an alien environment, so you really get to know someone in a short space of time. It’s Love Island - it’s the best place!





Toby Aromolaran

AGE: 24
SERIES: 7
Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? If I'm Single and Love Island is an opportunity for me, how could you turn down the chance to find love again?!
You were in a long term relationship with Chloe Burrows, what do you think her reaction will be when she hears you are going into the Villa? I don't know how she would take it.

Chris Taylor

AGE: 33
SERIES: 5

Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? Last time I was only there for 15 days, so I want to do it and enjoy it all again. I am 33 now and getting on a bit - I am getting ear hair! It would be nice to have a girl to keep my ears trimmed for me!
How did the Barbie Movie come about? I was invited to an afterparty by Margot Robbie and then ended up at an after party with her. I started to panic and make conversation with her, just having really stupid chats. All I can assume is that my silly chat made an impression on Margot Robbie. 18 months later I got an email from Warner Brothers.


Anton Danyluk

AGE: 29
SERIES: 5
Why are you returning to the Love Island Villa? For me it was a no brainer. I got the call and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity and probably the best summer I have ever had in my life. Getting the chance to do it twice is going to be unbelievable.
Why do you think the Love Island Villa is the perfect place to find love?
I think this time with Love Island: All Stars, things will be different, as we all understand what it's like to go on Love Island and the only thing now missing is finding a partner.

Mitchel Taylor

AGE: 27
SERIES: 10

Why are you returning to the Love Island villa? I think I went in with my heart on my sleeve the first time and got hurt and this time I am just going in to enjoy myself and if a connection happens, a connection happens.
In the summer you were given the name ‘Messy Mitch’, and a name that you have taken on as your own,  can we expect more of the same in the series? I’ll be honest, I don’t really plan on being 'Messy Mitch'. It just depends on what day of the week it is. I wear my emotions on my sleeve and what you see is what you get. I am very honest and very opinionated and I think that’s what people like me for.

Sophie Piper

AGE: 24
SERIES: 6
Why are you returning to the famous Love Island Villa?
I had a fun experience the first time around but I didn’t go the full way and find love, so I'd love to find someone this time.
What will you do differently this time round?
I’m quite chilled and don’t want drama, so I think I will approach this time round in a similar way. I’m a one guy kind of girl.
Why do you think the Villa is the perfect place to find love?
It’s a once in a lifetime experience and not something that comes up every day."

Shoppers took to social media on Sunday morning to voice their frustration after their orders were cancelled without warning.
A spokesperson for the supermarket apologised and reassured customers that their Tesco orders would be back up and running by mid-afternoon.
But some slammed the supermarket for 'appalling' customer service and claimed the glitch had left them without dinner on the table.
Reports of problems rose to a peak at 9am, according to the Downdetector website, with thousands logging problems with Tesco's service.
Tesco customers were left furious after being left without their grocery deliveries on Sunday morning after a technical fault


Dozens of infuriated customers took to social media to raise their frustrations.
One X user wrote: '@Tesco Worse [sic] customer service ever! System glitch no order but the system was fine to take your money and now we have to wait 3-5 days for a refund.
'Appalling. I hope all those affected don't waste their money and go elsewhere.'
Another user posted to Facebook: 'Tesco delivery due between 10-11am I've been on hold and still holding Tesco sort it out I need my shopping no email or text to say it's going to be late, nothing!
'Apparently a global issue order has been cancelled, no food shopping, no compensation, I'm absolutely fuming! So, no dinner for us today then, thanks Tesco! Tesco, not good enough!'
Another customer said: 'So Tesco order hasn't came, then it updates to say it's on it's way and money has been taken.
'Now, 21 minutes later it says the order has been cancelled and I need to wait 3-5 working days for a refund with £140 taken!
'Why even put an order through half an hour ago then cancel.'
A fourth person said: 'Poor mummy, @Tesco home delivery let her down and now she's got no shopping.
'Good job I can nip out for her. Some sort of glitch apparently. She was alone and hungry.'
Another disgruntled customer added: 'For someone who has a disabled child in the house and can't easily get to the shops, this is really unwelcome news at the last minute @Tesco.
'All well and good to say re-order for another time but I have a job and hospital appointments to juggle. Disappointed and no real explanation.'



Tesco customers voicing their frustrations about the cancelled deliveries after the technical issue
A Tesco's spokesperson said: 'We're really sorry that due to a technical issue, we had to cancel some online orders today.
'Our technical team have worked around the clock and have now fixed it.'
'Customers who were impacted have been contacted directly. We apologise again for the inconvenience.'
Tesco has advised customers to rebook to have orders delivered in the upcoming days. However, some customers said they were struggling to find suitable slots."

Denis Pushilin, installed by the Kremlin after Russia annexed the region in September 2022, said a Ukrainian missile had struck the city, which currently sits on the front line of Russia's invasion, injured an additional 20 people after it struck a busy market in the city.
Pushilin said the causality figures may change over the coming hours, with Russia's foreign ministry calling the strike a 'barbaric terrorist attack.'
Kyiv has not yet commented on the attack.
Photos of the aftermath of the attack, too graphic to publish, show bodies strewn across the streets around the market.
One man was seen mourning the death of his wife, who had been covered with a green and white cloth
Others were left to pick up after themselves following the attack
Ukraine allegedly targeted a busy market, though Kyiv has not yet commented on the attack
While almost all have been covered with sheets, some were left uncovered and their last expressions can be seen on their faces.
One man was seen mourning the death of his wife, who had been covered with a green and white cloth, while others were captured cleaning up the destruction wrought upon the city.
A Donetsk resident named Tatiana told local media she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.
'I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,' she said.
The missile attack was the latest in a series of attacks against Russia and occupied territories launched over the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian kamikaze drones successfully struck a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) processor and a missile plant on the same night.
Video footage showed two enormous explosions at the Novatek plant in Ust-Luga port in Leningrad region, triggering a raging inferno at the site, which sits just 81 miles from St. Petersburg.

A Ukrainian official separately claimed that drones had hit the Shcheglovsky Val defence enterprise in Tula, which produces the Pantsir-S and Pantsir-S1 air defence missile systems used to defend key sites including Vladimir Putin's palaces.
There were also Ukrainian strikes on Smolensk, Oryol and Bryansk regions provoking engagements with Russian air defences in one of Kyiv's most intense nights of the war in targeting military-linked targets inside Russia.
Massive fireballs were seen rising through the air at the strategically important Ust-Luga site, which in 2022 processed almost 7 million tons of gas products, a major export product that added an estimated €5.29 billion to Putin's war chest from sales to the EU alone.
Local media outlets reported that drones struck the Novatek facility at 3:20am local time, though Russia's defence ministry has not yet reported any attacks.
Novatek's Ust-Luga processes gas condensate, which itself is a processed version of LNG, and turns it into products including jet fuel, gasoil, and naphtha, and ships them across the world."

Bianca beamed as she shared a kiss with her new fiancée, 50, and proudly showing off her stunning emerald ring.
The couple, who have been dating since 2021, captured the loving moment outdoors with Bianca writing in a caption: 'The most precious thing happened…'

A friend of the pair has now told The Mail on Sunday: 'Ioan and Bianca have had the most torrid couple of years but their love has remained strong.
'Now they are looking to a lovely future together.'
He went public with his relationship with Bianca in October 2021, and Ioan and Alice were declared legally divorced in July 2023.
Bianca's engagement news comes just weeks after she hit back at speculation that she was pregnant, after catching the eye with a white illusion dress.
Last month, Bianca took to Instagram to share a beaming selfie in a pretty white sundress, gushing in the caption she was 'just a happy gal living life'.
However, she later shared a comment replying to another user as she said she'd been 'smashed' with messages asking if she was expecting.
She noted that her pinstriped white dress was 'giving her tummy that illusion,' and clarified that she was not pregnant.
Elsewhere in December, The Daily Mail reported that Alice, who shares daughters Ella, 14, and Elsie, 10 with her ex, is in dire financial straits – and has told friends that she cannot pay her rent or afford food, and is contemplating taking a job in Starbucks.
She has told pals that the money which she got from the sale of the marital home, believed to amount to $100,000 is all gone, much of it on lawyers, and she is now in a financial crisis.

A friend of the pair has now told The Mail on Sunday: 'Ioan and Bianca have had the most torrid couple of years but their love has remained strong' (Alice and Ioan seen together)
A friend said: 'Alice has been extremely upset and says that she can't afford to make rent when it is due later this month – at least not if they want to eat - and has just hit a financial rock bottom. She says she has nothing – not even medical insurance.'
They continued: 'She's been told that she should get a job but has not found any acting work and in any case she needs to look after their children who are school age.
'This week she has been discussing trying for a job in Starbucks but she thinks they might not want her as she is probably too old for them at 55. Also her agent doesn't want her to do it in case it looks bad.'
The friend added: 'She is feeling desperate and is out of ideas about how she can get along. She has been crying herself to sleep.
Alice and Ioan finally divorced in July 2023 but custody, spousal and child support have yet to be settled, and the next hearing in the case is due in March.
It comes amid news that the Fantastic Four star will reunite with his  daughters at least once a week after claiming his ex-wife had kept the girls away from him for almost a year.
In new court filings obtained by DailyMail.com, a judge ordered Alice to take the girls to weekly 'reunification therapy' sessions with their father.
And Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Josh Stinn also decreed that the warring former couple could not trash or insult each other in front of their children during therapy sessions.
According to court papers, the two girls now use the last name Griffith, the Anglicized version of their Welsh father's last name.
Ioan, who met Alice when they co-starred in the 2000 Disney movie, 102 Dalmatians, filed for divorce in March 2021, shortly after the blonde actress claimed on social media that her husband of 14 years was walking out on her and their two daughters.
Alice announced on Twitter in January 2021: 'Sad news. My beloved husband/soul mate of 20 years, Ioan Gruffudd, has announced he is to leave his family, starting next week.
'Me and our young daughters are very confused and sad. We haven't been given a reason except that he ""no longer loves me"". I'm so sorry.'

Ioan successfully obtained a three-year restraining order against Alice in August 2022 that banned her from mentioning him or his girlfriend on social media (Ioan and Bianca pictured in 2022)
In June 2022, she launched a Go Fund Me page asking for $25,000 to try and pay her bills, saying: 'I never in a million years thought I would be doing this. However in August 2020, just as the pandemic was really kicking in, my entire world fell apart.
'Since that date I have been not only struggling as a single mother to my babies, but also trying to cover bills and food and legal fees (ha! don't even talk to me about legal fees) which dwarf any other expense in my life and have finally drained everything - savings, accounts, pension, the lot.
'Yesterday all my accounts ran out and I couldn't buy anything. On the same day, my husband's lawyer sent me a letter telling me I was due in court on 2 August to argue ""my case"" in the divorce. I currently have no lawyer and no funds to pay one.
'If I don't turn up at court I will be in contempt, and I have no idea what will happen to me or my kids at that point.'

January 2021: The beginning of the end
Gruffudd filed for divorce in March 2021, shortly after Evans claimed on social media that her husband of 14 years was walking out on her and their two daughters.
October 2021: Ioan goes public with his new love
After Evans' explosive announcement about her split all seemed to quieten down until October 2021 when she took to Twitter to claim to her 29,000 followers that her estranged husband had been cheating on her for three years with a much younger woman.
Evans implied that her ex had gaslighted her for years, betraying her and their two daughters (but did not offer any evidence to support her accusation).
February 2022: Ioan files for a restraining order against Alice
After months of pointed tweets and social media posts made by Evans, Gruffudd responded by filing for a restraining order, submitting 113 pages of unhinged texts and emails that had not previously been made public.
In his court filing, Gruffudd claimed he told Evans that he wanted out of the marriage in August 2020 and that since then, she had harassed him with hundreds of unanswered text messages, abusive emails and social media posts - many of which he included in the filing.
He claimed she verbally threatened to tell the media he had abused her 'do what Amber Heard did to Johnny Depp'.

June 2022: Alice begs fans for money to pay for a divorce lawyer
As their divorce proceedings entered its 15th month, Evans claimed to be 'completely out of money for food and bills.'
She claimed she would receive no financial support from Gruffudd and that she was struggling to pay her legal fees and would be unable to 'feed or clothe' their daughters with her dwindling funds.
July 2022: Ioan asks for joint custody of daughters
After Evans filed for sole custody of their daughters, Gruffudd filed for custody and visitation rights to see his children, claiming in the filing that Evans had been purposely trying to cut communication between himself and the children.
He also petitioned that the girls attend in-person therapy and reunification therapy via zoom with him pending court-ordered mediation about custody.
In the filing, Gruffudd reiterated allegations that Evans had been verbally abusing during their 14-year marriage, and 'undermin[ing him] in front of the girls throughout their lives.'
August 2022: Ioan gets a three-year restraining order against Alice
Having previously been awarded a temporary restraining order against his estranged wife, Gruffudd successfully obtained a three-year restraining order against Evans in August 2022.
Harsher restrictions were put in place by a US judge, including a ruling preventing Alice from leaking private text messages from their children.
In the court documents, Gruffudd claimed Evans continued to cause him issues and wanted additional provisions added to the existing restraining order.
He also requested Evans not post his text messages or any other communications to the parties’ children, or the children’s text messages or any other communications to Ioan, on any social media account.
Gruffudd also asked for the judge to order Evans not to contact his employer or make disparaging statements about him to his employers.
October 2021: Ioan went public with his new love Bianca Wallace, posting a picture with the Australian actress who is 21 years younger than Alice
September 2022: Ioan and Alice's child custody battle hits a wall
Two months after Gruffudd filed for joint custody of his two daughters and asked for custody and visitation rights, the exes failed to settle their differences in family court, despite the help of a mediator.
Court documents showed the exes meeting was set for 31 August and that mediation had taken place but that 'no agreement' had been reached.
The document went on to confirm that that both Gruffudd and Evans had completed the mandatory Our Children First program.
The Superior Court of Los Angeles states of the program that: 'Parents are required by law to attend a mediation orientation/parent education program and a mediation session prior to appearing at an Order to Show Cause or Trial regarding the custody and/or visitation of their children.'
November 2022: Alice is reported to police over claims of 'child abuse' and drug use
Amid her ongoing custody battle, Evans claimed that someone called social services and the police on her with concerns over child abuse and drug and drink use.
The actress took to Twitter to allege that someone had sent authorities to her property who then found 'absolutely no signs of abuse' and 'no drugs or drink'.

February 2023: Child custody agreement is stalled again after Alice is charged with 'violating restraining order'
Evans appeared in court in February 2023 to answer two charges of violating a restraining order that was put in place by her estranged husband.
The warring former couple were scheduled to appear later that month at a custody hearing but Evans asked for a postponement.
Her attorney, Marie LaMolinara, argued that testimony Alice gives at the custody hearing could be used against her in her later criminal trial, which would violate her right, under the 5th Amendment, not to incriminate herself.
March 2023: Charges against Alice are dropped
Prosecutors in Los Angeles dropped charges against Evans who had been accused of defying a restraining order the Welsh actor has against her.
Evans had pleaded not guilty to two counts of violating the order and at a hearing at LA's Airport Courthouse, Commissioner James Cooper dismissed the charges after prosecutors told the court they were 'unable to proceed.'
At a follow-up hearing, Evans' attorney, public defender, Daniel Stefanic, filed a motion asking for a ruling that would declare her 'factually innocent' of the charges.

May 2023: Alice moves out of $2million family home as ex Ioan is 'too poor' to pay for it
Evans and her children moved out of her family home and into a rented abode with their two daughters after Gruffudd pleaded with a court to allow the home to be sold, saying he didn't have the money to keep up with mortgage payments for his family following their split in 2021.
The Fantastic Four star told a court in a document filed last year that neither he nor Evans could afford the $6,750 a month in mortgage payments, insurance and property tax.
He said he'd had just one paid job in the past year and was so poor he was relying on handouts from his young girlfriend.
May 2023: Ella, 13, applies for a restraining order against dad Ioan and his girlfriend Bianca
The teenage daughter of Evans and Gruffudd asked for a restraining order against her famous father and his girlfriend in documents filed on May 31 at the Los Angeles Superior Court.
In the documents, Ella stated that she is 'afraid' of her father and accuses him of 'threatening to call the police on her anytime she misbehaves' during their visitations.
Ella filed for a domestic violence restraining order against her father following what she said was an ugly incident at their home, during which she claims Bianca 'slammed a door on her head'.
In her filing against her father, Ella requested that he be made to keep at least 100 yards away from her and not contact her for five years and asks that Gruffudd be ordered to undergo a '52-week batterer intervention program'.
The program, which involves weekly classes, is intended - the document states - to 'stop abuse, teach accountability, abuse effects, and gender roles'.
Ella requested that the restraining order also cover her nine-year-old sister Elsie, noting that she 'lives with her sister and is afraid that [Ioan] will abuse and/or continue to allow abuse to happen to my sister too'.
She also asked that her father be made to pay 'for some or all of her lawyer's fees and costs' and requests that her phone account and that of her sister Elsie's be transferred to their mother, alleging that Gruffudd has 'threatened to cancel my sister's phone account and my phone account'.
Along with her domestic restraining order filing, Ella included a declaration as evidence to support her case, in which she shared her recollection of a bitter spat that she claims took place while she and her nine-year-old sister Elsie were visiting their father's home on May 26.
Ella admitted that she was 'so mad' at her father to find that Wallace was at his apartment when she arrived that she began throwing food on his bed, on the floor, and on him, before she attempted to flee the apartment - which, she says, is when the actress 'slammed a door on her head', leaving her with 'a small bump' and a 'bruise on her arm'.

June 2023: Ioan accuses Alice of abusing him via fake Twitter accounts
In court documents seen by MailOnline, Gruffudd claimed his estranged wife screamed at him outside his Los Angeles home and called him a 'f***ing abuser' and 'abusive c***' in front of their 13-year-old daughter.
Gruffudd also claimed Evans repeatedly broken a three-year restraining order he took out against her which has resulted in criminal charges - and flashed him while wearing no underwear when their children were being dropped off.
The bombshell papers also contained claims from Gruffudd that: Evans has made 'thousands of false, threatening and harassing posts' about him; Evans claims to be home-schooling Ella, but has 'provided no information'; Evans has interfered with the girls' therapy and they are missing appointments; and Ella poured rolled oats from a bag over his head, which left him 'in shock'.
July 2023: Ioan and Alice are declared legally divorced

In a court order handed down in LA Superior Court, Judge Josh Freeman Stinn finally granted Gruffudd's request for divorce amid the couple's ongoing custody battle.
The Welsh actor had filed for bifurcation and termination of marital status in May which would allow him and Evans to be declared legally divorced even as they continue settlement negotiations in their split.
A minute order obtained by DailyMail.com show the judge approved the request on July 3, ruling: 'The Court finds irreconcilable differences have arisen in the marriage and grants judgment for the dissolution of marriage as to status only, effective today.'
July 2023: Ioan's daughter loses bid for domestic violence restraining order against him

Two months after Ella filed documents a judge at the Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed an application by Ella for a domestic violence restraining order.
Gruffudd was present in court, along with Ms Evans for the hearing, as well as the lawyer appointed as the minor's counsel last month.

The judge ruled: 'The minor's request for a domestic violence restraining order against the petitioner is hereby dismissed without prejudice.'
The decision came three weeks after the teenager's bid to get a civil protection order against Gruffudd's actress girlfriend Bianca Wallace, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, was also denied.

Ioan said: Friends of the Liar star said he was 'very relieved' at the outcome. They also claimed that the situation is a 'nightmare' but they are 'happy to see some progress'.
August 2023: Ioan accuses Alice of 'child abuse' and keeping their daughters  from him

A Los Angeles judge attempted to shield Gruffudd and Evans from the fallout of their parents' ugly battles by banning the press from a custody hearing, keeping the proceedings secret.
But that didn't stop the warring former couple – who are both seeking custody of the girls – from taking vitriolic shots at each other in written court filings that are public and not sealed.
The Welsh star called his ex a 'child abuser' – while Evans claimed Gruffudd hadn't seen or called his children for almost three months, according to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com.
Ioan said: 'Alice has continued to inflict serious emotional harm on Ella and Elsie by her statements and by interfering in my relationship with them.
'Alice has verbally abused and undermined me in front of the girls throughout their lives.
'Since January 2021, Alice has also encouraged and instructed them not to see me or communicate with me and she has made thousands of threatening and abusive communications to me and about me.'
Alice said: 'I have read and disagree with the declaration of petitioner (Gruffudd) as to allegations that I am inflicting or causing our children ''serious emotional harm"".
'No one has ever contacted me or reported me for such conduct. No professional, nor teacher, nor school administrator, nor counsel, nor therapist.
'Petitioner has not seen, complied with, nor called the children for 11 weeks. I don't understand how having no recent information, ""petitioner believes"" there is an urgency such that a child custody evaluation must be commenced.'

Footage released online yesterday showed HMS Chiddingfold reversing into the docked HMS Bangor at a port in Bahrain.
The accident ripped a huge hole in the hull of the minehunter, which is constructed of glass reinforced plastic. There was internal damage but no injuries to the crew.
Navy sources suggested there was no timeline yet for when the vessel can return to frontline duties.
On a media round today Mr Shapps said something 'clearly' went wrong, but denied it was incompetence.
He told Sky News' Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: 'Just as in aviation or many other walks of life sometimes accidents and incidents happen, there's a full investigation under way.'

Asked if it was incompetence, Mr Shapps added: 'We don't say it's incompetence when we see an aircraft come down, a very rare occasion just as this would be a rare occasion, it's right to leave the investigators some time to work out exactly what's gone wrong.
'Something clearly did and we need to see what it is.'
The two minehunters had been based in the Middle East to ensure the safe flow of trade through the waters.
Rear Admiral Edward Ahlgren said: 'Why this happened is still to be established.
'We train our people to the highest standards and rigorously enforce machinery safety standards, but unfortunately incidents of this nature can still happen.
'I assure you that a full and thorough investigation is already under way and any changes in procedure that could prevent further incidents will be rapidly implemented.
'In the meantime the UK will continue to play a key part in ensuring the safety of merchant shipping in the region.'"

EZUN9F7WFR_HAXM0X94AD6NXQB,Grieving mom whose daughter was raped and murdered by an MS-13 gang member files $100MILLION lawsuit against the feds for lax policies: 'Nobody at the border did their job and checked his background',Alex Hammer For Dailymail.Com,"Published: 22:29 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 13:35 GMT, 22 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989467/Kayla-Hamilton-mom-daughter-raped-killed-migrant-ms-13.html,"A mourning mom whose daughter was raped and killed by an MS-13 gang member in 2022 has filed suit against feds alleging they failed to stop him at the border.
The lawsuit names both the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as defendants, and demands $100million in damages.
It was filed by Tammy Nobles and her attorney this week, roughly a year and a half removed from the incident in question.
Allegedly occurring in July of 2020, it saw Nobles' daughter, 20-year-old Kayla Hamilton, strangled with a phone cord by the then 16-year-old suspect.
The lawsuit alleges both agencies failed the woman by letting in the unnamed El Salvadoran, after not verifying his status with a phone call, and allowing him to be placed in a holding facility.

The lawsuit was filed by Tammy Nobles (pictured) and her attorney this week, roughly a year and a half removed from the incident in question
Allegedly occurring in July of 2020, it saw Nobles' daughter, 20-year-old Kayla Hamilton, strangled with a phone cord by the then 16-year-old suspect
They also failed to find the damning gangland tattoos said to have been on the perp's person, before ultimately neglecting to confirm a verified sponsor for him.
As a result, the suspect ran away and ended up as Hamilton’s roommate in a trailer home in Maryland, after allegedly subleasing from another illegal.
Appearing before NewsNation in an emotional interview, she and her lawyer laid bare some of the contents in the newly filed lawsuit.
'Nobody at the border did their job and checked his background', she told the station Sunday, claiming  if the federal government had properly screened the suspect, they would have realized he was a known member of the gang, disqualifying him from coming the US.
Most importantly, without the oversight, she said her daughter would still be alive - with her attorney claiming that both the DHS and DHHS have blood on their hands.
'I want everyone to know what is going on at the border,' she continued, weeks after a record 300,000 migrants entered the country in a single month in December.
'I had no clue what was going on before my daughter was brutally murdered and raped - but I do now.
'And I've found that the story is just so mind-boggling, how nobody at the border did their job and checked his background.
Noble's daughter (right) was autistic and wanted to live independently - and had recently moved in with her boyfriend (left) before her death
When asked what the hardest part of the past 18 months has been, Nobles tearfully said: 'The hardest part is that it could have been prevented. I could still have my daughter, if they just would have done their job'
'All they had to do was make one phone-call to El Salvador to know that he was an MS-13 gang member on the list,' she went on.
'It's just crazy how he got from Texas all the way to Maryland, to be in the same trailer as my daughter.'
Interviewer Natasha Zouves proceeded to ask the audibly emotional mother how she was doing, and how she and the rest of her family had been surviving the ordeal.
Appearing via videolink, she answered: 'The only thing that I can come up with is that God is helping me along this path.
'Nights are really bad - you're just left with your thoughts.'
She continued, before eventually tearing up: 'I try not to think about what Kayla went through that day, what she was thinking those last minutes of her life.'
Claiming that such thoughts would 'break' her before their all-important federal trial - slated for June 18 - she explained how there, she hopes to hear all of the painful details surrounding her late daughter's ultimate ordeal.
She conceded that it will be really difficult to see photos and hear testimony from cops who investigated the crime, but said it is something she still needs to do.
'I want to know what happened to her.' Crying, she added: 'I want to know, you know, a lot more than I do now.'
Hamilton, meanwhile, was raped and strangled to death on July 27, 2022. Officers had been called to a mobile home at the Rancho Estates for a suspected cardiac arrest victim, but instead found Hamilton's body.
Brian Claypool, the family attorney, explained why they believe the federal government is at fault.
'We’re bringing this lawsuit because we’re tired of being held hostage in our own country. We’re tired of DHS playing Russian roulette with our lives, [and] with Kayla's life,' the jurist explained.
'That's why we brought this case. We're alleging that two federal agencies [DHS and DHHS], catastrophically failed Kalya... and are failing everybody.
Echoing previous comments from Noble, he added: 'This could happen anywhere, to anybody.
'The DHS just needs to be held accountable,' he went on.  'All they had to do was follow their own protocol.
'Lift the t-shirt of the 16-year-old young man that was trying to enter the border,' he said,'[and] they would have seen a gang-related tattoo.
'And guess what. That would have disqualified him from entering this country. He should have been sent back at that very second to El Salvador.
But it allegedly gets worse, Claypool continued.
Cops arrested the suspect on January 15, 2023 after comparing his DNA to evidence from the crime scene. The 16-year-old El Salvadoran was charged with first-degree murder, as well as rape and robbery. Customs officials later confirmed the suspect was part of MS-13
'As Tammy said, secondly, all they had to do was pick up the phone, make a phone call, and guess what - on the list in El Salvador, was this young man. Because he was arrested iun July 2020, for being involved in an illicit MS-13 Gang.
'He would have been disqualified, again, for ever entering the country.'
The lawyer went on to explain how the crime is even more serious, due to the failings of the DHHS..
'DHHS, Health and Human Services, was responsible for putting them in a holding facility for a couple of days, and then making a phone call and confirming that this young man had what's called a verified sponsor - a relative, a known verified relative,' he explained.
'Even though DHS let him in, he still can't get in the US - unless he is going to a known relative. Well, they blew it too. And they're going to pay the price, because he runs away by the way, after going to this ""alleged"" verified sponsor.
'And then it gets even worse,' he said again, 'when [the suspect] end[ed] up at this trailer home as a roommate with lovely Kayla, that was leased out by another illegal immigrant.'
Growing increasingly animated, he concluded:  'So, we're done with this. The federal government has blood on its hands. They owed us a duty to protect Kayla and others in this country, and we're going to bring change through this lawsuit.'
Hamilton, meanwhile, was raped and strangled to death on July 27, 2022.
Officers had been called to a mobile home at the Rancho Estates for a suspected cardiac arrest victim, but instead found Hamilton's body.
Police arrested the suspect on January 15, 2023 after comparing his DNA to evidence from the crime scene. The 16-year-old El Salvador native, was charged with first-degree murder, as well as rape and robbery.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed the suspect was listed as a member of Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13.
The Aberdeen Police Department said Hamilton had just moved into the city to live with her 22-year-old boyfriend before her gruesome murder, which also came just three days after her birthday.
House Judiciary Committee Republicans launched a probe into her rape and murder, criticizing the Biden administrations' 'open border policies.'
U.S Reps. Jim Jordan and Tom McClintok demanded the Health and Human Services Department answer for the death of Hamilton.
After the attack, Jordan slammed Biden directly in a tweet criticizing his alleged inaction amid reports of the border crisis' impacts.
Summing up the news, Jordan wrote: 'Unaccompanied alien minors working brutal jobs across the country. MS 13 gang member kills Maryland woman. Fentanyl being smuggled across the border.
'But for some reason, Joe Biden continues to ignore the border crisis.'
When asked what the hardest part of the past 18 months has been, Nobles tearfully said: 'The hardest part is that it could have been prevented.
'I could still have my daughter, if they just would have done their job.'
She will argue her case before a federal judge in June."

Holly McCabe, from Denver, Colorado, was working as a nurse in an oncology hospital unit in when she was inspired by a cancer patient finishing her last round of chemotherapy.
Ms McCabe said: 'I had been a nurse for seven years when I started working in the cancer ward at St Joseph Medical Center, helping cancer patients through their painful experiences.
'While I knew the importance of regular breast checks, I never really checked my own breasts until August 27, 2023. While at work, I saw a young woman ""ring the bell"" signaling her completion of chemotherapy treatment. It reminded me to go home and do a self-exam. I found a hard lump in my right breast.'
As a young healthy woman, now 31 years old, with no family history of breast cancer, Ms McCabe did not believe she was high risk.
But after her exam and several follow-up tests, she was diagnosed with stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer in September 2023.
As a nurse working in a cancer unit at St Joseph Medical Center, Holly McCabe always told her patients of the importance of self breast exams , but never performed her own until August 2023
In September, Ms McCabe began a treatment regimen that includes 16 rounds of chemotherapy, followed by a second cycle that will span 12 weeks
Holly McCabe was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer at 30 years old after finding a lump in her breast
After feeling the lump in her breast, Ms McCabe made an appointment with her doctor and was sent to get an ultrasound, where she said the examiner discovered something that was 'worrying.'
This prompted her medical team to send her for a mammogram - an x-ray image of the breast.
After the image confirmed there was a mass in her breast, the doctors performed a biopsy on the lump.
The next day, as she was boarding a flight to her brother's wedding, her doctor called and confirmed she had breast cancer.
Not wanting to 'interfere' with her brother's wedding, she kept her diagnosis a secret from family and friends for several weeks.
It wasn't until more tests and one week later that she received the stage-3 triple-negative breast cancer diagnosis, a more aggressive and rare type of the cancer.
Ms McCabe said: 'When I heard my diagnosis, I felt numb. As a nurse, I knew the diagnosis was bleak. As the patient, I was terrified. Through processing the information, I felt my mortality, which at such a young age is hard to put into words.'
The above graph shows the case rates (blue and green dots) of breast cancer among women per 100,000 people compared to the death rate (red squares). As death rates have plunged, case rates are still rising. The blue and green dots are from two different databases tracking breast cancer rates over different time periods
Checking your breasts should be part of your monthly routine so you notice any unusual changes. Simply rub and feel from top to bottom, feel in semi-circles and in a circular motion around your breast tissue to feel for any abnormalities
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the US behind skin cancer. It accounts for about one-in-three of all new female cancers each year.
The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 310,700 new cases of breast cancer and 42,250 deaths from the cancer in 2024.
The average five-year survival rate for breast cancer is 90 percent.
And while death rates have plummeted 43 percent between 1989 and 2020 due to successful public health awareness campaigns, better screening and new drugs, cases are rising.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of all breast cancers. It differs from other types in that it tends to grow and spread faster, has fewer treatment options and usually has a worse prognosis.
This type of breast cancer has an average 77 percent five-year survival rate, but depending on the stage of the cancer, that rate can be as low as 12 percent.
Ms McCabe said it took several months for her to 'process' her diagnosis, but once she did, she knew she wanted to share her experience and connect with other breast cancer patients.

Ms McCabe will ultimately need a double mastectomy with reconstruction, radiation, and nearly a year of immunotherapy
As a young healthy woman with no family history of breast cancer, Ms McCabe did not believe she was high risk.
She said: 'It took around three months for me to process my diagnosis and emotions before sharing them online. I have always enjoyed creating and editing videos, and with this diagnosis, I realized I had something really valuable and important I could share to help others.
'I wanted to find other triple-negative breast cancer patients and survivors, especially my age. I have found that by sharing online and, in doing so, I have felt less alone.
'I receive daily messages from others going through similar or the same journeys that my content is helping them, and that brings me so much purpose during this phase of my life.'
The nurse's TikTok is full of videos of her sharing the story of her initial diagnosis, treatment regimen, side effects, medical tests and results, as well as the emotional and mental struggle she faces as she is 'mourning [her] life pre-cancer.'
She also revealed she met with a reproductive endocrinologist because chemotherapy treatments can cause infertility and she wanted to learn more about egg retrieval and freezing, which could allow her to have children after cancer treatments.
Ultimately, Ms McCabe said in a video, she decided not to go through the process of retrieving and freezing eggs. She said doctors told her there is still a small chance she could have a healthy future pregnancy.
In September, Ms McCabe began a treatment regimen that includes 16 rounds of chemotherapy, followed by a second cycle that will span 12 weeks.
She will ultimately need a double mastectomy with reconstruction, radiation, and nearly a year of immunotherapy.
If residual cancer remains at the end of her treatment, she is prepared to participate in clinical trials.
Despite her insurance coverage, Ms McCabe says she faces mounting medical bills and her medical team anticipates she will need to take a year off from work.
To alleviate the financial burden, she has set up a GoFundMe account to help cover expenses.
The most difficult aspect for Ms McCabe is realizing the toll cancer takes.

A California woman diagnosed with breast cancer in her thirties has revealed her symptoms were initially dismissed as a possible side effect from stopping her birth control.
She said: 'The treatment for this disease has made me feel like a stranger in my own body.
'Prior to my diagnosis, I felt I was in the best health of my life, so it has been quite a change physically. Emotionally, the treatment puts you through a lot.
'The medications all have side effects, altering your hormones and moods. On top of that, I deal with actively grieving my life before cancer.
'Life will simply never be the same for me after receiving this news and going through this treatment.'
But amidst her fears, the nurse has found solace and strength in the support of her TikTok followers.
She says their love, encouragement and kind words have helped her navigate the difficult days and reminded her of the importance of human connection.
Ms McCabe said: 'Seeing others extend love, support, and kind words helps me get through the hard days. I am a highly ambitious and independent woman and always have been, but I have learned that there is beauty in the community and that all humans need others in this life.'
Through her TikTok, she also aims to raise awareness about the importance of regular breast self-exams and early detection.
Her message to others facing a similar diagnosis is to 'Embrace the beauty that can be found even in the darkest of times.
'Each day granted is a precious gift; seize it.'
Ms McCabe added: 'Discover your true passions and desires, then pursue them with unwavering determination. Life's brevity and fragility should inspire you to live authentically and confidently, for it can be snatched away in the blink of an eye. You are never truly alone.
'There are others fighting similar battles all around you, waiting to connect and share in your journey. The beauty of community lies in our shared humanity, where our similarities far outweigh our differences.'
And on her GoFundMe fundraiser, Ms McCabe gave a piece of advice: 'Reminder - check your breasts!'"
FU1ET1AFVG_OFNP1OJ1NGQ615K,EXCLUSIVEWilliam Tyrrell's final hours: Foster mother's never-before-released police interview reveals her account of the missing toddler's last morning alive,Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia,"Published: 13:46 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 13:56 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12883401/William-Tyrrells-final-hours-Foster-mothers-never-released-police-interview-reveals-account-missing-toddlers-morning-alive.html,"A police interview with William Tyrrell's foster mother shows she gave confused and varying accounts of what happened on the toddler's last morning alive, and suggested innocent neighbours as suspects.
In the interview at a Sydney police station, the foster mother was asked about different 'theories' - including whether William was injured in an accident and she and the foster grandmother 'panicked' and 'covered it up'.
Police also asked her whether William could have been run over in the driveway by the foster father, and they covered it up for fear of losing custody of William's sister who lived with them.
There is no suggestion any of these theories are true and the foster family vehemently denies any involvement in William's disappearance. The detective leading the interview subsequently ruled out the foster parents as potential suspects.
The foster mother, known as SD, was grilled about deleting text messages from the foster father on the day William disappeared, and about seeing two mysterious cars that no one else living in the street canvassed by police could remember.
Police also seemed puzzled about the foster mother's timeline of events, and the gap between the last-known photo taken of William, at 9.37am, and what happened before the Triple-0 call at 10.56am.
Over a two-hour, 18-minute interview, SD was challenged about her account of William's last morning and why she and her husband's movements differed from what neighbours in the street and police on the scene said they saw.
William Tyrrell's foster mother was grilled by detectives two years after he went missing
In the interview with then-detective Gary Jubelin, the foster mother referenced one neighbour of her mother's on Benaroon Drive, in Kendall, calling him 'really odd' and saying her mother found him 'odd'.
The neighbour, Paul Savage, was later hotly pursued as a suspect by Jubelin, who was later taken off the Tyrrell strike force and convicted and fined for illegally recording interviews with him.
Mr Savage has since been completely exonerated of having any connection with William's disappearance.
William, three, vanished from his foster grandmother’s home in Kendall on the NSW Mid North Coast on September 12, 2014, and no trace of him has ever been found.
William, three, vanished from his foster grandmother’s home on that street on the NSW Mid North Coast on September 12, 2014
The interview, conducted almost exactly two years after William vanished, took place at Parramatta police station in western Sydney.
Daily Mail Australia has obtained a transcript of the ERISP (Electronically Recorded Interview with Suspected Person) with SD on September 1, 2016.
This and the foster father's interview on the same day was what Gary Jubelin later described as having 'ambushed and interrogated' the foster parents before ruling them out as persons of interest.
Then aged 51, SD was asked to go to Parramatta so she and William's foster father could be questioned by Strike Force Rosann, and asked if they or the foster grandmother were responsible for William vanishing.
Jubelin explained to her 'you understand why the accusing finger gets pointed back this way... the last people, our research and our evidence... invariably it's the people that had care or custody of the child.'
Insisting 'no, no, never', SD then said: 'if I for a single moment thought [the foster father] had something to do with it, I'd absolutely say it.'
The foster mother responded to a number of possible scenarios, of accidents and cover-ups, put to her by Jubelin, as well as to personal questions, saying the foster father was neither violent, nor had he had affairs with other women or a gambling problem.
She described herself and the foster father - a wealthy, well-educated couple who are known to live in a $4 million home on Sydney's exclusive north shore - as 'just Mr and Mrs Average'.

Although it is not suggested that SD is suspected of, or guilty of the disappearance of William Tyrrell, several years after the 2016 interview, SD was named as a person of interest in William's disappearance.
The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions is due to give advice by January 2024 on the viability of laying charges against the foster mother, after police submitted a brief of evidence in June.
Along with Jubelin, Detective Senior Constable Louise Currey attended the 2016  interview with SD.
It began at 10.49am and concluded at 1.29pm, with breaks in between.
The foster mother signed the police exhibit of what William was wearing - from his underwear to his shoes - on what was probably his last morning alive
SD was walked through her relationship with the foster father, which was preceded by an eight-year romance with another man, and lasted 18 months before they married in 2010.
She described him as 'normal' but also 'emotional' and 'depressed' since William's disappearance with 'swings every now and then'.
About fostering William, she said the boy had initially been 'very nervous around me' and 'it took a really long time for William to trust me', but had become 'completely comfortable' with her by the time he disappeared.
'This is the thing that kills me about this, is that he and I were just reaching that absolute one hundred percent open true mum-son relationship,' SD said.
The foster mother was taken through the sequence of events on the morning before William disappeared, which she had said was about or soon after 10.30am.
This was the same time she received a text from the foster father saying he was en route, and five minutes before he arrived.
The foster mother (above with the foster father at court last year) described herself and her husband as 'Mr and Mrs Average'
The foster mother called triple-0 at 10.56am on September 12, 2014 to report William missing, telling the operator she had been looking for her son for between 15 and 20 minutes.
The time of William's disappearance had always been cited as about 10.30am, but in the interview Jubelin challenged this, in particular the foster mother's assertion that William vanished soon after she took the final photograph of him.
The iconic image of William, barefoot in his Spider-Man suit and 'roaring' at the camera on his grandmother's verandah, was time-stamped 9.37am.
The foster mother said William rode his bicycle in the driveway about 9am after the foster father had left to make a conference call in town.
She said he then climbed a blackbutt tree below the side of her mother's house which has the high verandah which he said was 'too high, mummy'.
Police showed the foster mother these images which she took on William's last morning, the final image (bottom) time-stamped 9.37am
She had then photographed William, shoeless, in his Spider-Man suit on the back verandah while he played 'daddy tiger', roaring at the camera.
SD said her mother had made tea which she was drinking before she took that photograph, putting down her cup operate the camera.
'I remember having the tea thinking it's too hot for me to drink,' she said.
Jubelin told her in the interview that the 9.37am photo was 'the last confirmed sighting of William'.
The foster mother said it was after this that William had become bored playing with dice on the verandah and had put his shoes back on and 'jumped down off this deck'.
'He was running around in front of us and I remember [the foster grandmother] saying, ""Do you think he's got ADD?"" and I'm like, ""No, he's just excited,""' SD said.
It was after this that William vanished; however, Jubelin quizzed her about her previous account of events.
In particular, he wanted to know when precisely the foster mother realised William was gone. He insisted his questions were 'not a criticism' of her, and suggested the possibility that her memory of 'five minutes' could have been 'ten minutes'.
Foster mother: 'Yep. No I hear what you're saying. It's been running through my head as well... in hindsight I think what feels like five minutes may not be five minutes at all.
'I just wish, I wish I knew the exact time.'
Police search the side of the foster grandmother's house where William had played in the time leading up to his disappearance
The foster mother said she had searched for William in the yard, the house and partly down the street before speaking to neighbour Anne Maree Sharpley, then going down to talk with another resident, Lydene Heslop, to search in the bus stop.
The foster mother said that all happened prior to the foster father texting her and then arriving home from making a conference call at a nearby town with better internet reception.
Police logged his text at 10.30am and his arrival home at 10.33am.
Jubelin told the foster mother she was wrong, and that she hadn't gone searching for William with Ms Sharpley until after the foster father had arrived home.
Neighbour Anne Maree Sharpley (pictured at the William Tyrrell inquest in 2019) helped the foster mother search for William, but gave a police a different time frame for the search
'I can tell you I think fairly well that it's after,' Jubelin said, 'and it's around 10.40 or 10.45 that you first speak with Anne Maree.
'Anne Maree said when she speaks with you there, she sees and hears a male that is [the foster father].'
Quizzed further about when she went down the road to search for William, the foster mother conceded 'it must have been by myself', adding: 'And I got in mum's...'
This could be a reference to the fact that, as police later claimed, SD drove her mother's car on the morning William disappeared down to Batar Creek Road, which became the site of a massive search for the boy's remains in late 2021.
Jubelin asked the foster mother why she had deleted all the text messages sent to her from the foster father over a certain period, including the day William disappeared.
In particular, he wanted to know why she had deleted the text message JS had sent saying he was on his way home at a time when William had just disappeared.
The foster mother said it was not unusual for her to delete messages she deemed unimportant - such as a text from her husband saying he was coming home. There is no suggestion her deleting texts had anything to do with William's disappearance.
'I keep messages. I'm keeping messages that remind me to do things,' SD said.
'But a message that [the foster father] sends me to say I'm home in five minutes, I'm not going to keep that.
'I mean even though William was missing, it didn't strike me as being a milestone message or any important message that I needed to keep. I mean how many messages had I deleted?'
Jubelin proposed various scenarios of accident and cover-up that could have explained why William disappeared and has never been found.
None of these scenarios has ever been proven, and the foster parents have always denied any wrongdoing.
He put to SD that 'perhaps William... fell from the balcony, fell from a tree, injured and you've panicked and [the foster grandmother] has panicked and you've covered it up for fear of losing [William's sister].'
The foster mother replied: 'No, no, never, never. The only way he would have fallen from the balcony... he wouldn't have climbed it. We wouldn't have dropped him.
'My mum wouldn't cover that up. If I'd have done something to them, my mother would not cover it up.'
Jubelin speculated: 'Another suggestion... is that your mother became angry at William because of, you know, young kids and something might have happened and you're protecting your mother?'
Gary Jubelin quizzed the foster mother over several scenarios of accident and cover-up, asking if William could have died falling off the balcony, being run over or hit by his foster grandmother
SD responded: 'No, no way. My mother was never violent towards us growing up. I've never seen her be violent.'
William's foster grandmother died in March 2021.
Jubelin then put to SD:  'Another suggestion. William's waiting for [the foster father] to come home... and he's run out on the driveway and it's one of those tragic driveway, young child incidents.
'And there's been discussion and panic that if this happens, even though it's an accident, that we're going to lose [William's sister], but there's nothing we can do for William now.'
No evidence has emerged to support this car accident theory.
The foster mother replied: 'Mmm, mmm. Never, no. Judging from his reaction to me... when I said William's missing... he was pure.'"
FZNQMCPX71_T8BUEK5M6PXUEDC,Cabinet civil war breaks out over UK defence budget as Penny Mordaunt issues stark warning over the decline in the size of the Royal Navy - but Defence Secretary Grant Shapps dismisses her comments as just an 'opinion',Claire Ellicott Whitehall Editor,"Published: 22:27 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 01:52 GMT, 22 January 2024",20240120,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989833/Cabinet-civil-war-breaks-UK-defence-budget-Penny-Mordaunt-issues-stark-warning-decline-size-Royal-Navy-Defence-Secretary-Grant-Shapps-dismisses-comments-just-opinion.html,"Penny Mordaunt triggered a Cabinet row over defence spending yesterday after warning that the Royal Navy must 'keep pace' with Russia and China.
The former defence secretary broke Cabinet convention by warning that the decline in the size of the force over the last century was a threat to British interests.
Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary, dismissed her comments as just an 'opinion' and did not say when defence spending would be increased.
The Royal Navy fleet has reduced from 232 ships, including eight aircraft carriers in 1960, to 30 in 2022, including two new aircraft carriers. There are also warnings that a recruitment crisis could lead to the decommissioning of two ships.
Cabinet ministers are bound by collective responsibility and tend not to intervene in one another's briefs, but Ms Mordaunt, the Commons Leader and an honorary captain in the Royal Navy reserves, issued her warning ahead of the Budget on March 6.
Ex-defence secretary Penny Mordaunt broke Cabinet ranks by warning that the decline of the Royal Navy was a threat to British interests
Grant Shapps, the current Defence Secretary, dismissed her comments as just an 'opinion' and did not say when defence spending would be increased
She said: 'The Royal Navy and its partners must keep pace with the growing capabilities of other nations. If not, Britain's interests cannot be secured.'
In an article in The Sunday Times, she said: 'We must not just ask ourselves by how much Russia and China are increasing their fleets, but why.'
'The future Royal Navy must be able to continue to secure our interests, which are entirely predicated on being able to thwart attempts to deny us access to the seas of certain parts of the world.'
The warning from Ms Mordaunt, a former leadership contender, is not likely to have gone down well with Mr Shapps.
Asked about her comments, he said: 'I'm in a post where there are a lot of people with opinions, and a lot of people who've been in the military and armed forces will often express them.'
Last Monday the Defence Secretary warned that the UK was facing a 'pre-war world' and highlighted risks from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.
He was asked about the Conservative pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, but failed to provide a date.
The Royal Navy has shrunk to just 30 ships, down from over 200 in the 1960s
Mr Shapps has previously called for defence spending to be increased to 3 per cent of GDP. However, he defended the Chancellor's plans to cut taxes ahead of the Budget, saying 'people do want to see more of the money that they earn kept'.
Lord Dannatt, a former chief of the general staff of the British Army, warned last week that army numbers had fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today. But Mr Shapps insisted the size of the army would not dip below 73,000 under the Tories.
He also called on Europe to 'step up' and give Ukraine more funding after the UK provided a new financial package for the country.
He told Ms Kuenssberg: 'Britain has, again, as with all of those other things, led the way with a £2.5billion package and a security agreement, a cooperation agreement with President Zelensky and Ukraine. Now... not just America, but Europe needs to step up and do their part to make sure Ukraine can continue to defend herself.'
The spending row also comes amid soaring tensions in the Middle East following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war."
G1929O2M6Q_SY0CJ6BOQRD1P8W,America's 'swatting' surge: Cops to seek DECADES-LONG jail terms to halt dangerous craze after five-fold rise at schools and Jewish centers - and high-profile targets from White House to Selena Gomez,"James Reinl, Social Affairs Correspondent, For Dailymail.Com","Published: 14:21 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 14:21 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12969363/swatting-jail-schools-jewish-centers-white-house-selena-gomez.html,"The hoax 'swatting' call that saw firefighters dispatched to the White House this week was just the latest example of a growing scourge that risks lives and wastes police time and resources.
A caller to 911 early Monday morning sounded the alarm about a fire and a person trapped inside the Washington DC landmark.
'It was quickly determined there was no emergency,' a fire service spokesperson said. The bogus call was traced to a fake number. President Joe Biden spent the weekend at Camp David and wasn't present at the time.
The brazen hoax, directing crews to such a beloved and historic property, highlighted the scale of America's rising swatting incidents — which by some counts has exploded fivefold in recent years.
An LAPD swat team arrive at the scene of an armed robbery. Prank 'swatting' calls make cops less able to respond to real emergencies
The Education School Safety Network says hoax calls about mass shooters have become the most frequent violent problem faced by America's schools
Selena Gomez, Tom Cruise, Miley Cyrus, Ashton Kutcher, and other celebrities have been targeted in swatting hits that stretch back to the start of the 2010s.
But, in America's toxic political atmosphere, trouble-making callers are nowadays more likely to call out gun-toting cops to the home of a government official or decision-maker.
Recent targets have included Republican Senator Rick Scott, House representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Brandon Williams, and a prosecutor and judges involved in the cases against former president Donald Trump.
'Last month, criminals attempted a 'swatting' on my home in Florida,' Scott wrote in a statement on Wednesday.
It was a 'despicable act of cowardice, clearly intending to terrorize my family and inflict fear and violence,' he added.
Scott and his Alabama counterpart Tommy Tuberville this week unveiled a bill to amend the federal government's criminal hoax statute and establish strict penalties for swatting.
The Preserving Safe Communities by Ending Swatting Act, as it is known, could land hoax callers behind bars for up to 20 years, if their misdeeds led to serious injuries.
'This is happening around the nation, not just to elected officials, but also to hundreds of Jewish institutions,' Scott said. 'It's sickening, dangerous and we must stop it.'
Swatting is a dangerous criminal hoax where a false report of an emergency, crime, mass shooting, imminent bombing, or kidnapping is made to police with the goal of luring them to a target location.
The goal is typically to cause the deployment of a heavily armed police unit — often referred to as SWAT teams because of the 'special weapons and tactics' they use against armed adversaries.
Law enforcement is frequently advised falsely there is a threat inside a home, putting those inside the property in danger during a heavy-handed response.
Swatting attempts have increased in recent years as a form of online harassment and often target celebrities, political figures and internet livestreams.
Swatting has been on the FBI's radar for nearly two decades, and gained notoriety after high-profile celebrities were targeted in the early 2010s.
Studying what was then a 'new phenomenon' in 2008, FBI researchers said swatters were motivated by 'bragging rights and ego' rather than making money.
House Republican firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene says she's been a swatting victim eight times
Selena Gomez (pictured), Tom Cruise, Miley Cyrus, and Ashton Kutcher are among the celebrity victims of swatting
But those motivations have evolved over time.
Some swatters nowadays make bogus calls because they foster personal or political grievances and want to disrupt operations at a targeted school, college, house of worship or business.
Others seek to divert law enforcement resources away from other crimes, or have worked out some way to make money from a hoax.
Kevin Coffey, an LAPD detective-turned-safety consultant, says swatting has become a modern-day scourge that amounts to 'digital terrorism.'
'These digital hoaxes are turning others' lives upside down, and even, in some cases, causing deaths,' Coffey told Fox News.
For some, swatting is a way to settle scores amid heated debates over abortion and other issues, he said.
They want to 'take revenge on political individuals, people in the government, celebrities, and even journalists and people active in their communities, and law enforcement has to respond in force at full capacity,' Coffey added.
Swatting calls have had fatal consequences, after tactical units show up at homes with their fingers on triggers.
Wichita police erroneously shot and killed 28-year-old Andrew Finch at his front door in December 2017.
The call had been made over a row about an online video game.
Mark Herring, 60, died from a massive heart attack after police swarmed his home in Sumner County, Tennessee.
Schools in southern Florida have suffered a spate in disruptive swatting calls in recent weeks
Democrat Chuck Schumer calls swatting 'dangerous, disturbing and downright terrifying'
In June, the FBI launched a national database to track swatting incidents following a push from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
The New York Democrat called the attacks 'dangerous, disturbing and downright terrifying.'
Watchdogs have reported alarming rises in the number of swatting attacks.
The Secure Community Network, which monitors anti-Semitic attacks, in December recorded what it called a 'staggering' 199 swatting calls and bomb hoaxes targeting Jewish facilities in a single 24-hour period.
They were linked to the outrage over Israel's tough response to Hamas's bloodbath raids into southern Israel in October, the group said.
The group recorded more than 449 such attacks throughout 2023 – a more than fivefold increase on the 83 incidents in 2023.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, wants tougher jail terms to deter would-be swatters
Swatting had become a 'major concern for the safety and security of the Jewish community in North America, the group's national director Michael Masters said in a statement.
At the same time, the Education School Safety Network, warned that hoax calls about mass shooters had become the most frequent violent problem faced by America's schools.
The group counted 446 such false reports in the 2022-2023 school year — a more than fivefold surge on the 69 such incidents during the 2018-2019 school year.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said it was clear that 'swatting calls are on the rise.'
Politicians should get behind the draft Republican bill to put swatters behind bars for decades.
'Stricter penalties act as a deterrent,' Johnson said."
G3HSEMLRJZ_OOTSYWSXDULLRKR,Strokes of Lark! THOUSANDS of Brits go mudlarking in the filthy banks of the River Thames for hidden treasure - from 500-year-old coins and a human skull to a 19th century figurine from the Congo… but if you want to join them you might have to wait,Lettice Bromovsky,"Published: 09:07 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 09:38 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12982899/mudlarking-brits-searching-river-thames-hidden-treasure.html,"Every year thousands of Brits go mudlarking in the River Thames with the hope of finding hidden treasures dredged up from centuries gone by.
However budding mudlarkers have had their dreams put on hold for over 14 months, since the Port of London Authority suspended all new permits in November 2022 over concerns about the impact of the hobby on the environment.
It claimed then, that applications had gone up from only around 200 'four or five years ago' to around 5000, which they suspected was due to social media trends bringing in a new wave of enthusiasts.
While the suspension remains in place, newcomers can expect 'an announcement on future arrangements later in the year.'
Although now it is seen a popular pastime, the original mudlarkers were the poor peasants of London, who traipsed through the banks in search of items they could resell, such as bits of rope or nails.

She also found a rare magical figure from 19th century Africa after it washed up on the banks of the River Thames

Mudlarking as a profession started in the late 18th and then into the 19th century, and was the name given to people scavenging for things on the riverbank and selling them.
These original mudlarks were often children, mostly boys, who would earn a few pennies selling things like coal, nails, rope and bones that they found in the mud at low tide.
They are described as 'pretty much the poorest level of society, scrabbling around on the foreshore trying desperately to make a living' by Meriel Jeater, curator in the Department of Archaeological Collections and Archive at the Museum of London.
A mudlark's income was very meagre, and they were renowned for their tattered clothes and terrible stench. A mudlark was a recognised occupation until the early 20th century.

However the discoveries have continued to flood in from permit holders, just this week 52-year-old Steve Tomlinson discovered a piece of tanned leather dating back to 2,500 BC making it the oldest ever found in the UK.
The archaeologist and father of two was mudlarking in North Kent when he stumbled across a piece of leather - just 21cm long - poking out of the mud.
Carbon dating determined to it to be 4,488 to 4,600 years old. This would date it as being from 2578 BC - 2466 BC, placing it in the Neolithic period, around the same time as when Stonehenge was built.
Mr Tomlinson from Birchington said: 'Extraordinary, to think that this dates Stonehenge is absolutely incredible. These items just don't survive unless they are in anaerobic conditions.
'This is a really big and amazing discovery. To find the Bronze Age shoe and then a bit of Neolithic leather is extremely rare.
'It is so rare that it is on the top rarity scale. To find those was just amazing and what a future they have. They will be researched by future generations.'
Analysis is still ongoing, but experts believe that the leather is likely from an old bag or water bottle due to the red staining which suggests it has been waterproofed.
Six months earlier he had found the shoe just 60ft away from the spot on the Thames Estuary where he made his latest discovery.
Carbon dating revealed that the piece was a 3,000-year-old shoe from 888-781 BC, in the late Bronze Age, which would make it the oldest shoe ever found in the British Isles.
It was a toddler's shoe measuring in at around 15 centimetres and is the smallest shoe from this period found in the world.
He said: 'Obviously I was in a bit of shock to say the least. I didn't expect that result.
'Absolutely gobsmacked by it, it has really been absolutely fantastic. This has been a great experience we have got two records.'

Steve added: 'Just imagine some little kid 3,000 years ago was wearing this little shoe and some neolithic person who has made this water bottle or bag was carrying it around at the time of Stonehenge it is absolutely crazy.
'You can't really get your head around it to be honest because materials like this just don't survive. For this to be washed up it is just extraordinary.
'To get one was crazy to get two I can't put it into words to be honest.'
He is speaking with the British Museum about what the next steps will be for these pieces.
However, it is not just a sport for professionals, a rare arrowhead may have been fired from the Tower of London as much as 900 years ago was found by an amateur archaeologist.
Monika Buttling-Smith, 33, found the longbow arrowhead downstream from the fortress in the River Thames.
The 2in by 5in point is damaged, suggesting it may have hit its target - whether raiders or during target practice by English soldiers preparing to go and fight in France or the Crusades.
The arrowhead is believed to date to between 1100-1300, which means it could have been fired during the turbulent reigns of Richard the Lionheart and his brother King John.
Nicola White, a professional 'mudlarker' found a rare magical figure from 19th century Africa on the banks of the River Thames was stunned to find it could be worth thousands of pounds.
Experts believe the bizarre-looking but well-preserved 12ins figure of a wooden dog with metal nails protruding from its torso originated from the Congo in the late 1800s.
It would have been used by natives as a 'mediator' between the spirit world and the dead, allowing supernatural forces to intervene in human affairs.

Exactly how it ended up there is a mystery. One theory is that it was confiscated by Christian missionaries to Africa as evidence of sorcery and brought back to Britain.
The mother-of-two said: 'The tide was out so it was half way up the bank - it was quite high up with other pieces of wood, plastic and rubbish.
'First of all I was afraid to take it as it looked like a Voodoo doll and I didn't want to disturb it.
'But then a professor I know looked at photos and told me it was an important piece of art - he thinks it is a late 19th century Nkisi Nkondi from the Congo.

The theft came after an old mob associate led him to believe the famous shoes must be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value.
Terry Jon Martin's defense attorney finally revealed the 76-year-old's motive for the 2005 theft from the Judy Garland Museum in the late actor's hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in a new memo filed ahead of his January 29 sentencing in Duluth, Minnesota.
The FBI recovered the shoes in 2018 when someone else tried to claim an insurance reward on them, but Martin wasn't charged with stealing them until last year.
Martin pled guilty in October to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum door and display case to take the slippers.
Terry Jon Martin, an aging, reformed mobster who admitted to stealing the pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in The Wizard of Oz gave into the temptation of 'one last score,' is seen here in October 2023
Pictured: A pair of ruby slippers once worn by actress Judy Garland in the 'The Wizard of Oz' on display. Garland wore several pairs of ruby slippers during filming of the classic 1939 musical, but only four authentic pairs are known to remain
Martin blamed much of his upbringing for his embarking on a life of crime.
He told how he suffered under a cruel stepmother who mistreated him and his three brothers so badly for several years that he left home at the age of 16 and began drinking and stealing.
While on parole from prison, Martin's girlfriend became pregnant with twins, but he missed their birth after his parole was revoked.
Right after his girlfriend brought the one-month-old twins to prison to meet him, they died after a train struck her vehicle.
'This was truly the turning point in Terry's life - his villain origin story - and the reason he not only went down his dark path but accelerated towards it,' DeKrey wrote.
'His son said it best: ""The twins' death made (my dad) just give up on life; he decided on a life of crime.""'
Garland wore several pairs of ruby slippers during filming of the classic 1939 musical, but only four authentic pairs are known to remain
When it came to the famous ruby slippers, he had hoped to harvest real rubies from the shoes and sell them.
But a fence, a person who deals in stolen goods, informed him the rubies were glass and Martin got rid of the slippers less than two days after he took them, he said.
Defense attorney Dane DeKrey said in his memo that an unidentified former mob associate tempted Martin to steal the shoes, even though he hadn't committed a crime in nearly 10 years after his last prison stint.
'At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a `final score´ kept him up at night,' DeKrey wrote.
'After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse and decided to participate in the theft.'
DeKrey and prosecutors are recommending the judge sentence Martin to time served because he is physically incapable of presenting a threat to society.
Garland's character, Dorothy, has to click the heels of the slippers three times and repeat, 'There's no place like home,' to return to Kansas
Martin is in hospice care with a life expectancy of less than six months.
He needs oxygen at all times because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and was in a wheelchair at his most recent court appearance.
Even if he were sentenced to prison, his poor health might be grounds for a compassionate release.
Martin had no idea about the cultural significance of the ruby slippers and had never seen the movie.
Instead, DeKrey said he was just looking for one last big score, and the 'old Terry' with a lifelong history of crimes like burglary and receiving stolen property beat out the 'new Terry' who seemed to 'finally put his demons to rest' after being released from prison in 1996 and became 'a contributing member of society.'
DeKrey urged the judge to consider the major events of Martin's life when deciding whether a lenient sentence is appropriate.
The ruby slippers are featured throughout the 1939 film
Martin said he had no idea about the cultural significance of the ruby slippers and had never even seen the movie
Martin believed the shoes must be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value according to a new memo filed ahead of his January 29th sentencing in Duluth
Martin's lawyer also said the judge should consider that Martin had not committed any other crimes in nearly a decade before stealing the slippers nor in the years since then.
DeKrey said Martin didn't even try to claim a slice of the insurance reward money when some of his former associates tried to collect.
Garland wore several pairs of ruby slippers during filming of the classic 1939 musical, but only four authentic pairs are known to remain.
The stolen slippers were insured for $1 million, but federal prosecutors put the current market value at about $3.5 million.
The FBI said a man approached the insurer in 2017 and claimed he could help recover them but demanded more than the $200,000 reward being offered.
The slippers were recovered during an FBI sting in Minneapolis.
The FBI has never disclosed how it tracked down the slippers, which remain in the agency's custody.
John Kelsch, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, where Martin stole the precious artwork from in 2005
The slippers were on loan to the museum from Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw when Martin stole them.
Three other pairs worn by Garland in the movie are held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Smithsonian Museum of American History and a private collector.
Several rewards were offered over the years in hopes of figuring out who stole the slippers, which were key props in the film.
Garland's character, Dorothy, has to click the heels of the slippers three times and repeat, 'There's no place like home,' to return to Kansas.
Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4, when her family moved to Los Angeles. She died in 1969.
The Judy Garland Museum, located in the house where she lived, says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and Wizard of Oz memorabilia."
GG8RT69AXO_TXUNE8IGUQNPU7A,Revealed: Muslim schoolgirl who is taking High Court legal action against her teachers after pupils were banned from praying in school playground was suspended last year for threatening to stab girl,"Abul Taher, Security Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday","Published: 00:46 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 00:46 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12987505/Muslim-schoolgirl-taking-High-Court-legal-against-teachers.html,"A Muslim schoolgirl who is taking High Court legal action against her teachers after pupils were banned from praying in the playground was suspended last year for threatening to stab a girl.
Court papers reveal the teenager made the threat soon after confiding in the fellow pupil that she was bringing the court case to 'harm the school'. She was excluded for five days last April after her 'scared' confidante told teachers what the girl had said to her.
The news comes as her headteacher, Katharine Birbalsingh, told The Mail on Sunday last night that she feared for her own safety due to the backlash over the legal case, which the pupil and her mother are funding with legal aid.
The girl is suing Michaela Community School, claiming the ban breached her human rights.
The judgment in the High Court case, which could cost £1million, is expected next month.
The girl's headteacher, Katharine Birbalsingh (pictured), told The Mail on Sunday last night that she feared for her own safety due to the backlash over the legal case
The girl is suing Michaela Community School (pictured), claiming the ban breached her human rights
The controversy was revealed by The Mail on Sunday last year when we told how the school and its staff received bomb threats, death threats and racial abuse after anger was whipped up by extremists following the ban.
The media was able to name the school and the head last week after a judge lifted reporting restrictions.
Michaela in Brent, North-West London, is one of Britain's best-known state schools, and attains some of the best GCSE and A-Level results in the country. It is rated 'excellent' by Ofsted.
Since its foundation in 2014, it has strictly enforced discipline.
The school – half of whose 700 pupils are Muslim – has never provided a prayer room, and pupils did not pray in the past, including the pupil suing the school, who can only be known as TTT.
Last night, in her first newspaper interview about the case, Ms Birbalsingh said of the threats against the school: 'Thousands of people were after us – we were getting the most horrific phone calls and emails, threatening violence and death.'
The head said the school stopped the praying when TTT and others began to intimidate other Muslim pupils, telling them to fast during Ramadan.
She added: 'We believe in promoting cohesion. Too often the Left denies brown and black children the right to be British – they say we are from somewhere else. But we are not. For multi-culturalism to work, everyone needs to feel as though they are British.'"

Researchers from the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford are recruiting volunteers who have had a BCG jab, who will be given a booster that is inhaled.
Scientists hope to prove that inhaling the medication through the lungs – where droplets of TB enter and infect the body – will be better at stimulating the immune system to fight off the disease. The BCG jab is generally given to babies and young children, but is thought to wear off over time.
The UK Health Security Agency announced in September that TB cases in England had increased by seven per cent in the first half of 2023, with 2,408 cases compared with 2,251 in the first half of 2022.
Dr Esther Robinson, head of the TB unit at UKHSA, says: 'Tuberculosis is curable and preventable, but despite significant progress towards elimination in recent years, the disease remains a serious public health issue in the UK.'

A quarter of people referred for diagnostic tests on the NHS face a wait of six weeks or more.
The medical negligence firm Patient Claim Line analysed NHS England data from October 2023 to find that of almost 1.6 million people waiting for tests, 393,583 had been on the list for more than a month-and-a-half. Some 160,000 had faced delays of more than three months.
People seeking urodynamic tests – which analyse how well the bladder can hold and release urine – were the most likely to face lengthy delays, with 42 per cent having to wait six weeks or more.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to help people spot if medicines they have bought are counterfeits.
A smartphone app created by AI firm Cypheme says its detection technology can identify fakes by comparing images of medicine packaging against images of genuine products to check for subtle differences.
Users take a photo on their smartphone of the product they want to evaluate, then upload it on to the AI software ChatGPT to allow Cypheme's software to scan it and instantly reveal whether or not it is genuine.
It is thought that one in ten people in the UK have bought fake medical products in the past year alone as criminal gangs intercept shipments of medicines and switch them for lookalike counterfeits. Those most commonly bought in the UK include erectile dysfunction and weight-loss pills.
It's also much more likely that medicines bought from dodgy websites will be fake. While there's no single method to spotting these, suspicious websites will often be poorly designed with lots of pop-up ads, spelling and grammatical errors and adverts for prescription-only medicines on the homepage – which is illegal in the UK."

The TV star stepped out in her Pacific Palisades neighborhood on Tuesday afternoon to take her dog for a walk, exclusive DailyMail.com photos show.
Long, 74, who starred as bartender Diane Chambers on the classic TV sitcom, appeared glum and lost in thought, keeping her hands in her coat pockets while the pooch sniffed around without a leash.
The actress looked quite unrecognizable from her glamorous Hollywood heyday, sporting large eye glasses and dressed down in gray sweat pants, sneakers and a blue turtleneck.

Long was mysteriously absent on the Emmys stage on Monday where her former Cheers co-stars reunited around a recreated set of the show's iconic bar.
It is not known why she skipped the get-together where cast members Ted Danson, Rhea Perlman, Kelsey Grammer, John Ratzenberger and George Wendt were all present together in a recreation of the famous set, although Woody Harrelson was also a no-show.
Kirstie Alley, who replaced Long in Season 6, died in 2022.
Cheers ran for 11 seasons from 1982 to 1993, though the show was almost canceled after its first season due to low ratings (74th of 77 primetime shows at the time).
However, it spent eight of its remaining 10 seasons in the top 10, becoming the most-watched show in Season 9.
It earned 28 Emmy Awards from 117 nominations, earning Outstanding Comedy Series nominations all 11 seasons, winning four.
Long was nominated for an Emmy five times, winning in 1991. She also won an Emmy three years later for her role in the special David's Mother in which she played the title role, the parent of an autistic boy.
Long's character's on-again, off-again romance with former Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (played by fellow Emmy winner Ted Danson) kept the show on the top of the ratings chart year after year.
Shelley quit at the end of Season 5 in 1986, believing her character had run its course.

But she reprised her Cheers role to appear as a guest character on Frasier opposite on-screen love interest Kelsey Grammer.
In his 1995 biography 'So Far' Kelsey claimed Shelley was unpopular with producers on Cheers.
He claimed producers grew tired of her constant complaints about his own character and plotlines.
Long found fame playing the intellectual barmaid in the 1980s sitcom but has also appeared in a string of other hit shows and movies including, The Money Pit, Troop Beverly Hills, Hello Again, and The Brady Bunch Movie.
The Hollywood star, who has been divorced twice and is a mother of one, has lived in a $1.3million condo in the upscale West Los Angeles enclave of Pacific Palisades, California, since divorcing her second husband Bruce Tyson in 2004.
But according to locals, she is rarely seen out and about."

Eddie Dempsey, assistant general secretary of the RMT Union, called Israel's war on Hamas terrorists in Gaza a 'genocide' during an online interview with Stop The War Coalition on Friday night.
He revealed plans for strike action by Royal Fleet Auxiliary sailors, who are vital in the resupply of ships conducting strikes against Houthi terrorists attacking Israel-bound cargo ships off the coast of Yemen in support of Hamas.
Mr Dempsey said: 'How insane it is we are bombing a former colony [Yemen] in support of a genocide, supposedly to protect shipping...

'So our members are in danger because of the absolutely insane rhetoric we are seeing from Western politicians and the actions of our Government deciding to bomb Yemen along with the United States.
'I have to report to you that we are balloting our members for industrial action in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.' His comments provoked fury from politicians and former military chiefs last night.
Admiral Lord West, a former head of the Royal Navy, said: 'It's an extraordinary and very dangerous thing to do, for a union to decide what is going to be a government's policy or not.'
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, an ex-soldier, added: 'I never thought a trade union would put the lives of members of Armed Forces at risk. I think it's shameful.'

Last night, an RMT spokesman claimed that the strike ballot of RFA members was about pay, despite Mr Dempsey's comments to Stop The War Coalition.

Prince Mario-Max website boasts connections stretching back to William of Orange, which would make him a very, very distant cousin of the British Royals.
But his royal connections have been questioned with the head of the family, Prince Alexander of Schaumburg-Lippe, accusing him of 'harvesting our name for personal gain' and warning Harry to 'stay away from this man'.
The 46-year-old was on the German version of Celebrity Big Brother in 2014 where he was evicted after just eight days inside the house, as well as appearing on a shopping channel to sell a 'wealth elixir'.

Mario-Max – who claims he has the right to use the royal title after he was adopted by a distant relative of the family when he was 23 years old – has been dubbed 'the King of Trash TV' in the German Press for appearing on the local version of Big Brother, and hawking products on shopping channels including a so-called 'wealth elixir'.
He is also a regular visitor to America, where he has posed for photos with celebrities including Paris Hilton, Liza Minnelli and Ivana Trump at parties and red-carpet events, and where he once dated one of the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.
On Friday he immediately posted the photo of himself with Prince Harry – as featured on our front page – on social media. It attracted comments including: 'So cringe. Two irrelevant middle-aged men without serious pursuit using their titles to grift in superficial Hollywood,' and 'I'm embarrassed for both of you. This must be a joke.'
Speaking about meeting Harry, Mario-Max told The Mail on Sunday: 'We had a personal conversation and he was fabulous, very humble, very sweet. It filled me with joy.'
The Duke of Sussex was inducted into the 'Living Legends of Aviation' on Friday night where he was asked by host John Travolta about his first flight experience.

A statement on its website said: 'Prince Harry is a humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate and environmentalist.
'He has dedicated his life to advancing causes that he is passionate about and that bring about permanent change for people and places.'
Harry, who was sporting a black velvet tuxedo, was inducted alongside US navy pilot Fred George and former world speed record holder Steve Hinton, as well as Lauren Sanchez - who is engaged to Amazon founder Bezos.
She received the Elling Halvorson Vertical Flight Hall of Fame Award for her skills as a helicopter pilot and aviation businesswoman, having founded aerial filming company Black Ops Aviation in 2016.

Among those congratulating Harry on the award was Prince Mario-Max Schaumburg-Lippe of Germany, who appeared on the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.
On Instagram, he said: 'Congratulations To HRH Prince Harry for his very much deserved Living Legends of Aviation Award... Well Done.'
The King has served in both the RAF and the Royal Navy.
During his second year at Cambridge University he was given flying lessons by the RAF and the then prince started training as a jet pilot on 8 March, 1971.
He passed out at RAF Cranwell and joined the Royal Navy.
After a six-week course at Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth, he served on the guided missile destroyer HMS Norfolk as well as on two frigates – HMS Minerva and HMS Jupiter.
In 1974 saw the King qualified as a helicopter pilot and he flew Wessex helicopters with 845 Naval Air Squadron from aircraft carrier HMS Hermes.
He ended his Royal Navy service in late 1976 after taking command of coastal minehunter HMS Bronington.

Spencer, 59, who lives on the family estate, Althorp in Northamptonshire, took to Instagram yesterday to share a selection of newspaper cuttings about his mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who passed away in 2004.
An article announcing the birth of the late Princess Diana, Charles' younger sister, is also seen nestled in the memory box filled with pictures.
One of the photographs, captioned 'Lord and Lady Althorp's third daughter christened,' showed the mother of the Prince of Wales, 42, and Duke of Sussex, 39, as a newborn.
Diana is wrapped in a white blanket while her parents proudly look down at her.

Earl Spencer, who still resides at the family home, Althorp in Northamptonshire, shared the photo of his late sister, who was killed aged 36 in a car crash in Paris in 1997
Charles captioned the post: 'Remembering my mother, with love and gratitude, on what would have been her 88th birthday.'
Hundreds flocked to the comment section to support Charles and to offer his mother a happy 'heavenly birthday'.
Frances Shand Kydd wed the 8th Earl of Spencer in 1954 at 18 before divorcing in 1969.
In 1968, Frances lost a custody battle for Diana, Charles and their sisters Jane and Sarah and tried again in 1971 to regain custody of Johnnie Spencer but lost again.
The mother of Diana went to live with her new husband in Scotland after losing her first custody battle for her children, in which she was dubbed 'the bolter'.
Diana and her mother had a rocky relationship and weren't on speaking terms before she died in 1997.

In his Instagram stories, Earl Spencer also posted a photo of himself with his older sister Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia McCorquodale
It comes after the announcement that Princess Diana's brother will open up about the 'trauma' of being sent to boarding school aged eight in his highly anticipated memoir - which multiple outlets have dubbed as one to watch in 2024.
Earl Spencer will recount the 'culture of cruelty' he experienced at Maidwell Hall, a preparatory school in Northampton, and provide 'important insights into an antiquated boarding system' in A Very Private School, set for release in March.
The Guardian has flagged it on a list of 'nonfiction to look out for' this year - alongside titles including Salman Rushdie's Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder - to add to the 'the now many literary denunciations of boarding school'.
It is also listed as one of the 'best' picks for this year by The Independent, and suggested as an anticipated memoir by the BBC.
The Financial Times have recommended it in their article on what to read in 2024.
According to Gallery Books - an imprint of publishing company Simon & Schuster - Charles will 'presents a candid reckoning with his past and a reclamation of his childhood'.
A post on their Instagram in October added: 'A Very Private School offers a clear-eyed, first-hand account of a culture of cruelty at the school Charles Spencer attended in his youth and provides important insights into an antiquated boarding system.'
Leaving for boarding school aged eight, Charles had six months of sleepless nights before heading to Maidwell Hall, where pupils judged to be stupid or lazy were 'really unpleasantly' beaten with a cane on their bare buttocks.

'I said I wanted to go to a state school because it must be preferable to 13-week blocks away in a rather cold and unpleasant place,' he told TES magazine.
'To be totally candid, I think, coming from my background, teachers had absolutely no expectations of me,' he said.
'They just thought I'd be fine in life anyway. I was lucky enough to drift through.'
But the school's former headmaster John Paul has previously suggested that Earl Spencer may have exaggerated how bad his time there was.
'He's been in constant touch with the school ever since, so I don't think he could have been that unhappy,' Mr Paul said in 1992.
And it would seem that Charles's experiences at Maidwell Hall would stick with him decades later.
'Fifty years ago tonight, I spent my first ever night away from my family,' he wrote in a post on X in 2022.
'I was 8, & I'd been sent away to boarding school. It was part of a family tradition. 12 September 1972 has been with me ever since.
'I have 7 children. None of them have been forced to go to boarding school.'
Rather than going to state school, Charles headed to Eton College, during which time his sister Diana married Prince Charles when she was 20 years old.
He then gained a place at Magdalen College, Oxford to study modern history but admitted he committed very little time to his degree."

In fact it was business as usual for her Early Years 'taskforce' last week, which held a discussion at Kensington Palace on the day of her abdominal surgery.
Last Tuesday, bosses from some of the country's biggest firms came together to work on Kate's campaign to prioritise early childhood in society.
The taskforce, created by the Princess last March, is working on a report into how businesses can support young children as part of her Shaping Us project.

Kensington Palace briefed media last year that the taskforce's report would be the Princess's 'biggest thing' to happen after Christmas , but aides now say the findings are likely to be published 'later this spring' (File Photo)
This means the report will likely coincide with, and be central to, her return to Royal duties after Easter.
Yesterday, the Princess remained in hospital at The London Clinic as she recovered from her op. Some had expected her three children to visit her in hospital, but it is understood that, in line with the Princess's wishes, they attended school at Lambrook in Berkshire.
Unlike her father-in-law, King Charles, who is set to go under the knife for an enlarged prostate, Kate will only consider whether to talk about the procedure after she has recovered."

Reality star Kerry, 43, and former glamour model Katie, 45, have been friends for years after appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! together in 2004.
The pair met spent New Year's Eve together and it's now emerged Kerry is determined to help Katie get over any heartache following her split from Carl.
A source told Closer magazine: 'In the past, when she's been single, Katie has been known to go a bit wild as a bit of a coping mechanism, so pals are hoping she won't be heading into trouble again.
'Kerry has really been encouraging Katie to slow down a bit and look after herself.'

The insider added: 'Katie leans quite heavily on Kerry for support and guidance, and Kerry wants to help Katie continue to turn her life around this year.
'Katie had some low moments in 2023 and it's heartbreaking that she doesn't seem able to move on.'
It is claimed Kerry will be 'blunt, honest and candid' with Katie if she feels she needs to be to keep her on the right track, with the source insisting: 'Kerry doesn't take any rubbish.'
MailOnline has contacted representatives for Katie and Kerry for comment.
Katie and Kerry rang in the New Year together putting their former feud to bed.
Television personality Katie took to Instagram to share a video of the pair partying together, teasing in the clip that she was 'spending new year with her longest bestie ever' before turning the camera on Kerry.
Katie made the surprise announcement that she was single in the video.
She was last spotted with Carl on December 21 last year as they stepped out arm in arm together after her pantomime performance of Sleeping Beauty in Liverpool.

Katie and Carl previously split towards the end of November and unfollowed each other on Instagram but appeared to have reconciled for the Liverpool outing before going their separate ways once again.
Days later, Carl took a swipe at his ex-fiancée Katie Price as he posed while embracing a mystery woman's legs, adorned with a tattoo reading 'Game Over'.
The car dealer, 34, had been enjoying a Thailand getaway with his friends, during which he crouched down to the ground holding the woman's legs as she stood from behind.
He showed off the bold tattoos on his companion's legs, displaying the words 'Game Over' on the back of her thighs as she wore mini denim shorts.
Smouldering into the lens, Carl repeated the words in his caption, in an apparent nod to his relationship status with the star.
In July last year, Katie and Carl were said to be planning a secret wedding, with Katie snapped trying on a gorgeous white gown a few months later in November.
The pair have been in a turbulent relationship since July 2020, getting engaged the following April.
But things were said to be going full steam ahead with wedding plans, with Katie said to be keen to run off and 'elope' with Carl as a source claimed she 'loves the thrill of getting married'.
It comes after Carl took a swipe at his ex Katie as he posed while embracing a mystery woman's legs, adorned with a tattoo reading 'Game Over'
However, the TV personality's wedding plans do not include her mother Amy, with it said that she won't tell her when she gets married due to her disapproval of Carl.
A source told OK! magazine: 'Katie is planning on having a secret wedding with Carl, then a big party afterwards. It will be soon. She loves the thrill of getting married and wants to do it again.'
Sharing further details on their plans, they went on: 'Katie's keen to run off and wed Carl at a registry office. The kids will be there, but she won't tell her mum until it's done.
'Katie knows Amy would be fuming and tell her not to do it. She keeps suggesting to Carl they elope to Gretna Green.'
Katie has been married three times. She was married to Peter Andre for four years, and then tied the knot with Alex Reid in 2010.
They split after 11 months of marriage and Katie went on to marry Kieran Hayler in 2013, but they broke up in 2018.
Now, the former Celebrity Big Brother winner has revealed why she's reluctant to get married again, and claims the men she has dated just 'want to be famous'.
On The Katie Price Show podcast, Katie's sister Sophie asked: 'Would you get married again?' Katie replied: 'The trouble is, it costs ME money to get married and it costs ME money to get divorced.
Car dealer Carl and Katie split last year, with Katie announcing the news on social media on New Year's Eve (pictured together in November 2023)
'So I haven't really been in a good situation, so for me to get married again, they have to tick the right boxes, or they have to have more to lose than me because I'm just sick of these cling-ons that turn into Mr Price's and then want to be famous and all of this. I'm just sick of it, I just want to meet someone who wants me for me...
'But yeah I would get married, shall we organise it, of course I would bloody get married again, I want a fairytale. Yes, I would get married again and I want the full shebang.
'I just want it to be right, I never wanted to get divorced and marry again and again.
'To have that one person, no drama, there's nothing worse than when your family don't get on with them. I like to be settled, when I'm settled then everything else goes good.'"

Your questions about the skin cancer answered after Sarah Ferguson's diagnosis - including how to check your moles,Elena Salvoni,"Published: 22:10 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 23:23 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12989621/melanoma-skin-cancer-Sarah-Ferguson-diagnosis-moles-questions.html,"Sarah Ferguson has been diagnosed with the most serious type of skin cancer - a malignant melanoma.
The Duchess of York, 64, had a mole removed from her body while undergoing breast reconstruction surgery last year, one of which was found to be cancerous.
The cancer occurs after the DNA in skin cells is damaged, triggering mutations that can form malignant tumours - which can be deadly.
Around 17,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma each year, according to the latest figures published on the Cancer Research UK website.
There is an annual average of 2,300 deaths from the skin cancer, according to the charity, with it accounting for around 1 per cent of cancer deaths.
Here, MailOnline looks at what melanoma is, how to spot it and how to prevent it.

Malignant melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that begins in melanocytes (file image)
What is malignant melanoma?
Malignant melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that begins in melanocytes, cells found in the upper layer of skin that produce melanin, which gives skin its colour.
It is typically caused by harmful UV rays and then not repaired so it triggers mutations that can form malignant tumours.
While less common that other types of skin cancer, it is more dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs more rapidly if it is not treated at an early stage.
What causes melanoma?
How do I prevent it?
How do I check for it?
Check your skin for any unusual changes. Use a mirror or ask a partner or friend to check any areas you cannot see.
In particular, look for:
What signs should I look for in my moles?
Cancer Research UK recommends following its ABCDE approach when checking your moles.
A - Asymmetrical - look at the shape of the mole
B - Border - look at the edges of the mole
C - Colour - Look at the colour of the mole
D - Diameter - Look at how wide the mole is
E -  Evolving - Check it regularly to see if it is changing
It's important to examine your skin every month and visit your GP regularly for a skin examination (file image)
How can melanoma be treated?
Removal
This can be done by removing the entire section of the tumor or by the surgeon removing the skin layer by layer.
When a surgeon removes it layer by layer, this helps them figure out exactly where the cancer stops so they don't have to remove more skin than is necessary.
Skin grafting
The patient can decide to use a skin graft if the surgery has left behind discoloration or an indent.
Immunotherapy, radiation treatment or chemotherapy
This is needed if the cancer reaches stage III or IV. That means that the cancerous cells have spread to the lymph nodes or other organs in the body."

Enclosed shopping centers where millions of American teenagers spent their youth are giving way to open air retail, experts say",Neirin Gray Desai Consumer Reporter For Dailymail.Com,"Updated: 13:16 GMT, 22 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-12965653/mall-retailers-strip-centers.html,"Classic noughties movies like Mean Girls and Superbad have portrayed American shopping malls as bustling hives of teenage social life.
But it's getting harder than ever for high schoolers to enjoy those nostalgic traditions because retailers are increasingly turning their backs on indoor shopping venues.
Instead, they are looking to open air strip malls, which experts say are experiencing a revival across the US.
'The demand for open air retail has never been higher,' said Chris Ressa, host of the podcast Retail Retold and chief operating officer of real estate firm DLC Management.
He said the transition has been catalyzed by the Covid pandemic and the rise of working from home, which decreased footfall in downtown areas where indoor malls are more common.
Retailers are increasingly turning their backs on indoor shopping venues. Pictured is the Brickell City Centre shopping mall Miami, Florida
Four Mean Girls protagonists stand in the Old Orchard Mall. The film was released in 2004
Strip malls first came around in the years after the Second World War with the expansion of suburban living and the automobile.
Now, as consumers spend more time anchored to their homes and less to their place of work, strip malls are an inexpensive and practical option for retailers that want to get as close as possible to customers, according to Ressa.
'Generally speaking, open air retail is more cost effective,' he said, noting that there are no common areas requiring upkeep and that access makes it easier to move stock in and out of the store.
That ease of access is also a benefit to shoppers who order online and only want to visit the store to pick up their goods since they can drive up and enter with ease.
'If you only want to go to one store in an enclosed mall, it's a challenge,' said Ressa. 'You've got to park, get out and traverse the entire mall to get there.'
A study by Capital One Shopping Research in June found that indoor mall vacancy rates are more than twice those of other US retail spaces. It cites projections that of the estimated 1,150 malls in the US there may be just 150 remaining by 2032.
While customers may be enthusiastic about the convenience of outdoor malls, they are not necessarily giving up the social element altogether, according to Ressa.
'I think they're getting the best of both worlds,' he said.

One famous scene from Mean Girls shows Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams, pull up in her car and quip to Lindsay Lohan's Cady Heron: 'Get in loser, we're going shopping'.
Such mall outings may still viable today, despite the lack of a climate-controlled environment that traditional wisdom indicated increased shoppers 'dwell time'.
Open air malls are now offering more and more space for leisure and socializing, whether that be in the form of fitness studios like Orangetheory, or restaurants that offer outdoor dining.
Green spaces to sit and convene are also standard in proposals by real estate developers for modern open air shopping centers.
One of the country's once-bustling malls to have fallen is the Westfield in downtown San Francisco. Last year an analysis by the San Francisco Standard revealed 45 out of the 97 retailers operating there in 2020 had since closed.
The exodus from malls often comes in the wake of departures by big department stores, which serve as 'anchor tenants' and provide a critical chunk of revenue to mall operators.

That can also have the knock-on effect of causing nearby businesses with less of their own pull to suffer too.
In November, Macy's said it would accelerate the opening of 'small format' stores outside of city centers after successful trials of the new model.
In 2020, the retailer - known for its larger stores in urban malls - began opening smaller 'Market by Macy's' locations, around a fifth of the size, in suburban shopping centers.
Foot Locker is experimenting with a variation on the same strategy. Its CEO Richard Johnson said during an earnings call in September that it was looking for the right ways to 'pivot out of malls'."

The Sea Viper Air Defence system will get more effective missiles featuring a new warhead and a software update that will enable it to defeat ballistic missile threats.
It will help protect the Navy's Carrier Strike group and allows tracking, targeting and destruction of a variety of air threats more than 70 miles away.
The £405 million upgrade, awarded to missile systems company MBDA UK, will help sustain 350 skilled jobs across the country and be complete by 2032.
The contracts will make Sea Viper 'the most capable naval air defence system ever developed for the Royal Navy', the Government said as Houthi attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea continue.
It is hoped the upgrade will help Navy ships to better deal with more complex threats in future.

The Houthis, backed by Iran, have been attacking ships in the Red Sea since November, purportedly in support of Gazans.
The US and UK have repeatedly warned the Houthis to stop attacking the vital shipping route and last week they took action with an airstrike.
The strikes saw over 100 missiles launched at more than 60 targets across 16 locations in Yemen, including an airbase, airports and a military camp, officials said.
Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: 'As the situation in the Middle East worsens, it is vital that we adapt to keep the UK, our allies and partners safe.
'Sea Viper has been at the forefront of this, being the Navy's weapon of choice in the first shooting down of an aerial threat in more than 30 years.
'Our strong and enduring relationship with British industry has ensured we can deploy the latest technological capabilities wherever they are required while supporting hundreds of jobs across the country and bolstering UK prosperity.'
Mr Shapps this week visited HMS Diamond in the Red Sea, where it recently used Sea Viper missiles to shoot down multiple Houthi attack drones as part of the US-led international taskforce Operation Prosperity Guardian.
The taskforce currently consists of HMS Diamond, three US destroyers and a French warship.
Rear Admiral Anthony Rimington said: 'A cutting-edge weapon system, Sea Viper continues to provide the Royal Navy with impressive lethality.
'Sea Viper Evolution further enhances this capability against the more complex and evolving threats and strengthens our co-operation and interoperability with key partners.'

This defence boost comes as the UK successfully fired a high-powered laser weapon as fast as the speed of light at an aerial target for the first time.
The DragonFire laser-directed energy weapon was able to hit a £1 coin half a mile away in secret trials.
Its intense beam can cut through targets, such as drones, in its line of sight and defence sources have estimated that each 'shot' costs around £10.
The Army and the Royal Navy are considering using the weaponry as part of future Air Defence missions.
However, it is currently unknown when the DragonFire could enter service.
The weapon system is a £100million collaboration between the Government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and industry partners such as Leonardo and Qinetiq."

Mohamed Ibrahim, 37, and Iris Jones shot to fame in June 2020 when they defied critics and tied the knot despite having a 46-year age gap.
But last September, MailOnline revealed that Iris had thrown him out of her home near Weston-super-Mare after accusing him of being a 'selfish money-grabber' - three years after their wedding.
Just weeks after being dumped, Mr Ibrahim started dating mother-of-11 Angela Rogers, 61, after he won her over with supermarket flowers before they had 'the best sex ever'.
But the Daily Mirror has now revealed that Ms Rogers - who splashed out £5,000 on their relationship - has dumped Mr Ibrahim after she caught him messaging a 69-year-old widow.

Ms Rogers claimed that the toyboy had asked her for money to help finalise his divorce from Ms Jones - and even proposed twice without ever buying a ring.
She told the newspaper: 'He's a freeloader who clearly has a thing about older women. I don't want to see him hurting anyone else.'
Ms Jones left This Morning audiences stunned in early 2020 when she detailed her first night of passion with Mr Ibrahim after she travelled to Egypt to meet him.
The pair married in November that year after meeting through Facebook, but they spent two years apart before he got a UK visa.
After being kicked out by Ms Jones last July, Mr Ibrahim started chatting to Ms Rogers - who had befriended him two years prior on Facebook after reading his story.
Ms Rogers said she contacted Mr Ibrahim to check how he was doing after the break-up and he told her he was 'lonely and depressed' on a video call.
She said he showered her with compliments, telling her she was beautiful and asking to meet up in person.
Ms Rogers, who had been single for 14 years, told the toyboy that he could come and stay in her spare room, but admitted: 'He's the biggest mistake I ever made.'
Mr Ibrahim travelled 225 miles on the train from Somerset to Leeds where he picked Ms Rogers up, swung her round and told her she was his 'Queen'.
He proceeded to buy her flowers and grapes from Marks & Spencer before cooking her up a Spaghetti Bolognese at her flat.
Despite planning to have him stay in the spare room, Ms Rogers admitted that he ended up in her bed.
MailOnline revealed that Iris had thrown him out of her home near Weston-super-Mare after accusing him of being a 'selfish money-grabber'
In early 2020, Iris raised eyebrows when they appeared with Holly and Phil on This Morning – reducing them to hysterics – as she opened up about their first night of passion
'He was telling me I was beautiful and then he said we'd had the best sex he'd ever had in his life,' she told The Daily Mirror.
After just five weeks of visiting Ms Rogers, Mr Ibrahim is said to have proposed on a foot-bridge over the A64 York Road in Leeds. She said no because they hadn't known each other long and he was still married to Ms Jones.
But a couple of months later, Ms Rogers moved into a flat with her new toyboy and contributed £1,800 for new furniture.
Ms Rogers claims that he never offered to pay for anything and that she would fund his clothes, trainers, aftershave, bus fares and meals among other luxuries.
He also allegedly asked her for £800 to pay for his divorce but she refused to hand him the money.
When Mr Ibrahim got down on one knee again in October, Ms Rogers said yes, admitting that he was very charming and persuasive. She said that they would even FaceTime his family in Egypt.
The couple married in November 2020 and they spent almost two years apart before Mohamed was finally granted a visa which allowed him to move into Iris' bungalow in Weston-super-Mare
After being kicked out by Ms Jones last July, Mr Ibrahim started chatting to Ms Rogers - who had befriended him two years prior on Facebook after reading his story
At one point, she even gave him £550 after he told her his father was ill and he needed to visit him in Egypt. He later told her that he had made a miracle recovery and returned to the UK promptly.
Mr Ibrahim repaid her £300 but was soon found to be cheating.
After posting a photo of the pair together, Ms Rogers said she received a message from a 69-year-old widow who claimed that Mr Ibrahim had been chatting to her as well.
A heartbroken Ms Rogers claimed that when she confronted her boyfriend, he became angry and started shouting at her.
She eventually asked Mr Ibrahim to leave and blocked his number after he continued to call her.
Ms Rogers is determined to find out the truth about why he married Ms Jones and why he used them both.
Iris, 83, stunned the nation when she revealed four years ago on ITV's This Morning how she spent hours every week making love with Mohamed Ibriham, 37
She fears that Mr Ibrahim is using women to extend his visa, which runs out in June.
Mr Ibrahim declined to comment to The Mirror and accused Ms Rogers of trying to gain fame with his name.
In a video on social media, he said: 'I moved to the north after I separated with this woman for a few weeks. But I'm back again in my area.'
In another he told women to 'leave me alone'. He said: 'Some idiots, some trollers want to be famous on my back.
'This message is for all women and girls who follow me. Leave me alone.'
When Ms Jones dumped Mr Ibrahim, she wrote a lengthy Facebook post in which she revealed how she had spent thousands of pounds on him while he never paid for anything."

On January 20, friends of Staff Sergeant Michelle Young, 34, shared the news that she had taken her own life. Days earlier, Young shared a post celebrating her daughter Gracie's birthday with her audience of over 100,000 followers.
'Happy birthday to the sweetest girl I’ve ever known,' Young wrote. 'She’s a force to be reckoned with, she’s witty, ambitious, kind, compassionate, intelligent, hardworking, hilarious, and selfless.
'I cried the entire time I made this. I love you forever, kiddo. The best part about my life is being your momma.'
Her death has led to an outpouring of tributes from friends online and on her social media pages.
'Michelle was always so kind to me. We talked often about our daughters and how similar they are,' friend Brianna Hasan wrote. 'I know she loved Gracie more than anything. I cannot believe this happened.'
U.S. Army soldier and influencer Michelle Young, 34, died by suicide just days after her daughter's 12th birthday
Young was a staff sergeant who served two tours in Afghanistan. She enlisted in the Army at 17, returning home at 24, soon after her daughter's second birthday
Friends remembered Young as a doting single mother to 12-year-old Gracie
The Prescott, Arizona, resident enlisted in the Army at 17 years old. She returned from her first deployment seven years later, soon after her daughter's second birthday.
'I was in the military before I became a mother,' Young wrote on Instagram. 'I volunteered for this life, she didn’t. She’s had to be away from her only parent during multiple deployments, TDYs, and training, yet she never complains.'
In October, Young posted a series of photos where she and Gracie - both doting Chiefs fans - dressed up as Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift for Halloween.
The 34-year-old served two tours in Afghanistan, most recently in 2021. That same year, she extended her military contract to serve 20 years. As of September, she had served 16.
In her free time, Young worked as a crisis and trauma response volunteer while also volunteering at a local women's and children's homeless shelter. In one post, she explained that her passion for service was sparked by her own brother's suicide.
'That day forever changed my life, but it also created a passion for helping others that I don’t think I would have had if I didn’t experience the pain of losing him,' Young explained.
Military values ran deep in her family. The soldier often spoke of her grandfather, a Navy veteran who served in WWII.
'Growing up the thought of joining the military never crossed my mind,' the 34-year-old wrote, adding that the only person she knew who had served at the time of her enlistment was her grandfather. 'I didn’t know any women that were in the military.'
The soldier boasted over 100,000 Instagram followers, where she frequently shared photos of her vacations abroad

Young's daughter, Maine explained, 'was her whole world,' and the campaign was organized to help Gracie 'with anything she may need. We know Michelle would appreciate us all looking out for her now.'
It's unclear how or where Young took her life.
Friends left comments under the campaign to honor the soldier.
'Michelle was an angel when I needed it, and I never got to repay her for her kindness on this earthly world. So I’ll do it for her daughter,' Nicole Jimerson wrote.
On Facebook Tatiana Mendes described Young, who was her maid of honor, as her 'best friend.'
'I don’t know how I’m ever going to survive without your light in my life,' Mendes wrote. 'You have touched so many of our lives. The thought of you not around is unfathomable.'
She added: 'I promise you I will be there for Gracie forever and always. Rest in peace my sweet angel.'

JWWIUJXNU2_H6HWAVTKOM3GFPS,Smart motorways were plagued with summer of extended power outages putting drivers' lives at risk,Lettice Bromovsky,"Published: 18:30 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 22:33 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989247/smart-motorways-power-outages-drivers-lives-risk.html,"Smart motorways were plagued with a summer of extended power outages that put drivers' lives at risk, it has been revealed.
The safety systems shut down a total of 41 times last summer, which operate by detecting breakdowns on motorways with no hard shoulder and control the networks CCTV to detect people at risk.
But between April and August 2023, there were electricity supply problems lasting a total of 541 hours across 52 separate days, with eight locations having outages that lasted more than 24 hours.
The data, released under a Freedom of Information request by the Telegraph, revealed that only two of the 41 incidents were resolved in under an hour.
One of the busiest junctions on the M25 had no signs or signals for an entire day.
Sites where National Highways experienced a power outage which lasted more than a day
The safety systems shut down a total of 41 times over the summer in 2023.
Ministers had already paused the construction of new smart motorways, which convert the hard shoulder into another active traffic lane and use variable speed limits, in January 2022
The data records how 'multiple devices' went down in June across three junctions of the M4 in Berkshire for 1 day and 16 hours.
Also that month, the M1 was hit with issues at junction 34 near Sheffield for one day and seven hours.
The longest power outage lasted four days and 22 hours in July on the M6, near Junction 18 in Cheshire.
In April 2023, the Government announced that all new smart motorways would be scrapped due to a lack of confidence from drivers and financial pressures.
Ministers had already paused the construction of new smart motorways, which convert the hard shoulder into another active traffic lane and use variable speed limits, in January 2022.
It pledged not to continue with the rollout until it had five years' worth of safety data from existing schemes.
However, the recent electricity failure mean that the stopped vehicle detection systems were not working, the regional staff were unable to control the signals to set speed limits to slow traffic, the 'Midas' system which alerts controllers to queuing traffic would not work, and CCTV was offline, meaning control room staff could not get 'eyes on' even if alerted by emergency services or motorists to a collision.
Regional operations centres in the East, North East and North West each experienced two shut downs lasting longer than 24-hours.
The power outages meant that the regional staff were unable to control the signals to set speed limits to slow traffic
Roads minister Richard Holden pointed to a £900million investment to tackle issues on existing smart motorways - including the construction of emergency refuge areas
Claire Mercer also pledged to continue pushing for the hard shoulder to return on every road. She is pictured marching in Westminster in Novemeber 2021
The radar system meant to detect live lane breakdowns was logged as not working at 24 locations on 32 separate days over a 129-day period between April 10 and August 16.
It was discovered in April 2023 that the life-saving technology failed to detect stricken motorists as many as 21,100 times on the roads over five years – the equivalent of 12 vehicles a day.
Smart motorways are stretches of road where technology is used to manage traffic slow and reduce congestion.
They also use the hard shoulder as a running lane and using variable speed limits to control the flow of traffic.
There are three main types of smart motorways, these are:
- controlled: these include a permanent hard shoulder and technology such as variable speed limits to adjust traffic flows.
- dynamic: the hard shoulder can be opened up at peak times and used as an extra lane, which would see reduced speed limits.
- all-lane running: permanent removal of the hard shoulder to provide an extra running, with emergency refuge areas provided at regular intervals.
All three types use overhead gantries to direct drivers.
Smart motorways were developed to manage traffic in a way that minimises environmental impact, cost and time to construct by avoiding the need to build additional lanes.  However, concerns have been raised over their safety after a number of crashes.
They make up around 13 per cent of the motorway network in England.
Source: RAC
Live lane breakdowns can happen on smart motorways because their hard shoulder has been removed and turned into an extra lane of traffic.
This put the lives of drivers directly at risk as National Highways staff at regional operations centres are less likely to be alerted to life and death emergencies where motorists do not have hard shoulders to pull onto.
The data showed that the M1 and M6 motorways were the most prone to suffering from the radar system going offline due to localised power outages.
These unexpected outages are in addition to routine and planned system shut downs, which allow engineers to update software or carry out network repairs.
Essential maintenance on Saturday meant stopped vehicle detection was suspended along smart motorways in the North East, North West, East Midlands and West Midlands from 10.30pm for seven-and-a-half hours.
Claire Mercer's husband Jason, 44, was killed on the M1 smart motorway near Sheffield in 2019, told the Telegraph: 'This data is yet more proof that there is a fundamental problem with smart motorways. But, the Government still won't take it seriously.
'Their determination to keep existing smart motorways comes despite numerous deaths of motorists stranded on live lanes, many life-changing injuries, coroners warning of a risk of future deaths, and select committees reports highlighting safety concerns.'
Mrs Mercer has accused the Government of 'stalling' after failing to respond to a smart motorway dossier her lawyers sent ministers containing 'compelling evidence regarding safety concerns', and drew parallels between the Post Office and Horizon scandal and National Highways' and the Government's handling of smart motorways.
'It is telling that the government is the sole stakeholder in both the Post Office and National Highways,' she said.
Andrew Page-Dove, National Highways Operational Control Director, said: 'Smart motorways are designed to operate safely without relying on technology. As with any technology, there are occasional planned and unplanned outages and so we have well-rehearsed procedures to deal with issues which arise.
'We have additional measures to limit any impact on drivers or traffic flow, including increased patrolling by our traffic officers.'"

The newly appointed royal couple appeared happier than in recent weeks, arriving at Aarhus Cathedral with their children: Crown Prince Christian, 18, Princess Isabella, 16, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 13.
Tasmanian-born Mary, 51, stunned in a custom Søren le Schmidt purple coatdress that was created for the coronation of King Charles III last May.
She protected herself from the snowy weather by wrapping up in a cosy shawl and leather gloves, adding a pillbox hat and court shoes to complete the look.
The mother-of-four introduced a hint of sparkle with Bruun Rasmussen diamond earrings, an acquisition from an auction in 2022 that she has worn on several occasions.

Mary is renowned for her fashion choices, often sporting graceful ensembles that have been crafted specifically for her.
Her mid-length coatdress by Søren le Schmidt featured a shawl collar, wrap front and cinched waist, created in a deep violet hue.
This time, the Queen elevated her accessories, choosing leather scalloped gloves and a complementary purple pillbox hat.
Meanwhile, her chestnut tresses were perfectly curled and arranged in a half up-half down hairstyle.
King Frederik, 55, ascended the throne last Sunday after his mother Margrethe abdicated after 52 years as Queen.
A celebratory portrait, photographed from inside the royal Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, was posted to the Danish Royal Family's Instagram page earlier this week.
The image featured the King and Queen, 51, in full regalia, alongside the couple's elegantly dressed four children.
The scandal-laden prince took the Crown to become King of Denmark on January 14 2024, succeeding his 83-year-old mother's phenomenal five-decade reign.

Margrethe's decision to vacate the throne in honour of her eldest son astonished many, as it comes amidst a controversial year for the royals who have been plagued by stripped titles and salacious rumours.
It comes as a resurfaced interview revealed how Queen Mary almost never met then-Prince Frederik.
'The taxi arrived, and I said, 'Oh, all right at the last minute and just got in.'
The interview was conducted in 2004, but was recently republished.
Mary and Frederik's fairytale romance has been under scrutiny in recent weeks however.
King Frederick has faced intense scrutiny since photographs emerged of the then prince enjoying a night out with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova in Madrid last year.
The glamorous socialite strenuously denied claims of a romantic tryst with Frederik, even going as far as to dub them 'malicious'.
However in the newly released image, the monarchs have shown no sign of sweat or adversity, and can be seen beaming excitedly for the camera."

The KIIS FM breakfast presenter, 52, who is known for his centre-right political views, weighed in on the upcoming national holiday during a fiery rant on Monday morning's show.
Sandilands lost his cool early in the broadcast after he received a memo from KIIS' content director about sensitivity when it comes to the national holiday.
He began by taking a stab at the 'woke industry of the media' for discouraging employees from celebrating the public holiday, before pointing out what he believes is a double standard.
'I can't believe I have to thank everyone for letting us use the land, but we're not allowed to celebrate it on a national holiday,' Sandilands raged.

Sandilands then issued a message to critics of the holiday, saying: 'Let me tell you, those who aren't happy with Australia Day, don't have a holiday! Go to work.'
Later in the broadcast, Sandilands explained that he doesn't believe Australia Day should be a time for dwelling upon 'the deeds that others did' before the nation was established.
Instead, Sandilands said he wants Aussies to simply be 'nice to each other'.
'I can't believe I have to thank everyone for letting us use the land, but we're not allowed to celebrate it on a national holiday,' Sandilands raged. (Pictured: Woman holding a 'Change The Date' sign at an Invasion Day protest on January 26, 2023)
'Doesn't matter what colour you are, what religion you are. Let's celebrate together as a nation together on Friday,' he said.
It came days after Sandilands slammed Australia Day 'whingers' during a radio interview with opposition leader Peter Dutton.
'Australia Day is exactly one week from today, January 26, and I know some folks don't like that date, but that's the date. It's there, it's been there for as long as I can recall. It's one week away, all the anti-Australia Day types have been out,' Sandilands said.
Sandilands then issued a message to critics of the holiday, saying: 'Let me tell you, those who aren't happy with Australia Day , don't have a holiday! Go to work'
'People want us to feel guilty. I don't feel guilty. I don't feel guilty at all about the day.'
Elsewhere in that interview, the shock jock claimed that even if Australia changed the date, 'people will still have a problem because there's some people out there that always whinge about everything'.
Australia Day, observed each year on January 26, marks the landing of the First Fleet in 1788 when the first governor of the British colony of New South Wales, Arthur Philip, hoisted the Union Jack at Sydney Cove.
But for many First Nations people, it is regarded as 'Invasion Day' or the 'Day of Mourning', with many campaigning for the holiday to be abolished completely or the date changed.

While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hasn't explicitly mentioned any plans to change the date, a rising number of councils and state governments are choosing to cancel traditional Australia Day activities, including citizenship ceremonies.
In recent years Invasion Day protests have overshadowed any festivities with thousands attending rallies in major cities demanding the date be changed.
Large protests are expected this year after the referendum to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament in the constitution was voted down in October."

The body of Kenneth Charles Grace, 58, was discovered in a motel in Sydney's CBD on Thursday, reported The Daily Telegraph.
He was due to be sentenced at Downing Centre District Court that same day after pleading guilty to six charges of dishonest conduct in relation to his investment fund, Goldsky, in April 2023.
Grace ripped off investors, including Olympians Sam Riley and Robbie McEwen, to the tune of around $24million after claiming he could generate returns of up to 20 per cent.

'A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner after the body of a 58-year-old man was found in a CBD motel last week,' a spokesperson for NSW Police said.
'Officers from Surry Hills Police Area Command were called to a hotel on Foveaux St about 1.15pm last Thursday (18 January 2024), after a man was found deceased in his room.'
Grace's business was liquidated in 2018, with his crooked dealings being probed in the Federal Court and the Queensland Supreme Court.

He also rented  a luxury Sydney Harbour home with its own skippered motorboat 'so he could clear his head' in the months before his fund collapsed.
Other victims of his Ponzi scheme included former AFL players Clark Keating who invested $100,000 and and Simon Black who invested $80,000."

The 71-year-old supermodel revealed that a hotel had drained their pool after she swam in it, and said she learned about it from her friends many years later in 2012.
'I did not know until we all went to the [late modeling agent] Eileen Ford's 90th birthday party,' she explained to Page Six in an interview published on Saturday.
'All the models were there,' she recalled. 'And one girl said to me, ""Remember when they drained the pool? When you got in the pool at the so-and-so hotel?""
The actress — who was spotted with her family at her one-woman, off-Broadway play the day before — added: 'I was like, ""They did?"" And she said, ""You didn't know that?""'

The star — who secretly eloped with her financier fiance Brian Maillian in Las Vegas last year — declined to name the hotel nor reveal its location.
'So you get a lot of that,' she said about the hateful experiences she faced during her iconic, decades-spanning modeling career. 'People draining pools. It was racist.'
'As a model, there were different kinds of things that would happen to me because I was Black,' she continued.
Despite being one of the most iconic supermodels, she still faced ugly racism, but the entrepreneur recalled one model who always supported her.
'Lauren Hutton would go to photoshoots and say out loud, ""Why isn't Beverly on the cover of magazines? She is just as pretty.""'
Johnson said it was especially meaningful for Hutton to advocate for her as she was the 'it girl' at the time and could help her land more modeling opportunities.
'At the time Lauren was on every cover,' she continued. 'She was the it girl, so it was major for her to say that out loud at the time.'
This year, Johnson is celebrating the 50th anniversary of being the first Black woman to grace the cover of American Vogue in 1974.

On Saturday, the actress, 39, who shares her sons August 'Gus' Harrison, two, and Oscar 'Ozzie' Bennett Goldsmith, one, with husband Taylor Goldsmith, 38, announced they rescued another dog with her Instagram followers.
'Welcome to the family, Marshmallow!' she captioned an adorable picture of her pup laying on a white dog bed. 'This sweet boy was found wandering the streets for several days, many miles from here by our beloved nanny, Celina.
She continued: 'He's about 6-7 months, unchipped, not fixed (but scheduled for next week) and just the most unexpectedly wonderful addition to our gang.'
Mandy Moore revealed she and her husband Taylor Goldsmith, rescued another dog on Saturday
The This Is Us star revealed Marshmallow is about '6-7 months, unchipped, not fixed (but scheduled for next week) and just the most unexpectedly wonderful addition' to her family.
'We weren't looking for another dog but he was looking for us and the fact that he looks remarkably like our dear Joni made it too impossible to ignore,' she added, referencing her late pooch, who passed away, at age 12, in 2020.
The mother-of-two mused that her 'cats are nonplussed and Jackson (our 14 year old shepherd mutt rescue),' but 'Marshmallow is slowly winning them over.'
As for how they picked their newest addition's name, Moore revealed she and her spouse's eldest child came up with his name.
'When we showed Gus a picture of him and asked what his name was, without hesitation he shouted 'Marshmallow!' With his arms in the air. Done and done. Can't wait for all of the adventures, sir!! #adoptdontshop,' she concluded.
Moore and Goldsmith, 38, previously rescued cats Fig, Peanut and Olivia, before welcoming their two children.
Their beloved pup, Joni, died following complications from surgery to remove a mass on her liver.
At the time, she shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, which read: 'My heart is utterly shattered. She was my first love and best friend.'
'Welcome to the family, Marshmallow!' she captioned an adorable picture of her pup laying on a white dog bed. 'This sweet boy was found wandering the streets for several days, many miles from here by our beloved nanny, Celina
'Last night, very unexpectedly, we lost our Joni girl. Yes, she was almost 13. Yes, she had pretty major surgery a week ago to remove a mass on her liver but she was recovering really well,' Moore told her fans.
She went on to say: 'I knew something was amiss when she, lifelong food-obsessed, didn't finish her dinner and couldn't get comfortable in bed (despite being on pain meds). My mama intuition told me to bring her in and I'm glad we did.'
Moore continued with a trip down memory lane as she wrote about the first time she met Joni.
'I saw her puppy mug online way back in early 2008 and drove down to San Diego to meet her at @thebarkinglotrescue and was instantly smitten. I'll never forget the drive home, telling her that it was just us against the world now.'
As for how they picked their newest addition's name, Moore revealed she and her husband Taylor Goldsmith's eldest child came up with his name
Their latest addition comes three years after the death of her beloved dog, Joni
The post continued, 'To know her, was to love her. She never met a stranger. She was waaaaay more human (or muppet) than dog. She loved ANYTHING she could eat, even if sometimes it was gross (cat poop). Seriously, she was a vacuum.'
'She loved to give very stinky kisses. And I have no doubt she knew what an absolutely indispensable part of our lives and cherished soul she was...right until the end.'
'My heart is utterly shattered. She was my first love and best friend. Through every twist and turn of life of this past decade and change, she was right there. There's a deep chasm of emptiness that will never be filled but I am so grateful for her sweet nature and the endless connection, compassion, responsibility, patience and devotion that the love of a pet can bring into your orbit.'
She continued, 'When mulling over the details of her surgery last week, my husband sorta joked that everything would have to be run by me because I'd had Joni for 13 years and only had him for 5. He's right.'
'She was the boss and a total mama's girl. I'm so sad she won't get the chance to meet her human brother soon but maybe she wasn't ready to share. Or be a suction cup right by my side every night.'
Moore concluded, 'I will love and miss you forever, my Joni. Thank you for beyond a lifetime of love.'"

After huge events, such as the September 11 outrages in New York, the free countries of the world turned themselves upside down in efforts to prevent a repeat.
Long-treasured liberties were set aside. Travel became infinitely more difficult for innocent people, vast strategies to prevent radicalisation were launched and whole departments of universities and police forces were devoted to the struggle against terror. Similarly, conservatives over the past 40 years worked themselves into frenzies about the threat of the Trotskyist Militant tendency to take over the Labour Party.
During the Cold War much attention was paid to actual communist infiltration on the part of the Soviet Union, though to little effect. All the time these concerns were being voiced, dedicated critics of our open societies were working away undisturbed in key parts of our national framework.
Spreading out from the universities of the 1960s and afterwards, they inserted themselves into the teaching profession at all levels, into the media, especially broadcasting, into the law and the civil service, into local government and eventually into national politics too. Their success was unspectacular but enormous, as we shall see. It was done by dull, unexciting people ceasing to shout slogans and instead finding their way behind important desks in every corner of the key structures of civilisation.
Wherever you encountered officialdom in the 1950s, you generally met traditional and even conservative men and women. By the 1990s, you were far more likely to confront individuals who were opposed to tradition and very open to revolutionary thinking.
As The Mail on Sunday reports today, at least 300 schools in England are signed up to Stonewall programmes that urge them to avoid calling pupils 'boys' and 'girls' and to introduce books that endorse the Stonewall agenda, plus gender-neutral toilets and uniforms (Stock Image)

Many Sixties Left-wingers learned a key lesson from the American activist Saul Alinsky who, in his book Rules For Radicals, told them to stop marching and shouting, and hoisting red flags on things, and to use their energy instead in the tedious but effective work of committees and bureaucracies.
The process was given a name, nearly 60 years ago, by the German radical sociologist Rudi Dutschke, who proclaimed a 'long march through the institutions'. The marchers on this expedition were to pass 'through the institutions of power', there to 'create radical change from within government and society – by becoming an integral part of the machinery'. And this is more or less where we are now. This may explain the curious inability of our elected government to do anything about the onward march of Stonewall and its ferocious radicalism about transgender issues.
As The Mail on Sunday reports today, at least 300 schools in England are signed up to Stonewall programmes that urge them to avoid calling pupils 'boys' and 'girls' and to introduce books that endorse the Stonewall agenda, plus gender-neutral toilets and uniforms. What is the long-term purpose of this campaign? Why can democratic authority not put a stop to it? Stonewall receives millions in fee income from schools and local authorities, while offering 'awards' to schools that comply with its desires. A similar system operates in the NHS.
But the key point is that those activities have continued virtually unchecked even though Ministers ordered Government departments to sever links with the charity two years ago. English education law is clear that ideological material should not be promoted in schools. Yet it seems to be unenforced, and perhaps unenforceable. The schools, more than any other part of the state, appear to have a remarkably high population of radicals of all kinds. Perhaps, instead of largely ritual 'security' measures and attacks on civil liberties, proper conservatives might now turn their minds to their own Long March, recapturing the vital parts of society that revolutionaries took over while we were not looking. It is a method that certainly works, if only you have the staying power."

The appliance uses hot air rather than hot oil to cook foods, offering a quick and healthy alternative to deep-fat fryers.
However, with so many makes, models and accessories, it can be difficult to know where to begin and how to make the most of your new kitchen helper.
The questions often on the minds of air fryer buyers are often how big it needs to be, how much food can it cook and how much cash should I really be spending?
Thankfully experts and air fryer lovers have revealed the answers to all these questions and below we break them down into easy bitesize chunks.
Air fryers are the newest kitchen gadget to take the UK by storm, with an estimated 12 million households owning one
Does the size of your air fryer matter?
The experts were talking as part of Channel 5 's new documentary, 'Air Fryers: Do you know what you're missing?,'  which aired on Wednesday, presented by Alexis Conran.
The programme began by answering the key question - is size important when it comes to an air fryer?
With an overwhelming amount of options, gadget expert Jon Bentley looked into finding out.
He revealed: 'It's amazing the diversity available.
'Once the air fryer size increases, manufacturers throw in both extra cooking capacity, which suits large families, and a bunch of novel gadgets'.
There are options with two drawers, paddles, turntables, and even digital cooking probes that tell you when food is ready.
However, when it comes to size, the experts explain that: 'In fact, size doesn't matter, they all do the same thing, just in bigger and bigger cannisters.
'That means there's an air fryer to suit every consumer'.

When it comes to size, the experts explain that: 'In fact, size doesn't matter, they all do the same thing, just in bigger and bigger cannisters'
Arguably the most important question consumers want to know is how much they should be spending on an air fryer.
Presenter Conran explains: 'With air fryers, there's a general rule - the more you pay, the more they do.
'What's more, a basic model is often just as affective as the bells and whistles varieties'.
Aggie Mackenzie, from popular show How Clean is Your House?, advises: 'I've found that often the cheaper product, doesn't necessarily have to be any worse than the top end of the market'.
The programme highlighted that air fryers cover a very wide price range from just under £20, all the way up to more than £600 for a colourful Sage model sold by Harrods.
The Sage model costs £659 and has a capacity of 22L - it's settings include toast, crumpets, bake, roast, grill, pizza, air fry, reheat, warm and slow cook.
While they can get expensive, the programme shared that consumer service Which?'s advice is to spend 'about £60 if you're looking for a basic but good model'.
The presenter added: 'As well as being easy on the wallet when you first buy them, the other great thing about air fryers in the midst of an ongoing cost of living crisis, is that they've proven to be superstars when it comes to the household budget.

'While an electric cooker costs around £109 to run each year, the annual cost of a basic model air fryer is £31.18'.
Jon Bentley agreed: 'There is something very wasteful about an oven heating up for 10 or 15 minutes before you put anything in it and then you're using a big space to often heat up something that's very small'.
Once you've got your hands on the right gadget to suit your family's needs, you need to know how to use it correctly.
One thing that experts in the programme issued a warning about is that you need to be careful not to overfill your air fryer.
Actor and Comedian Shazia Mirza, advised: 'Do not over-stack your air fryers - don't think you can make a big fat chicken and a bag of fries and a bag of peas and a bag of carrots in the same basket.
'It's not gonna happen, you'll blow the air fryer up'.
Conran explains that as well as not overfilling the device, you don't need to buy a huge one and overfill your kitchen counter space.
Cleaning Expert, Aggie Mackenzie, advises: 'Now I've found that often the cheaper product, doesn't necessarily have to be any worse than the top end of the market'
Most air fryer baskets are coated with a non-stick lining, similar to a frying pan, so to make your device last as long as possible, you won't want to scratch it off
He said: 'If you don't have room for a fryer with two compartments and you're forced to choose a smaller fryer don't fret.
'There's always a gadget you can add that will help boost the cooking capacity. For instance, if you add a rack to your air fryer basket, the cooking space is doubled'.
Clare Andrews, Author of the Ultimate Air Fryer Cook Book, added: 'Just be really careful what you stack on top of one another and how you remove the food.
The stacking trays also help with you not overfilling your basket. You can use it to separate the food, therefore it's much quicker and you get that crispier finish'.
Expert and author, Andrews, continues: 'One of my top tips would be don't use metal tongs or spoons because that can really damage the non stick'.
Most air fryer baskets are coated with a non-stick lining, similar to a frying pan, so to make your device last as long as possible, you won't want to scratch it off.
Andrews suggests: 'Always go for a wooden spatula or a wooden spoon when you're stirring in your air fryer'.
Clare Andrews, Author of the Ultimate Air Fryer Cook Book, added: 'Just be really careful what you stack on top of one another and how you remove the food'
The experts add that you can get more out of your air fryer using certain accessories such as silicone moulds.
Conran says: 'But if you don't want to break the bank on brand new liners or moulds, any trusty oven-safe dish would do the trick.
With Andrews chiming in with: ''You can even use ceramic trays or Pyrex dishes that fit in a normal conventional oven. They keep it clean as well.
'Certain foods such as fish and chicken work perfectly in silicone liners, as well as baking cakes or muffins or even making Yorkshire puddings'.
Moving on to the part that everybody hates, the programme discusses how to keep your appliance clean.
Conran explains: 'They are quite easy to get clean. If you don't do it properly, it's one of the main reasons why these gadgets take an early exit'.
Cleaning expert, Aggie Mackenzie, jumps in with: 'You don't want any residue or food lying there because time after time that residue will get burnt on, it will start to smoke and it's harder to remove'.
Meanwhile, Shazia Mirza added: 'Nothing actually sticks to the drawer if you use parchment paper like I do, so I haven't actually got anything sticky on the drawer so I just use hot soap and water, it's brilliant'.

The 34-year-old, who is the older sister of model Georgia Fowler, poured her figure into a pair of retro bell bottom jeans embellished with patchwork details.
As she stepped out in the Ralph Lauren Lounge, her billowy white shirt matched the white pattern adornments on her $700 distressed bottoms.
The model elevated her designer look with a set of chunky brown heels which beautifully matched her $960 Ralph Lauren handbag.
Her accessories included two gold rings and an understated necklace which perfectly fit into the low-cut tie neckline of her top.

As her dark locks tumbled down her back in their natural wave pattern, Kate enhanced her picture-perfect features with a minimal makeup look.
Kate, who split from billionaire pub baron Justin Hemmes, 51, in 2018 following three years of dating, has kept a very low profile in recent years.
She was last spotted alongside her heavily pregnant sister Georgia, 31, in December as the pair took their children on a beach day out at Camp Cove.

The Victoria's Secret fashion model flaunted her growing belly in a black bikini, but Kate slipped into a more conservative one-piece.
Georgia is expecting her second child with husband Nathan Dalah, while Kate shares daughters Saachi, three, and Alexa, four, with Justin.
Kate has kept her love life very private since splitting from the businessman, with her last known partner being rumoured beau David Oettlé in 2021.
In July 2018, Justin, 51, (right) announced his split from Kate after three years of dating - the pair share daughters Saachi, three, and Alexa, four
Meanwhile, Justin is currently dating 26-year-old model Madeline Holtznagel.
While it's not known exactly how long Justin and Madeline have been dating, she previously hinted their relationship has carried on longer than many people expect.
Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald in October 2021, Madeline said they'd actually met two years before reports emerged of their relationship in early 2020.
'We have known each other for two years and met when I was modelling in Singapore,' she said at the time."

Homeowners 'bonkers' for the air units with 20,000 on waiting lists and firms saying they 'can't keep up with demand'",Madison Burgess,"Published: 10:06 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 10:11 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12968869/dehumidifiers-homeowners-britain-air-units-breathing-damp.html,"The demand for dehumidifiers is on the rise in the UK, with brands saying they 'can't keep up' and more than 20,000 people on waiting lists.
It comes as Britain faced sub-zero temperatures this week, with a 'cold plunge of Arctic air'.
With homeowners struggling to heat their homes and keep mould at bay, the need for the damp-fighting machines is soaring.
Chris Michael, managing director of British dehumidifier brand Meaco, told BBC News: 'Demand has been bonkers. We can't keep up with it'.
He revealed his firm had a waiting list of 20,000 last winter and the company didn't have enough stock, so this year he's throwing in another 100,000 units - 280,000 in total.
The demand for dehumidifiers is on the rise in the UK, with brands saying they 'can't keep up' and more than 20,000 people on waiting lists (stock image)
However, he's still not sure if the amount will be enough, revealing they 'should have brought in an extra 50,000'.
Kate Martin's home in the West Midlands, is amongst those struggling with a mould problem that often comes with very cold weather.
Mrs Martin revealed: 'I couldn't breathe properly, my chest hurt.
'It doesn't matter if you have 10 blankets, if it's damp, you are freezing'.
However, as soon as she set her dehumidifier going and wiped the mould away, she noticed she and her family were 'breathing freely again'.
Dehumidifiers can be used to drastically reduce humidity and condensation levels in a home, making it less hospitable to mould, mildew and dust mites.
The National Association of Property Buyers (NAPB) says that often when a householder uses a dehumidifier for the first time, they are surprised to find just how much water it collects from the air.
Some dehumidifiers will gather up to 20 litres of water on the first use. If used regularly, the organisation says moisture levels in the air will drop.
With homeowners struggling to heat their homes and keep mould at bay, the need for the damp-fighting machines is getting out of control
There are two main types of mechanical devices - refrigierent dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers.
Refrigerant devices, which Mr Michael says are by far the most popular choice, use a compressor and refrigerant coil to remove moisture.
Humid air is drawn into the dehumidifier and passes over a refrigerated coil that will lower the temperature to it's dew point - condensation takes place, removing the mositure.
The water is then collected in a container to be emptied once it's full.
The managing director says they are the more highly favoured option as they usually cost less to run, however dessiccant dehumidifiers are better for colder spaces.
They use a material that draws moisture in, with the material then being heated to collect the water - also helping to heat the room.
Dehumidifiers usually set a household back around £100-£200, however prices can be as high as £350.
Although, they can be significantly cheap to run and could knock cash off your electricity bill.
Dehumidifiers can be used to drastically reduce humidity and condensation levels in a home, making it less hospitable to mould, mildew and dust mites
Rachael Peterson, from Oxfordshire, has gone as far as using her dehumidifier to do the job of a tumble drier.
The electronics engineer hangs her clothes up to dry in a cupboard under her stairs overnight, in the same room as her device.
She claims that on a cheaper electricity tariff, this sets her back less than 4p, adding that 'the clothes are dried down there in a matter of hours'.
However, if you can't afford the cost of a dehumidifier, there are plenty of other ways to ensure your home is ventillated and fight off pesky mould and condensation.
One mother revealed on Facebook that she battles mould and condensation by placing bowls of salt on the windowsill - a hack that costs as little as 9p.
Simple tricks, from cracking a window open every morning to using a hair dryer to get rid of the liquid build-up, can also help reduce the amount of condensation inside your home.
Expert in air quality, Professor Cath Noakes from the University of Leeds, also stresses that it's equally important to ventilate and heat your home as it is to use a dehumidifier.
She explains: 'High humidity is associated with mould and other microbial growth.
'Very low humidity, say below 40%, and definitely below 30%, is associated with things like respiratory viruses'.
The expert urged homeowners to remember that while dehumidifers remove some of the moisture that encourages mould, they do not get rid of the mould itself."

The international police body has called for forces to consider opening online units offering services like 'reporting crimes, filing complaints or hosting virtual community meetings'.
In a White Paper warning of an explosion of crimes in virtual reality games, Interpol suggests officers should maintain a 'virtual presence in the metaverse' to prevent sex offences, child abuse and even terrorism.
The term metaverse refers to 3D virtual worlds where users depicted as online figures called avatars interact.
Earlier this month the Mail revealed that a UK police force is investigating a 'virtual rape' in the metaverse for the first time.

A girl under the age of 16 went to police last year saying her online avatar had been gang raped by strangers in a virtual reality game.
Although there was no physical attack, officers decided to investigate as the girl was assessed as suffering the same psychological and emotional trauma as someone who has been raped in the real world.
Now Interpol is warning that virtual reality crimes could become a major problem.
The report said: 'The metaverse has opened up opportunities for criminals to commit new types of crime, which can be referred to as 'metacrime'.
'Metacrime is a growing concern and could become a major issue as the immersive world becomes part of our daily life.'
The paper recommends forces set up a presence in the metaverse to allow users to report 'metacrime' or even provide another avenue for the public to report offline crimes.
It added: 'Police departments can establish a virtual presence in the metaverse, offering services such as reporting crimes, filing complaints or even hosting virtual community meetings.
'This approach can make police services more accessible, especially for those with mobility issues or in remote areas.'
The word metaverse was coined in 1992 by author Neal Stephenson in his science fiction novel Snow Crash.
The paper recommends forces set up a presence in the metaverse to allow users to report 'metacrime' or even provide another avenue for the public to report offline crimes. Pictured: A virtual reality Interpol station
The NSPCC estimates that 15 per cent of children aged five to ten have used virtual reality.
Wearing a headset, users are plunged into an immersive virtual world that feels real where they can interact with others inside a computer-generated environment.
Users can also put on vests called haptic suits, which simulate sensations such as the impact of a punch, providing a 'tangible link between virtual and physical experience', Interpol warns.
It identified 41 types of crime which could be perpetrated in the metaverse including rape, sexual exploitation of children, deepfakes, financial scams, identity theft and even virtual burglaries.
The report also warns: 'Terrorists could misuse the metaverse to receive financial support, which could lead to the commission of terror attacks.'
The rise of the metaverse has prompted calls from police chiefs in Britain for new laws to protect women and children plus more action from tech companies to make platforms safe for users."

I can't stress strongly enough that no one in the UK is calling for laws such as those in Switzerland that permit assisted dying which is not linked to a terminal illness or an incurable physical condition.
This is a nuanced and delicate argument, but there are issues around mental or psychiatric illness which make it harder to establish true consent to such a procedure.
Those issues don't generally arise when you are talking about debilitating, life-limiting physical conditions which cause unbearable pain.
Alastair Hamilton travelled to Switzerland to Pegasos Swiss Association, an Assisted Dying Clinic near Basel, in August 2023. His family were unaware and were stone-walled for weeks by the clinic before finding out what had happened to Alistair (pictured)
Alastair Hamilton's case proves the UK must debate this great moral dilemma, says assisted dying campaign group chairman Trevor Moore (pictured)
There are around 30 countries or states with assisted dying laws in place and, while they are all different in the scope and breadth of their regulations, almost all focus on easing the suffering of those with a terminal illness – and giving them a choice in terms of where and how they die.
The laws for which campaigners in the UK are pressing would require an applicant to be mentally competent at the time of being assessed, and then again following a relevant interval before they receive their life-ending medication. That becomes more difficult when considering mental illness.
And the evidence we have built up over time comes from places like the US, where – at least in some states – there have been assisted dying laws in place for more than 25 years.
In many of these jurisdictions, palliative care has improved considerably, a sign that talking about death more widely can have a positive impact, whatever choice you'd like to make.
The laws in places such as Oregon dictate that you must have fewer than six months left to live to be able to request an assisted death.
We would go further. We're campaigning for a law that would extend to all terminally ill people, regardless of the time they have left, and to those with neurodegenerative conditions like motor neurone disease and anyone suffering unbearably from incurable physical conditions.
This isn't for everyone; nor should anyone have access to it without meeting strict criteria.
But cases like this one demonstrate that now is the time for the UK's own discussions to begin in earnest.

Walking arm-in-arm with wife Samantha, 52, the UK's Foreign Secretary, braved the cold to attend Cocklebarrow races near Gloucestershire today.
The former PM, who appears to be enjoying political life once more, strolled into the event with his wife of 27 years.
The pair exchanged cheery looks with one another as they strolled through the muddy field.
Samantha looked stylish in £200 corduroy maxi skirt from her brand, Cefinn, with contrast-stitched detailing.
The UK's Foreign Secretary David Cameron and wife Samantha were in Gloucestershire earlier today to attend the Cocklebarrow races
Mrs Cameron added to the look with a chic oversized blazer and a pair of statement gold hoops.
Meanwhile, David kept it simple and opted for a chocolate-coloured hunting coat with a pair of jeans.
The Cameron's would have enjoyed a busy day at the Cocklebarrow races, which comprised pony races, P2P races, and also has a shopping market to browse.
Last month, the ex PM revealed his return to politics came after Rishi Sunak refused to let him leave Downing Street when the pair met for a drink.
Lord Cameron made a shock return to the Cabinet in November when the Prime Minister named him as Foreign Secretary as part of his reshuffle.
The former Prime Minister had indulged in a drink with Mr Sunak in his flat above Number 10 just a week earlier in what he had thought was a meeting designed to pick his brains for some friendly advice.
But he was left blindsided when the Prime Minister refused to let him leave and instead offered him a return back into frontline politics seven years after he quit.
Lord Cameron told the Sunday Telegraph: 'He was asking my advice about some things, we were talking about things generally, and I kept sort of getting my coat and saying: 'Well I must go, I've taken up far too much of your time'. He kept saying, 'no, no, sit down, there's something else I want to ask you'.'
The husband-and-wife of 27 years exchanged cheerful glances with one another as they arrived at the event
Samantha looked chic in a £200 maxi skirt from Cefinn. Meanwhile, David kept it simple with a hunting jacket and pair of jeans
Eventually, Mr Sunak asked him to come back as Foreign Secretary and although surprised by the immediacy of wanting to say 'yes', Lord Cameron asked if he could mull the decision over with his wife, Samantha, and their children.
It was a full circle moment for Lord Cameron who in 2016 stood on the doorstep of No 10 and hugged his family after an emotional farewell in which he announced he was stepping down as prime minister following the Brexit referendum vote.
In his leaving speech he shared a rare glimpse of family life behind the famous door with the children sometimes 'kicking the red boxes full of work'.
He recalled how his daughter, Florence, had once climbed into his red ministerial box just before a foreign trip and pleaded to be taken with him.
He promised 'no more boxes', so perhaps there was little surprise 'there was a bit of eye-rolling' when Lord Cameron asked his children Nancy, 19, Arthur, 17, and Florence, 13, about his potential return.

Lord Cameron pictured with his wife Samantha in 2018, whom he mulled the decision over with about whether or not to return to frontline politics
'They [the children] were generally positive,' he said. 'They know it's what really interests me and they've been very supportive.'
After getting the green light from his family, Lord Cameron told Mr Sunak he would take up the post and the two men agreed the outline of a comeback deal.
Lord Cameron would use his network of contacts and status as a former leader to turbocharge Britain's foreign policy.
In return, he would drop his lucrative and controversial business interests and agree to toe the line on issues where he has publicly disagreed.
Mr Sunak could not hold his delight and was seen gloating about the shock move to bring him back.
In a slick video released by No10, the Prime Minister was shown crowing at how news of the ex-premier's return had not emerged prior to the dramatic reshuffle in which Suella Braverman was ditched as Home Secretary.
Mr Sunak was shown telling Lord Cameron: 'This is somehow the best kept secret', to which the former premier replied: 'Unbelievable.'
Not all were seemingly thrilled by his return with Boris Johnson this month appearing to mock his return.
In a thinly veiled swipe at the Foreign Secretary, Mr Johnson suggested Lord Cameron was a prime example of 'nails peeling out of the coffin lids' across the world.

Speaking to estate agents in Ontario, Canada, Mr Johnson said: 'Look, I think it's great news for retreads everywhere.'
In his 2019 memoir For The Record, Lord Cameron revealed how he and Samantha had frequently argued about how his career would affect their private lives.
At the time she was a 21-year-old art student in Bristol while he was a 25-year-old working as an adviser for the then Tory chancellor Norman Lamont.
Describing how his friends doubted their relationship, he said: 'I was the ambitious Tory apparatchik. She was the hippie-like art student.
'My friends would say she helped to turn a pretty traditional Home Counties Tory boy into someone a bit more rounded, more questioning and more open-minded,' Mr Cameron wrote.
'But many of the arguments we had about politics were actually about logistics, rather than issues. Samantha worried hugely about how it would affect our life. Where would we live? How would we stay together? How much would we see of each other?'"

Critics have argued that the Net Zero target of eliminating additional greenhouse emissions by 2050 was helping to cripple the UK's industrial base.
The job losses at Port Talbot, Britain's biggest steelworks, follow the replacement of its blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace that will emit less CO2.
The Government paid £500million of taxpayers' money to the Indian owners, Tata Steel, to help meet a £1.25billion cost of converting to the electric arc process.
Last night former Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured) called for the ditching of the new environmentally-based 'growth duty' definition

Now top Tories have warned against new plans for Government bodies and regulators to define moves towards economic growth in terms of 'sustainability'.
It would mean that regulators such as Ofcom, who have a duty to support economic growth when they take decisions, would have to pivot to also demonstrate their 'alignment with environmentally sustainable objectives'.
The move, which is the subject of a Whitehall consultation, comes as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is hoping to spark the economy into life in time for this year's general election.
Last night former Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg called for the ditching of the new environmentally-based 'growth duty' definition.
'The viscera of the Net Zero Trojan Horse contain the enemies of growth,' he said.
'They aim to destroy the Government's last efforts to turn our economy around. Regulators must not be distracted with the flowery words of environmental objectives but need to concentrate on competition and growth.
'I fear the greens even when they bear regulatory gifts.'
Former Brexit Minister Lord Frost added: 'Setting these as legal objectives for regulators opens the door for spurious legal challenges by political campaigners, wasting time and money and distracting regulators further from their vital role in keeping the UK economy moving.
Co-Chairman Shanker Singham speaks during the launch of The Growth Commission
'If the Government is serious about fixing the economy, it must not allow the central mission of growth to be hijacked by special interest groups, who often care more about hamstringing growth than promoting it.'
They were speaking after economists on the independent Growth Commission urged the Government to use per capita GDP as the core definition of 'growth duty'.
Shanker Singham, co-chairman of the Growth Commission, said: 'Regulators should have a clear responsibility to consider the impact of their actions on economic growth as defined by impact on GDP per capita.
'Though a worthy cause, conflating the Government's environmental objectives with economic objectives of regulator activity will lead to confusion and could lead to decisions that will damage both economic growth and environmental sustainability.'"

Among Republican voters in the first-in-the-nation state, 55 percent say they support former President Trump, which is 19 percentage points more than those who say they support former United Nations Ambassador Haley (36 percent).
Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has fallen to a far-distant third with only 6 percent support, according to the Suffolk poll commissioned by NBC10 Boston and the Boston Globe.
The results follow Haley's disappointing third place finish in the Iowa caucuses on January 15 where she earned 19.1 percent. The caucus yielded Trump a massive 51 percent victory and DeSantis a second place finish with 21.2 percent.
A New Hampshire Republican primary poll shows Nikki Haley 19% behind Donald Trump among GOP voters in the state – but 1% ahead of the former president among independent voters
Haley is hoping to see a better outcome in the more moderate state of New Hampshire, where voters express they are less wooed by Trump's MAGA agenda and DeSantis' 'anti-woke' ideology.
A few previous polls had Haley within one-digit of Trump – and an American Research Group survey taken January 12-15 showed them in a dead tie with 40 percent each. One January 4-8 poll from University of New Hampshire Survey Center/CNN showed Haley just 7 percent behind Trump.
The latest, however, shows Haley falling behind by nearly 20 points after her third-place finish in Iowa.
Independent voters might be Haley's saving grace in the primary election on Tuesday as they show to be the wildcard, the Suffolk/NBC/Boston Globe poll reveals. Independent voters are allowed to vote in the primary and cast their ballot for whoever they choose.
Many who lean left claim they will write-in President Joe Biden's name on Tuesday's ballot.
Donald Trump took a commanding victory in the Iowa caucuses with 51% of the vote, but is less popular in the more left-leaning state of New Hampshire
Haley, after coming in third in Iowa, is looking to pick-up a win in New Hampshire
Among Republican voters, Haley is 19 percent behind, but when independent voters were polled, she was actually ahead of Trump by 1 point.
Forty-five percent of the 217 independent voters surveyed say they will cast their ballot for Haley while 44 percent say they will go for Trump.
Only 5 percent say they would vote for DeSantis.
The polling in Iowa proved to be pretty accurate, with Trump winning by dozens of points against Haley and DeSantis, as well as biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, both of whom have since dropped out of the race.
Ramaswamy has since backed Trump, as has Sen. Tim Scott, who dropped out of the 2024 Republican primary in mid-November."

Speaking to The Mirror, Carlos revealed if he will be returning to the BBC show, which will air later this year.
He said: 'Fingers cross you know. I hope I will'.
In November last year, Angela broke down in tears as she addressed her shock Strictly exit on It Takes Two.
The One Show host, 39, and her professional partner Carlos were voted off after a tense dance off with Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin.
An emotional Angela had to be comforted by Carlos as she addressed her departure after watching a reel of her highlights.
The presenter told host Fleur East it 'stung' to leave the competition just one week after wowing the judges with her Argentine Tango in Blackpool.
'There's been a few standout moments. I feel really grateful for them. In life, in this glorious madness you can have a steady road, either middle of the road and have quite a smooth journey', Angela said.
'I've always felt like those ups and downs are better for you to feel things deeply, whether that's right down there or right up there.

'The Argentine Tango in Blackpool, for me, which is possibly why this stings so much to come a week later.'
The pair showed their strong bond as they held each other's hand, with Carlos wiping away tears as they watched their best moments on the show.
During the shows dance off, Angela narrowly missed out on a place in the quarters after failing to win over the judges with her cha-cha-cha to Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive.
Angela faced Layton and his professional partner Nikita Kuzmin, who performed an American Smooth to Magic Moments by Perry Como, originally scoring 34 points.
After watching both routines, the judges delivered the verdicts, with only Shirley Ballas revealing she would pick Angela over Layton."

Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 24, tells today's Desert Island Discs that when he performed at last year's Last Night he left early to avoid hearing the song.
The long tradition of a sing-along rendition of Rule, Britannia! is a highlight of the annual Royal Albert Hall concert.
But there have been calls to ban it as some see it as too celebratory of Britain's imperial past and its role in the slave trade.
The song, which originates from James Thomson's 1740 poem Rule, Britannia and is set to music by Thomas Arne, contains the line: 'Britons never will be slaves'.

Kanneh-Mason tells Desert Island Discs: 'I don't think it should be included and I didn't stay for that. That's just my opinion. I think maybe some people don't realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel.
'The wealth of folk music from this country is astonishing. I think that would be a wonderful thing to take its place.'
The BBC was branded woke in 2020 when it announced that only instrumental versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory would be performed at that year's event.
It later backed down in the face of a public backlash.

Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign did not get off to a good start.
The 45-year-old candidate, dubbed 'DeFuture' of the Republican Party, tried to launch his 2024 bid in May by showing off his next-gen tech savvy - with a Twitter Spaces session.
And then the app crashed.
The debacle got a good laugh from his senior citizen rivals, former President Donald Trump, 77, and President Joe Biden, 81.
'Glitchy. Tech issues. Uncomfortable silences. A complete failure to launch. And that's just the candidate!' a spokesman for Trump gleefully said. Biden chimed in with, 'This links works,' which led people to his campaign's donation site.
For the next eight months, the DeSantis campaign was plagued with problems - including chatter that he was awkward on the stump, was secretly wearing high heels and was bleeding money from his donors.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday he was leaving the presidential race after eight months. He endorsed former President Donald Trump on his way out the door
In May, the 45-year-old candidate tried to launch his 2024 presidential bid using Twitter - but the app crashed
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis laughs during an Iowa camapign stop in the lead-up to his official presidential campaign announcement in May. DeSantis' awkward demeanor on the campaign trail became one of the prevailing narratives of his failed 2024 campaign
Even before the official launch, DeSantis had to contend with some strange anecdotes in the press about him.
The Daily Beast reported in March that four years before, during a private plane trip between Tallahassee and D.C., DeSantis dug into a pudding cup - literally - using three of his fingers to consume the treat.
'He would sit in meetings and eat in front of people,' a former DeSantis staffer told The Daily Beast, 'always like a starving animal who has never eaten before ... getting s*** everywhere.'
Once he started actively campaigning, he immediately got branded as awkward, robotic and aloof.
One DeSantis staffer, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com in June that their boss had to be told 'when to smile.'
'He just needs to chill out a bit and be less stiff,' another source said. 'He always looks awkward and needs to get out and meet more people.'
Early on, DeSantis had impressive fundraising totals, but by July he had cut a third of his staff, 38 aides in total.
In turn, DeSantis' super PAC took over hosting most of the governor's campaign events.
In October, podcaster Patrick Bet-David informed DeSantis that there was a viral TikTok video airing out a conspiracy theory that he had hidden heels inside the cowboy boots he often sported at campaign events
The 2024 presidential hopeful had to contend with rumors that he was wearing hidden high heels in his cowboy boots. Politico Magazine later ran a story bolstering this claim
DeSantis - like Sen. Marco Rubio before him - also had to slap down rumors that he was wearing hidden high heels.
In October, podcaster Patrick Bet-David informed DeSantis that there was a viral TikTok video airing out a conspiracy theory that he had hidden heels inside the cowboy boots he often sported at campaign events.
TikTok user Spamellina had sketched the shape of a high heel over the photo of DeSantis in his boots and then shared a picture of a pair of women's wedged boots for comparison.
'No, no, no those are just standard, off the rack Lucchese,' DeSantis said in defense, name-dropping a popular cowboy boot brand.
Politico Magazine later ran a story quoting three expert shoemakers who bolstered the hidden lifts claim.
The dig stuck, with Donald Trump Jr. mocking him for it on the stump in Iowa last week.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at his Iowa caucus results party on Monday. He lost to Trump by 30 points in the Hawkeye State after his campaign and super PAC spent a combined $150 million
On Saturday, DeSantis headlined three events in South Carolina in an attempt to take votes away from Nikki Haley in her home state.
DeSantis' final days in the race had him frantically trying to figure out where his message might best resonate after he lost Iowa to Trump by 30 points - at a cost of $150 million, between his campaign and his Never Back Down super PAC.
One estimate had that at $6,400 a vote.
In Iowa he had traveled to all 99 counties - dubbed the 'full Grassley' - and received the endorsement of the state's popular Gov. Kim Reynolds - but almost lost his second place status to Haley, who wasn't focusing heavily on the state.
The day after the Iowa caucuses DeSantis flew to Greensville, South Carolina to plant a flag there, with the thinking that if Haley lost South Carolina he could turn the GOP primary into a two-person race versus Trump.
At the same time, his super PAC started laying off staff.
He flew back to New Hamsphire later that day and on Wednesday CBS News broke that he planned to leave the Granite State - possibly for good - to again campaign in South Carolina all weeekend.
That trip ended up lasting one day - with three events - and concluded with headlines on how DeSantis dressed down a fourth grade teacher over Haley's education record as governor.
DeSantis was unable to say where in South Carolina he could win - nor could he point to a Super Tuesday state where the campaign could put its focus.
On Sunday, instead of campaigning in South Carolina, DeSantis was expected to fly back to New Hamsphire - cancelling appearances on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's State of the Union in the process.
Instead he returned to Florida, where he filmed the video announcement that he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Trump, kicking Haley a final time on his way out.
'He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,' DeSantis said, speaking to the camera."

The Django Unchained actor, 56 - whose daughter Corrine recently became engaged - was also spotted joining his co-star, Cameron Diaz, while preparing to shoot scenes for the action-comedy in Atlanta on Saturday.
The Oscar winner kept it casual wearing a long-sleeved, black sweater as well as a pair of dark navy trousers.
He also slipped into black ankle socks as well as comfortable, white sneakers that were secured with laces.
Foxx strolled outdoors while placing his hands in the pockets of his pants, and was soon accompanied by The Mask actress, who also dressed down for the busy day of filming.

She sported a pair of fitted, black pants and a plain white shirt which was layered with a tan-colored cardigan.
Diaz also donned a pair of white sneakers and allowed her blonde locks to flow down naturally past her shoulders.
At one point, the pair were spotted walking next to each other as they made their way down a sidewalk.
The Netflix movie is directed by Seth Gordon and also stars Glenn Close, Andrew Scott as well as Kyle Chandler.
The plot synopsis of the project has remained mostly under wraps and a set release date has yet to be announced.
Back in April of last year, while filming Back In Action in Georgia, Jamie was notably hospitalized - which had been revealed by his daughter Corinne at the time.
Most details of the actor's medical issue have remained private, but in May 2023, she took to her Instagram stories to give an update on Foxx's condition.
'My Dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating. In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone's prayers and support!'

Jamie had also taken to social media to express his gratitude for the overwhelming support he has received after suffering a medical emergency on April 11.
'Appreciate all the love!!! Feeling blessed,' he typed out to his fans and followers. Social media users, including celebrities, jumped to the comment section to continue to send their love to the Ray actor.
His close pal, Kevin Hart, had also given a positive update of his own around the same time while appearing on an episode of the Impaulsive podcast.
The comedian explained to host Logan Paul, 'I'm very fortunate to have the relationship that I have with Jamie and to be able to just check on him and stuff like that.'
The Me Time actor added that Foxx's family was continuing to be 'tight and for reasons just about where he is, because Jamie's always been a private person to a certain degree.'
Kevin stated that the outpouring of love has been a major influence in Jamie's recovery. 'The dope thing is that he's getting better in his situation, and you know, everybody's prayers, everybody's love, energy. All that stuff is seen and felt.'
'So in this case, man, you know, you just want the guy to get out of the situations and then get back home,' the Die Hart star continued.
'You know, I don't know the details, or the exact details to what's going on, but to my knowledge is there's a lot of progression and a world of better, man.'
Last month in December, Jamie notably made his first public appearance since his health recovery at Critics Choice Association event (seen above)
The star revealed that six months earlier, he was unable to 'walk' and further stated, 'I couldn't do that six months ago, I couldn't actually walk to [the stage]'
The comedian movingly added about his close friend, 'So you know, my love, synergy, energy goes out to him. He's needed, he's necessary. I know that he knows that.
'I know that he feels that because there's been an outcry, an outpour of support in this regard. So, I can only hope that it continues,' Hart added about the Oscar winner.
Last month in December, Jamie notably made his first public appearance since his health recovery.

Foxx received the Vanguard Award for his performance in The Burial and while taking to the stage, gave an emotional 12-minute speech to the crowd, per The Hollywood Reporter.
The star revealed that six months earlier, he was unable to 'walk' and further stated, 'I couldn't do that six months ago, I couldn't actually walk to [the stage].'
The Ray actor then humorously stated, 'And I'm not a clone, I'm not a clone. I know a lot of people saying that I was cloned out there.'
'I want to thank everybody. I've been through something, I've been through some thing,' he also added.
He continued, 'It feels good to be here. I cherish every single minute now, it's different. I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy because it's tough when it's almost over, when you see the tunnel'; seen earlier this month in Hawaii

Instead, Eyal Yakoby, a senior, is among a growing number of students who have resorted to legal action to fight back against schools they believe are failing to protect Jewish students from hatred and harassment.
In an exclusive interview with Dailymail.com, Yakoby accused the revered Ivy League institution of falling woefully short in addressing the escalating antisemitism within its hallowed halls and alleged the school had committed 'egregious' violations of federal civil rights law by selectively enforcing its rules of conduct.
Detailing some of the disturbing allegations leading up to the lawsuit, Yakoby claimed the school had failed to notify students about bomb threats against the university's Jewish organization Hillel and allowed swastikas to be openly displayed.
'If the university isn't going to uphold the law and its own rules, then the court system will,' the Israeli-American student vowed.
Last week a group of six Jewish Harvard students filed a lawsuit against the college, demanding antisemitic professors be fired and students who troll them disciplined. The University of California, Berkeley and NYU have also been hit by similar litigation.

Yakoby's lawsuit comes just weeks after Penn President Liz Magill's shameful testimony at a congressional hearing on antisemitism.
Fierce backlash swiftly led to her resignation in December, with some donors also withdrawing their support.
But amid a surge in campus antisemitism, marked by protests and both verbal and physical attacks, students are now also taking a stand through the legal system.
Yakoby is among several concerned students who have recently filed lawsuits against their schools under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to combat the rising tide of antisemitism on college campuses.
After expressing concern about rising hostility towards Jews following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and urging the school to address the issue, Yakoby said he felt ignored.
'I've sent 15 emails to the school begging them to take action before any sort of legal battle came into play,' he said.
'In most cases there was no response whatsoever or it was 'we're taking it seriously' - but every time I was told we were taking it seriously, there would be another major incident,' he added. 'I'm not talking just a small thing, I'm talking about a major incident happening.'

Posts from fellow students at UPenn advocate for the destruction of Israel, the only Jewish state
Anne Norton, a professor in UPenn's Middle East Center, posted antisemitic content on her Twitter account. Despite a 400 percent increase in antisemitism since the brutal massacre against Israelis on October 7, she claimed that 'playing the victim' is what 'Jews are best at'
The lawsuit, filed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on December 5, claims Penn created a persistently hostile educational environment for the students.
The complaint cited instances of antisemitic slurs such as when a mob, including some non-students, rampaged across Penn's campus, chanted for the destruction of Israel and scrawled the words 'intifada,' 'blood thirsty' and 'shame' on the walls of Penn buildings.
Shocking acts of antisemitic graffiti across campus saw slogans such as 'Intifada,' 'Avenge Gaza' and 'The Jews R Nazis' scrawled on a building next to a Jewish fraternity.
Yakoby emphasized disparities in the university's response to incidents, and called for consistency, especially regarding controversial speakers.
The complaint also claims the university hired 'rabidly antisemitic professors' and ignored pleas for protection.
Yakoby pointed out instances where professors endorsed terror organizations and the university's inconsistent actions regarding controversial speakers.
'The university canceled Narendra Modi from speaking on campus because it made Indian students feel uncomfortable and yet they're fine with hosting Mark Lamont Hill who was fired from CNN for antisemitism,' he said. 'And Roger Waters, who was described by the city of Frankfurt as the most notorious antisemite in the world.'
'So consistency is if you draw a line that anytime a group is offended for a speaker coming, then you made your bed here, you have to lie in it,' Yakoby stated. 'Or we should say there's going to speakers that make you uncomfortable. That's the real world. But we haven't been upholding them.'
'So why is it free speech sometimes and not free speech always? I think what the university should have done is been consistent,' he added.

A slogan projected on Penn Commons read: 'Zionism is racism'
Yakoby described one incident that prompted him to take action.
He said: 'I was eating lunch in Hillel and there were bomb sniffing dogs walking around and I didn't think too much about it until the university sent out an email later in the day saying that there were threats made against the Hillel.
'The university was made aware about this at 6:30 am and they didn't notify the community until 3:30 pm.
'That's when it registered to me that someone has to take immediate action to safeguard the community because the fact that they wouldn't tell anyone and allow people to just enter and exit a building with an active bomb threat told me a lot.'
He also detailed how Associate Professor of Arabic Literature Huda Fakhreddine had reposted an article about Yakoby that described him as an Israeli foreign agent and propagandist.
'This is a professor at Penn ... How am I supposed to take her class? If that's not targeting then I don't know what is,' he said.
Yakoby also told how another professor in UPenn's Middle East Center, Anne Norton, had posted antisemitic content on her Twitter account.
Despite a 400 percent increase in antisemitism since the brutal massacre against Israelis on October 7, she claimed that 'playing the victim' is what 'Jews are best at.'
Expressing disappointment in the university's stance on protecting students, Yakoby underscored the need for immediate action.
He emphasized that the lawsuit serves as a way to exert pressure on the university when other means, such as emails and communication, yielded insufficient responses.
The lawsuit aims to secure injunctive relief, compelling the University of Pennsylvania to cease discriminatory policies against Jewish students.
Additionally, it calls for preventative measures, including the termination of faculty and staff deemed antisemitic, expulsion of students engaged in antisemitic behavior, and the implementation of mandatory antisemitism training for the Penn community.
The lawsuit also seeks damages, including tuition refunds.
The plaintiffs argue that Penn has neglected to enforce its own policies safeguarding Jewish students from discrimination, harassment, and intimidation, citing violations of seven university policies, including the Code of Student Conduct, Guidelines on Open Expression, Penn's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy, and the Faculty Handbook.
The case docket details over 100 incidents of antisemitism on campus since 2015.
It alleges that the Palestine Writes Literature Festival set the stage for a 'wave of antisemitism' in the fall, noting that 25 festival speakers, including Roger Waters and Marc Lamont Hill, were identified as antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League.
The students are being represented by legal teams from the Law Offices of Eric A. Shore and Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP.
Dailymail.com contacted UPenn for a comment.
This is not the first time Penn has been accused of antisemitism in recent months.
The school is facing a civil rights complaint after it was accused of being a 'magnet for anti-Semites.'
Another UPenn student, Noah Rubin, detailed the harassment and anti-Semitism Jewish and pro-Israel students have faced on campus.
One video showed a group of students at UPenn chanting in favor of 'Intifada revolution.'
Rubin hammered the Ivy League institution as a 'climate of fear' amid antisemitic protests and language litter the campus.
'We're fed up with the inaction from the administration. And frankly, we're fed up with all the enablers of this — which includes professors who are antisemitic and who have participated in, organized with, and even supported them financially,' he alleged.
In November, the school also came under fire over anti-Semitism on campus after anti-Jewish slogans were projected onto three of the school's buildings.
'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' read one message splashed across the John M Huntsman hall on Wednesday night. The slogan demands the land from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea, meaning the end of the State of Israel.
The students say Harvard has demonstrated antisemitism for years, but that the events following the Hamas October 7 attack made it a more 'severe' issue
The lawsuit, filed by student Alexander Kestenbaum (pictured) and five unnamed others from Students Against Antisemitism, describes how Gay's student supporters bullied them and other Jewish kids after her resignation.
Meanwhile, six Jewish students from Harvard University announced last week they are suing the school, claiming it has become a 'bastion of anti-semitism and hatred' with descriptions of how they have been bullied since the university's president Claudine Gay resigned.
The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts, alleges that President Claudine Gay's congressional comments about campus antisemitism are just the tip of the iceberg of the school's problem.
Gay stepped down on January 2 after sparking fury and threats of a donor boycott with her remarks. By then, she had also been accused of plagiarism.
The school stood by her, refusing to accept that it had an antisemitism problem. In her resignation letter, Gay said she had been the victim of racist threats because she is a black woman.
The lawsuit, filed by student Alexander Kestenbaum and five unnamed others from Students Against Antisemitism, describes how Gay's student supporters bullied them and other Jewish kids after her resignation.
In internal chat rooms, Jewish students were labeled 'pedo loving Zionists', according to the lawsuit.
Some pro-Palestine students said they also supported Hamas' attack and considered it a 'moment of decolonization.'
The students say the issue existed before Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, but became more 'severe' afterwards.
They are now asking for students who have threatened them to be expelled, and for anti-Israel professors to be fired.

UPenn student Noah Rubin detailed the harassment and anti-Semitism Jewish and pro-Israeli students on campus have faced
In November, three students also sued NYU for failing to protect them against 'festering Jewish hatred permeating the school' that has accelerated amid the Israel-Hamas war.
Jewish pupils Bella Ingber, Sabrina Maslavi and Saul Tawil accused their college of 'egregious civil rights violations' by allegedly allowing other students to chant anti-Semitic slogans like 'gas the Jews' and 'Hitler was right' without repercussions.
Their lawsuit, filed in New York federal court, says the college has been giving 'mobs of students carte blanche to harass and intimidate NYU's Jewish population' through its 'actions and inactions' over the past month.
It alleges 'the age-old virus of antisemitism is alive and well at New York University' and has grown worse after Hamas' horrific October 7 incursion into Israel brought tensions to a boiling point.
Ingber, Maslavi and Tawil blasted the university for allegedly violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin.
They say they tried to address their concerns, but administrators brushed them off and said they should call a hotline for students with 'emotional challenges.'
NYU contested their claims, telling DailyMail.com at the time they 'do not accurately describe conditions on our campus,' and that it 'looks forward to setting the record straight' in court.
But the plaintiffs say antisemitism has been a 'growing institutional problem' on American university campuses for decades - and NYU is 'among the worst.'
The lawsuit was filed shortly after former UPenn president Liz Magill testified on Capitol Hill at a congressional hearing on antisemitism, where she failed to condemn antisemitism
One of the messages demanded former UPenn president Liz Magill call for a ceasefire in Gaza
'This case arises from NYU's egregious civil rights violations that have created a hostile educational environment in which plaintiffs and other Jewish NYU students have been subjected to pervasive acts of hatred, discrimination, harassment, and intimidation,' the lawsuit reads.
'For years, NYU—acutely aware of ongoing and disgraceful acts of anti-Jewish bigotry—has reacted with, at best, deliberate indifference, refusing to enforce its own anti-discrimination and conduct policies that it readily applies to protect other targets of bigotry, and instead fostering an environment in which students and faculty members are permitted to repeatedly abuse, malign, vilify, and threaten Jewish students with impunity.
'Regularly confronted with such genocidal chants as, 'Hitler was right,' 'gas the Jews,' 'death to kikes,' and 'from the river to the sea,' and other abuse, plaintiffs not only have been deprived of the ability and opportunity to fully and meaningfully participate in NYU's educational and other programs, but they have suffered and have been put at severe risk of extreme emotional and physical injury.'
Inger, Maslavi and Tawil say antisemitism on university campuses increased by 40 percent and that NYU has long been aware of the 'festering Jewish hatred permeating the school.'
They claim the increase in alleged issue was allowed to happen because rather than implementing 'urgently needed protective and disciplinary measures to restore campus order and safety', administrators have 'gaslighted the Jewish students."

Chemistry teacher Alastair Hamilton, 47, paid more than £10,000 to die at the suicide clinic – which then kept his death a secret from his family.
His distraught mother Judith Hamilton, 81, last night warned that other families should be aware of the 'cowboy clinic' called Pegasos which, unlike the better-known Dignitas clinic, does not require people to be terminally ill or to be accompanied by someone when they go there to die.
She said the family still haven't received the goodbye letters the clinic said he had left for them, or his personal belongings he had with him.
The family learned he had taken his life at the clinic only after police examined his bank account statements and found that he had transferred thousands of pounds to Pegasos.
Pegasos had initially refused to speak to them about his remains, saying it was 'against our lawyer's recommendations'. Eventually the family received his ashes in the post - two months after he died.
Shockingly, it took the persistence of Mr Hamilton's devastated family, the Metropolitan Police, the Foreign Office and Interpol to discover what had happened to Alastair after he vanished last summer.

The disturbing case can be revealed amid renewed pressure from cross-party MPs including Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for UK law to be changed to allow assisted suicide in Britain
In emails to Alastair's family, a frustrated Met Police sergeant criticised Pegasos's 'lack of compassion and lack of transparency' as 'completely unacceptable'.
The disturbing case can be revealed amid renewed pressure from cross-party MPs for UK law to be changed to allow assisted suicide in Britain.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer recently called for MPs to be given a vote on the issue, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said it was 'an issue of conscience for individual parliamentarians' to decide on.
Mr Hamilton told his parents he was visiting a friend in Paris when instead he was flying to Basel in Switzerland to end his life by lethal injection.
Alastair's family said they were prompted to talk about their devastating experience amid discussions around assisted death in the UK, where it is currently illegal to help someone kill themselves.
Alastair's brother Toby, 52, said: 'I'm not against assisted dying but you can't let someone who is not terminally ill turn up and do this on their own, completely alone, and then completely disregard the family or next of kin. It's a cowboy operation. These people are cowboys.'
Mrs Hamilton added: 'Why Pegasos acted the way they did and agreed to help Alastair do this, I don't think I will ever understand.
'We're all still heartbroken and still have so many questions, but I'm not sure we will ever get all the answers.'
Under Swiss law, since 1942, people are allowed to help others to die as long as their motives are not selfish, such as for financial gain.
The law states that the person wishing to die must be of sound mind, but they do not need to be terminally ill or have any medical conditions. The country's assisted suicide clinics are non-profit organisations.
Its most famous clinic, Dignitas – where at least 540 Britons have died in the past 20 years – has strict rules that its clients must be terminally ill, suffering extreme pain or living with an 'unendurable disability'.
But Pegasos, run by activist Ruedi Habegger, says its users do not need to be ill to kill themselves. Its website says it will approve someone's death request 'in as little as a few weeks' as long as they are aged over 18.
Alastair's family said he had been battling with low moods since 2022, when he began losing weight and feeling increasingly tired.
His family were unaware and were stone-walled for weeks by the clinic before finding out what had happened to Alistair

Portrait of young Alastair Hamilton
He had given up working full-time and moved back into his parents' home in Hampton, south-west London, but doctors could not work out what was wrong with him.
His worried family paid for multiple private health checks, including tests for cancer and HIV, to understand Alastair's weight loss. But doctors were still unable to diagnose him with any condition.
Toby, who owns a lettings agency, said: 'Alastair started talking about suicide like he was talking about going for a pint down the pub.
'I begged him not to say the 'S word' to our mum and said we would throw money at the problem, whatever he needed, until we figured it out.'
On August 10, Alastair's father Edward, 85, drove him to Gatwick Airport. He had no reason to suspect his son was not travelling to meet a friend in France.
Before he left for the last time, Mrs Hamilton said her son 'put his arms around me and gave me a big kiss, and just said, 'Always remember Mum that I love you very much, I always have, I always will, no matter what'.
'I was so chuffed to think he was picking up his life and getting some enthusiasm, and he was always very affectionate and loving towards me, so it didn't register that these words were his final goodbye.'
His family became concerned when Alastair stopped responding to their calls, texts and voicemails over the next week.
Mrs Hamilton phoned the police to report him as a missing person. Scotland Yard soon established that Alastair had in fact caught a flight to Switzerland.
An analysis of his bank transactions then revealed four payments totalling £10,310 to the Pegasos Swiss Association, a small clinic run from an office in central Basel.
Officers contacted Pegasos but, other than confirming Alastair had died there, the clinic failed to provide police with the date of his death or any other information.
As the days dragged on, Toby persistently emailed the clinic, saying: 'I urge and beg you to please reply to my email as soon as possible.
'Can you imagine what this is doing to our family in an incredibly traumatic time?'
However, the clinic did not reply for another week until it sent a cold email asked Toby to provide scans of his passport and to sign an affidavit in order to receive information about his brother.
Despite Toby doing this immediately, another week passed by before they finally confirmed Alastair had died on August 14.
Last night, Toby said: 'If you had the slightest bit of empathy, and you are the slightest bit of a decent human being, you would pick up the phone and actually talk to the grieving family.'
Mrs Hamilton added: 'I would have remortgaged the house and had his body flown home if I had known what happened, but we never got that chance.'
Only in October – two months after Alastair died – did the family receive his ashes in the post
The family have still not received goodbye letters that the Pegasos clinic (pictured) said he had left for them – or his wristwatch, clothes and other personal effects
Only in October – two months after Alastair died – did the family receive his ashes in the post.
They never received any goodbye letters, despite Pegasos claiming Alastair had left some for them.
They have also never received his wristwatch, clothes or any of his belongings. Toby said: 'We eventually found Alastair's application to Pegasos which was literally just like a two-page covering letter for a job application.
'It doesn't seem like they do any of the checks that Dignitas do. They're not liaising with doctors for medical records or psychotherapists to make sure a person is ill.'
Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen revealed that she had joined the Dignitas clinic after her diagnosis of stage four lung cancer, and urged 'lawmakers to catch up with the public'.
Last night, after hearing about Alastair Hamilton's case, Dame Esther told The Mail on Sunday: 'Obviously, any new law in the UK will need precautions built in.
'We can learn from other countries where such laws are already in place as to what is the most practical and humane way of legalising assisted dying without making people vulnerable.'
Pegasos did not respond to several requests for comment.

Cabinet Minister Penny Mordaunt warned that the Royal Navy must 'keep pace' with its rivals in a stark intervention in a row over the size of the fleet.
It came as Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was unable to say when the UK might hit its target of spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence, amid warnings about the shrinking size of the British Army.
Yesterday General Lord Dannatt hit out at the shrinking size of the army, which he said has fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today 'and falling fast'.
Writing in The Times,  the former Army commander drew parallels with the 1930s when the 'woeful' state of the UK's armed forces failed to deter Hitler.
In a tweet today Ms Mordaunt, the Commons leader and MP for Portsmouth North, who is also a Navy reservist, linked to a Sunday Times article about the shrinking size of the Royal Navy. 'The Royal Navy and its partners must keep pace with the growing capabilities of other nations. If not Britain's interests cannot be secured,' she wrote.
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Shapps clapped back, saying: 'I'm in a post where there are a lot of people with opinions and a lot of people who've been in the military and armed forces will often express them.'

Cabinet Minister Penny Mordaunt warned that the Royal Navy must 'keep pace' with its rivals in a stark intervention in a row over the size of the fleet.
It came as Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was unable to say when the UK might hit its target of spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence, amid warnings about the shrinking size of the British Army.

Yesterday General Lord Dannatt hit out at the shrinking size of the army, which he said has fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today 'and falling fast'.
A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Tories having public spats about the state of our Forces are the same Tories that have hollowed them out over the last 14 years.
'Since 2010, they have cut the Army to its smallest size since Napoleon, removed one in five ships from the Royal Navy, and taken more than 200 aircraft out of service in the last five years alone, all while plunging satisfaction with service life to new lows.'
'Labour knows the first duty of any Government is to keep the nation safe and protect our citizens. In government we will renew the countries commitment to those who serve and make sure our forces have the kit they need to fight.'
The Defence Secretary was challenged over why he could not give people a commitment on when the 2.5 per cent target will be reached at a time when he has warned about rising global threats.
He pointed to the Navy's modernisation programme and new weapons systems, telling the BBC: 'There is a trajectory upwards. 'I can't give you the exact date because we've always said it's as the economic conditions allow. But the point is we're working to a plan.'
Earlier, on Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, he defended Jeremy Hunt's focus on tax cuts rather than upping defence spending, saying 'the Chancellor has been incredibly generous' with a nearly 10 per cent pay rise for the Armed Forces.
'We are committed to spending more when conditions allow. But I also think that it is true to say that people do want to see more of the money that they earn kept.'
Under Government proposals, the size of the regular army will be cut from a commitment of 82,000 troops to 73,000 by 2025.
But analysis by The Times suggested numbers could drop below that as soon as next year and continue on a steep downward trajectory.
If the army continues to shed troops at the current rate, the number of regular soldiers will fall below 70,000 by 2026, according to the figures compiled by the newspaper.
The army has faced growing recruitment challenges, but is focused on bolstering hiring and improving retention - and last summer laid out pay increases for personnel.
Lord Dannatt said pay and conditions should be 'urgently reviewed' and 'a pay rise to attract recruits and to retain current trained personnel should be a priority, as should addressing the appalling quality of some armed forces accommodation'.
Noting a lack of investment in equipment and infrastructure, The Times quoted an unnamed former senior US general as saying the UK was seen as 'having diminished capabilities over the past couple of decades'.
'Hence, while being the most important ally across the board, it is decidedly not what it used to be, regrettably.'
Mr Shapps today pledged the size of the British Army will not dip below 73,000 under the Conservatives.
He added: 'It isn't a question of how many men and women you have on the ground only, it's about how lethal your armed forces are.'
The size of the overall armed forces is around 188,000, Mr Shapps said."

Sir Ephraim Mirvis said that using the word in this context is a 'moral inversion' which is meant to 'tear open the still gaping wound' of the Holocaust.
He said that the misappropriation of the word was offensive to both the victims and the survivors of the Holocaust.
He added it is also insulting to those affected by more recent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.
The warning comes ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day on January 27, amid fears of some organisations being pressured to refer to claims of genocide in Gaza in their commemorations.
Israel has been accused of inciting genocide against Palestinians during the ongoing conflict.
On December 29, South Africa filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice alleging its conduct in Gaza was genocide. This has been supported by several countries, but Israel officials labelled the claims as 'disgraceful'.
Israel will appear before the court at The Hague in the Netherlands after South Africa's request for a hearing, based on the fact both countries have signed the United Nations 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.
The United States have joined Israel in rejecting these claims.

The Chief Rabbi wrote in The Telegraph that the allegation of genocide was 'the ultimate demonization of the Jewish state'.
He wrote: 'It is a term deployed not only to eradicate any notion that Israel has a responsibility to protect its citizens, but also to tear open the still gaping wound of the Holocaust, knowing that it will inflict more pain than any other accusation.
'It is a moral inversion, which undermines the memory of the worst crimes in human history.'
He added that the 'enthusiastic clamour' to use the term is a 'moral failure built upon a foundation of hatred and misinformation'.
Genocide is defined as 'the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group' by the Oxford Dictionary.
Sir Ephraim said that if Israel's intentions were genocidal, it could have employed its military strength to 'level Gaza in a mater of days'.
The Chief Rabbi added that instead, it is 'providing civilians with advance notice' even if it risks the military objectives.
The African nation alleges that 'acts and omissions by Israel... are genocidal in character' as they are committed with the intent 'to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethical group'.
South Africa's foreign ministry said in a statement that the country is 'gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants'.

South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa (pictured) has previously accused Israel of war crimes and acts 'tantamount to genocide'
The ministry added that there are 'ongoing reports of international crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, being committed as well as reports that acts meeting the threshold of genocide or related crimes as defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, have been and may still be committed in the context of the ongoing massacres in Gaza'.
It also asks the court to issue an interim order for Israel to immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza.
A hearing into that request is likely in the coming days or weeks. The case, if it goes ahead, will take years.
South Africa can bring the case under the Genocide Convention because both it and Israel are signatories to the convention.
Israel's foreign ministry issued a statement in response in which it said the case lacks a legal foundation and constitutes a 'vile exploitation and cheapening' of the court.
The statement also said Israel is committed to, and operates according to, international law and focuses its military actions solely against Hamas, adding that the residents of Gaza are not an enemy.
It asserted that it takes steps to minimise harm to civilians and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the territory.
'Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa and its application to the International Court of Justice,' the statement read.
'South Africa's claim lacks both a factual and a legal basis, and constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the court.'

Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said South Africa's case 'provides an important opportunity for the International Court of Justice to scrutinise Israel's actions in Gaza using the Genocide Convention of 1948'.
She said South Africa is looking to the United Nations' highest judicial body 'to provide clear, definitive answers on the question of whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people'.
Whether the case will succeed in halting the war remains to be seen. While the court's orders are legally binding, they are not always followed.
In March 2022, the court ordered Russia to halt hostilities in Ukraine, a binding legal ruling that Moscow flouted as it pressed ahead with its devastating attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities.
South Africa has been a fierce critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
Many, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa's past apartheid regime of racial segregation.

Ian Bailey, who was convicted of murdering the filmmaker in 1996, collapsed in the street in Bantry, West Cork.
People immediately rushed to provide assistance to the 66-year-old, who would have turned 67 on January 27.
One local first aider reportedly provided CPR for 20 minutes until the emergency services arrived, but Mr Bailey was unresponsive and pronounced dead at the scene.
He had previously suffered up to three heart attacks and had been admitted to both Bantry Hospital and Cork University Hospital, where in the latter he had a procedure done on his heart.

Mr Bailey was one of the first to report on the death of 39-year-old Sophie Toscan Du Plantier when she was murdered outside her holiday home in a rural part of West Cork
However, it was deemed he was too unwell to have a required by-pass operation.
Mr Bailey was one of the first to report on the death of 39-year-old Sophie Toscan Du Plantier when she was murdered outside her holiday home in a rural part of West Cork.
He was arrested twice but never tried in Ireland. In 2019 he was found guilty in France, where he was tried 'in absentia' and sentenced to 25 years behind bars.
In 2020, Ireland's High Court rejected an attempt by French authorities to have him extradited.
He has always denied any involvement in the horrendous murder, but was arrested twice and questioned about the murder which horrified the country.
While reporting on the case for newspapers across Ireland and the UK, Mr Bailey delivered food to Sophie's neighbour's house - and saw this as an opportunity to look at the crime scene.
A Netflix documentary explained how Bailey wrote stories about Sophie having a string of lovers and having parties with 'sex, drugs and rock and roll' which locals blasted as 'ridiculous'.
Mr Bailey had previously suffered up to three heart attacks and had been admitted to both Bantry Hospital and Cork University Hospital
An integral part of French 90s showbusiness culture, Sophie was the wife of Daniel Toscan du Plantier, a famous Parisian film producer - and a friend of Jacques Chirac - and mother to Pierre Louis, her much adored son from a previous relationship.
Her friends and family explain that she had one lover - Bruno Carbonnet - who was known to her husband and that they had split acrimoniously in 1993.
He was a suspect in the early investigation but was able to prove he was in Paris at the time of the murder.
Sophie had loved to retreat from the spotlight and social whirl of Paris to the rugged beauty and solitude of the wind-blown Irish coast, where she could be alone to think, write and walk.

Three years before her death she had bought a bleached white house in West Cork, over the churning Atlantic Ocean, the Fastnet lighthouse blinking in the distance.
In December 1996, she returned for a short pre-Christmas break, intending to head back to her husband and son in Paris for the festive celebrations. She never made it.
Sophie's body, battered almost beyond recognition, was discovered lying face-up in the grass verge of a lane, 100 yards from the house she loved in Toormore, a tiny outcrop, six miles West of the nearest town, Schull.
She was clothed in white pyjamas and was wearing hastily laced-up boots.
A large rock and concrete block, both spattered with her blood, had been used to strike her repeatedly on the head and body.
The coroner's report noted she had 50 separate injuries."
PJ0V3R69OK_1YY025QQS12UMAD,DAN HODGES: Three wise men rescued Rishi. But nothing will save the Tories if this farce continues,"Dan Hodges, Mail on Sunday","Published: 23:30 GMT, 20 January 2024 | Updated: 05:19 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240114,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12986973/rishi-sunak-prime-minister-tories-farce.html,"Ultimately it was the three wise men who came to the Prime Minister's rescue. 'Jacob Rees-Mogg, IDS [Iain Duncan Smith] and John Redwood were the ones who saved Rishi,' a rebel MP explained to me about last week's Rwanda Bill. 'We had the votes. More than 60 of us voted to amend the Bill. But those three convinced everyone we couldn't destroy the whole thing. IDS said, ""We can't hand Starmer that victory."" '
So Sunak and his Rwanda plan limp on.
When it came to the crunch, the so-called 'Five Families' of disparate Tory plotters who had modelled themselves on New York's Mafia crime gangs ended up looking more like a mob from Bugsy Malone than The Godfather.
Despite the threats and resignations, only 11 Tory MPs actually voted against the legislation.
But if the PM thinks his internal troubles are behind him, his backbench opponents insist he should think again. 'We've shown we've easily got the numbers to defeat the Government,' another insurgent told me. 'It's only a matter of time now. Sooner or later an issue will come up where our interests and Labour's interests align. And then people will strike.'
Ultimately it was the three wise men who came to the Prime Minister's rescue. 'Jacob Rees-Mogg, IDS [Iain Duncan Smith] and John Redwood were the ones who saved Rishi,' a rebel MP explained to me about last week's Rwanda Bill

A colleague agrees. 'A number of flashpoints are coming up. There'll be another string of by-election defeats. The polls aren't turning, they're getting worse. Then we've got the local elections, which will be a bloodbath.
'And Sunak doesn't have a strategy to turn things around. He keeps saying he's taking long-term decisions, but in truth he can't take a decision on anything unless he's forced to.'
All this forms the rationale that the Tory rebels keep putting forward for their ongoing agitation. They don't want to have to oust Sunak, they insist. They just want A Better Rishi. If only he'd follow their lead and political instincts, he would realign his Government and party with its fracturing base, see off the looming threat of Reform (formerly Ukip), and transform his electoral fortunes. It's a rationale rooted in utter delusion.
More plots. More parliamentary guerrilla warfare. More hackneyed, self-aggrandising allusions to Cosa Nostra capos.
That would simply lead the Tory Party to a single destination – electoral destruction.
The simple truth is the rebels now have two choices.
First, stop all the grandstanding and game-playing, and just get on and dump Rishi Sunak.
Yes, given their recent habit of changing leaders with the frequency some people change socks, this would represent a desperate final gamble. But at least it would contain a sliver of logic.

The message the Tories should be hammering home to voters is clear: 'If Starmer lied to them to become Labour leader, he won't have any problem in lying to you'. PIctured: John Redwood
A rebel MP said: 'We had the votes. More than 60 of us voted to amend the Bill. But those three convinced everyone we couldn't destroy the whole thing. Iain Duncan Smith said, ""We can't hand Starmer that victory."" '
Sunak's personal approval ratings are now plumbing Liz Truss-like depths. He has a common touch that makes Marie Antoinette look like Fred Dibnah. And at this stage of the electoral cycle there is neither time nor space for any great political reinvention.
The Rishi the Tories have is the Rishi they're stuck with.
That is, unless they forcibly remove him, replace him with a more instinctive populist such as Boris Johnson or Kemi Badenoch, and try to completely reframe the debate. Such a course would be unlikely to deliver victory. But it might just mitigate their losses, and keep Sir Keir Starmer honest.
The second option is for the Tory malcontents to ditch dreams of sacking their leader and decide to back him. Properly back him.
Shut down the shadowy cabals. Shove the alternative manifestos and policy papers in the shredder. End the sniping and conniving, get their heads down and actually – Heaven forbid – throw their weight behind their own Tory Prime Minister and his strategy.
OK, in fairness, that would need Sunak to identify a strategy and stick to it.
The Five Pledges Plan. The Ditch The Green Crap And Get The Government Off People's Backs Plan. The Make People Healthier And Happier By Banning Smoking And Gambling And TikTok Plan.
If the PM thinks his internal troubles are behind him, his backbench opponents insist he should think again. 'We've shown we've easily got the numbers to defeat the Government,' another insurgent told me. 'It's only a matter of time now. Sooner or later an issue will come up where our interests and Labour 's interests align. And then people will strike'
Over the past year, each has been rolled out, then hastily rolled back again. Creating confusion and anxiety even among those who are minded to give him their support.
'I don't mind backing Rishi,' one Tory MP told me forlornly. 'In fact, I want to back him. But to do that he's got to give us something to back.'
He also has to give his party something to attack. Instead of focusing their fire on their own Prime Minister – and by extension their own feet – Tory backbenchers need to be channelling their aggression towards Labour. But again, to do that, they need their PM to take a lead.
It's clear that Sunak and his team have yet to agree on a clear plan for defining and defeating Starmer. Their current strategy appears to be to try to paint him as a dangerous ideologue who is merely waiting to throw off the slightly threadbare cloak of Blairism and unleash unfettered Marxism on an unsuspecting nation.
But that attack is not finding resonance, because it doesn't align with reality.
The problem isn't that Starmer secretly believes in a genuine socialist alternative. It's that he doesn't appear to believe in much of anything.
Last week saw – for the umpteenth time – surreptitious briefings that he is preparing to ditch his £28 billion Green Prosperity Plan, which sits at the heart of his economic and political programme. The Ten Pledges he used to trick Jeremy Corbyn's downcast activists into handing him the Labour leadership have been unashamedly dumped.
The problem isn't that Starmer secretly believes in a genuine socialist alternative. It's that he doesn't appear to believe in much of anything
So the message the Tories should be hammering home to voters is clear: 'If Starmer lied to them to become Labour leader, he won't have any problem in lying to you.'
Yet even if Sunak can sharpen Tory spears to the point they can pierce Starmer's hitherto impregnable armour, there is little point if so many Tory MPs remain obsessed with fighting among themselves rather than taking the fight to Labour. As one Minister admitted to me: 'The problem is that some of our MPs don't even want to win the General Election. If they can't have their own pure agenda they'd like to see the world burn.'
Well, if they carry on as they have over the past few days, they will get their wish.
Divided parties lose elections. But parties that descend into a rabble get annihilated in them.
And this is what the Tories looked like last week. It began with Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick – both until recently the most senior Ministers responsible for implementing the Rwanda plan – telling anyone who would listen that the plan isn't fit for purpose.
And it ended with the bizarre spectacle of Tory deputy chairman Lee Anderson resigning so he could oppose the Bill, then reversing his decision and rushing out of the 'No' lobby because he claimed Labour MPs were laughing at him.
Sunak's personal approval ratings are now plumbing Liz Truss-like depths. He has a common touch that makes Marie Antoinette look like Fred Dibnah
What on earth do the rebels think they will achieve by ensuring the farce of their Rwanda non-rebellion is played out over and over again between now and polling day? What is the desired outcome?
That Rishi Sunak will finally be cowed into submission and bend to their iron will? That voters deserting their party in droves will look at this clown-show and say, 'I thought the Tory Party was losing touch with the likes of me. But look at them. Eleven out of 349 MPs took a principled stand, and the deputy chairman did a runner because people were giggling at him. They're the guys for me!'
Last week those three wise men may have saved Rishi. And they may have temporarily managed to save their colleagues from themselves.
But much more of this, and there is nothing that will save them or their party from the verdict of the British people."

Pastor Chris Avell, of Dad's Place in Bryan, Ohio, was criminally charged with zoning violations on December 8.
The church, located next door to a homeless shelter, started opening its doors to people escaping the cold in March 2023, reported WTVG.
On November 21, the fire chief conducted a fire code inspection and discovered 18 violations. Officials performed two more inspections in January and found several violations that had not been fixed.
'The only reason this is still an ongoing fire/safety concern is because Chris Avell ignored the City's notices in the fall hence forcing criminal charges related to zoning,' city leaders claimed.

Dad's Place appears to continue to be open to sheltering people from the cold. On Facebook, the church said they would remain open 24/7 as a warming station from January 13 to January 16 to escape the bitter cold that gripped Ohio.
'We'll see, but I'm just, I'm praising God that at least as of now if I'm understanding correctly, the people can stay,' Avell said. 'We’re a church, you know, this is what we do.'
Jeremy Dys, the attorney representing Avell said, 'We're disappointed with the city that they would take that extra measure.'
'There are multiple attorneys on this case, Mayor Schlade and anyone from the city could have come and talked to any of us at any time.'
The city said the church is located in a C-3 zoning district, which means it is not permitted for residential use.
The violations found in November include improper installation of laundry facilities, inadequate or unsafe exit areas, an improperly installed gas grill, an unpermitted gas dryer, no permitted and approved kitchen hood over the stove and limited ventilation.
During a November inspection, the fire department said they found 18 violations. Then returned twice in January and found people sleeping in the building and a gas leak
On November 17, the city zoning administrator recommended that Bryan Chief of Police Gregory Ruskey (pictured) file charges against Dad's Place
When the fire department returned on January 9, they found five violations had not been fixed. They returned again on January 16  and discovered approximately 20 people sleeping in the building and a gas leak.
The zoning administrator inspected Dad's Place on November 17 and said he saw multiple people sleeping in the building and were told there was a bedroom in the facility.
This led to the office recommending that Bryan Chief of Police Gregory Ruskey file charges against Dad's Place.
On September 30, police received a complaint about a sex offender living out of his vehicle in the church parking lot.
The City of Bryan said they started receiving an increase in calls for service based on inappropriate activity at Dad's Place since May 2023."

The sophisticated swindle involves criminals approaching people, often the old or the lonely, with a 'wrong number' introductory message before they develop a friendship over months and convince them to invest their life savings in a bogus scheme.
It takes its name from the concept of fattening up a pig before slaughter.
After a news segment about the scam aired on The Project on Sunday night, host Rachel Corbett revealed she had received a phone call version of the con.
'It was such a weird situation that somebody had called, asked for a name that wasn't mine. I said 'no' and then instead of doing the normal thing of just hanging up and going, 'sorry', they said, 'oh, I must have got it wrong' and they started to  keep me on the phone,' Corbett told her co-hosts.

The TV star said the call caught her by surprise and 'felt weird and wrong and odd'.
Australian victims of 'pig butchering', which is also known as 'romance baiting, lost up to $4500 every hour in 2022.
The Australian Federal Police is cautioning lonely hearts to be wary of organised criminals this Valentine's Day.
For the first time, it released a pig-butchering criminal playbook seized in a raid to inform the public of the tactics used.
Acting Assistant Commissioner Cybercrime Command Chris Goldsmid the pig butchering manual had four key steps – packaging, raising, killing/investment scam and cash out.
The 'packaging' stage involves scammer adopting the persona of a good looking and successful business owner or investor before they send a genuine-seeming accidental 'hello' text intended for someone else.
Scammers often use a genuine-seeming 'wrong number' message before seeking to develop a friendship with the victim over months to convince them to invest their life savings in a bogus scheme
Australians lost more than $322 million in investment scams last year
Dating and romance scams accounted for $35 million in losses
Here are tips to avoid becoming a victim of this cruel hoax:
- Don't invest in foreign exchange, cryptocurrency or speculative investments with people you've only ever encountered in the online environment
- Be particularly wary of crypto, which has always been associated with scams and criminal activity
- If you are unsure, get a second opinion from a professional, in-person

- Talk to friends and family to get an outside perspective. Confiding in someone could help prevent or minimise losses
- If something doesn't sound normal then it could be a scam. For instance being asked to pay your through crypto or with gift cards
- When it comes to relationships, understand that you really don't know anyone at all until you physically meet them
Offenders are encouraged to say they are 28-35 years old, to show they understand pop culture and are educated or have well-paying jobs.
Next comes the 'raising' stage where the scammer slowly grooms the individual over a period of weeks, months or even years.
They often message their victims every morning and reach out every night before confessing their love and using pet names for the victims, like 'baby' or 'wife'.
Scammers then flaunt their supposed wealthy lifestyle and encourage the victims to think they can achieve the same thing if they invest through certain schemes, often involving cryptocurrency.
Victims think they are trading on legitimate platforms but the money is actually siphoned into an account owned by offenders who created fake platforms that look identical to well-known sites.
Finally, the scammer reaches the 'cash out' stage where they convince the victim to make one final investment with a false promise it will allow them to withdraw their funds.
There are different manuals that tailored for age, gender, sexual preference and geography.
Acting Assistant Commissioner Goldsmid said traditional romance scams were often initiated on dating apps but pig butchering often started with cold texting individuals on messaging apps.
'Pig butchering does not target individuals with the false hope of a relationship but instead initiates a conversation looking for friendship,'' Assistant Commissioner Goldsmid said.
'Scammers usually say the accidental messages are because of 'fate' or 'divine will'.
'Over the course of months or years, the scammer will flaunt a lavish lifestyle and leave a trail of comments about their wealth, such as bragging about the value in their cryptocurrency wallets.
'Once victims ask how they are making their money, victims are directed to a complete replica of an investment site that shows the growth of an investment.
'When the victim sends money to invest, victims are provided weekly, month or yearly investment statements, that show continual growth in their investment. Often the victim provides even more money to invest.
'When the victim wants to cash out or the scammer believes there no more money to scam out of the victim, the offender tries one more time to get money by saying things like, 'taxes need to be paid but I know a great accountant', or 'we are all meeting at a luxurious resort for our AGM, our travel agent can book for you, just provide them the cash for the airfares and accommodation'.

West Midlands Police said the teenager was found with serious injuries at 15:30 and was taken to hospital, but tragically passed away.
The police have launched a murder investigation and have asked members of the public to come forward if they have any information or footage that may help.
The teenager was found in Victoria Square - a pedestrianised area in the heart of the city, near to the Council building and the Town Hall.
The square was previously home to the travelling Knife Angel sculpture. The 27ft-high artwork was made of 100,000 knives which were collected as part of weapons amnesties by police forces across the UK.
Police added that after initial investigations took place, the cordon at the scene has been removed but officers will continue to be 'highly visible' in the area and no arrests have yet been made.
Detectives are in the process of reviewing CCTV and carrying out other enquiries.

Chief Inspector James Spencer, from Birmingham Local Policing Area, said: 'The life of a 17-year-old boy has tragically been taken away and all our thoughts are with his family and friends at this awful time.
'It's very early stages in the investigation but we have a team of skilled detectives who are working to identify, and arrest, whoever did this.
'We fully understand the shock and concern this will cause, and although it is being treated as an isolated incident a visible police presence will remain across the city centre.'
'We're keen to hear from anyone who may have information which can assist our enquiries.'
One onlooker said they saw the victim 'lying on a bench' before emergency services arrived at the scene.
They said: 'We were filming a K-pop video and saw a man laying on the bench. The people were standing next to him and suddenly the police came running and a minute later the ambulance arrived.'
A woman who saw the police arrive told BirminghamLive: 'We were by the fountain when we saw a man lying on the bench.
'The people were standing next to him and suddenly the police came running and a minute later the ambulance arrived. That was sometime between 15:00 and 15:30..
'The victim was still alive at that time. We hadn't heard any screaming or anything but then the police sealed off the area. That's when we were interviewed by the police about it.'

QNGL1WQWCP_EZATPDBUE5S4X3S,EXCLUSIVEI beat hot flushes at work by freezing out my colleagues,Claudia Connell for the Daily Mail,"Published: 20:15 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 20:57 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12989279/I-beat-hot-flushes-work-freezing-colleagues.html,"After last week's chilling Arctic freeze, we're now set for weather to rival the Riviera. So are we turning the heating down? On or off?
While predictions of unseasonably balmy days this week may be a welcome relief for some of us, there's nothing quite like a fluctuating temperature gauge to ignite a row about optimum comfort levels.
And while this might be a perennial source of conflict between couples at home, in my experience nothing can get quite as heated as a row about the temperature at work.
And now it's official.
The Government is encouraging employers to sign up to the Menopause Workplace Pledge, promising to help menopausal colleagues wherever possible — including recommendations for cooler office temperatures.

The Labour Party — eager to secure the hot flush vote — has gone a step further, proposing paid menopause leave and temperature-controlled 'cool zones' at work.
But while the thought of herding a bunch of middle-aged women into a specially designated corner of the office — near the fridge, perhaps? — might at first sound a bit unhinged, I actually think they might be on to something.
Because, there was once a time when I was quite the office hottie.
Unfortunately, not in the sense that everyone was captivated by my dazzling beauty and killer figure. No, in my case it was more literal.
When I was in the grips of menopause, a combination of out-of-control hot flushes and the oppressive office central heating made me feel like a chicken on a barbecue.
As surprised as I am to find myself siding with the snowflakes, if we'd had such cool zones when I was going through the change, I wouldn't have been driven to commit the sneaky act of sabotage that I did — and that my colleagues still talk of to this day.
My journey to work was unbearable. During the winter, London Tube carriages are heated to sauna-like levels but often too packed to be able to remove and carry a coat.
Nothing can get quite as heated as a row about the temperature at work (file photo)
I would arrive at my desk a damp, frizzy, dehydrated mess. And the huge open-plan office provided no respite to a woman who had yet to succumb to HRT. We sat on large communal desks next to windows that didn't open while heat pumped out from ceiling vents.
The majority of staff were perfectly happy with the temperature, a few complained that it was too cold (there's always one, isn't there?). But I found it unbearable.
Despite stripping down to a T-shirt and having an electric fan at my terminal, it was stifling and I couldn't focus on my work.
The temperature was centrally controlled in some boiler room deep in the bowels of the building. Every now and then a chap in overalls would appear, wave a thermometer around and disappear.
After cornering him (the poor man was probably terrified of the raging, red-faced lunatic who accosted him by a lift), I learned that it was possible to alter the temperature in individual sections, via a wall thermostat hidden away in a dark corner. Aha!
The next evening, while working late, I saw that the thermostat was set to 23C (73F). What were we? Lizards? I wasn't having that.
I turned the temperature down to a more acceptable 20 c (68 f). But would that be cool enough in a room with a lot of bodies and no natural ventilation? Best make it 17C (63F). Then again, that was washing-line drying weather. This internal negotiation went on for several minutes until I settled on 14C (15F). Job done.
The next morning, I arrived to be greeted by colleagues sitting in coats and woolly hats.
'The heating is broken,' one said to me, glumly.
'Oh dear,' I replied. Maintenance men were summoned, they got on ladders and examined vents but — to my relief — didn't look at the wall thermostat.
Finally, comfortable for the first time in months, I switched off my desk fan and enjoyed the blissful cool.
It's very easy to get warmer when you feel the cold — you just pile on more layers. It's a different story when you're hot and bothered (file image)
Over the next few days, colleagues began turning up in thermal body warmers and fingerless gloves as I rolled my eyes. What a bunch of drama queens.
When a whole team of engineers with stepladders appeared, I quietly turned the heating back up — lowering it again the second they'd gone.
My wicked ruse went on for several weeks until one pesky engineer beat me to the thermostat and declared, 'Someone has set this to 14C!'
Busted. I confessed to howls of outrage. But I wasn't sorry.
My reasoning is that it's very easy to get warmer when you feel the cold — you just pile on more layers. It's a different story when you're hot and bothered. Other than jumping naked into the fountain in the foyer (which I suspect may have been frowned upon by management), there was nothing I could do.
From tea slurpers and throat clearers and pen stealers, there will always be annoying work colleagues and their habits to contend with.
But if 'cool zones' come into being, then at least office hotties like me will no longer be driven to Traitors-level subterfuge."
QNRRIV55ZK_A67DMG71XNWDK3O,UMass students are BANNED from studying abroad after they staged anti-Israel sit-in on campus and were arrested after ignoring police officers' orders to leave,Noa Halff For Dailymail.Com,"Published: 01:03 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 01:43 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12987487/UMass-students-BANNED-studying-abroad-staged-anti-Israel-sit-campus-arrests.html,"A University of Massachusetts Amherst student is facing a sudden setback in his plans to study abroad in Spain after taking part in an anti-Israel sit-in on campus and defying police officers' orders to leave.
Aidan O' Neill, a junior at UMass Amherst, along with two other students, had their eligibility to study abroad revoked after their involvement in an Oct. 25 protest supporting Palestinians led to arrests and disciplinary probation.

After refusing police orders to leave the building when it closed at 6 pm, 56 students, including O'Neill, and one staff member were arrested for trespassing, and then placed on disciplinary probation until the end of the spring semester.
O'Neill's study abroad eligibility was then revoked as he had signed an agreement that prohibits students from participating in the program if they have pending legal or disciplinary actions or are on academic probation.
The initial protest on Oct. 25 involved 500 students demanding UMass sever ties with defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, a producer of missile components for Israel's Iron Dome.

The protest demanded UMass sever ties with defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, a producer of missile components for Israel 's Iron Dome
The Iron Dome is an Israeli mobile all-weather air defense system that successfully intercepts upward of 90 percent of projectiles. Since Hamas's unprovoked Oct. 7 massacre, more than 11,000 rockets have been fired toward Israel.
O'Neill, along with faculty members, are now fighting back - emphasizing the right to voice opposition to what they call the university's alleged support for 'genocide.'
'To lose my abroad eligibility at the last second, that was just heartbreaking,' O'Neill said to the Boston Globe. 'I was practicing my right as a student to speak up against the university funding a genocide. It just seemed, honestly, crazy and absurd to me that the university was going that far to punish me.'
The students are arguing that their punishment is disproportionately severe due to their political views, despite the university claiming it is merely adhering to the established policies, irrespective of the protest's content.
Faculty members, including Rachel Mordecai and Jason Moralee, have rallied behind O'Neill, denouncing the denial of his study abroad opportunity as an excessive penalty for 'peaceful political expression.'
O'Neill 'was participating in a peaceful expression of his political convictions,' Rachel Mordecai, O'Neill's faculty adviser said to the Boston Globe.
'This denial of the opportunity to study abroad constitutes a disproportionate penalty for what Aidan participated in.
Mordecai wrote a letter in defense of O'Neill, signed by 23 other faculty members. The statement, obtained by the Globe, called O'Neill 'an exceptionally successful and talented student.'

O'Neill's study abroad eligibility was then revoked as he had signed an agreement that prohibits students from participating in the program if they have pending legal or disciplinary actions or are on academic probation
O'Neill was set to leave to Barcelona on Jan. 3 for his study abroad program, which he'd been planning since last spring. Now, the junior is staying in his hometown, Scituate, until next semester begins in the spring.
The students were told they were no longer eligible weeks before their trip, leaving them with thousands of dollars in fees and travel expenses. One student is now threatening to take legal action against the school.
Jason Moralee, the Associate Dean of Research and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion also advocated for O'Neill and the two other students by urging fellow administrators to swiftly clear them for study abroad.
Moralee highlighted that students with code of conduct violations, academic probation, or other issues are routinely permitted to study abroad.
He argued that students with clear records, like O'Neill's, who engaged in protests should not be hindered in their eligibility to participate in the study abroad program.
'Surely, peaceful protest done by exemplary students whose records are otherwise clear ... is an offense that should not in itself prevent students from studying abroad,' he said to the Globe.
But University spokesperson Ed Blaguszewski defended the IPO's decision, stating that the decision aligns with the university's past practices and the Student Agreement of Participation signed by each student.

'To participate in a UMass Amherst study abroad program, students must be in good standing academically with the university and in compliance with the university's Code of Student Conduct,' he expressed in a statement to the Globe.
'Consistent with the university's past practice and the Student Agreement of Participation signed by each student, IPO revoked eligibility for these students to study abroad for the upcoming winter/spring terms.'
Contrary to the university's stance, O'Neill and the other students argue that their disciplinary treatment deviates from past practices.
O'Neill and the other students, facing uncertainty, were informed of their inability to study abroad on the last day of the semester, leaving them in a state of limbo.
One student, represented by attorney Shahily 'Shay' Negrón, claims to be confronted with up to $20,000 in fees for the overseas program.
Negrón emphasized the emotional and financial toll the ordeal has taken on the student.
'They have been extremely distraught,' Negrón said to the Globe. 'This entire ordeal has had a toll on my client emotionally [and] financially.'
UMass is 'harming my client because she exercised her right to free speech,' he added.
O'Neill said he is still considering participating in a study abroad program next year, when his probation clears.
'If things had happened differently, I'd be in Barcelona right now, living with the host family and having the study abroad experience,' he said to the Globe. 'I feel really crushed by my university. I feel like they've just betrayed my trust for the last time.'"

Ms Lattouf has launched legal proceedings against the ABC after she was sacked in December just three days into a week-long hosting gig on Radio Sydney's morning show.
She was let go after sharing a social media post about the conflict in Gaza.
The radio host claims she was discriminated against because of her Lebanese heritage and her political expression, allegations the broadcaster has denied.

Jackson Allard was initially admitted to the University of Minnesota Medical Center in October 2023 for stomach pain.
After doctors conducted tests, he was found suffering from Influenza 4 and double pneumonia which had impacted his lungs and oxygen levels.
The young adult had been intubated to give his lungs a chance to heal but his condition kept deteriorating and doctors were forced to place him on an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) machine.
Ultimately, multiple doctors advised Allard to have a double lung transplant to survive.

The young adult had been intubated to give his lungs a chance to heal but his condition kept deteriorating and doctors were forced to place him on an ECMO machine
Allard's grandmother, Doreen Hurlburt said: 'At one point, a doctor said he had a 1 percent chance of living and we said, ""He's fighting, he's fought for how many weeks we're going to give him a chance to fight, we're not going to stop any procedures or anything.""'
'He's just friendly, he's outgoing, everybody's just attracted to his energy and how much fun he is.
'I thought for sure we were going to lose him. I thought for sure he’s not going to survive this, but in my mind I kept picturing him coming home.
'You have to stop vaping, and we kept telling him that over and over and over again, and he was a heavy vaper. He vaped all the time, but he said, ""It’s better than cigarettes.""'
'Well they said, with cigarettes in 50 years you’ll have lung cancer, in five years, if you vape they will see you with permanent lung damage.'
The vape-addicted adult and his mother, Jamie, will be staying in Minneapolis for at least six months to attend regular check-ups at the university hospital.
Based on the current situation, Allard can never drink alcohol or smoke and will need another transplant in his life.
According to the GoFundMe page launched by Hurlburt, the last words he said before being intubated were: 'I am scared, I don’t want to be alone.'
The fundraising page has raised $20,910 toward its $30,000 goal.

According to Johns Hopkins University research on vape ingredients, thousands of chemical ingredients in vape products have not been identified.
But among those identified, several were harmful substances, including caffeine, three chemicals never previously found in e-cigarettes, a pesticide and two flavorings linked with possible toxic effects and respiratory irritation.
A University of North Carolina study also found that the two primary ingredients found in e-cigarettes, propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, are toxic to body cells.
'Emerging data suggests links to chronic lung disease and asthma, as well as associations between dual use of e-cigarettes and smoking with cardiovascular disease,' Dr. Michael Blaha, director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, said.
Based on the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey, over two million American middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes, with more than eight in 10 using flavored e-cigarettes.
The process of getting a double lung transplant is not without its own risks.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the human immune system protects the body against foreign substances and even if the patients has the best possible match with the donor, the body will try to attack and reject the new lungs.
To decrease the risk of organ rejection, patients are given immunosuppressant medications which they need to consume for the rest of their life.
A risk of infection, kidney damage, osteoporosis and cancer also exist."

Mark Elton travelled from Melbourne to Perth for the gig checking the instrument in as oversized baggage with stickers market 'fragile' on the case.
But when the musician of more than 30 years opened up the bag when he arrived, he noticed large cracks in the wood.
'Hey @qantas! Thanks for a very depressing start to my month of shows at @fringeworldperth 2024,' he posted to Instagram along with images of the damage.

The musician who was set to perform a month of shows at the Perth Fringe festival, said the double bass looked like it had been 'dropped from a considerable height', blaming the baggage handlers
'What's worse is there was no apology or notification of any accident involving my precious instrument.
'After many years of being a club member and choosing to fly with @qantas I'm hoping you'll support me through this major emotional & financial setback.'
With a month of shows lined up and no way to get a tune out of his double bass, fellow musicians rallied to his support with WA Symphony Orchestra double bassist and luthier Andrew Tait, loaning him an instrument.
Qantas have since responded to the complaint and checked CCTV.
The airline said there was no evidence of damage to the case in transit, but did offer a goodwill payment.
'We know how important it is to handle all luggage with care, including musical instruments,' Qantas said in a statement.

Jennings was previously ordered to spend an indefinite amount of time in a psychiatric hospital after stabbing 32-year-old Giuseppe Vitale to death in 2003.
The then-18-year-old met Mr Vitale online and the pair arranged to meet for casual sex before Jennings tied the older man up and stabbed him in the neck.
Jennings was in 2005 found not guilty of Mr Vitale's murder on mental health grounds and detained in a hospital.
Six years later, he made headlines again when he absconded from Morisset hospital near Newcastle before going on the run in a stolen car belonging to another man he met online.
Jennings was handed a minimum 18-month jail sentence for the theft, which came after he tied the man up during a consensual bondage session at an inner-Sydney apartment.
Police are searching the Sydney city centre and other areas where he is known to spend time, including the Central Coast, Cumberland and Sutherland Shire areas.

The ceremonies for the spies were first held in 2012, and were mentioned on the Instagram account of MI5 at the time of the King's Coronation.
King Charles, who is patron of the Intelligence Services, presented hundreds of the secret agents with honours, awards and citations for bravery back when he was the Prince of Wales.
The locations of these events have differed over the years, including taking place at Thames House - the HQ of MI5 in London.
Security sources told The Telegraph that there are no fixed dates for the ceremonies.
It is uncertain if Prince William will potentially take over this role.

The majority of spy operations are never known to the public and consequently the agents don't receive any public recognition.
But sources told The Telegraph that the King personally presented awards to those responsible for foiling dozens of terrorist attacks.
Colonel Philip Ingram, a former Army intelligence officer, told the newspaper: 'It is fantastic that His Majesty takes a personal interest and plays his role in saying thank you to some of these exceptional men and women who have to permanently live and work in the shadows.'
The awards were separated into operational and non-operational divisions, The Telegraph reported.
This is so that archivists, interpreters and other forms of staff could also be rewarded.
Also included are counter-terrorism and counter-espionage workers, along with those tackling organised crime alongside the police.
Many agents honoured by the King were involved in operations in countries like Russia, China and Iran.
Ken McCallum, the director-general of MI5, Sir Richard Moore, the head of MI6, also known as 'C', and Anne Keast-Butler, the director of GCHQ are the only members of the intelligence services to be named publicly.

Sir Richard Moore, from Leatherhead, Chief, Secret Intelligence Service, is made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George by King Charles III
In an Instagram post at the time of the Coronation, the official MI5 account said: 'Alongside the rest of the nation, we are delighted to celebrate the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla.
We have benefited from His Majesty's public and private recognition of our work, including through a regular award ceremony in which he recognises the efforts and achievements of teams working in the UK's intelligence agencies.
'His dedication to the intelligence agencies means a great deal to our people.
'From everyone at MI5, we offer our heartfelt congratulations to Their Majesties as we continue in our unwavering commitment to keeping this country safe.'
In 2015, it was reported that Prince William has made a top secret visit to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) – the maximum security 'listening station' which tracks electronic traffic of terrorists and spy agencies around the world.
The Duke's first ever trip to GCHQ, housed in a doughnut-shaped building in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed that he and other young Royals were being advised to change their email addresses and cut back on social media activities over fears they could be targeted by foreign spies and hackers.
It is uncertain if Prince William will potentially take over this role
But questions were asked last night about the Duke's use of a publicly funded Royal helicopter to make the trip, as it was not an official public engagement and was not announced in the Palace's Court Circular.
The Duke was flown from London's Kensington Palace to Gloucestershire airport on the Queen's helicopter Flight, funded by the taxpayer, and which is supposed to be only used for official engagements by the Royals.
A Palace source initially described the 200-mile round trip as a 'private visit' but later suggested it was 'official', and so could possibly be paid from the taxpayer-funded Royal Travel Budget.
Kensington Palace and GCHQ refused to say whom he met, or what he saw. But it is believed the Prince met the new head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, and also saw the agency's code breakers at work, monitoring internet and communications traffic to pick up terrorist threats.
Other members of the Royal family have previously visited GCHQ, which was opened by the Queen in 2004.
A GCHQ spokesman said: 'Prince William paid a private visit to GCHQ on March 19. As it was a private visit we can't go into further details of what his itinerary involved.'"

Paracelsus Recovery said research on patients referred for treatment suggested that porn addiction is significantly more prevalent than official numbers suggest.
Children are being exposed to online pornography from as young as nine, according to a recent study for the children's commissioner for England.
A quarter of 16 to 21-year-olds first saw pornography on the internet while still at primary school. By the age of 13, 50 per cent had been exposed to it.
But Paracelsus Recovery, which is based in Zurich and London, warned it had seen a 150 per cent increase in the number of people being treated for porn addiction between 2019 and 2023.
Its chief executive Jan Gerber said: 'It is clear from our research that porn addiction is significantly more common than official numbers suggest.

'We estimate that one in two males suffer from problematic porn consumption that would meet the diagnostic criteria for addiction, and one in four females.
'Among under-18s, the levels are higher still, at around 60 per cent.'
The United Kingdom has the second highest incidence of internet pornography searches in the world, with an average of 16,600,000 searches for porn taking place each month. The adult film industry is estimated to be worth more than £15billion a year.
The Government's Online Safety Act, passed last year, will force porn websites to use age verification software to stop access by under-18s. Similar technology is already used by gambling websites.
Ofcom is consultation with the porn industry about how the scheme will be rolled out next year.
One 27-year-old British man treated by Paracelsus Recovery said he became addicted to pornography after he started watching it from the age of 12.
He said: 'I had lost all control over my behaviour. I was sitting in my room smoking weed and watching porn videos from morning to night.
'I had no friends, it had messed up my education, and I felt hopeless.
'I cannot even articulate how disgusting and ashamed I felt, and it's only other individuals who have struggled with a porn addiction who can understand the depths of this despair.'"

The pharmaceutical giant, which developed its jab in partnership with the University of Oxford, is set to face a High Court battle over claims the vaccine is 'defective'.
It has been linked to a newly identified condition called Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT) which causes blood clots.
At least 81 people have died due to complications linked to the very rare side effect while hundreds of others have also suffered illness as a result.
In what may be one of the biggest cases of its kind, more cases are expected to be lodged, meaning the vaccine manufacturer could face up to £80million in compensation payouts if it loses, according to The Telegraph.
The pharmaceutical giant, which developed its jab in partnership with the University of Oxford , is set to face a High Court battle over claims the vaccine is 'defective'
MP Sir Jeremy Wright has been urged the government to take 'step in and settle' legal claims
The government indemnified AstraZeneca and other vaccine manufacturers as it sought to roll out vaccines during the pandemic.
Under Vaccine Damage Payment scheme, victims of certain vaccines, including ones used to beat Covid, are entitled to a one-off 'all-or-nothing' sum of £120,000 from the Government.
Tory MP Sir Jeremy Wright, whose constituent Jamie Scott suffered a 'significant permanent brain injury' from a blood clot after getting the job in 2021, has urged the government to take action.
The former Attorney General said: 'The public need the confidence to know they will be looked after if in the tiny, tiny minority of cases where the vaccine has gone wrong.
'And that confidence is damaged if the Government does not step in and settle these cases.'
The claimants are suing under the Consumer Protection Act, suggesting that the vaccine was not as safe as those who received it were led to believe.
AstraZeneca is fighting the claims, calling them 'confused' and 'wrong in law'.
The company has also pointed to the millions of lives the vaccine is believed to have saved in its first year of rollout.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is not being used as part of the UK's booster programme after experts recommended mRNA vaccines – such as the Pfizer or Moderna jabs – should be used instead.
Dr Stephen Wright (left), 32, died from a blood clot to the brain after having his first dose of the AstraZeneca jab in January 2021
Vaccine complications have been listed on the death certificates of a number of people who were administered the AstraZeneca jab.
Dr Stephen Wright, 32, died from a blood clot to the brain ten days after having his first dose of the AstraZeneca jab in January 2021.
In April last year, a coroner ruled the vaccine should be added to Dr Wright's death certificate.
In another case, a rock musician known as Lord Zion suffered a severe headache and was admitted to hospital eight days after receiving the jab.
Lord Zion's partner Vikki (pictured together) said she is still 'pro-vaccine' following his death, but called on the Government to better educate medical staff on the side effects
His condition worsened and he passed away in hospital on May 19, with the preliminary death certificate listing a brain bleed caused by vaccine complications as the cause.
His partner Vikki said she is still 'pro-vaccine' following his death, but called on the Government to better educate medical staff on the side effects and rework the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.
An AstraZeneca spokesperson said: 'Patient safety is our highest priority and regulatory authorities have clear and stringent standards to ensure the safe use of all medicines, including vaccines. Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems.
'From the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, Vaxzevria has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects.
'The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) has granted full marketing approval for Vaxzevria for the UK based on the safety profile and efficacy of the vaccine.'"

Police are trying to traced the driver after the attempted kidnap in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, just before midnight on Saturday night.
The woman has reported that a man in a dark red, possibly burgundy coloured car approached her while she was walking along Tan Y Graig Road from the British Royal Legion pub.
The mystery man was described as having dark hair and an accent that is not local to the area.
He asked her to get into the car - and when she would not, he exited the car and tried to drag her to the vehicle.

'Extensive CCTV and house to house enquiries have been carried out, and police are now appealing to the public to help them identify the car and the driver.'
The investigation has established that the car travelled along Hendre Road from Tan Y Graig Road.
Officers are encouraging local people to check CCTV and doorbell or dashcam footage for sightings of the car. The incident is being treated as isolated at this time.

Well, a stream of disgruntled travelers have shared what they believe to be the world's biggest tourist traps, in a bid to prevent others from making the same mistake.
A Reddit thread titled 'What place is the biggest tourist trap?' has garnered more than 4,500 comments to date, with a mix of places across the globe making the list.
One traveler advised against going to see the Mona Lisa at the Louvre museum in Paris, with the Leonardo da Vinci painting being underwhelming and 'tiny,' while another said that Stonehenge in Wiltshire would leave you 'bitterly disappointed.'
Take a trip down to see which spots on the map are best to avoid, according to this band of unhappy campers.
One traveler said the street vendors around the Pyramids in Egypt made visiting the historic site a 'very uncomfortable experience'
Many Redditors outed the Egyptian pyramids as the biggest tourist trap, with the main complaint being the 'number of hawkers and touts' in the area.
One traveler said the street vendors made visiting the historic site a 'very uncomfortable experience.'
Another disgruntled commenter wrote: 'I've been to nearly 50 countries and Egypt was hands down the worst place I've ever been.
'The canals had rotting donkey corpses every few miles. Everything was a scam or a bribe.'
Giving perspective visitors a more precise idea around what they can expect, another Redditor wrote: 'Don't get me wrong, the Pyramids themselves are awesome. Seeing them up close is really cool.
'The problem is, well, everyone that is involved with the Pyramids and everything surrounding it. The Pyramids aren't like what you'd expect.
'You'd think they are out in the middle of some desert far away from civilization, right? They are right up against Cairo.
'The city is like less than a 1/4th of a mile away. And it is such a eyesore. And on top of that, they are surrounded by people who scam, harass and steal from tourists.'
Many Redditors described Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts as a tourist trap, and disappointingly small
Plymouth Rock, which is displayed on the shore of Plymouth Bay in Massachusetts, has come to symbolize the spot where William Bradford and the Mayflower Pilgrims disembarked before founding Plymouth Colony in December 1620.
The tourism website notes that the 'simple glacial erratic boulder has become a world famous symbol representing something different to each person who looks at it.'
It also notes that 'although no historical evidence exists to confirm Plymouth Rock as the Pilgrims' actual steppingstone to the New World, the boulder was identified as this spot in 1741, 121 years after the arrival of the Mayflower.'
Many Redditors described the rock as a tourist trap, and disappointingly small.
One commenter joked: 'The bar across the street has a great view of the disappointed tourists.'
Another Redditor said the rock was only worth visiting 'so you can make a funny social media post about it.'
To make the trip worthwhile, they advised exploring downtown Plymouth which was 'full of good restaurants, cafes, shops, etc' and there were 'some nice beaches around too.'
One Redditor advised others to stay away from iconic Pier 39 in San Francisco.
While the website markets it as an ideal place to see views 'of the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges, Alcatraz and the city skyline at almost every turn,' one unenthused traveler simply described it as a 'long outdoor mall filled with useless tchotchkes (bric-à-brac).'
They advised visiting the 'Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, or one of our various arts and science museums' instead.
Another Redditor disagreed, exclaiming in response: 'I actually really enjoyed Pier 39!'
One Redditor described Stonehenge as 'bitterly disappointing'
'Don't go to England just to see Stonehenge,' one Redditor said, highlighting that anyone who did would be 'bitterly disappointed.'
For those who really want to visit the prehistoric monument, they advise spending time in Salisbury as well, and 'enjoying the scenery on the way there and back' from London.
Another of their tips includes 'exploring the area around Waterloo train station in London.'
While thousands of tourists flock to the Mount Everest region each year, one Redditor said it was at the top of their list when it comes tourist traps.
They explained that the mountainous area is filled with 'garbage and dead people' and to top it off, tours are 'extremely expensive.'
In a bid to help the trash problem on Mount Everest, various initiatives have been launched.
Clean Everest, which was founded by French mountain guide Marion Chaygneaud-Dupuy in 2013, helped to collect more than 10 tons of waste in four years and it continues to this day.
Just over two million people visit Mount Rushmore in South Dakota each year, but a few Redditors warned against going.
One commenter wrote: 'There is nothing to do there except look at the government-sanctioned vandalism on the mountain. Not worth the cost of admission or the drive to get there.'
Another said the massive sculpture that depicts U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln was 'honestly not as grand or impressive as it's made out to be.'
They added: 'Plus, I think it's tacky that somebody decided it'd be cool to carve the faces of four white presidents into a mountain sacred to and stolen from the Native Americans. It just doesn't feel right.
'Save your time and visit other places in the area, including Custer State Park, Spearfish, Crazy Horse and Wind Cave.'
One Redditor described the Disney parks as a 'GIANT waste of time and money'
The Disney theme parks attract more than 100 million visitors worldwide and one Redditor described them as a 'giant tourist trap,' which they 'do expensively and well.'
They noted that if people were looking for this kind of thing, then 'it's probably worth it... but if not, it's a GIANT waste of time and money.'
Another Redditor added that the parks 'used to be fun places but now are nothing but money suckers and horrible food.'
Other commenters complained about the long wait times for rides, with one noting that 'we now just call it DisneyLine.'
The famous Cloud Gate sculpture by artist Sir Anish Kapoor, which is affectionally nicknamed The Bean, is found in the AT&T Plaza at Millennium Park in the Loop area of Chicago.
Thanks to its mirrored surface, the art installation makes for a top photo opportunity,  and it attracts hundreds and thousands of visitors a year.
Despite its popularity, one Redditor said they didn't understand the fascination.
They said of The Bean: 'I've lived here 18 years and have never felt compelled to go anywhere near it.
'People who come here insist on going there for a picture, never fails. Especially people from overseas. It's like one of their top three things to do.'
Many Redditors slammed Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa for being a tourist trap and described it as 'underwhelming'
About 30,000 tourists visit the Louvre museum in Paris each day, with Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa being the star attraction.
However, many Redditors outed the masterpiece as a tourist trap and described it as 'underwhelming.'
One disappointed museum-goer wrote: 'Hands down the most underwhelming thing I have seen... but it receives so much hype, people barely notice the Greek sculptures on their way to see a small painting of a sad looking lady.'
Another commenter said that along with the painting being 'tiny,' it was impossible to get close to it because the area was 'roped off and extremely crowded.'
One Redditor entered the Great Wall of China, 'specifically the location north of Beijing,' into the tourist trap thread.
Explaining their nomination, they wrote: '[The] wall has been torn apart, rebuilt so many times you may as well just visit Disneyworld.
'On the way to the wall people are hawking all kinds of tourist junk.
'Finally, you get to walk on the wall. The problem is some parts... they're built for... I don't know... horses to gallop on?
'You're scrambling up and down smooth stone floors of 30 degree angles with only metal handrails to give you anything to steady yourself with.
'When I went it was busy as hell so you're just butting heads with the locals, as if someone let the dogs out, and they're clambering all over the place then plopping down to lay out a lunch in the middle of the crowd.'
Times Square in New York sees more than 300,000 pedestrians a day
Times Square in New York got quite a few votes from Redditors as one of the world's biggest tourist traps.
One commenter said of the bustling spot, which sees more than 300,000 pedestrians a day: 'Not only is it always crowded and full of people in the worst costumes you've ever seen trying to scam you, but the amount of money everything costs there is insane.
'I mean everything - even if you go to a chain restaurant (like Applebees), the prices are doubled for the literal same dish at a location in a different area of New York.'
Another Redditor said that despite it being a tourist trap, Times Square was 'still worth seeing at least once just because of how iconic it is.'
Many beer lovers from around the world flock to the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin for a taste of the black stuff and to learn about its history.
However, one Redditor has deemed the attraction an overpriced tourist trap.
They wrote in the thread: '$20 for a multi-story 'beer-brewing for dummies' walk-through tour. The penultimate floor has a bunch of Guinness advertising media, which was cool, I guess.
'This floor also had ""Guinness University,"" where you could learn the proper way to pour a pint of the titular beverage. The top floor is an observation deck, with little blurbs printed on the windows, describing prominent features of the view. You can have a pint at the ""University,"" or at the bar on the observation deck floor.
'And that's it. You get ONE pint, with the price of admission. You can't buy another. Get your beer, take in the view, then leave. I was so mad. It's not that I was looking to get wasted... But a couple of pints, enjoying the view a while, maybe shooting the shit with some other patrons. But no... One beer, and goodbye.
'That was the one blight on an otherwise spectacular week in Dublin.'
One Redditor said of the Leaning Tower of Pisa: 'It's not even leaning very much. It's one of those attractions that's better in pictures than in person'
One Redditor who entered it into the thread, said they were surprised they didn't see the Leaning Tower of Pisa higher on the list.
Explaining why the wonky bell tower should be considered a tourist trap, they wrote: 'It's not near the airport and is the middle of a sh**ty city, surrounded by trashy shops and aggressive merchants. It's not even leaning very much. It's one of those attractions that's better in pictures than in person.'
Another Redditor agreed with these sentiments and simply described the attraction as 'pretty disappointing.'
They added: 'There is only really one parking lot closer to it. Immediately as you leave your car the first street sellers approach you. Then you have to walk through a street market with more sellers on foot getting in your face.
'Then you finally get through the gates where sellers aren't allowed. It's basically just a huge lawn with the tower at one side. Tower is pretty cool but ruined by the packs of people taking the same picture.
'There isn't anything else to do in the city so you just walk back through the market and the pestering street sellers. At this point you end up buying something as to not feel like you wasted the day.'
The Salem Witch Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, failed to impress one Redditor, who nominated it in the thread.
They wrote as a warning to others: 'You sit in a darkened auditorium and from time to time a spotlight appears on various areas above your head to show tableaux featuring mannequins dressed in 17th-century clothing, each scene depicting an event during the witch trials.
'A recording tells the story.
'The backdrops and props look very old and dated. Very underwhelming, especially at $17.50 per ticket.'
Maya Bay in Thailand was made famous after appearing in the Leonardo DiCaprio movie The Beach
Maya Bay in Thailand, made famous after appearing in the Leonardo DiCaprio 1999 movie The Beach, was branded a tourist trap by one Redditor.
They complained that because of its film outing, the white sand cove on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, is now 'nasty' and littered with 'too many tourists.'
In 2018, the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation announced that it was banning visitors to let the coral reefs and vegetation recover.
There have also been several closures since, but the Redditor says that these will not help in the long term.
They concluded: 'It will never be the place that everyone thinks they're going to see ever again. Sad.'
In Canada, a pool of Redditors elected the Capilano Suspension Bridge as the country's worst tourist trap.
One commenter said of the attraction: 'Private park in North Vancouver with a swaying drooping pedestrian bridge across a small canyon. $80 admission.
'There is a similar bridge for free on a public park nearby. For that price I'd rather visit the peak-to-peak gondola ride between mountain tops in Whistler.'
Another contributor also suggested visiting the Lynn Valley Conservation Area as a cheaper alternative to Capilano and with 'just as nice views.'
However, one Redditor disagreed with the naysayers, writing in the bridge's defense: 'I love the Capilano Bridge!!! How dare you????'
Las Vegas caused a stir among Redditors, with many upvoting it as one of the world's biggest tourist traps.
One commenter reminisced about how 'many years ago, there were great, cheap buffets.'
However, nowadays hotels prey on tourists and 'put you in a room where you lose track of time and lose your money.'
'Also, people do stupid things when they go there for bachelor/bachelorette parties, sometimes ruining friendships and marriages,' they added.
Another Redditor said how the city was 'literally designed to get your money while giving you the illusion you actually have a chance.'
'And if you do hit big they do everything in their power to keep you there so you can give it back,' they added."

Tawfiq Ajaq, 17, was shot and killed Friday - less than a year after relocating to the war-torn country to finish high school and reconnect with Palestinian culture.
His parents brought him and his four siblings to the Middle East this past summer, before the conflict broke out.
He was shot dead as he made the drive back to the small village by a member of the Israeli military, they said Saturday - before claiming the Biden Administration made the murder possible.
Speaking from his funeral overseas, the teen's father, Hafez Ajaq, criticized the country's long-standing support for Israel, and implored Americans to 'see with their own eyes' the truth of the conflict.

Relatives mourn at his funeral in his family's Palestinian home village in Al-Mazra'a ash-Sharqiya, West Bank, Saturday
Both the US and Israel have issued statements indicating they are investigating the teen's death, though the latter has yet to confirm responsibility.
As of Sunday morning, both probes - with Israel's being carried out by the country's police force - have yet to produce anything substantial.
Hafez, meanwhile, claimed Americans are not getting the 'true story' about the shooting and the ongoing conflict.
'They are killer machines,' he said of Israeli forces, who have received more than $260 billion from the US alone since the country was formed in 1945.
'They are using our tax dollars in the US to support the weapons to kill our own children,' he continued, speaking from the ceremony at Al-Mazra’a Ash-Sharqiya.
'The American society does not know the true story,' he went on. 'Come here on the ground and see what’s going on.'
He then asked: 'How many fathers and mothers have to say goodbye to their children?'
'How many more?'
Ajaq - one of more than 30 Americans killed in the conflict - was born and raised in Gretna, Louisiana, near New Orleans, relatives said
His parents brought him to Ash-Sharqiya - which has a population of under 5,000 - last year, and on Saturday, he was given a hero's sendoff. Crowds of Palestinians were pictured pulsing through village streets, as men who held aloft a stretcher with the teen's body.
It was wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Ajaq was killed Friday by Israeli fire and police say they have launched an investigation
'I am feeling full of sadness, for his mother, his father, his uncles, myself - all his relatives,' said Mohammad Salen, Ajaq's great uncle. 'In this situation, the sadness is covering us from all over'
'The good always dies young,' Tawfiq's cousin, Maher Abdul Jabbar, said. ‘That’s a prime example of what happened to my cousin.'
He further told NBC News : 'Born and raised in the U.S., he's been here for one year.'
'He does not know anything - I'm teaching him what's life. I'm teaching him what's the land. What's the cost of the land?
'And here he is,' he continued, after carrying the boy's casket. 'He's [now] paying for it, for freedom.'
NewsNation also spoke to several of the victim’s family members Saturday, and learned how they are ‘heartbroken’ over the loss.
They described how they are still trying to piece together what happened, in their  first broadcast interview since the incident.
'I am feeling full of sadness, for his mother, his father, his uncles, myself - all his relatives,' said Mohammad Salen, Ajaq's great uncle .
'In this situation, the sadness is covering us from all over.'
Appearing by videolink, the man went on to reveal how Ajaq had been planning to spend his senior year overseas, before heading back to New Orleans, his birthplace, for college.
There, Salen said, the teen intended to study business - a dream that's now been cut short.
The boy's father, meanwhile, claimed Americans are not getting the 'true story' about the shooting - and the conflict in general - and thus need to 'see with their own eyes' the senselessness of the violence
'They are killer machines,' he said of Israeli forces, who have received more than $260 billion from the US alone since the country was formed in 1945
'They are using our tax dollars in the US to support the weapons to kill our own children,' he continued, speaking from the ceremony at Al-Mazra’a Ash-Sharqiya
'The good always dies young,' Tawfiq's cousin, Maher Abdul Jabbar, said. ‘That’s a prime example of what happened to my cousin.'
He and others proceeded to explain how Ajaq had been a member of a mosque in the New Orleans area before moving, and that the place of worship had held a vigil for him Saturday night as officials’ investigation continues.
When asked if he 'could tell him something now', Jabbar repliedd: ‘I would tell him that I was always proud of him – [that] he was such a good kid. [That] I loved him.
'That’s the main thing,' he added, growing emotional. 'I loved him; our whole family loved him. He was really precious to us.'
An Israeli bulletin stated officials had already received reports about an incident that took place near where Ajaq was killed, where an off-duty police officer and a civilian 'fired toward a Palestinian individual suspected of hurling rocks in the area'.
'An IDF soldier was present in the area,' the military said. 'The claim that the soldier fired at the Palestinian is under review. The Israel Police have opened an investigation into the incident.’
The US Department addressed the teen’s death in its own statement, one bolstered by comments from NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby at a White House press conference.
Israeli forces, meanwhile, have said they are probing the incident, issuing a statement claiming officials had already received reports about an incident that took place near the shooting, where an off-duty cop and a civilian 'fired toward a Palestinian individual suspected of hurling rocks in the area'
'An IDF soldier was present in the area,' the military said. 'The claim that the soldier fired at the Palestinian is under review. The Israel Police have opened an investigation into the incident’
The incident is only the latest latest fatal shooting in the West Bank, where nearly 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war more than three months ago
The US addressed the teen’s death in its own statement, saying it has asked Israel for more information
The sparse statement read: ‘We can confirm the death of a US citizen civilian in the West Bank on January 19, 2024.
‘We are working to understand the circumstances of the incident and have asked the government of Israel for further information.’
Questioned about the killing at Friday's press briefing at the White House, the U.S. National Security Council spokesman said: ‘It’s definitely deeply concerning,’
'I’m afraid I don’t have anymore information,' he added. [But] [W]e're seriously concerned about it.'
The incident is only the latest fatal shooting in the West Bank, where nearly 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza more than three months ago.
The Biden administration recently has repeatedly expressed concern about violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians.
Ajaq - one of more than 30 Americans killed in the conflict - was born and raised in Gretna, Louisiana, near New Orleans, relatives said.
His parents brought him to Ash-Sharqiya - which has a population of under 5,000 - last year, and on Saturday, he was given a hero's sendoff.
Crowds of Palestinians were pictured pulsing through village streets, as men who held aloft a stretcher with the teen's body.
It was wrapped in a Palestinian flag."

Shamim Ahmed, 30, of Shadwell, was sentenced to six years in prison in June 2017.
He had travelled to Turkey in an attempt to join the Islamic State in Syria in 2016. He had then been on a suspended prison sentence for having threatened to attack a French bookshop in west London that was selling the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo.
During his sentencing hearing, he wagged his fingers at the presiding judge and muttered kuffar, or term meaning non-believer. He subsequently yelled: 'Wage Jihad, wherever we are – target the civilians, tourist sites, inshallah [God willing].'
Before he was removed from the court, Mr Ahmed then threatened to punch a dock officer and warned the judge: 'Give me twenty years, I'll come out the enemy.'
Shamim Ahmed had travelled to Turkey in an attempt to join the Islamic State in Syria in 2016 when he was arrested. He had been on a suspended prison sentence at the time
The French Bookshop, on Bute Street in South Kensington, has now closed. It was selling copies of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo when it was threatened by Mr Ahmed
Shamim Ahmed has now been freed, despite warnings that he remains a danger to the public
He has now been freed, despite warnings that he remains a danger to the public.
He was released in October 2022, but was recalled the prison nine days later following 'concerns about his behaviour'.
His release bid in June 2023 was blocked by the Parole Board, with the reasoning given that Mr Ahmed 'remains a radicalised person and would continue to pose a risk in the community.'
The Ministry of Justice was unable to prevent Mr Ahmed being freed following the completion of his sentence.
Chris Phillips, of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told The Sun that it was concerning that radicalised individuals could be released.
'There needs to be proof that they have been deradicalised rather than an autonomic release or parole,' he said.
Mr Ahmed, it was heard during his trial, had only begun practising Islam in 2013. He had sent threats to Downing Street, the Australian government, and schools regulator Ofsted as he became radicalised.
He was first arrested in January 2015 for threatening the staff of The French Bookshop, a now closed French-language bookstore in South Kensington.
He had sent threats after the publication of the first edition of Charlie Hebdo following the terrorist attacks that targeted the weekly magazine in January 2015.
He sent an email subject lined, 'Protect your neck while you're still alive.'
He then telephoned the bookshop to ask whether they were selling the magazine 'against the Muslims.' It was quickly followed up by a second threatening phone call in which he said he would 'come and stab you.'
'I'm going to come right away and blow up the shop. I'm not afraid of the police, I'm a Muslim,' he said.
He was charged with threatening the bookshops and stopped from handing out anti-democracy leaflets outside a local polling station during an election.
The leaflet featured the flag of the Islamic State. It was titled, 'Reject democracy, call for shariah!' and included the sub-heading: 'Stay Muslim, don't vote!'"

'I'm not saying anything derogatory, but when you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this,' Haley said Saturday while campaigning in New Hampshire.
'I wasn't even in DC on Jan. 6. I wasn't in office then. They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he was talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario,' she continued.
Trump, 77, previously accused Pelosi, who was speaker at the time, of being in charge of security on the day of the insurrection. Daily Mail relied on video clips to report on Haley's remarks after she banned Daily Mail from covering her campaign after its exclusive report that Haley falsely denied cheating on her husband when she was accused of engaging in two extramarital affairs during her 2010 South Carolina gubernatorial campaign.
Nikki Haley questioned whether Donald Trump is 'mentally fit' to be president after he appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
Haley has ramped up her crticism of Trump with only four days to go until New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
But the former president continues to hold a double-digit lead in the polls. The latest poll by the Boston Globe and Suffolk University shows Trump with 53%, Haley  with 36% and Ron DeSantis with 7%.
Additionally Senator Tim Scott endorsed Trump on Friday night, becoming the latest party official to back the former president. Scott is from Haley's home state of South Carolina and she appointed him to his seat when she was governor.
Trump plans to taunt Haley more with his support from her state. At his rally in Manchester on Saturday night, he hosted South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and a slew of other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. Also appearing are U.S. Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry.
But the former president raised eyebrows when he spoke at a rally in Concord, New Hampshire on Friday. Trump repeatedly referred to Haley being responsible for security during the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.
'By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they — do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it,' Trump claimed, without substantiation.
'Because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security — we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guards, whatever they want. They turned it down. They don't want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people.'
Haley repeatedly jumped on his gaffe at her campaign stops in New Hampshire on Saturday.
'When you’re 80, that’s what happens. You’re just not as sharp as you used to be,' she said. 'We need to know that the person that’s going to be in this office has the stamina to be at the top of their game.'
President Joe Biden's reelection campaign pounced on the gaffe, posting a clip of Trump's comment on X and remarking: 'A deeply confused Trump confuses Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley multiple times.'

Trump has long blamed Pelosi, a top Democrat, for the events of January 6, when a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol and attempted to stop the certification of Biden's election win.
Pelosi's office has denied those claims, saying that she had no more responsibility for Capitol security than did then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican.
A spokesperson for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com on Saturday morning.
At his event in Concord on Friday, Trump spent much of his speech disparaging Haley, and said he would 'probably' not select her as a running mate.
'She is not presidential timber,' Trump said. 'Now when I say that, that probably means that she's not going to be chosen as the vice president.'
'I know her very well. She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough. And she wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job,' Trump said. 'She's not going to be able to deal with President Xi. She's not going to be able to deal with Putin.'
Ahead of Tuesday primary election in New Hampshire, Trump has stepped up his rhetorical attacks on Haley, his main challenger in the Granite State, where an open primary format gives independent voters an influential say.

On his Truth Social platform, Trump lashed out at Haley on Friday, mocking her birth name in racially charged taunts.
Trump repeatedly referred to Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India by way of Canada, as 'Nimbra,' and apparent misspelling of her given name.
Haley, the former South Carolina governor, was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa.
Since childhood, she has always gone by her middle name, 'Nikki.' She took the surname 'Haley' upon her marriage in 1996 to Michael Haley.
Trump called Haley 'Nimbra' three times in the same post on Friday, and said she 'doesn't have what it takes.'
Trump's post was an escalation of recent attacks in which he referenced Haley's given first name - though he previously misspelled it 'Nimrada'.
He has also falsely suggested she is ineligible for the presidency because her parents were not US citizens when she was born in 1972. Haley, a US citizen at birth, meets the Constitution's citizenship requirements for the presidency.
Haley has dismissed Trump's latest attacks as proof that she threatens his bid for a third consecutive nomination.
'I'll let people decide what he means by his attacks,' Haley told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday when asked about Trump´s false assertions that her heritage disqualifies her from the Oval Office.

Sen Tim Scott appeared on stage with Donald Trump on Friday evening in Concord, New Hampshire, to endorse the former president is the race for the Republican nomination
'What we know is, look, he's clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums, if he's spending millions of dollars on TV. He's insecure, he knows that something's wrong,' she added, according to the Associated Press.
New Hampshire holds its first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday. Haley in particular may struggle to continue her campaign if she finishes a distant second to the former president."

It comes after it was revealed police officers ignored a 999 call from the address one hour before the bodies were tragically found, as they continue to probe the deaths and confirmed they are 'not looking for anyone else'.
Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, and his daughters aged 12 and seven, were found dead inside the house in Costessey, alongside a 36-year-old woman whose identity has not yet been disclosed.
Nina Crisan, whose son knew 12-year-old Jasmine Kuczynski, described her as a 'very, very sweet girl' who had a 'calm and cool energy.'
She told Sky News 'she was just a lovely, lovely kid' and that the incident had come as an 'absolute shock' to the local community.
She said that it was a tight-knit community and even if you didn't know someone directly, you saw each other through the children or from dog walking.
Speaking anonymously to Sky News, a boy who knew Jasmine said: 'We grew up together. She never held a grudge, she was always kind and caring to everyone.'

Norfolk Police confirmed they had received a call from a man at the address at 6am but officers did not attend.
Police were only sent to the house after receiving a second call at 7am from a member of the public, who was concerned about the people inside. The four injured bodies were discovered when police broke in at 7.15am.
As a result, Norfolk Police confirmed that it had referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC).
Since then, detectives from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team have ruled out any third-party involvement.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We've spoken to witnesses and neighbours, carried out house-to-house enquiries, examined local CCTV and completed initial scene investigations. As a result of this, we're not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

Norfolk Police admitted that it had received a call from a man at the address at 6am yesterday but they did not attend. Officers were only deployed following a second phone call from a member of the public shortly before 7am
A cordon remains in place along with a 'heavy police presence' and forensic teams are continuing to investigate inside the property

'Post-mortem examinations will be carried out tomorrow for the man and woman (Sunday 21 January) and on Wednesday (24 January) for the two girls.
'While I can confirm all four people were found with injuries, we will not be disclosing any further information until these examinations have taken place and the cause of death has been established.
'This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved and it is clear from the reaction it's caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community. We've had uniformed officers patrolling the area today and these will continue tomorrow.'
The force said a separate IOPC referral had already been made over their involvement with the family on December 14, when Mr Kuczynski was reported to have gone missing and was later found wandering nearby.
A Norfolk Police spokesman said: 'A second referral has been made to the IOPC today following the identification of a 999 call made yesterday morning at 6am by a man at the address and police resources were not deployed.
'Officers had been called to the address shortly before 7am after a member of the public called police to raise concerns for the welfare of people inside.
'Police arrived on scene at around 7.15am and forced entry to the address, finding the bodies of two young girls, a 45-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman.'
Post-mortem examinations will be held on all four bodies to establish cause of death.
A cordon remains in place along with a 'heavy police presence' and forensic teams are continuing to investigate inside the property.
Police have said that the man and two children lived at the address while the woman, although related, was visiting and not a permanent resident at the address.
Police have requested anyone who may have been in the Allan Bedford Crescent area earlier that morning to come forward with information.

The two children believed to have been killed were today described by neighbours as 'beautiful girls'.
The girls were identified locally as Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, and her seven-year-old sister who attended local schools and were often seen walking around.
Well-wishers including some crying girls left flowers in their memory today beside the police cordon outside their semi-detached home.
Mr Kuczynski's Thai-born wife Nanthaka Kuczynska who was known as Nan had reportedly not been seen by neighbours for months.
Others said that her sister had recently moved in to help care for the girls and Polish-born structural engineer Mr Kuczynski who had been suffering from mental health issues.
Mother-of-two Jocelyn Atienza, 50, who lives nearby said: 'It is just awful. The two girls were lovely sisters and beautiful girls.
'They were nice girls who were a little shy. We used to see them walking around together. They would look really happy when they were out with friends.
'The older one would catch the bus to school, and her little sister would walk to the primary school by herself.
'Their mother was friendly and we always used to say hi hello to each other in the street, but I have not seen her around for some time.

'She always used to put up decorations for Halloween and Christmas outside their home, but her husband was putting up decorations instead of her last December.'
Jasmin was a pupil at Taverham High School while her sister was a pupil at the Queen's Hill Primary School on the Queen's Hill estate where they lived.
Mr Kuczynski is understood to have lived in Britain for the last 20 years after graduating from Wroclaw University of Technology in Poland.
His home remained cordoned off by police today as white-suited forensic officers were seen going in and out of a large white tent erected beside the front door.
The Bishop of Norwich the Right Rev Graham Usher said wanted to offer 'Prayers for all impacted by this tragic news, especially the wider family and people from Costessey:.
He added: 'I've spoke to our local clergy who are offering support in the communities they serve and will be opening churches for those who want to come and pray or talk.'

Neighbours said Mr Kuczynski himself had been reported missing just before Christmas. A drone circled the area at the time and also flew over the nearby woods, with the father later found walking along the Fairway near his home.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess confirmed that Norfolk Police had previously made contact with the family before Christmas after a missing persons' report was lodged.
One near neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'There were five or six police cars outside their house. People were looking for him and then another neighbour found him walking up the hill round the corner.
'The sister-in-law then came round to help look after him. I think he had mental health issues at the time he went missing. People were talking about how he was not well.
'They were a very quiet couple and did not seem to speak to other people.
'It is just awful that kids are involved. The first I knew about something happening was when police knocked on my door this morning and asked if we had heard anything.'"

Rogerson, 83, suffered a brain aneurysm in his prison cell in Sydney's Long Bay jail on Thursday and was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital in the city's inner-east.
The crooked cop, known as 'The Dodger', died in hospital at 11pm on Sunday night, after his life support was switched off at about 11:30am on Friday.
Rogerson's wife Anne Melocco told Daily Mail Australia his family was only alerted to his deteriorating condition just days before he died.
'We were only notified of his condition this MORNING,' she said in a text message.
Both hero and villain during a 28-year career with the NSW Police, Rogerson was at one time considered one of their most decorated officers.
The former detective was serving a life sentence for the execution-style slaying of Sydney drug dealer Jamie Gao in 2014 when he died on Sunday.

Drug dealer Jamie Gao (pictured) was shot dead by detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara in 2014
Gao's body (pictured) was dumped at sea and found floating off the coast of Cronulla
Rogerson had always argued his innocence, claiming he was unaware of fellow crooked former detective Glen McNamara's plans to murder the 20-year-old.
Mr Gao was lured to a darkened storage shed in Padstow, in the city's south, and shot dead before the former police officers attempted to cover their tracks by dumping his body in the ocean.
His body was later found floating off the coast of Cronulla.
Rogerson and McNamara, who were jailed for life in 2016, both claimed innocence and blamed each other for Gao's murder.
When Gao's body was taken out to sea the morning after he was murdered, McNamara claims Rogerson was with him the whole time on the boat, threatening him with a gun. But Rogerson claimed he stayed on dry land.
The sentencing judge said although gunshot residue found on Rogerson's clothing pointed to the possibility he was the triggerman, he couldn't be sure who fired the fatal shots.
The pair was also jailed for stealing 2.78 kilograms of methamphetamine with a street value of up to $19 million from the 20-year-old university student.
In March 2023, the High Court rejected an appeal by Rogerson to have his murder conviction overturned, stamping out any hope he had of being released.
The culmination of Rogerson's recognition in the force was to receive the coveted Peter Mitchell Award for outstanding police work in 1980 but within six years, his career had unravelled spectacularly.
In 1981 he was controversially found responsible for the fatal shooting of another young drug dealer, Warren Lanfranchi, but deemed to have acted in the line of duty.

However Lanfranchi's girlfriend, sex worker Sallie-Anne Huckstepp, soon after alleged Rogerson deliberately killed him as revenge for robbing a heroin dealer who had been under police protection at the time.
Huckstepp's body was found in Centennial Park in 1986 with a Coroner ruling five years later there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone.
In the same year, Rogerson was dismissed from the police force for depositing $110,000 in bank accounts under a false name.
At the peak of Rogerson's demise, he was also implicated in the attempted execution of NSW undercover operative Michael Drury.
The similarly decorated drug squad detective had refused to accept a bribe in exchange for evidence tampering in a heroin trafficking trial.
Drury was shot twice through his kitchen window at his home in Chatswood in Sydney's north shore in 1989 but survived the attack.

Rogerson, hitman Chris Flannery and Melbourne heroin dealer Alan Williams were alleged to have conspired over the attempt on Drury's life.
The detective was suspended from the force but acquitted of conspiring to murder Drury, who it was alleged he had attempted to bribe on Williams' behalf.
In 1999, the former detective was sentenced to 12 months behind bars for lying to the Police Integrity Commission.
Rogerson appeared briefly in shows telling tall tales about his times on the beat, one was titled The Wild Colonial Psychos which also featured notorious career criminal Mark 'Chopper' Read.
Richard Roxburgh portrayed Rogerson in the 1995 mini-series Blue Murder and its 2017 sequel Blue Murder: Killer Cop which explored his close relationship with crime kingpins Arthur 'Neddy' Smith and Chris Flannery.
Roger Rogerson was a decorated and high-flying NSW police officer who ended up with a rap sheet that included, murder, drug trafficking and perverting justice.
*Rogerson was born in Sydney in 1941 and joined the NSW Police in 1959, at 18
*During his 27-year career he worked on high-profile cases and was an integral part of the notoriously corrupt armed hold-up squad
*Rising through the ranks to detective, in 1980, he received the coveted Peter Mitchell Award for outstanding police work
*In 1981 he was investigated over the fatal shooting of 22-year-old drug dealer, Warren Lanfranchi but was cleared of wrongdoing after an inquest determined he shot Lanfranchi while trying to arrest him
*Lanfranchi's girlfriend Sallie-Anne Huckstepp sensationally accused Rogerson of murdering her boyfriend and was found murdered in Centennial Park in 1986
*Sydney underworld figure, Arthur 'Neddy' Smith was charged Ms Huckstep's murder but later acquitted
*Smith later said Rogerson gave him the 'green light' to commit crimes in NSW
*Rogerson was acquitted in 1989 of trying to bribe and conspiring with a hitman to murder undercover drug squad officer Michael Drury, who survived a 1984 execution-style shooting
*Rogerson was dismissed from the force in 1986 for depositing $110,000 into bank accounts using a false name and later spent nearly four years in prison in the 1990s for perverting the course of justice.
*Richard Roxburgh depicted Rogerson in the 1995 television mini-series Blue Murder as the star crooked cop who was in cahoots with prominent underworld figures
*Rogerson appeared briefly in shows telling tall tales about his times on the beat, one was titled The Wild Colonial Psychos which also featured criminal Mark 'Chopper' Read
*Rogerson was jailed in 2005 for 12 months after admitting lying to the Police Integrity Commission, at a hearing into possible corruption at Liverpool City Council
*In May 2014, Rogerson and fellow former detective Glen McNamara shot dead 20-year-old university student and drug dealer Jamie Gao dead in a Sydney storage unit
*The pair were found guilty in 2016 of murdering Gao and sentenced to life
*They received an additional nine year sentence for stealing 2.78kg of methamphetamine from Gao, with an estimated street value of $19 million
*In 2021 Rogerson and McNamara lost bids in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal to have their convictions overturned, with a panel of judges saying Rogerson's case 'did not raise any doubt about his guilt'
*On March 17, 2023, the High Court rejected a bid by Rogerson to have his life sentence overturned
*Rogerson was moved from Long Bay prison to Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital on January 18, 2024, to receive end-of-life care and died three days later."

Horses and riders were seen charging through flames several feet high in the streets of Vilanova D'Alcolea, in Castellon, eastern Spain, as part of an annual festival celebrating Saint Antoni.
The saint, canonised more than 790 years ago, is well-loved in Spain, and days-long festivals are held the country in his honour.
Participants believe that horses who leap through the flames of specially constructed bonfires will be purified during the coming year. Organisers claim that the festival dates back some 500 years.
Legend holds that Saint Anthoni was visited by the Devil, dressed as a woman, while he lived in a desert.

Keen to avoid temptation, he walked across the burning embers of a fire to distract himself
According to the region's tourism board, the horses are blessed, and a procession begins marching through the streets of the village.
There, horses and riders are forced to leap over 'spectacular barriers of fire' set up along a predetermined route, known as the matxà.
Following the procession, a race known as the 'tropell' takes place, which sees riders racing their horses without saddles to a finishing line.
Pastries known as 'coques' are give to participants who make it to the finishing line, and the distribution of the pastries are meant to display the strength of each horse and the rider's skill in handling them.
While local groups have for years defended the practice, rights groups have condemned the festival as animal abuse

The rider with the most coques is given alive chicken as a prize, and a dance is held afterwards.
While local groups have for years defended the practice, rights groups have condemned the festival as animal abuse.
The town's mayor Maria Jesus Martin Gomez disagreed, previously saying: 'The only thing I have to say is that the animals don't suffer anything at all.
He added: 'The government of Castilla and Leon assign us a vet and the City Hall hires another one, who is making rounds all around the village during the festival.
'Every year they produce a report which has always been favourable and nothing has ever happened here.'"

Tariq Zaman, 42, was caught on police dashcam footage weaving across lanes in Kenilworth, at breakneck speed after initially bluffing to pull over when requested to stop by police.
Zaman, of Medlicott Road in Birmingham, led police on the 10-minute high speed chase in his Peugeot 407 Estate on 21 July 2022 at around 11:45pm.
As the police car slows down behind driver, the footage shows the sly yob take off after pretending to comply with officers and begin recklessly speeding down residential roads.
It's not long before Zaman is hurtling at 68mph in the 30 zone outside of a primary school on Clinton Lane, narrowly missing an oncoming minibus and visibly losing control of his car.
Tariq Zaman, 42, was sentenced to 20 months in prison for dangerous driving, and handed a £156 fine along with a 36 month disqualification from driving
Officers continue doggedly chasing the dangerous driver who attempts to shake them off by making sharp turns as he zig-zags across lanes to avoid oncoming traffic.
After getting stuck behind a tractor, a passenger jumps out of the car to makes a run for it.
Zaman, steadfast in his aim to get shot of the police, swerves around the tractor hitting 80mph in a 40 zone, on Birmingham Road towards Balsall Common.
With the driver travelling at a whopping 70mph down the wrong lane of the A452 dual carriageway, it becomes too dangerous for the police to continue pursing him.
Shrewdly, the officer takes a parallel route and shortly catches up with Zaman, who after taking a wrong turn onto a building site, parks up before attempting to flee on foot in a cross-country escape.

However, the driver was found by the force's German Shepherd, perched on a pile of rubble nearby, inside an empty shell of a building.
Astonishingly, Zaman had 'the gall' to ask officers: 'What did you think of my driving?'
On being told it was poor, Zaman further stunned officers when he asked: 'Why was it poor?'.
Zaman was sentenced to 20 months in prison for dangerous driving, and handed a £156 fine along with a 36 month disqualification from driving, at Warwick Crown Court on 17 January 2024.
Investigating officer DC Samir Hassan said: 'Zaman had a clear and flagrant disregard for the safety of the people of Kenilworth and Balsall Common.
'This chase involved so many near-misses and moments where Zaman almost lost traction completely that it's a miracle that no-one was hurt.
'The gall of Zaman to ask for a review of his driving afterwards is astonishing – we're not sure how many stars 20 months in prison and a 34 month driving ban translates to, but it definitely isn't five.'"

Five-year-old Karter Holloway died on New Year's Day at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Hospital as a result of his injuries from the beating.
Amir Devon Hines, 24, has been charged with murder and felony child abuse and is being held without bond; it is unclear if he has entered a plea at this time.
'He was always happy, he would just bop. Just bop around all the time. He was my 'bop-bop', Tiffani Holloway, Karter's maternal grandmother, told ABC 11.
Hines, who is scheduled to appear back in court on Monday, told the family that Karter had fallen off his bike when Karter was hospitalized, according to Holloway.

The Raleigh Police Department received a call on December 31 from staff at UNC Chapel Hill Hospital about a serious assault on a child.
The boy died the next day from a brain hemorrhage that resulted from his injuries, according to doctors.
The five-year-old, who had autism and was non-verbal, leaves behind a two-year-old sister and the rest of the family.
'He loved me,' Holloway said on WRAL. 'He couldn't talk. He had words but he didn't talk in sentences. He had ways of letting you know.'
The grandma said Karter loved being in water and superheroes.
'Processing the crime - I can't process that... process that I'll never see Karter again, I struggle with that,' Holloway said.
It is reported that Hines showed no remorse during his initial appearance in court when a judge informed him that Karter had died.
'Medical reports told us the medical truth, which was he was beaten all over. Karter had bruises from head to toe,' Holloway said, unable to hold back her tears.
'That will help us in this process of grieving because now know the truth,' she added. 'To know what Karter went through in those last moments that he was alert and alive.

'Of all deaths, that of a child is the most unnatural and the hardest to bear,' Dr. Enoch Holloway, Karter's great uncle, said.
'He loved life. He loved his family,' Letitia Tillery, a teacher, told the crowd gathered. 'When he hugged you, it was full of love and compassion. He squeezed the happiness into your soul.'
'Death seems a cruel thief when it strikes down the young,' Enoch said. 'If I can say anything that I'm confident in, Karter's with the Lord.'

Kennedy thanked supporters who contributed to the GoFundMe, which has raised more than $10,000 as of early Sunday morning.
She wrote: 'Mostly I would like to say thank you for your prayers and words of encouragement. You have no idea how much it has helped!'"

The cat-loving couple also told officials that they would pay up to $100,000 to build a facility and invest money annually to keep it running but were rejected.
They believe their proposal was shot down due to their demand for a land donation and a roadway.
'We've been turned down every time we want to develop some type of an aftercare program to help these cats instead of (them) dying on the streets,' Chip Malley said.
As of now to deal with stray cats, Kenton County uses the 'trap, neuter, release' method with no daycare facilities.

The method is supported by the National Feline Research Council and other animal advocacy organizations.
Kelsey Mccombs, director of Kenton County Animal Services said: 'There's a lot of people who don't understand that cats can be successful and happy outdoors. And that's just fundamentally a philosophical difference. I don't expect to change everyone's mind.'
To keep costs in control and prevent people from dropping off random cats, the family has purposely kept the address of the shelter a secret.
The Malleys said they even found a kitten in their mailbox once.
But due to keeping their house in incognito mode, many of the cats have also not been adopted by people.
Most people find out about the shelter through word of mouth or by their Facebook.
The shelter also has a very strict adoption policy. To adopt or volunteer help, people have to call Jan personally and set up an appointment."
UCAU7G6ZHE_C45KPR82QDT638K,Desperate Humza Yousaf pleads with SNP voters not to defect to Labour claiming Keir Starmer doesn't need Scotland to beat the Tories at the next election - and pledges to work with him if he takes power,"David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline","Published: 11:30 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 15:39 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988763/Desperate-Humza-Yousaf-pleads-SNP-voters-not-defect-Labour.html,"SNP leader Humza Yousaf today made another desperate plea for party voters not to abandon it to back Labour - as he wooed Keir Starmer and vowed to work with him if he becomes PM.
The First Minister insisted that Scots do not need to move their vote away from the scandal-riddled nationalists in order to get rid of the Tory government of Rishi Sunak.
Mr Yousaf is under mounting pressure with polls suggesting that the SNP may not be Scotland's largest party at Westminster after the next election, with Sir Keir's route to power coming through a resurgence north of the border.
In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Yousaf said Sir Keir 'will undoubtedly be the next prime minister' even if Scots don't swarm to back his party, in a clear attempt to cling on to seats.
But it was also revealed he has written to the Labour leader, offering to work with him after the election if he wins, saying differing political views should not 'prevent us being able to work together'.
However he also suggested that the price of his help would be a new referendum on Scottish independence.
Sir Keir has previously ruled this out, and polls suggest that he probably will not need SNP help after the election.
The First Minister insisted that Scots do not need to move their vote away from the scandal-riddled nationalists in order to get rid of the Tory government of Rishi Sunak.
In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Yousaf said Sir Keir 'will undoubtedly be the next prime minister' even if Scots don't swarm to back his party, in a clear attempt to cling on to seats.
In an appeal to SNP voters, he told BBC Radio Scotland's The Sunday Show: 'I think there's still a raging debate in the country around the constitution, but that is not what this general election is going to be about.
'I've been really clear that I'm not going to turn my back, close my eyes, or shut my ears to any voter in the country, whether they voted Yes or No (to independence).
'I want to reach out to people across the country to say ''I understand why so many people have wanted to run a million miles from this rotten Tory Government''.'
Asked whether his party will use a Labour win to 'endorse the Union', Mr Sarwar said: 'No, because I want to persuade people that we can make Scotland work within a devolved settlement.'
In his letter to the Labour leader, Humza Yousaf said differing political views should not 'prevent us being able to work together'.
He wrote: 'I hope you will accept this invitation to meet and that we can establish a working relationship in the interests of the people we represent.'
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Yousaf appealed to Sir Keir to work with the SNP on reducing child poverty and strengthening relations between the UK and Scottish governments.
He told the programme Sir Keir will 'absolutely' be the next UK prime minister, and said he must tackle child poverty by committing to scrap the two-child benefit cap - which the Labour leader has previously not committed to.
The policy prevents parents from claiming child tax credits or universal credit for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. A so-called rape clause, which requires women to declare their child was conceived as a result of rape in order to maintain the benefits, should also be scrapped, the First Minister said.
Previously, Mr Yousaf said the SNP's conditions of working with Labour would be Sir Keir paving the way for a future Scottish independence referendum.
In his letter, published on Sunday, the First Minister made clear independence is still a priority.
'My Government is clear that Scotland's future is as an independent country in the European Union, and that there is a democratic mandate for a referendum on independence which should be respected,' he said.
He later told Kuenssberg: 'I'd like to speak to Keir Starmer as the man who will undoubtedly be the next prime minister.'
In a direct appeal to the Labour leader, he said: 'SNP MPs will work with you.
'When it comes to Keir Starmer being the next prime minister of the United Kingdom, which I think he absolutely will be, I should say I'm very willing to work with an incoming Labour government.
'I think there's plenty that we can work on. There will be disagreements - the constitution perhaps being the obvious one.'"

Diplomats involved in the talks told the Wall Street Journal that officials from the US, Egypt and Qatar have presented Israel and Hamas with a 90-day proposal that involves three phases.
The first phase involves a long pause in fighting while both sides release hostages. For Hamas, that means freeing all of the remaining civilians detained on October 7, while Israel would need to emancipate hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
During the first phase, the IDF would also withdraw forces from Gaza's towns and cities, end drone surveillance and double the amount of aid going into the region.
Talks are set to continue in Cairo over the coming days, the diplomats said.

The first phase of a newly-reported proposal by the US, Egypt and Qatar would involve a long pause in attacks on Gaza. (Pictured: wounded Palestinian young women talk on their beds as they receive medical care onboard the French LHD Dixmude military ship, which serves as a hospital, as it docks at the Egyptian port of Al-Arish on January 21)
It comes after previous negotiations broke down on November 30 during a week-long ceasefire in return for the phased release of around 100 Israeli hostages and 300 Palestinian prisoners.
Neither Israel nor Hamas has agreed to the terms of the new proposals, and Taher Al-Nono, representing Hamas, told the WSJ that no real progress has been made.
But the two parties' 'willingness to discuss the framework was a positive step,' one anonymous diplomat involved told the newspaper.
Egyptian officials said Israeli negotiators are keen for a two-week ceasefire to allow for a second hostage-prisoner exchange, but they're reluctant to discuss the possibility of a permanent end to the war.
Meanwhile, Hamas negotiators are using the hostages to their full advantage - saying they will only be released in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners and a permanent ceasefire.
The militant group has also said the reality of the previous short-term hostage deal was disappointing - with less aid than promised reaching Gaza and many of its prisoners getting re-incarcerated.
If the first stage of the 90-day plan succeed, negotiators would move to phase two.
In this phase, Hamas would free female Israeli soldiers and return the bodies of those who have died in the conflict, in exchange for Israel returning more Palestinian prisoners.

Phase three would involve the release of Israeli soldiers and fighting-age men in return for Israel moving its forces outside the current borders of the Gaza Strip.
A permanent ceasefire would eventually follow, and the re-launching of the process to outline agreed borders of the Palestinian state.
Egyptian officials said an international fund for the reconstruction of Gaza and safety guarantees for Hamas political leaders have also been tabled.
The tentative negotiations are the latest development in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which spiraled into a full-scale invasion of Gaza following the horrific October 7 Hamas attack.
Israel said the attack killed around 1,200 civilians, and that many were raped, tortured and abused.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation, and began relentless strikes on the Gaza Strip that have so far killed more than 25,000 Palestinians.
DailyMail.com has contacted the White House for comment on the latest negotiations, but the office did not immediately respond.
Hamas released a video showing hostage Noa Argamani explaining how Yossi Sharabi and Itai Svirski were killed in captivity
The world watched in horror as a video emerged of Noa Argamani, 26, sitting on the back of a motorbike as she screamed 'Don't kill me' to the men surrounding her during Hamas's attacks on Israel in October
Itai Svirski has allegedly been killed while being held captive by Hamas
Yossi Sharabi was allegedly killed after the building the hostages were housed in was hit by an Israeli airstrike
The relaunch of negotiations also follows the release of a chilling video by Hamas showing 26-year-old hostage Noa Argamani being forced to say two of her fellow captives were dead.
Argamani says they were killed by IDF strikes in the January 15 video. The footage followed another video posted that day in which Hamas claimed they would reveal which of the three hostages is still alive.
In the footage they asked viewers 'what do you think?' - referring to the fate of the Nova festival attendee Ms Argamani, Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Itai Svirsky, 38.
Videos of their capture from the peace festival horrified the world, with Argmani shown horrified as a Hamas militant stole her away on a motorbike."

The Duchess of York has had a mole removed from her body which tests have since found to be a malignant melanoma which is the most serious type of skin cancer.
It comes after the 64-year-old underwent a breast operation for cancer last year, with insiders saying it has 'not been an easy time' for her.
The mother-of-two had a number of moles removed while undergoing breast reconstruction surgery last year, one of which was found to be malignant.
The Duchess, who is the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, was described as being in 'good spirits' after the 'distressing' news, which was broken to her just days after Christmas.

The author has spent the last few weeks in Austria recuperating at a luxury clinic after spending some time with the Royal Family at Sandringham over Christmas.
It is hoped that the cancer was found early enough that she won't have any further problems, but will undergo further tests to determine whether it has spread.
A melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other areas of the body, mainly caused by exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun or sunbeds.
People with paler skin, a large number of moles and family history of skin cancer tend to be more at risk of developing this.
The news comes days after it was revealed both King Charles III and the Princess of Wales will have undergone medical procedures by this time next week.
Princess Catherine was  taken into hospital last week to have planned abdominal surgery which will leave her at The Clinic in London for ten to 14 days, and requiring up to three months of rest and recovery at home.
The reason for the surgery is unknown, although sources have said it is not cancerous in nature.
The same day Kate underwent her surgery, it was announced that King Charles would have treatment for an enlarged prostate in the next week.
The news comes days after it was revealed King Charles and the Princess of Wales had health scares. Pictured: King Charles greets Princess Catherine at the world premiere of No Time To Die at the Royal Albert Hall in London in September 2021

A spokesman for Sarah, Duchess of York said: 'Following her diagnosis with an early form of breast cancer this summer, Sarah, Duchess of York has now been diagnosed with malignant melanoma.
'Her dermatologist asked that several moles were removed and analysed at the same time as the Duchess was undergoing reconstructive surgery following her mastectomy, and one of these has been identified as cancerous.
'She is undergoing further investigations to ensure that this has been caught in the early stages.
'Clearly, another diagnosis so soon after treatment for breast cancer has been distressing but the Duchess remains in good spirits.
'The Duchess wants to thank the entire medical team which has supported her, particularly her dermatologist whose vigilance ensured the illness was detected when it was.
'She believes her experience underlines the importance of checking the size, shape, colour and texture and emergence of new moles that can be a sign of melanoma.'
The Duchess is set to be treated by Dr Andrew Furness, a consultant medical oncologist at Royal Marsden Hospital in London, as well as Catherine Borysiewicz, a constultant dermatologist at King Edward VII Hospital in London.
It says she has been recuperating at MAYRLIFE, a luxury clinic in Austria which has played host to the likes of Naomi Campbell, Karlie Kloss and Rebel Wilson in the past.
The Duchess is a patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust and spoke at a Breast Cancer Foundation gala in 2019.
Her elder daughter Princess Beatrice is patron of the British Skin Foundation and has worked with skin cancer patients.
The Duchess's father Roland Ferguson was diagnosed with both prostate cancer and skin cancer in the 10 years before he died.
In November, following her battle with breast cancer, the Duchess revealed she was scared about getting the disease 'somewhere else' and admitted to waking up in the night in a panic.
On the ITV show Loose Women, she highlighted the importance of attending mammogram appointments before admitting she was worried about the future.
'And then of course you start four in the morning syndrome,' she told Christine Lampard, Coleen Nolan, and Brenda Edwards on the pre-recorded one-off special.
'You know that moment when you suddenly wake up and go ""oh I'm sure I've got cancer somewhere else... I'm gonna go and ring my doctor"".
'I'm getting over that but it's only been a few months since I've had the operation, so I'm just beginning to sit up straight.'

It comes months after the Duchess went public with her battle against breast cancer, including having a single mastectomy last year in her bid to beat the disease.
After having a reconstruction on her left breast, she even went on morning television where she joked that she 'kind of likes them'.
Showing a grand sense of humour, Sarah told Good Morning Britain presenters Susanna Reid and Ed Balls in December that she had named her left breast 'Derek'.
Her cancer journey began in spring when a routine test first detected something was seriously wrong before the Coronation.
In early May, Sarah attended an appointment in London for a mammogram. Rather than being given the all-clear, as expected, the technician explained that a 'shadow' could be seen in the breast.
Given the size of the area, a lumpectomy was ruled out and Sarah was strongly advised to go ahead with a single mastectomy, which would eradicate the shadow of cancerous cells across the breast.
Sarah was said to be devastated but determined to press ahead with a mastectomy as soon as possible, telling friends she had 'no choice' but to go through with the operation.
She had undergone a gruelling eight-hour operation at King Edward VII Hospital in June following her diagnosis with breast cancer and revealed the moment she knew doctors had found something during her mammogram.
'I could see they moved very quickly,' she said. 'They said ""Well we'll just do another one"" then ""Oh we'll just do this"" and I was saying ""No no but you haven't found anything have you? No I'm fine aren't I?"".'
'It was like a splat. It was like someone had gone [gestures a splatting action] like that and it was better to have it removed.'
Since the operation, Sarah has exuded positivity and encouraged others to get checked - especially if they are scared.
This morning she said: 'For anyone who is thinking ""I can’t possibly do it"" because they might find something, the sooner they do find something and remove it, and if they have to remove it as a lumpectomy or a mastectomy or whatever they have to do, it's okay you've got this.
'And it's okay to cry. It's okay to be terrified. It's okay to say ""I really am terrified"", but together we can be strong to get through it.'

Malignant melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that begins in melanocytes, cells found in the upper layer of skin that produce melanin, which gives skin its colour.
While less common that other types of skin cancer, it is more dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs more rapidly if it is not treated at an early stage.


Symptoms

A new mole or a change in an existing mole may be signs of melanoma.
Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they're more common in areas that are often exposed to the sun.
Some rarer types can affect the eyes, soles of the feet, palms of the hands or genitals.
Check your skin for any unusual changes. Use a mirror or ask a partner or friend to check any areas you cannot see.
In particular, look for:

Causes

Ultraviolet (UV) light is the most common cause of melanoma. It comes from the sun and is used in sunbeds.
Melanoma is more common in older people, but younger people can also get it.
You're also more likely to get melanoma if you have:

If you have black or brown skin, you have a lower chance of getting melanoma, but you can still get it.
Prevention
Staying safe in the sun is the best way to lower your chance of getting skin cancer (both melanoma and non-melanoma).
Do the following:

Treatment
Melanoma skin cancer can often be treated. The treatment you have will depend on where it is, if it has spread and your general health.
Surgery is the main treatment for melanoma. Radiotherapy, medicines and chemotherapy are also sometimes used.
Surgery could involve removing the melanoma and an area of healthy skin around it, swollen lymph nodes if the cancer has spread to them and other parts of the body if it has spread to them.
If a large part of skin has to be removed, a skin graft might be needed which could see kin taken from another part of the body to cover the area where the melanoma was.
Radiotherpay is sometimes used to reduce the size of large melanomas and help control and relieve symptoms.
Targeted medicines and immotherapy are used to treat melanomas that can't be dealt with by surgery, or have spread to lymph glands or other parts of the body.
Chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells, is sometimes used to treat advanced melanoma when it has spread to another part of the body. It does not work as well as other treatments, but can be used if you are unable to have them.
How dangerous is it?
Generally for people with melanoma in England:

She has filed the lawsuits in the US District Court of Colorado as a Jane Doe and is seeking unspecified damages from two companies.

Some of the services she provides include swaddling her clients in baby blankets, fixing bowls of cereal, playing Saturday morning cartoons, changing their diapers and kicking men in their genitals.
In an interview with The Denver Post, she said, 'For years, I’ve built a business on my likeness.
'And having it represented by a scam company is extremely damaging to what I do, because if I’m associated with this scam, people are going to take me less seriously.
'There’s been many instances where my images have been used by another person to scam people out of money and then it’s, ""Well, Kat Marie is a scammer,"" when they’re not even talking to me at all.
'You can’t just take advantage of people on the internet and get away with it. Someone will eventually stand up for them. I certainly could not care and could get Twitter to take my images down and move on. But there’s just too many people in the community looking for acceptance to continue to let scammers get away with this,' she further said.

In her first lawsuit, Marie is suing Mark Anthony Young and Carol Aaliyah Muhammad, both from the United Kingdom, for allegedly setting up a fake adult baby clinic and using her pictures without permission.
Both of the accused had set up a clinic called AB Elite Clinic and said they were based in the UK and Ohio.
Earlier last year, Marie discovered the clinic after a man contacted her and questioned why she never provided the services he was promised after sending thousands of dollars through CashApp.
Marie then found Young online and demanded that he stop using her photographs. She claims he agreed and stopped but soon started again.
The lawsuit says that in May 2023, Young messaged her on social media and threatened to expose her legal name and address to right-wing websites and police.

The former president said he is now looking forward to working with the former rival to defeat Joe Biden in November, and again called on the GOP to unite behind him.
During a trip to his New Hampshire campaign headquarters, he also said he would retire the nickname 'DeSanctimonious', that he has used frequently in the the battle for the White House.
Trump is going into New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday with a commanding lead over Nikki Haley after his landslide victory in Iowa.
Now he has one of the top Republican officials in the country on his side, even though he was widely mocked him and targeted him with nicknames such as 'Meatball'.
Donald Trump said he is 'honored' to have Ron DeSantis ' endorsement in the Republican race for president after the Florida Governor made the shock decision to drop out
Trump endorsed DeSantis in his 2018 bid for governor in Florida, using his coattails to help earn him the Republican nomination and eventually the win
'With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates,' the Trump campaign said in a statement.
'It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.
'Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement. From higher taxes, to decimating Social Security and Medicare, and to open borders, she represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans.
'It’s time to choose wisely.'
DeSantis , widely considered the future of the Republican party and initially the favorite to take down Trump, announced he was suspending his campaign in a surprise video announcement Sunday afternoon.
It followed mounting speculation that donors were fleeing and his campaign was struggling to find a path to make a dent in Trump's huge polling lead.
During a trip to his New Hampshire campaign headquarters, he also said he would retire the nickname 'DeSanctimonious', that he has used frequently in the the battle for the White House
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential campaign on Sunday. Pictured: DeSantis at a campaign stop in Nashua, New Hampshire on January 19
DeSantis came second in the Iowa caucuses and largely avoided campaigning in New Hampshire so he could focus on South Carolina – the home state of 2024 candidate Nikki Haley.
But the writing was on the wall when the campaign fired half its staff, big-money backers were increasingly frustrated with his war on 'woke' and top brass were at each other's throats.
DeSantis channeled Winston Churchill in his farewell video and called Haley a 'repackaged form of warmed-up corporatism'.
His final warning was for Republicans not to go 'back to yesteryear' and confirmed he would support Trump, the opponent who has mocked and humiliated him for the last year.
'We don't have a clear path to victory,' DeSantis said in the video posted to X announcing his departure from the race. 'Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.'
Now the Republican primary is down to a two-person race with only former President Trump and his once-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley vying for the nomination.
'I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race,' Haley said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday afternoon. 'He's been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.'
Despite repeatedly bashing Trump for refusing to debate in the primary cycle and taking several hits from the ex-president, the governor decided to endorse his former rival.
Throughout the campaign, Trump called DeSantis a 'traitor' for deciding to run for president in 2024 after the former president's endorsement is what led him to clinch the Republican nomination for governor in Florida in 2018.
'It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,' DeSantis said. 'They watch his presidency gets stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.'
He added: 'Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.'
'I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.'
The pledge in question is what the Republican National Committee (RNC) required all candidates to sign, vowing to support the eventual nominee if they wanted to participate in their four primary debates last year. Trump never signed the pledge and refused to show up for the debates.
DeSantis' young family joined him for most of his time campaigning. Pictured: Ron, Casey, Madison, six, Mason, five, and Mamie, three, appear together on stage at a campaign event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Saturday, January 20 – the day before Gov. DeSantis dropped out of the race

After no guidance was sent for events on Sunday or Monday ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, speculation began to swirl over where DeSantis had landed after his Saturday swing.
The announcement of the end of his campaign was filmed in Florida, where it is now known he returned to after holding his last 2024 campaign event in South Carolina on Saturday.
Moments after the video went live, guidance was sent canceling DeSantis' meet and greet in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday evening.
DeSantis' campaign vehemently denied to DailyMail.com on Sunday any rumors that could emerge detailing DeSantis' plans to drop out – but just hours later, the governor released a video on X ending his bid.
'Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,' DeSantis said in a four-and-a-half video on his exit from the campaign. 'Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward.'
'If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,' he continued. 'But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources.'
It appeared that DeSantis would stay in the race until after South Carolina in hopes that Haley would do poorly in her home state and drop out.
But instead, he chose to exit before New Hampshire could weigh-in on Tuesday.
'[Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear – a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism – that Nikki Haley represents,' he said in slamming the former president's only remaining GOP contender.
DeSantis' launched his campaign in a disasterous Twitter Spacces event before CEO Elon Musk rebranded the website to X. Instead of starting off with the anticipated 'historic' social media announcement, the app experienced a series of glitches that wouldn't let the event kick-off
DeSantis' final days in the race had him frantically trying to figure out where his message might best resonate after he lost Iowa to Trump by 30 points.
After completing the 'full Grassley' in Iowa by traveling to all 99 counties and receiving the endorsement of the state's popular Gov. Kim Reynolds, DeSantis still couldn't turn ou the vote for a win in the caucuses on January 15.
The day after the Iowa caucuses DeSantis flew to Greenville, South Carolina to get a jump start in the fourth primary contest state in hopes voters would turn against Nikki Haley there.
After the quick South Carolina stop, DeSantis flew back to New Hampshire later that day before CBS News broke on Wednesday that the governor planned to leave the Granite State - possibly for good - to again campaign in South Carolina all weekend.
That trip, however, ended up lasting one day – with three events. It concluded with headlines on how DeSantis sparred with a fourth grade teacher over Haley's education record as governor.
On Sunday, instead of campaigning in South Carolina, DeSantis was expected to fly back to New Hampshire. But after canceling appearances on NBC's Meet the Press and CNN's State of the Union in the process, it became clear something else was afoot.
Hours later on Sunday morning he dropped out of the race and canceled remaining events."

In a recent video she posted on TikTok, Instagram, and other social media platforms, the couple shared the breakdown of their income sources.
The content creator revealed the most money they have earned under the name Salary Transparent Street, a social media brand, was from partnerships and ads.

Williams, a graduate of Northern Virginia Community College and Georgetown University, quit her job as a data analyst that paid $115,000 a year to work full time on her social media brand Salary Transparent Street in 2022.
The 27-year-old confessed she and her husband were reluctant to quit their jobs: 'He was supposed to quit with me, but we were a little hesitant.'
'It really was such a drastic change, so we were like, ""Let's wait a little longer."" Then a few weeks after that, it was a no-brainer. We loved what we were doing. We wanted to do more of it.'
She founded the platform to encourage people to talk openly about their jobs and advocate for more pay transparency, she said.
'If the Great Resignation has taught us anything, it is that there is power in numbers,' she explained in a 2022 interview with the Washington Post.
'When workers are empowered, they can actually influence change. I figured, what better way to get open salaries out there on the Internet than by asking strangers on the street?'
But she did not expect the overwhelming reactions from social media users: 'I thought that it was going to be successful, but I had no idea it would go as viral as it did.'

She founded the platform to encourage people to talk openly about their jobs and advocate for more pay transparency, she said
The 27-year-old confessed she and her husband were reluctant to quit their jobs: 'He was supposed to quit with me, but we were a little hesitant'

After two years, Williams has accumulated more than around 2.7 million subscribers, who tune in to watch her clips showing people talking about their pay publicly on the streets.
'Like 80-ish,' a woman who works in vendor management said. 'It's a good starting job out of school. I can afford my life, but I think there could be a little bit extra in there.'
A man said: 'I'm a recruiting consultant at a media company in the D.C. area. I make upward of $120,000-plus.'
'I'm a registered nurse in Florida,' another person shared in a video, 'I make $80,000 a year.'
Williams also interviewed people in finance and software engineering, who earned some of the highest salaries she heard in 2023.
A woman who works in healthcare technology said on the street of Denver, Colorado, said: 'I do... artificial intelligence and machine learning. I make around $230,000.'
Vivian Tu, a finance creator who lives in New York City, said: 'Last year, I paid myself a salary of roughly around $300,000, but my business made about $3.2 million.'

In one of the recent videos Williams made, she and Daniels sat down and revealed their own earning in 2023.
'The reason that we decided to share how much we made is because we can't just talk the talk, we have to walk the walk,' Williams told the Washington Post.
'One of the most common questions we get from our community in the comments section is, ""How much do you make?"" And I think that's a fair question.'
Through brand partnerships, Williams brought in $1,012,329, constituting a significant portion of the $1,043,740 she made last year.
'Sometimes our partnerships with one brand are worth six figures, and that's because we are working with them for the entire year,' Williams explained in the video.
'Having a viral video doesn't make you a millionaire,' she said. 'We learned that very quickly.
'But having the passion and the idea of building a business behind a social media page will generate a lot of revenue from brand deals,' she added.
She and Daniels have made hundreds of videos that have received nearly a billion views, and also built a website that features pay data and resources for job seekers.
She said: 'We have to look at this like as a business but also consider impact. It's really not just about viral videos. It's what can we do with this information to make sure it's not just lost in the interwebs? How do we have impact?'"

V8P2BOE1EK_0ITRJAFW0XCW3B0,Man who has spent four years living in abandoned California GHOST TOWN he bought for $1.4 million attempts to turn desolate mining post into a tourist hotspot by building a luxury HOTEL in the center of the empty community,Emily Lefroy For Dailymail.Com,"Published: 20:51 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 20:51 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12975327/man-spent-four-years-living-abandoned-ghost-town-cerro-gordo.html,"If you build it they will come - at least one man is hoping that's the case, after buying an abandoned town and building a hotel to attract visitors.
YouTube creator Brent Underwood and his investor friend, Jon Bier, owner of boutique public relations agency Jack Taylor PR, bought Cerro Gordo from family owners in July 2018 with plans to turn it into a tourist attraction.
The 300-acre property, which contains 22 buildings, is located about 220 miles north of Los Angeles.
The treacherous journey to the historic town is made on a single-lane gravel road that ranges from '2,000 feet above sea level to 8,500 feet above sea level.'
YouTuber Brent Underwood purchased the abandoned Cerro Gordo mine in California in July 2020
Brent and Jon are currently undertaking the 'project above all projects,' which is rebuilding a hotel in the town
'Since the Coronavirus outbreak, I've moved from Austin, Texas up to the town and I'm living alone in this abandoned ghost town trying to make it into a place for more people to enjoy,' Brent shared in a clip to his channel.
According to the creator, the town was originally established in 1865, and the silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for helping to build up LA.
Brent has previously said he was drawn to Cerro Gordo's long and bloody history. At its peak in the 19th century, the community of 5,000 people was a haven for violent crime because the nearest law enforcement agencies couldn't be bothered to police it given the remote location.
'The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly,' he wrote in the description for a YouTube video.
Brent and Jon are currently undertaking the 'project above all projects,' which is rebuilding a hotel in the town.
The American Hotel tragically burned down in 2020, which Brent described as a 'gut punch,' and has vowed to rebuild it.
'There's going to be six rooms in this top floor, all of the rooms will have just postcard views,' he explained, showing off the panoramic views of the town.
Currently, the hotel still has a way to go, with no roof and supply transportation issues making it difficult.

Brent has previously said he was drawn to Cerro Gordo's long and bloody history. At its peak in the 19th century, the community of 5,000 people
'The hotel is an exercise and patience,' he explained. 'There's only so much I can do a lot of this work needs to be done by licensed contractors and so it's a waiting game at the moment.'
Another big challenge Brent, who spends his days hiking and mining in the abandoned mines, faces is getting water into the buildings.
'Living with no running water is no joke but it's also led me on some of my biggest adventures up here,' he shared in the clip.
Brent said he got a hydrogeologist come up to the town, who advised him on where he thought the best area would be to drill for water.
To balance out the scientific approach, he also sought the advice of a water dowser - or 'water witch' - who use rods or pendulums to locate ground water, buried metals or ores, gemstones, oil, claimed radiations, gravesites and malign 'earth vibrations.'
Brent reached out to a popular water dowser to ask if he could come out to the mine site.
'I read about Rob originally in a New York Times article that was about these huge multi-million dollar vineyards in Napa that were using Rob to find their well locations during a drought,' Brent explained.
'Oil companies swear by him, vineyards swear by him.'
Rob does a lot of his dowsings remotely, printing out a map of the area and uses different pendulums to find the location of the water.
For Brent, he located two main areas to drill a well to supply water to the town.
'[Number one] is in a very easy to drill location, it's very convenient, it's a lot closer to town than the one that the hydrogeologist came up with,' Brent explained.
'And the second location that Rob found was directly behind the museum over there so if you want the best it's over there quality if you want the most gallons it's right here.'
The hotel has beautiful panoramic views of the stunning landscape that surrounds the property

Brent spends some time exploring the abandoned mines the 22-building town is built around
Brent continues explaining getting running water to the town is one of his main priorities, especially with the hotel being built.
'I think 2024 is going to be a big year for water at Cerro Gordo,' he said confidently.
Brent has previously spoken about his experiences in the ghost town, admitting he didn't believe in ghosts before he started living in Cerro Gordo, but had his first supernatural experience on the property.
He detailed a story of when he had some friends visiting, so went to stay in the bunkhouse on the property, but noticed there was a light on in the kitchen.
'I walked down here to the bunkhouse and I looked in that first window right there and the curtain all been been closed and a curtain open and closed and a little face looked out and the light was on in the kitchen,' he recalled.
'I went down to Robert our caretaker and I said Robert how long are the contractors staying in the bunkhouse and he kind of turned and looked at me he said the contractors left two weeks ago. So that was a bit spooky.'"
VRCKAA0831_EQWHK6PUF0L325R,Cyclone Kirrily: Wild weather system off Queensland coast to intensify into a category three while heatwave scorches Australia,Freddy Pawle For Daily Mail Australia,"Published: 02:55 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 02:55 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12987815/Cyclone-Kirrily-weather-Queensland-category-three-heatwave-Sydney-Brisbane-Melbourne.html,"A tropical low is expected to intensify into a cyclone in days with Aussies warned to brace for 'severe impact' while millions of others sweat through a heatwave.
The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has been keeping track of a slow-moving tropical low pressure system off the northeast coast of Queensland that 'will continue to strengthen to a tropical cyclone' over the next 24-hours.
Cyclone Kirrily is expected to intensify into a category three before it crosses the Queensland coast between Cairns and Mackay on Wednesday.
Meteorologist Steve Hadley urged Queenslanders to keep up to date on weather warnings over the following days.
Meanwhile, all mainland states and territories besides the ACT and Victoria were issued with heatwave warnings as temperatures skyrocket from Sunday.
Sydney is due to experience its hottest day of the year so far, with the CBD climbing to 37C while people in Penrith will feel the heat nudge up to 40C.
Millions of Aussies are escaping the heat (pictured) after the Bureau of Meteorology issued heat wave warning for about half of the country
Areas in Western and South Australia, New South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory will all hit temperatures of about 40 degrees (pictured, Bondi Beach)
Low to extreme heatwaves will hit about half the nation between Sunday to Tuesday, stretching all the way from the west coast, through Central Australia and up to the east and northeast coast.
Far-west and northern NSW will see the worst of the heat though, with Tibooburra due to get up to 43C.
The severe heat will stretch into northern NSW, with the north west slopes and plains staying hot into mid-next week.
Maximum temperatures in the high thirties to low forties are forecast for towns in the north including Moree.
Mr Hadley said the low pressure system off Queensland's coast 'could bring heavy rainfall' to areas further south of where it hits land between Cairns and Mackay.
The area is still recovering from Cyclone Jasper that smashed the coastline with heavy rain and wind speeds exceeding 160km/h.
An update on the cyclone from BoM on Sunday morning warned a 'severe coastal impact is possible, particularly if the system crosses near or south of Townsville'.
'We really want people to just stay up to date with the forecast and warnings, and if you're living in an area of the coastline which may be impacted by the cyclone this week it's time to start looking at things now,' Mr Hadley said.
The tropical low is expected to intensify into a cyclone on Monday night.
Once it crosses the coast, the cyclone is predicated to soften to a tropical low and move south bringing intense rainfall to parts of southern Queensland.
Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Chris Stream warned residents of those in impacted areas not to drive during heavy rain or flash flooding.
BOM is also warning Queenslanders near Cairns of a low pressure system in the Coral Sea that could develop into a cyclone throughout the week (pictured)
The area is still recovering from Cyclone Jasper which smashed the coast with hearvy rainfall and wind speeds of up to 160 km/h in December (pictured)
'Those vehicles float very well in water — they lose traction and the vehicles are washed away,' he said.
Mr Stream also warned that forensic crash investigators had dispelled 'the myth about removing your seat headrest and using that to break a window'.
'You will not be able to exit your vehicle.'
Around 40,000 people across north Queensland were left without power after Cyclone Jasper made landfall in December.
Subsequent 'cyclonic' storms across the over Christmas saw 10 people killed in flood waters and rough seas including a teacher and a nine-year-old girl.
While Queenslanders will be waiting with bated breath to see if another cyclone will smash into the coast, BoM also issued several heatwave warnings for the next three days.
Extreme heatwave conditions are predicted to hit Western Australians from Exmouth to Paraburdoo and across the border of South Australia with temperatures reaching the mid 40Cs.
Northwest South Australia is also expected to experience similar extreme heatwaves in the following days.
BoM also warned areas of the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales to be prepared for temperatures reaching the high 30Cs and 40Cs throughout the start of the week.
The Bureau warned older and younger people, pregnant and breastfeeding women and those unwell or with medical conditions are most at risk during heatwaves.
'Seek a place to keep cool, such as your home, a library, community centre or shopping centre,' BOM's safety advice reads.
'Close your windows and draw blinds, curtains or awnings early in the day to keep the heat out of your home.'

VWIHAF33GA_MD6N22UJ963NB16,Ron DeSantis uses FAKE Winston Churchill quote in final message to voters as he ends disastrous presidential campaign with epic gaffe,"Claudia Aoraha, Senior Reporter For Dailymail.Com","Published: 22:57 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 00:20 GMT, 22 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12989819/Ron-DeSantis-fake-Winston-Churchill-quote.html,"Ron DeSantis ended his campaign to become the GOP's presidential candidate by using a fake statement attributed to British wartime leader Winston Churchill.
The Florida Governor signed off his campaign with the quote: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,' underneath the video where he announced he was removing himself from the running.
But the motivational words, which he attributed to Churchill, where never actually used by the statesman and former UK Prime Minister, according to history experts.
The International Churchill Society's website states: 'We base this on careful research in the canon of fifty million words by and about Churchill, including all of his books, articles, speeches and papers.
The Florida Governor signed off his campaign with the quote: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,' underneath the video where he announced he was removing himself from the running
'We can find no attribution for either one of these, and you will find that they are broadly attributed to Winston Churchill. They are found nowhere in his canon.
'An almost equal number of sources found online credit these sayings to Abraham Lincoln—but we have found none that provides any attribution in the Lincoln Archives.'
Author Richard Langworth, who wrote on 11 books on Churchill and his life, also found no source for the quote.
DeSantis, widely considered the future of the Republican party and initially the favorite to take down Trump, announced he was suspending his campaign in a surprise video Sunday afternoon.
It followed mounting speculation that donors were fleeing and his campaign was struggling to find a path to make a dent in Trump's huge polling lead.
Trump said he was 'honored' by DeSantis' endorsement and called for Republicans to 'rally' behind the former president's 2024 White House bid.
Winston Churchill, the British wartime leader, never said the words that DeSantis attributed to him, experts say
DeSantis came second in the Iowa caucuses and largely avoided campaigning in New Hampshire so he could focus on South Carolina – the home state of 2024 candidate Nikki Haley.
But the writing was on the wall when the campaign fired half its staff, big-money backers were increasingly frustrated with his war on 'woke' and top brass were at each other's throats.
His final warning was for Republicans not to go 'back to yesteryear' and confirmed he would support Trump, the opponent who has mocked and humiliated him for the last year.
'We don't have a clear path to victory,' DeSantis said in the video posted to X announcing his departure from the race. 'Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.'
Now the Republican primary is down to a two-person race with only former President Trump and his once-United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley vying for the nomination.
DeSantis' launched his campaign in a disastrous Twitter Spaces event before CEO Elon Musk rebranded the website to X
The announcement of the end of his campaign was filmed in Florida, where it is now known he returned to after holding his last 2024 campaign event in South Carolina on Saturday.
DeSantis' campaign vehemently denied to DailyMail.com on Sunday rumors that he planned to drop out – but just hours later, the governor released a video on X ending his bid.
'Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,' DeSantis said in a four-and-a-half minute video on his exit from the campaign.
'Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward.
'If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it.
'But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources.'
The end of DeSantis' 2024 hopes ended much like how they began - on X.
DeSantis launched his campaign in a disastrous Twitter Spaces event before CEO Elon Musk rebranded the website to X.
Instead of starting off with the anticipated 'historic' social media announcement, the app experienced a series of glitches that wouldn't let the event kick-off.

2. 'Never, never, never give up.'
3. 'Time and money are largely interchangeable terms.'
4. 'Personally I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught.'

5. 'Vengeance is the most costly and dissipating of luxuries.'
6. 'Harsh laws are at times better than no laws at all.'
7. 'Everyone has his day, and some days last longer than others.'
8. 'It is not in our power to anticipate our destiny.'
9. 'Never give in—never, never, never, never, except to convictions of honour and good sense.'
1. 'If you're not a liberal when you're 25, you have no heart. If you're not a conservative by the time you're 35, you have no brain.'
2. 'Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.'
3. 'The hardest cross I have to bear is the Cross of Lorraine.'
4. 'You have enemies? Good. It means that you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.'
5.'If you wanted nothing done, Arthur Balfour was the best man for the task. There was no one equal to him.'
6. 'With integrity, nothing else counts. Without integrity, nothing else counts.'
7. ‘You make a living by what you get; you make a life by what you give.’
8. ‘Never quit Never, never, never quit!’

Scientists have known for years that 'Methuselah microbes', cells that have stayed dormant in permafrost for tens of thousands of years, carry the risk of propagating and spreading like wildfire if taken out of their icy confines.
But they have begun to warn that with 2023 being the warmest year on record - by a long way - since global records began in 1850, the risk of a deadly pandemic caused by zombie viruses is higher than ever, as more and more permafrost, which covers a quarter of the northern hemisphere, is melting.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) reports that the Arctic's average temperature has already risen at a rate three times higher than the global average, and is the region with the highest rate of average temperature change.
Jean-Michel Claverie, a geneticist at Aix-Marseille University in the south of France, told the Observer: 'The crucial point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark and lacks oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological material.
Scientists have known for years that 'Methuselah microbes', cells that have stayed dormant in permafrost for tens of thousands of years, carry the risk of propagating and spreading like wildfire
Increased shipping in the region, caused by global warming, may further release more ancient pathogens that are extremely difficult to fight
'You could put a yoghurt in permafrost and it might still be edible 50,000 years later.'
He said that the disappearance of Arctic sea ice, caused by global warming, posed a massive risk to human health.
'That is allowing increases in shipping, traffic and industrial development in Siberia. Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to drive vast holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and ores,' he told the newspaper.
'Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The effects could be calamitous.'
Scientists have long spoken out about the risk of introducing ancient pathogens to the modern world, saying that they may be extremely difficult to fight, given how different they are from modern pathogens.
Scientists say the disappearance of Arctic sea ice, caused by global warming, posed a massive risk to human health
Claverie, along with a team of other scientists, previously published research that showed that roughly one in a hundred ancient pathogens caused major disruptions to ecosystems.
Though the number seems small, the teams research claims that four sextillion cells escape permafrost every year at current rates.
'One percent of 4 sextillion is a number most people can’t even conceive. There’s so many, many opportunities for this to happen.
'The probability is rare for one individual virus, but there are so many potential viruses,' Corey Bradshaw, the Director of the Global Ecology Laboratory at Flinders University in Australia, previously told CNN.
Last year, scientists from Russia, Germany and France identified six ancient diseases trapped in permafrost that had the potential to wreak untold havoc on the world."

Aubrey Plaza, 39, and Maddie Ziegler, 21, were among the cast and crew on hand to help with the promotion by first stepping in front of the cameras for a round of promo photos.
The ladies braved the cold temperatures, which dropped into the 30s, and the snow in the Snyderville Basin, where the famed city is situated.
Once inside the venue, Plaza showed off her stylish all-black ensemble consisting of a minidress, sweater and matching stockings.
The former Parks And Recreation star also donned a pair of black sneakers, and had her dark brown tresses halfway pulled back.

Ziegler made her grand arrival in a blue denim outfit that included a skirt with an embroidery on the right side and a matching shoulder-less top.
The actress, who first gained recognition as a star of The Dance Moms reality series, also wore a pair of open-toe heels, and had her dark locks styled long, straight and flowing over over her chest and down her back with a center part.
Written and directed by Megan Park, My Old A** tells the story of Elliott Labrant (Maisy Stella), who has been advised by her future self not to fall in love. That is, until she meets the boy her older self warned her about, according to a premise in Wikipedia.

The announcement, confirmed in a statement, comes after a disappointing 18 months during which from the Florida Republican suffered several missteps.
Last week, the popular conservative was rejected by Iowa's Republican voters in favor of another Trump nod - a result that, while not unexpected, still stung for a campaign that sunk most of its resources into the state only to come up short.
It also left him uncomfortably close to a third-place finish following a campaign filled with gaffes - including viral videos of the governor laughing, and a decision to announce his bid on Twitter, before being met with glitches and technical problems.
The campaign has also hemorrhaged staff as well as donors, whom sources earlier in the day claimed had been put off by DeSantis's insistence to push against the woke.
In a video released Sunday, the 45-year-old conceded that he and his remaining staffers '[no longer] have a clear path to victory,' and are thus calling it quits.
Hours earlier, several current and former DeSantis staffers painted a bleak picture of the current state of his campaign.
One former adviser to a DeSantis super PAC told NBC News: 'When they decided to do the Twitter Spaces launch, maybe then at that point, I knew they were stupid.'
The once shiny and hopeful idea of a DeSantis campaign was at its peak in the weeks after his astounding 20-point win in the state of Florida in November 2022 - the presidential campaign never came together as well as it seemed like they might at that time
Now, days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where DeSantis is expected to come in third (of the three remaining candidates), former supporters are hoping for a quick end to the campaign
Despite the struggles, DeSantis - until Sunday afternoon - had maintained until the end that he was going to win Iowa.
He toured the whole of the state meeting with voters, and even earned the endorsement of both the state's very popular governor Kim Reynolds, as well influential evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats.
But his retail politics play, which has often been rewarded by Iowa voters, did not pay off for the 45-year-old father of three in the notorious purple state.
The New Hampshire primary, meanwhile, had been slated for this week - though DeSantis - who in recent months had bet big on Iowa - had all but ignored it.
'We haven't spent very much money here,' he told Fox News last week, before reports surfaced Sunday that the politician was mulling how to go about a graceful exit.
'Nikki Haley is spending an inordinate amount of money here,' he added at the time, before theorizing that Trump appeared to be benefitting from his big win in the battleground state.
That momentum, he conceded, looked to be poised to carry onto the next caucus stop in New Hampshire, where DeSantis would likely again placed behind not only Trump, but surprise runner-up Nikki Haley.
Not settling for third of three, DeSantis' team looked poised to instead focus on South Carolina, a state that loves Trump and where Haley served as a governor for six years, though those plans now look to be a thing of the past.
Likely making the decision after becoming faced with the abject reality that he cannot beat Trump, his only remaining hope - that something will knock the frontrunner out of contention - also appears to be a fool's errand.
Hours before his announcement - where he stoically told followers that he is 'suspending my campaign' - pne supporter told NBC that DeSantis, echoing statements he has long said publicly on the campaign trail, 'believes there are multiple scenarios where Trump wouldn’t be the nominee.'
But Trump is lively and charismatic - perhaps metrics in which DeSantis fell short.
However, at 77, he is also somewhat long in the tooth - a fact that had provided the Florida politico some semblance of hope, given his rival's candidacy, at least by comparison, was inherently risky and unpredictable.
More importantly, the former president also remains in serious, ongoing legal trouble - though, as the landslide result from Iowa last week suggests, that doesn't seem to be stopping him from snagging the nomination.
That said, due to the uniqueness of the situation - as well as the lack of precedent - a conviction in one of his five criminal cases could potentially stop him from accepting the nomination.
DeSantis, as a result, had painted himself as the strong alternative to the frontrunner if he, for some reason, becomes unavailable due to his legal woes.
Needless to say, it is not how things were supposed to shake out for the man who won the formerly purple state of Florida by 20 points in a 2022 reelection following a successful first-term, and seemed poised to give Trump a serious challenge.
DeSantis has gone head-to-head with Nikki Haley and eked out a win over her camp in Iowa, but whether he can beat her in her own home state of South Carolina remains to be seen

DeSantis, some speculate, is hanging on for now because of the potential that Trump could drop out due to unforeseen circumstances involving his age or legal troubles
One month after his unprecedented win in Florida, polls showed DeSantis beating both Trump and Biden in potential election cycle matchups.
At the time, support seemed to be waning for Trump after what had been another tough election cycle for Republicans - at least those outside the state of Florida.
DeSantis was positioned as the heir apparent to Trump's Republican party, but the odds that Trump was really going to back down never seemed very high.
There was a moment when DeSantis was eating into Trump's numbers so significantly, that a convincing argument could clearly be made, and was made to major backers, for his candidacy.
But he would wait another six months to officially declare his run for office. Momentum had already been lost, and a glitchy, underwhelming campaign rollout on Elon Musk's newly revamped Twitter spaces was a bad omen for what was to come.
'A total failure to launch,' is how one former DeSantis adviser described it.
'This thing blew up on the launch pad,' he continued. A fitting metaphor given the announcement was hosted by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who certainly has experience with such things.
It was not long after the messy May 2023 start that troubled brewed amid the ranks of the DeSantis campaign and super PAC.
Personality clashes would launch thousands process stories that became a central theme of the media's coverage of the DeSantis camp, and the fighting never really worked themselves out.
NBC reports that finances at both the DeSantis campaign and Never Back Down were mismanaged to varying degrees. But, poor decisions led to several cycles of boom and bust hiring and firing activity that became a highly reported bad look.
Ron and Casey DeSantis (left) put almost all of their campaign eggs into the Iowa basket, and came up tragically short
Trump, who DeSantis once looked like he may be a real threat to, is cruising toward the Republican nomination
And then came the money problems.
According to the NBC report, once momentum began to stall inside the campaign - which was almost immediately - DeSantis began struggling to directly fundraise for his team.
Notably, Citadel founder Ken Griffin, who had previously backed DeSantis' political efforts, edged away from the campaign reportedly due to the governor's focus on 'culture war' battles.
DeSantis tends to come down on the side of social conservatives, which may have been a problem for him during this primary cycle.
'Losing Ken was big,' a donor told NBC. 'And the bigger problem was it sent a signal to others.'
The day DeSantis put rumors about his exit to bed, morale at his HQ was reportedly as low as it had ever been.
Staffers said they weren't sure when the road will end for their fearless leader - telling the outlet they were hoping it would be sooner rather than later - and that came on Sunday.
'It’s done. He’s not going to win it. If you are serious about not wanting Trump to be the nominee, as much as it pains me to say this at this point, I think all the energy goes to Nikki Haley,' said one former Never Back Down, DeSantis's SuperPAC, operative.
'I’m just really tired of all the infighting.'"

The 12-year-old and two friends, aged 11 and 14, were grabbed and thrown into the back of a car last Wednesday in Erskine, 77km south of Perth.
The terrified boys were later dumped at a beach south of Mandurah after what one family believes was a targeted alleged attack.
'He was so terrified when he got home to his mum his legs were still shaking ... and that was a couple of hours later,' the 12-year-old boy's aunt Bianka Willder told 7News.
'My nephew, he ran for his life and he didn't want to get caught and he ran and they chased him down.'

Three teenagers have been charged after allegedly forcing three younger boys into their car and dumping them at Tims Thicket Beach (pictured)
The boys were at a sleepover on Wednesday night when they walked to a nearby service station for snacks.
The police said they were approached in a carpark by a group of males who accused them of trying to break into their car.
'They ended up chasing the boys down ... bashed one, chucked one in the car and my son was the last one to get chucked in the car,' the 12-year-old boy's stepfather Stephen Willder said.
The boys were driven 16km away to the other side of town and dumped at the isolated Tims Thicket Beach, which is only accessible by four-wheel-drive vehicles.
One of the boys had a phone and was able to call his family to pick them up.
The 12-year-old has not been able to sleep properly since the shocking incident.
'He is not himself, he is so withdrawn and he is terrified,' Ms Willder said.
'Don't take matters into your own hands.'
Three teenagers have been charged with three counts of deprivation of liberty and one count of aggravated assault.
Jak Brian Hefron and Connor Erik Whiting — both aged 19 — were granted bail with a $1,000 personal undertaking at Perth Magistrates Court on Friday.
They are set to return to court on March 1.

XHIOE84398_W5V5XG7VR3Z9NSG,Jacinta Nampijinpa Price blasts 'corporates' for shaming Aussies who celebrate Australia Day after Woolworths stopped selling merchandise,Padraig Collins For Daily Mail Australia,"Published: 05:38 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 10:37 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988245/Jacinta-Nampijinpa-Price-scathing-attack-Australia-Day.html,"Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has blasted 'corporates' for shaming Aussies who celebrate Australia Day as fallout continues over Woolworths decision not to sell merchandise.
The annual debate over the national holiday took a heated turn last week when Woolworths dumped all Australia Day merchandise from its stores, which prompted Liberal leader Peter Dutton to call for a boycott of the chain.
Mr Dutton's Coalition colleague Ms Nampijinpa Price told Sky News on Sunday that the public resents big businesses dictating to them.
'Australians are... more worried about the cost of living, they don't want to have deal with the corporates telling them... how to behave or think or feel about the country that they love,' she said.
'I mean this is home. They're sick of being shamed to be proud Australians.'
Ms Nampijinpa Price was among the most prominent Aboriginal opponents of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which was shot down in the October 14 referendum.
Coalition politician Jacinta Nampijinpa Price (pictured) has come out strongly in favour of Australia Day
Fellow No campaigner Warren Mundine agreed with Ms Price's sentiment arguing 'the reality is we've got so much to celebrate about this nation'.
'We are one of the incredible nations that brought 26 million people from around the world, multi-coloured, multi-cultural, multi-faith,' he said.
'We've got all these amazing people in this country who have come here and I'm proud they chose Australia, to really build this country into an amazing place ...
'We're probably the most successful multi-everything country in the world.'
Mr Mundine, however, held a different view on Australia Day just four months ago.
In September, he broke ranks with several No campaigners by calling for Australia Day to be moved from January 26 and treaties to be established with Indigenous Australians.
The former Labor political activist turned Liberal candidate also called for the recognition of Aboriginal land rights in an interview on ABC's Insiders.
'January 26 will always be an important day because of the fact that European countries came to Australia and set up the colonies here.
'We can't get away from that. But we can't become captive of it. We have to face the facts and move on.
'Yes, recognise history. Yes, recognise the invasion, recognise the good and bad that is in our history, but we still have to move on,' Mr Mundine said at the time.
In the official No case pamphlet sent to voters before the referendum on October 14, Coalition MPs warned that 'many activists are campaigning to abolish Australia Day, change our flag and other institutions and symbols important to Australians'.
It was revealed earlier this year that more than 80 local governments nationwide have pulled the plug on January 26 citizenship ceremonies.
Mr Mundine told Daily Mail Australia that political leaders on councils across Australia were taking the country in the wrong direction.
'We are building this bloody good country but all we get are these leadership people - especially in the Green councils - all they are doing is knocking the country,' he said.
Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said people are 'sick of being shamed to be proud Australians'. Two women wearing Australian flag bikinis are pictured
'(They say) ""we're a bunch of racists"" or ""we're a nation of uneducated idiots"" so I am just over it,' he said.
Mr Mundine called this the act of 'a mob of whingers who don't like Australians'.
'Let's just bugger all these whingers off, stop wasting all this money and start celebrating this country and fix things.
'I just want to get back to the real issues because we spend too much time on this'.
Venues across Australia are refusing to use the term 'Australia Day' - simply referring to events held this upcoming long weekend as 'public holiday' and 'public holiday eve'."

The Labour mayor brokered the 'exploratory partnership' deal with Fujitsu in December during a trade junket to Japan.
The trip saw him ride the country's bullet train and enjoy a Noel Gallagher gig in Osaka, according to photos on his Twitter account.
The deal between the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) and Fujitsu will look at ways it can harness the beleaguered firm's 'technical expertise' for the region's investment zone – a project set to provide £160 million of public funding to business schemes and create 32,000 jobs.
Mr Burnham and Bev Craig, leader of Manchester City Council, penned GMCA's Fujitsu deal during a meeting with Vivek Mahajan, the firm's chief technology officer, at its Tokyo HQ on December 8.
The trip saw Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham ride the country's bullet train and enjoy a Noel Gallagher gig in Osaka, according to photos on his Twitter account
The deal between the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) and Fujitsu will look at ways it can harness the beleaguered firm's 'technical expertise' for the region's investment zone – a project set to provide £160 million of public funding to business schemes and create 32,000 jobs
At the time, Mr Burnham praised the partnership as a 'massive boost' for the region's investment zone.The deal – which has been reported by UK Tech News and Manchester Mill – came just weeks before the broadcast of ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which reignited public anger over the scandal and heaped intense pressure on the Government to act.
Mr Burnham has said Post Office bosses treated people 'appallingly' and called for the Post Office to be stripped of its independent prosecution powers.
It is understood Fujitsu has yet to do any work as part of the partnership deal, which is not a contract and no public funds have been spent or earmarked by the GMCA for it. But the timing of the partnership could be seen by some as tone-deaf, as the firm remains under intense scrutiny over its role in the widest miscarriage of justice in British legal history.
More than 700 sub-postmasters were privately prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 after faults with Fujitsu's Horizon system used in branches made it look like money was missing.
Mr Burnham and Bev Craig, leader of Manchester City Council, (pictured) penned GMCA's Fujitsu deal during a meeting with Vivek Mahajan, the firm's chief technology officer, at its Tokyo HQ on December 8.
In a statement, Mr Burnham said: 'Fujitsu is a large, longstanding employer in Greater Manchester, and it is right that we work closely with them. Of course, the public inquiry is bringing new information into the public domain all the time and we will wait for its conclusions before taking any decisions.' This comes as the Bank of England and HMRC are among 21 public bodies to be asked by Treasury Committee MPs to reveal any details of contracts handed to Fujitsu since 2019, when the High Court ruled Horizon-related prosecutions were unjust.
MPs – who have asked for a reply within two weeks – want to know the value of any contracts with Fujitsu, whether there were considerations of supplier risk and whether steps were made to 'bar Fujitsu from bidding for contracts put out to tender'.
Since 2012, Fujitsu has won almost 200 public sector contracts worth a total of £6.8 billion, according to analysts Tussell.
Some 43 of those contracts are still in force, worth £3.6 billion, including the contract for the Post Office Horizon system, and several Government departments including the Home Office, the Foreign Office, Defra and the MoD.
Fujitsu did not respond to a request for comment."
XIY945INHA_DA2TA4ZNVCVDERM,EXCLUSIVEFrom a furniture giant Temple and Webster fighting 'colonisation' to flags at Woolworths supermarkets: Inside the 'Reconciliation Action Plans' sweeping corporate Australia - and the VERY awkward problem they expose,"Brittany Chain, Political Correspondent For Daily Mail Australia","Published: 13:31 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 22:17 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12976897/Corporate-Australia-Reconciliation-Action-Plans.html,"It is a popular online homewares and furniture store - but Temple & Webster has grand plans to advance the cause of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia.
The company - best known for selling the likes of rugs, couches and bathroom fixtures - has a mission to 'acknowledge and accept the past wrongs' of 'colonial Australia'.
It pledges to 'acknowledge and accept the colonial history associated with our history' and has committed to 'educating customers about First Nations culture and rights'.
That's according to company's 11-page Reconciliation Action Plan or 'RAP' - a document produced as part of a push by Australian corporations to 'increase economic equity and support self-determination' by Indigenous Australians.
In spite of this grand commitment, Temple and Webster has no idea if any Aboriginal employees are among their 194 staff.
'Currently, we are unaware of how many of our employees identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people... we will investigate culturally appropriate ways to build this understanding,' the RAP, signed by CEO and founder Adam McWhinney, reads.
And it's not alone.
Online furniture brand Temple and Webster have a company mission to 'acknowledge and accept the past wrongs' of 'colonial Australia'
The CEO of Reconciliation Australia is Karen Mundine, niece of famed anti-Voice campaigner Warren
David Jones, Colgate, T2, Princess Polly and Atlassian are all among dozens of household name corporations who have pledged their commitment to reconciliation via one of these RAPs - an initiative of Reconciliation Australia and Karen Mundine, niece of famed anti-Voice campaigner Warren.
Ms Mundine said in total there are more than 2,200 'corporate, government and not-for-profit organisations' within Australia and about three million employees 'that have taken goodwill and intention and transformed it into action' via one of these plans.
Yet some of these businesses and organisations have signed up despite not employing a single First Nations person.
Under the plan, some of these companies have committed to celebrating NAIDOC week, offer staff the option to 'swap out' public holidays like Australia Day and create mandatory education activities surrounding cultural sensitivities and practices like Acknowledgements of Country.
The National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA) is among those businesses to have pledged action under a RAP.
With alumni spanning the globe, including Cate Blanchett, Mel Gibson and Baz Luhrmann, NIDA says it has a responsibility to 'to support and amplify the First Nations workforce'.
The drama school noted in its own 13-page RAP that it is operating on unceded land.
'Sovereignty was never ceded. Always was, always will be, Aboriginal land,' the RAP states.
Recent Emmy winner Sarah Snook (left), Mel Gibson (centre) and Cate Blanchett (right) are all NIDA graduates
'We are committed to changing how we operate because it is the right thing to do. We are ready for truth-telling and rebuilding.'
Truth-telling is one of the three pillars of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The first was the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, overwhelmingly defeated in a referendum in October 2023.
The second pillar is a Makarrata Commission, designed to explore treaty and truth-telling options within Australia. National funding via the federal government has been set aside to establish the Commission, but after the crushing Voice defeat it remains unclear whether the government will proceed.
NIDA's RAP was last submitted in August 2023 - ahead of the vote. At the time, they employed 161 part and full-time staff. Four identified as First Nations, along with 13 of the 297 students enrolled.
David Jones has also created a RAP. CEO Scott Fyfe also acknlowedged in it that the department store 'operates on the unceded lands of First Nations peoples'.
'Traditional Custodians have inspired and cared for Country for more than 60,000 years. The world’s oldest department store has much to learn from the world’s oldest living cultures,' he said.
Of David Jones' 6,664 employees, 24 identify as Indigenous to Australia.
The Voice was defeated on the back of a campaign by Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Warren Mundine
Woolworths had pledged, as part of their RAP, to displaying Aboriginal flags out the front of stores around the country. It's understood that is actually no longer the plan for 2024 - and that a flag has instead been placed at one behind-the-scenes facility
The department store also noted in the Reconciliation Action Plan that it supports the Uluru Statement from the Heart.
Airbnb’s Country Manager for Australia, Susan Wheeldon, signed off on her brand's commitment to 'developing and implementing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment, retention and professional development strategy' in 2024 after acknowledging they 'do not currently employ' any First Nations people.

She said in her action plan: 'To Airbnb, a reconciled Australia is a country where everyone feels they can belong, people are free of racism, are respected, treated equally and can freely pursue their life goals.
'We invite our community to embrace a shared history and recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and heritage as a proud part of our shared national identity.'
Eco-brand Atlassian has a similar goal.
Despite publicly backing the Voice to Parliament and being a champion for the Yes vote, of the 3,500 Atlassian staff in Australia, the founders acknowledged as part of their 2023 RAP the 'number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff who have self-identified is unknown'.
It is understood there are Indigenous people on staff at Atlassian, but this is not yet something they've tracked as part of their headcount.
Few of the RAPs commit to tangible targets that customers and everyday Australians outside of the business are able to track.
However Colgate has committed to contributing 'a percentage of product proceeds to help fund First Nations community partner programs' as part of the RAP they created in 2023.
Of 380 staff, two identify as First Nations, and Colgate says: 'We understand that for First Nations peoples, their voices aren’t being heard to the extent they should be.'
'We seek to increase representation of underrepresented people across all organisational levels.'
Similarly, Woolworths had pledged, as part of their RAP, to displaying Aboriginal flags out the front of stores.
The company has since backed away from the proposal, with a spokeswoman saying they were only planning to put flags up where they already fly the Australian flag.
'We don’t plan to add flags outside our supermarkets.
Despite publicly backing the Voice to Parliament and being a champion for the Yes vote, of the 3,500 staff at tech giant Atlassian in Australia, the founders acknowledged as part of their 2023 RAP the 'number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff who have self-identified is unknown'. Pictured are co-founder Scott Farquhar and his wife Kim Jackson
'The specific statement refers to displaying the flags ‘where practicable’. The locations deemed practicable are those where the Australian flag is already flown.
Meanwhile at Temple and Webster, the goals for 2024 and 2025 begin within.
This year, the company aims to 'communicate our commitment to reconciliation to all staff' and increase internal knowledge and understanding of certain cultural protocols - such as a Welcome to Country and Acknlowledgement of Country.
The company also hopes to establish First Nations representation.
'At Temple & Webster, we don’t just believe in equality, diversity and respect – we live it through our intentions, actions and words – and have done so since day one,' CEO Mr McWhinney says."

'Maybe one day he'll just laugh about his adventures, he likes to tell a good story.'
Local patrols, SES members and drones will all continue their search throughout the day on Sunday, police said.
'Any of the locals that are around, we would appeal to you that if you see anything please can you contact the police,' Ms Cantell said.

XXC00VA9Z2_677QVV5745S0S0Q,Bizarre allergy behind 11-year-old girl's debilitating skin condition,Freddy Pawle For Daily Mail Australia,"Published: 05:07 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 10:16 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12988231/Bizarre-allergy-11-year-old-girls-debilitating-skin-condition.html,"A mother has opened up about her young daughter's debilitating skin condition and allergies to her tears and sweat.
Summah Williams, 11, was recently hospitalised in Brisbane after breaking out in a painful rash that her mother Karyn Zimny thought was just a sunburn.
After going on antibiotics for a staph infection, Summah's skin from her head to her toes shed 'like a snake'.
The dancer was diagnosed with an extreme case of eczema causing her skin to become dry, itchy and easily irritated as well as being allergic to her tears and sweat.
While eczema can usually be treated through regular moisturising and steroid creams, Summah's case is so severe that she's receiving experimental treatment.
A young girl diagnosed with extreme eczema, Summah Williams, has also received a devastating blow of also being told she is allergic to her own tears and sweat (pictured)
Ms Zimny said her daughter's condition has led to people staring at her on the street during a flare up.
'People look at Summah when we go to the shops, and during this flare, everywhere we went, people thought she was sunburned,' Ms Zimny told 7News.
Summah's rare allergy leaves her with puffy 'panda eyes' whenever she cries.
It is also seriously affecting her love for dancing as when she sweats her skin will start to flare up and become irritated.
'When she looks at all her other dance friends, she gets upset and asks, ‘Why can’t I have skin like them?’ It’s heartbreaking,' Ms Zimny said.
There is no known cure for eczema, which mostly affects children aged between six and 12.
There is also no known cause of the skin condition, however it is believed it can be passed on genetically.
The 11-year-old (pictured) has to contend with the debilitating condition to pursue her love for dancing, with her sweat causing her eczema to flare and become worse
Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, occurs when the top layer of skin doesn't properly maintain moisture
It causes skin to become dry, itchy, rough, and more prone to infections and inflammation (redness)
The condition can 'flare' and cause symptoms to become worse
Flares can be caused by general skin irritants but can also occur randomly

Eczema effects up to 30 per cent of children and 10 per cent of adults across Australia, according to Eczema Support Australia.
While the condition causes near-constant irritation and pain, sufferers have also been shown to be contending with more far reaching affects.
'Compared to the general public, those living with eczema are 44 per cent more likely to have insomnia, 41 per cent more likely to have anxiety and 79 per cent more likely to have depression,' Eczema Support Australia's website reads.
The organisation's managing direction, Melanie Funk said the combination of discomfort and social isolation was extremely harmful.
'Being excluded socially due to lack of awareness and judgement of appearance plus the prolonged, severe, sleep deprivation and ongoing discomfort, all take their toll,' Ms Funk said."

Video footage showed two enormous explosions at the Novatek plant in Ust-Luga port in Leningrad region, triggering a raging inferno at the site, which sits just 81 miles from St. Petersburg.
A Ukrainian official separately claimed that drones had hit the Shcheglovsky Val defence enterprise in Tula, which produces the Pantsir-S and Pantsir-S1 air defence missile systems used to defend key sites including Vladimir Putin's palaces.
There were also Ukrainian strikes on Smolensk, Oryol and Bryansk regions provoking engagements with Russian air defences in one of Kyiv's most intense nights of the war in targeting military-linked targets inside Russia.
Massive fireballs were seen rising through the air at the strategically important Ust-Luga site, which in 2022 processed almost 7 million tons of gas products, a major export product that added an estimated €5.29 billion to Putin's war chest from sales to the EU alone.

Fire was seen rising up into the air following the attack
Local media outlets reported that drones struck the Novatek facility at 3:20am local time, though Russia's defence ministry has not yet reported any attacks.
Novatek's Ust-Luga processes gas condensate, which itself is a processed version of LNG, and turns it into products including jet fuel, gasoil, and naphtha, and ships them across the world.
Some 150 people were evacuated from the Kremlin-linked Novatek natural gas terminal, which sits some 550 miles from the nearest Ukrainian border.
'The plant is located in the coastal zone, next to a specialised terminal where products and gas condensate itself are loaded onto ships and sent for export. At the time of the explosion, three large tankers were at the berths, which arrived in Ust-Luga from Belgium, Oman and Libya,' reported the pro-war Two Majors Telegram channel.
'There are no reported casualties as a result of a fire at Novatek's terminal in the port of Ust-Luga,' said Leningrad region governor Alexander Drozdenko.

'The personnel were evacuated. A high alert regime has been introduced in the Kingisepp district.'
Locals reported two drones in the sky ahead of the strike on the Novatek facility.
They headed towards St Petersburg before changing direction to target the Ust-Luga complex.
An eyewitness said: '****ing hell, I've just witnessed an explosion. Something serious [happened] there.'
Another video recorded an exchange saying: 'Kolya, why did you decide it was a drone? Did you see it?'
The missile plant in Tula, meanwhile, is some 200 miles from the Ukrainian border.
Footage showed at least one giant explosion at what was reported to be the key Russian defence facility.
Russia claimed to have downed a drone but footage showed a clear explosion on the ground.
Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko posted: 'In Tula, according to local residents, there was a powerful visit to the Shcheglovsky Val defence enterprise, which produces the Pantsir-S and Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile systems, and also modernises various armoured vehicles.'
The scale and nature of any damage was not initially clear.
Western officials believe that Putin's invasion of Ukraine may take up to 30 years to recover from, given how much money is being spent on the military."

The bodies of Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, and his two children were found by police at  a home in Costessey on Friday alongside the body of a woman, 36, who has not yet been identified.
The female died as a result of multiple stab wounds to the neck while the man, who was named locally as the father-of-two, suffered a single stab wound, police said.
Post-mortem examinations on the two girls, identified as Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, and her seven-year-old sister, will be carried out on Wednesday.
It comes after it was revealed police officers ignored a 999 call from the address one hour before the bodies were discovered. Police are continuing to probe the deaths and confirmed they are 'not looking for anyone else'.

Norfolk Police earlier confirmed they had received a call from a man at the address at 6am but officers did not attend.
Police were only sent to the house after receiving a second call at 7am from a member of the public, who was concerned about the people inside. The four injured bodies were discovered when police broke in at 7.15am.
As a result, Norfolk Police confirmed that it had referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC).
The force said a separate IOPC referral had already been made over their involvement with the family on December 14, when Mr Kuczynski was reported to have gone missing and was later found wandering nearby.
The married father worked as an engineer in the property trade and had lived in England for the past 20 years. He graduated from Wroclaw University of Technology in Poland.
Officers said the 36-year-old woman found dead 'was visiting and didn’t live at the property'.

Mr Kuczynski's Thai-born wife Nanthaka had reportedly not been seen by neighbours for months and it is understood her sister recently moved into the family home to help look after them.
Third-party involvement in the deaths have been ruled out by police.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said this evening: 'Following this latest development we remain satisfied no one else was involved in this incident.
'This latest information will only add to the distress and shock felt by members of the local community and it's why, from the outset, we've been determined to carry out detailed and methodical enquiries to make sure we fully understand how this incident has happened.
'I would like to thank the community for their support and for the many people who have called offering information. We continue to work through this and will get back to everyone who has been in touch.'
He added that a police cordon remains in place at the scene and there will be a continued police presence in the residential area tomorrow."

A 15-year-old boy suffered a head injury while cliff jumping at Warriewood Blowhole on Sydney's Northern Beaches on Sunday.
He was stranded in the cave below the spot popular with teenage thrill-seekers as huge waves battered against the rocks.
Dramatic footage of the incident showed two of the injured boy's friends attempting to reach him before a 16-year-old surf lifesaver named Saskia Rundle-Trowbridge battled pounding swell to help bring all three back to safety on Warriewood Beach.

'The waves were pretty big, especially when I was coming in,' Saskia told 9News.
'I got blown up against the rocks and the cord of my rescue tube was stuck on a rock.'
Saskia told the ABC her 'one mission was to get these boys to safety, make sure they were okay'.
'My whole team, my driver, and the rest of the team on the beach with the radios, they were amazing,' she added.
'We go into this volunteer service just to do that sort of thing, keep the beach safe and keep the people safe. That's the goal, just to keep everyone safe.'
It is just one of over 3,000 rescues hero Surf Life Savers have performed on Australia's coastline this summer.
It comes as new data reveals that adults rather than children are most at risk of drowning during the school holidays.
Surf Life Saving Australia CEO Adam Weir suggested this is because social-media obsessed adults are seeking out isolated spots to take pictures and getting into trouble.

'People want to be where they see on social media: they are looking for that perfect photo, wanting to be on that isolated sandy beach,' Mr Weir told the Sydney Morning Herald.
'Over summer I've seen a number of articles showing the 'top 10 beaches to visit', but a number were unpatrolled.
'We are pushing people to go to these beautiful places, but we need to consider the water risks.'
All 54 drownings in Australia last summer occurred at locations not patrolled by lifeguards or volunteers.
While drownings increased across all age groups during the school holidays, the rise was most prominent in adults, according to the research published by Surf Life Saving Australia in the international journal Injury Prevention last week.
A desire to visit isolated spots to take the 'perfect photo' for social media is leading to a rise in adult drowning deaths, according to the country's top surf life saver
Since the start of this summer, there have been 33 coastal drowning deaths, compared to 26 by this time in the 2023 season
'Risk for children was consistent throughout the year, whereas it was adults where we saw an increase in risk around school holidays,' Surf Life Saving Australia researcher and study co-author Dr Jaz Lawes told the paper.
A person attempting to rescue someone else before drowning themselves accounted for the second-highest number of deaths.
'There is a sad trend of adults drowning when going in to rescue a loved one, and that does often happen at unpatrolled beaches,' Dr Amy Peden, UNSW injury prevention researcher, said.
On January 6, father-of-six Michael Sneddon drowned at Ettalong Beach on the Central Coast while attempting to save his ten-year-old son after they both got stuck in a rip.
Mr Weir called for better information campaigns and greater use of drone technology in isolated areas.
Since the start of this summer, there have been 33 coastal drowning deaths, compared to 26 by this time in the 2023 season."

Therapist says trend could help people cope with sudden grief because it lets you 'continue like they're still alive',Maria Okanrende For Mailonline,"Published: 15:15 GMT, 21 January 2024 | Updated: 15:24 GMT, 21 January 2024",20240121,dailymail.co.uk,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12980237/Why-people-text-loved-ones-Therapist-loss.html,"Some people text their loved ones after they've passed away as a helpful coping mechanism, a therapist has revealed.
Therapist Dr Sheri Jacobson, an Oxford University graduate and founder of Harley Therapy, revealed that texting someone after they've died can be a helpful to soothe the finality of the 'abrupt' loss.
She also says reaching out is human nature, that we are creatures of habit and so would prefer to 'continue our actions from the time they were alive'.
So say many mourners, including the grieved parents of 17-year-old Charlie Cosser who was stabbed to death at an end-of-term party last July.
Such is the pain of Martin and Tara Cosser that they continued to send a WhatsApp message each morning to their son Charlie's phone after he died.

Tara said: 'I just send him a message saying I love him with a couple of hearts.
'It is just a simple message. Of course, nothing comes back. I just don't want to be scrolling down on my phone to find his name'.
Famously 90210 star Brian Austin Green, 50, revealed in 2019 that he also turned to the trend following the death of his ex co-star Luke Perry of a massive stroke the same year.
The actor, and ex beau of Megan Fox said he texted his late pal 'hoping, that he would text me back, or that he was out there somewhere'.
Similarly, Ruth Murray, from Minneapolis, continued to message her sibling Mike Murray, 37, after he passed away unexpectedly in March 2019.
She repeatedly sent him texts to say how much she missed him - but was shocked to receive a reply from a woman who had been assigned his old number.
She said her brother passed away from a heroin overdose and so she decided to message him in order to help her work through her grief.

Dr Sheri has revealed five ways to stop texting a loved one once they gave died.
Cold turkey
The expert said you can try setting a date for when you will send your last text message and send it as an 'ending message'.
Planned reduction
Dr Sheri said: 'If you prefer to phase them out then you can gradually reduce the frequency until they naturally taper'.
Substitution
The expert said you might want to think of a different action which you could swap with texting.
She listed activities like watering a plant or doing a two-minute breathing exercise. 'Instead of texting, you will be left with a pleasant, nurturing habit' she added.
Add self-care elements
She said of self-care tips: This will differ greatly from person to person and your psychological state.
'Try small treats like solo walks, time in nature, indulging in a good book or film, or whatever you can focus.
Reach out for professional help
She concluded by advising that you reach out to a helping hand following the loss of someone dear.
'Besides individual therapy, local bereavement groups can be very helpful as they additionally incorporate social support'.
Accountability
Dr Sheri said: 'If you share your goal with someone close to you, you might be more likely to work towards that end of texting, given there is a witness and support'.
Assisted method
She advised speaking with a therapist to allow you the chance to discuss the significance of messaging to you.
She also said one can work with you in tailored ways to find out how to move forward.
Dr Sheri has also provided healthy tips to help you navigate your grief:
Honour your feelings as they arise
The therapist explained that grief can be more complicated than you first anticipate. If you try to suppress your emotions, they are likely to come out in other ways.
She added: 'Do try to acknowledge what you are going through. It may not be pleasant, but it is natural'.
Soften your appraoch
The expert suggested softening your approach, and to allow yourself room to grieve instead of being too hard on yourself.
Try talking to yourself as you would a friend. She said: 'Allow in the messiness that grief can bring, including the difficult thoughts you are having'.

Connect with others
She explained: 'This may or may not include talking about your loved one. Although you may not feel up to socialising, the social support can be very valuable in facilitating healing'
Although not the response she was expecting, she was thankful to receive a reply from the woman, who had offered to be a personal 'sounding board'.
So why else do we text our loved ones after they've passed away? And how can this behaviour be rationalised?
Dr Sheri explained: 'It usually takes a long time for us to adjust to the death of a loved one. Sometimes we continue our actions from the time they were alive.
'This is partly because we are habit-forming in nature and continue doing the things that we are accustomed to. It's also partly a way of staying connected to that individual.
'It can be a helpful coping mechanism since it can be a bridge to the other individual and help to ease our abrupt sense of loss. If in particular, the content of the writing is about how you are feeling, it could be cathartic in itself and a form of self-soothing'.
While it would perhaps be insensitive to to try and regulate how one grieves following a loss, the expert revealed that it forms part of a larger grieving process, and it shouldn't last forever.
She said: 'We go through various stages of grief - such as shock, denial, bargaining, anger, depression, acceptance - in different ways and sometimes we spend longer in one period.
'However gradually we work towards a place of acceptance and integration where we are not stuck in our grief. It's possible that texting could be an ongoing way to commemorate that person and our relationship, in a similar way to visiting a grave.
'There is general acceptance that grave visits can be ongoing, and texting could be seen in a similar light, though a relatively recent method in human history'.
She went on to add that the texting should never be excessive or interfere with your daily life.
She concluded: 'Ideally you will feel that you feel you have moved on with life, whilst still retaining the memory or them and their legacy'."

Defence Secretary Grant Shapps today lambasted Netanyahu's 'disappointing' rejection of a Palestinian state as part of any post-war plan for Gaza.
Thousands of people demonstrated in central Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling for the return of hostages held in Gaza and early elections to oust Mr Netanyahu, who rules at the head of a coalition containing far-right nationalists.
He has has vowed to press ahead with the offensive in Gaza for many months despite mounting pressure on Israel to rein in its military action as the scale of death and destruction intensifies.
Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Shapps said: 'Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security. Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution.

Thousands of people demonstrated in central Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling for the return of hostages held in Gaza and early elections to oust Mr Netanyahu, who rules at the head of a coalition containing far-right nationalists.
'Now, you'll get a lot of different views within the Israeli government, of course, it is a rainbow coalition.
'So we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country.'
Mr Shapps had earlier told Sky News the UK 'certainly remains wedded to' a two-state solution and that there 'isn't another option'.
Demonstrators marched through Tel Aviv's Habima Square last night, a frequent protest site, with some carrying signs calling Netanyahu 'the face of evil' and demanding 'elections now'.
Protesters demanding the return of hostages also gathered in Haifa and outside the premier's Jerusalem residence.
Netanyahu is under intense pressure to secure the return of the hostages seized by Hamas on October 7, with the militant group on Monday announcing the deaths of two more of its captives.
Avi Lulu Shamriz, the father of Alon Shamriz, a hostage mistakenly killed by Israeli troops earlier in the war, told AFP in Tel Aviv Netanyahu's war cabinet was heading for disaster.
'The way we're going, all the hostages are going to die. It's not too late to free them,' he said.
Yesterday shadow Foreign Secretary David  Lammy said he backs US calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state when the war in the Middle East ends, and branded Mr Netanyahu's opposition to the plans 'unacceptable'.
He said the Israeli prime minister's position would mean 'occupation and siege continues' in Gaza, where the Palestinian death toll is approaching 25,000, according to local health authorities."

The Chancellor said he would emulate Nigel Lawson whose tax-cutting policies helped Margaret Thatcher to a third election win.
Forecasts of how much leeway he is likely to have to deliver on Rishi Sunak's pledge to slash taxes further will arrive this week.
The independent Office for Budget Responsibility could give him from £6billion to £10billion of extra headroom against his fiscal targets, reports suggest.
The Prime Minister has said that there will be 'more to come' on taxes following a national insurance cut in the Autumn Statement.
This had been underpinned by a Treasury assessment that the government was on track to meet its debt rule with £13bn headroom.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has pledged further tax cuts, as suggestions emerged that he would have more fiscal headroom than expected
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that there will be 'more to come' on taxes as the UK enters an election year
The Spring Budget takes place on March 6, with an expectation that there will be movement on taxes to mollify restive Tory MPs fearful of losing their seats.
Analysts at Capital Economics told the Financial Times that the cost of government borrowing is expected to go down, boosting Mr Hunt and raising the headroom ceiling to at least £19bn.
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the paper that it was 'plausible' that the headroom could grow by £10billion but also pointed to indications of economic uncertainty.
Mr Hunt will be able to pledge tax cuts using the bonus as long as he meets his fiscal targets to cut debt as a share of GDP over the course of a Parliament. He told The Mail on Sunday he wanted to 'relieve pressure on families' and would stick to the plan of 'prioritising tax cuts'.
Mr Hunt vowed to take inspiration from the late Conservative chancellor Mr Lawson, who slashed personal taxation which led to the Big Bang in financial markets. 'Just as Nigel Lawson positioned the City of London for the finance boom in the 1980s, this period of Conservative government has seen the UK positioned for the massive technological boom we're set to see in the coming years,' wrote Mr Hunt.
'The most dynamic economies tend to be places with lower taxes. The lesson is clear: supporting businesses with competitive taxes – not more government spending – is the way to growth.

'We Conservatives have always known that, of course but it is worth remembering.
'The plan is working. That's why we need to stick to it. It means cutting taxes, not raising them.'
The UK is at the forefront of a tech boom, said Mr Hunt, with hopes that investment in financial technology, health research and semiconductor development will propel the economy.
It is not clear what form tax cuts will take. However the Prime Minister and Chancellor are keen to grow the economy, indicating that further cuts to national insurance or income tax are likely as opposed to targeting inheritance tax or stamp duty.
Mr Hunt may also hold a second giveaway Budget in the autumn before a November general election.
In his article, he wrote of 'brimming with confidence about the fundamental strengths of the economy'. He called the UK a country that is 'really going places, despite the blows of a pandemic and Putin's energy shock'.
Ahead of the last Spring Budget before the next election, the Treasury and No 10 have discussed how to ensure any tax cuts have the maximum impact on voters.
'The problem last time was that it was seen as a pre-election bribe,' one strategist told The Times. 'This time we're going to sell it differently, tying it to the broader argument this is about growth.'"

Last year, the actress, 39, was said to be 'frustrated' when the professional dancer, 33, was unable to get home during the final six weeks of Strictly Come Dancing, despite being voted out in week three with partner Nikita Kanda.
Gorka has now signed up as a judge on the Spanish version of Strictly, Bailando con las Estrellas, which will see him spend a lot of time in Madrid for filming.
As the Spanish dancer jets across Europe for his new role, Gemma has been caring for their daughter Mia, four, and son Thiago, six months, with a source telling The Mirror she has 'effectively raising two kids by herself.'
The insider added: Gemma knows how important Gorka's work is to him and goes above and beyond to be supportive but she found it challenging when he wasn't able to travel back to Man­­chester to spend time with her and the kids, even when he'd been voted off last year's series.'

On his new role on Spanish Strictly, they added: 'Gemma knows he's just wanting to support his family, but it's ­disappointing for her. It's a really rough patch for them.
'Gemma was focusing on the end of the series as the end point – but the judging role was too good an opportunity to miss. As with any couple, the longer they're apart, the more tension there is between them.'
MailOnline has contacted Gemma and Gorka's representatives for comment.
Gorka confirmed his new job on Instagram last week, sharing: 'I finally can share the news that I will be one of the judges in the Spanish version of Strictly, Bailando con las Estrellas @bailandoest.
'So excited to [be] back in Spain and doing the show that changed my whole life and excited to be sat on the other side of the floor this time even if I am not sure I will be able to hold myself and not dance.
'First show is this Saturday (13.01.24) and I can't wait.'
Gemma was quick to show her support in the comments section, writing: 'Woohoo! So proud and so excited to watch (if I can figure out the Spanish tele).'
Last month, Gemma shared her reaction after Gorka returned home from Strictly.
She wrote: 'After 3 and a half weeks he’s home! I've well and truly handed them over. Bye hun. Mum's off for sit down. @gorka_marquez!'
Last year, the actress, 39, was said to be 'frustrated' when the professional dancer, 33, was unable to get home during the final six weeks of Strictly Come Dancing

Gorka had been away preparing for the Strictly final after his appearance on the show was cut short due to his exit in week two.
It came after Gemma spoke about how Gorka needs to be 'passionate' with his Strictly partners in order to score highly - as she rubbished the show's curse.
Gemma, who welcomed her second child in July, spoke about the importance of a connection between the dancers and how they needed 'chemistry.'
A former contestant herself back in 2017, she told The Metro: 'I remember when I had to dance the rumba with Aljaž.
'Everyone said, 'You have to look into his eyes and get close,' and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is awful! But the dance looked rubbish because I didn't do it.
'So then I remember saying to Helen [Skelton], 'You've got to be passionate with Gorka, that's part of the dance.' I'm always rooting for them to have chemistry!'
When asked if she has any 'anxiety' when Gorka, 33, is away, she defiantly said no and joked that she only cared where he was based so he could help her with the school run after rehearsals.
She added: 'I think if we were together all day, every day, 24/7, we'd probably hate it. It's been like that for our whole relationship, so I guess it probably works because of that, we don't know any different, really.'
