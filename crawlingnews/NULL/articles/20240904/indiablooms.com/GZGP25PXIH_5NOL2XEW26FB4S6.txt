Prime Minister Modi was received by Brunei’s Minister of Religious Affairs Pehin Dato Ustaz Haji Awang Badaruddin.
"Brunei’s Minister of Health Dato Dr. Haji Mohammad Isham was also in attendance. A gathering of Indian community members were also present to greet the Prime Minister," read a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs.
The mosque is named after Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei (father of the current Sultan, who also initiated its construction), and was completed in 1958.
