On Saturday night, a nurse, on her night shift duty at the Illambazar Health Center in Birbhum, was allegedly molested by a patient.
According to reports, the accused, who was brought to the health center for treatment, touched the nurse inappropriately while she was administering him with saline.
The nurse alleged that the patient molested her while being attended to in the emergency department.
The accused was even accompanied by his family members at the time of the incident.
"The male patient misbehaved with me and touched me inappropriately in my private parts while I was just following the doctor's instructions. He also hurled verbal abuses at me," the nurse was quoted as saying by NDTV.
"Such incidents occur due to a lack of security. Otherwise, how can a patient dare to do such a thing to someone on duty in the presence of his family members who do nothing to stop him," she said.
The incident triggered tension at the health center, which prompted hospital authorities to contact the police.
Cops arrested the accused after arriving at the scene.
The incident comes at a time when massive protests are being held in Kolkata and rest of the state over the horrific rape and murder of the young doctor At RG Kar Hospital while she was on her night duty earlier this month.
The Mamata Banerjee-led government is facing protests and flak over its handling of the crime.
