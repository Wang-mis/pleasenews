061ZDY1O9T_NMG3URF6ZOEZ8D3,Ram temple and a quest for resolutions,Dr Rakesh Sinha,"Updated: January 22, 2024 13:55 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-temple-ayodhya-quest-resolutions-9120304/,"The inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22 is more than a religious event. It carries with it the civilisational character of the country for posterity. It is not an end itself but a means to proclaim the progressive message of a commitment to faith that is not premised on “otherness”. The movement to restore the Janmaboomi was neither a battle against any religion nor an effort to re-prosecute history. It was to proclaim the commitment to the culture that has shaped Hindus’ worldview. Lord Ram is not a god that gives, one to whom people go with wishes and aspirations but a deity who personifies ideals of life. He is a non-sectarian icon and represents those virtues considered essential for the uplift of the soul, a harmonious social order and inclusive welfarism for the people. It is these virtues that allow him to transcend the limits of time, geography and religious philosophies.
It is for these reasons that the battle to reclaim his birthplace has been fought by his devotees for five centuries.
Earlier, too, the Somnath temple was reconstructed after Bharat’s independence. But there is a world of difference between the two reconstructions. The first one was carried out largely through political and cultural elites, often enmeshed with the Indian state. There was a limited debate on ideas, even from opponents led by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The masses were an audience in the celebration. The Ram temple movement involved the common masses of all religions and sects, who participated in the ideas and had aspirations to regain the land and rebuild the temple. The movement was not a prisoner of political or cultural elites. In the process, everything under the sun was debated and the present generation can now understand the value of Bharat’s cultural exceptionalism in a world where there is a “clash of civilisations”.
The movement to restore Ram Janmbhoomi saw an ideological opposition that denounced it as an attack on the liberal-secular values of India. These arguments were relegated to the realm of the polemical as archaeological evidence and other historical sources failed the critics. Moreover, they wanted to discover the nation’s past without endorsing its culture, traditions and spirituality.
The limits of which aspects of India’s past glory and philosophy could and would be celebrated have been determined by the West – whether from an Orientalist or post-colonial lens. This not only circumscribed the nation’s autonomy to rediscover its past but also its capability to reproduce its civilisation.
Today, we see no ideological attack against the temple inauguration. There is only dissent by those sections of the political class that subscribe to an outdated idea of secularism. This ideological stream cherishes European modernity and has tried to redefine India civilisationally, disconnected from its culture. Like Russian czar Peter the Great, they belong neither to their home nor to the West.
The reproduction of civilisation does not exclusively depend on people’s aspirations and commitment to their culture. The role of the state is also vital. Many civilisations declined when the state denied legitimate space to culture and spirituality, and measured progress only through material measures.
During the freedom struggle, the Indian National Congress did not include a civilisational reproduction of Bharat and borrowed the Western idea of the nation-state. In the eight colonial-era census reports between 1872 to 1941, there is a clear concern about the slow rate of conversion of Hindus, indicating that religious conversion was part of the “civilising mission”. The colonisers tried to present the diversity among Hindus as competing identities. Congress – with the exception of some leaders like B G Tilak, Lajpat Rai, B C Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh — ignored this cultural aggression. The party did not pass a single resolution against it. Further, Partition was not merely due to the religious and political situation between the Hindus and Muslims. Demographic changes contributed substantially to the communal ideology. Hindus saw no change under the Nehruvian state in terms of the colonial cultural climate.
All these constituted Hindu anxieties and led to an apologist mindset. The success of the RSS, from the leadership of K B Hedgewar to Mohan Bhagwat, lies in addressing these Hindu anxieties. How could the RSS exceptionalism become a reality? Other Hindu organisations, movements and leaders – including the Hindu Mahasabha and V D Savarkar – argued that only by politically consolidating their majority status could Hindus’ identity and existence be safeguarded. This was a theory of domination. The RSS, on the other hand, has been Hinduising Hindus since 1925, who have been divided along caste, creed and have an enforced amnesia about their own greatness. It has tried to free them from sectarianism, orthodoxy and isolationism by investing huge human resources. This is not a majoritarian ambition but a Hindu renaissance.
Movements for cultural revival have been plagued by feudalism and capitalism. This creates plebeians and patricians and eventually sabotages a civilisation’s continuity. The state plays an important role here. Narendra Modi’s social and economic philosophy has made the state more moral. Aggressive poverty alleviation measures, along with his emotional connection with the marginalised are unique, in India and the world. He is committed and consistent in word and deed. PM Modi also enjoys enormous moral power beyond his office. His intervention has removed the danger of the emergence of cultural plebeians and patricians.
His spiritual positioning has uniquely impacted the psychology of people. The Ram temple is not the only example of this. In 2017, he unveiled a 112-foot-tall Adiyogi Shiva statue in Coimbatore. He succeeded in getting space for a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi, an Islamic society, in 2018. There’s also the renovation of the Kashi Vishwanath temple 2021.
All of this highlights the fundamental difference between the two most significant leaders of Modern Bharat, Nehru and Modi. Both are unapologetic about their worldviews. Nehru did not hide his attachment to Western values. His was a case of enlightened subjugation. On the issue of the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, he wrote to chief ministers on August 1, 1951, pointing out that “It is little realised here what great injuries to our credit abroad is done by the communal organisations of India because they represent just the things which a Western mind dislikes intensely and cannot understand. The recent inauguration of the Somnath temple with pomp and ceremony created a very bad impression abroad about India and her professions.”
Neither Somnath temple nor Ram temple denies space to non-Hindus nor does secular space shrink due to them. The Modi era is a quest for resolutions. The PM attends ceremonies, performs rituals and proactively integrates himself with Hindu spirituality. In ancient Bharat, the most iconic kings were those who lived with dharma. The political class in post-independent Bharat earned more from the Machiavellian idea of deluding the people by showing artificial sympathy to religions. Modi demolished this political cynicism, which was based on religious appeasement. The journey from Somnath to Ayodhya has shown that cultural continuity is unaffected by aggression, physical or ideological.
The Ram temple also establishes that the decolonisation of minds and ideas is a cultural and spiritual process.
Till today, the decolonisation of postcolonial societies, especially Bharat, was dependent on discourses generated in the West. They critiqued the West’s domination but wanted erstwhile colonies integrated with Western modernity. This contradictory approach has failed. The construction of the Ram temple involves generations, millions of people as well as the courts and intellectuals. It unfolds with the spirit of decolonisation and inclusiveness. The next step is to ensure social unity.

Those denying this are deluded or trying to make a political point as Rahul Gandhi is doing on his new yatra. A clip he posted on social media has him saying that nobody has the right to tell you how to worship, what to eat or how to live. He is right but if his political instincts were stronger, he would know that he is out of touch with the national mood. Personally, I have learned never to go against the box office.
This is why I have said before that the temple is now a reality and that it should become a symbol of renewal and reconciliation. I have also warned against the dangers of religion becoming a political ideology and pointed to the ruin this has brought in countries like Pakistan and Iran. It is possible to say both these things. But trolls on social media see complex issues only in black and white and so I have been charged with, among other things, being confused and changing my mind out of sycophancy.
On the eve of the consecration of Ram’s new temple, I would like to warn against Hindu triumphalism once again. This is becoming stridently evident and increasingly farcical. One political lowlife, known to be close to the Home Minister, went to the extent of posting a picture of Khan Market decked in saffron flags and sneeringly tweeted that people like me would now probably boycott Khan Market in future. I use this example because the barb was directed my way but there are thousands of examples of Hindu triumphalism on social media and some of it comes from people ‘proud to be followed by Narendra Modi’. When he is done with the consecration ceremony, the Prime Minister would do well to openly condemn Hindutva triumphalism. It is destroying any chance of the temple becoming a symbol of hope and renewal.
There is something else I want to draw attention to today. I did an interview with V S Naipaul soon after the Babri Masjid was torn down in which he said that he was not that horrified by what had happened. Babar was no friend of India, he said, and would have built the mosque out of contempt so if nemesis caught up with him a few centuries later, nobody should complain. This interview has been posted on my timeline many times in recent days but without reminding people of what Naipaul said immediately after.
He said that the idea of taking political revenge made no sense and that after a cultural death, a true revival comes about only when you accept that the past is truly dead. “People feel continuity is what they are expressing, but the renaissance doesn’t come about by people trying to pretend that the past is still going on. The renaissance comes when people accept that the past is over. I think this is where I would probably part company with the political position of the BJP.” Wise words that need to be remembered in this moment when Ram could become the symbol of a much-needed Indian renaissance.
For far too long far too many Indians have lived in a sort of dark age in which for some the only thing that has mattered is religious revivalism entwined deeply with a hatred of Muslims. For those of more leftist bent the only thing that has mattered is a twisted form of casteism in which those belonging to castes oppressed for centuries now believe that it is time to take revenge on those they believe are privileged. Having recently been a victim of this second lot I want to reiterate that hating the upper castes is also a form of casteism.
It is our misfortune that political leaders on all sides of the divide have exploited the basest emotions in voters in the hope of winning elections. Hatred, fanaticism, bigotry usually define the mood of the nation in an election year and there is every chance that this could happen once more as the general election draws near. When the election is over there will be the usual attempts to try and bring peace and harmony but one reason why there has never been an Indian renaissance is because it is impossible to put the bad stuff back into the bottle once it is unleashed.
If the temple is to become a ‘national temple’ as some politicians have been saying, then there is a chance that there could finally come the possibilities of an Indian renaissance. It is something that will help India emerge from a long period of darkness in which people have been distracted from their real problems by reminding them constantly of divisions of caste, creed, and community. It is these basest of emotions and the constant idea of taking revenge politically for historical wounds that have held India back. All our political parties and all our political leaders are guilty of having done this again and again.
It is time for all of them to reflect on the harm they have done and repent. It is a shame that so many opposition leaders refused to attend tomorrow’s consecration. It was an opportunity lost. I shall end with Vidia Naipaul’s excellent advice: a renaissance will only happen when the past is seen to be ‘truly dead.’"
0ZACGQ91VP_G2LNM7YRJVT0IQY,"Military Digest | First Republic Day: Changes that took place in Indian military after January 26, 1950",Man Aman Singh Chhina,"Updated: January 22, 2024 08:28 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/first-republic-day-indian-military-january-26-1950-9119916/,"On January 26, 1950, many important changes took place in the Indian military. With the country becoming a Republic, the associations with the British Crown were severed and a new India began its democratic journey with a fresh beginning.
New oath for armed forces
One of the foremost changes which took place with effect from January 26 was the new oath or affirmation for the personnel of the armed forces. Directions were issued by the Ministry of Defence that the oath or affirmation would be administered to all personnel present at units, stations, and ships during a parade held for the purpose on the morning of January 26.
The new form of Oath replaced “I…………do swear in the name of God” with “I……..solemnly affirm”. The reference to God was removed and the oath was now taken swearing allegiance to the President of India instead of the King of the United Kingdom.
Institution of new gallantry awards
It was also on January 26, 1950, that the new gallantry awards came into effect. Thus, gallant actions deserving a medal which preceded that date and took place after August 15, 1947, were retrospectively awarded these medals.
Three new awards for gallantry in combat with an external enemy and one for gallantry in law and order situations within the country were instituted by the President of the Indian Republic on January 26, 1950. They were designated as Param Vir Chakra (PVC), Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), Vir Chakra (VrC), and Ashoka Chakra (AC).
While the design of PVC, MVC, and VrC was elaborated in the official notification on January 26, 1950, the design of Ashoka Chakra was not specified as the details were still being worked out.
New order of precedence of wearing medals
Another key change that took place on January 26, 1950, was how medals were to be worn by the recipients of uniformed services. The medals awarded after Independence got precedence over those awarded under British rule.
A notification stated the new gallantry decorations awarded by the Republic of India were to be the first in order of precedence for wearing medals by the Defence Services with effect from January 26, 1950. Campaign medals to be instituted on or after January 26, 1950, came next. Commemorative medals like the Independence Medal awarded on August 15, 1947, were to follow Campaign Medals. State medals and Commonwealth awards were to come last.
New rank in IAF
Immediately after the first Republic Day, in February 1950, a notification was issued that a new rank of Master Warrant Officer (MWO) had been established in the Indian Air Force (IAF). The names of the first batch of substantive Warrant Officers of the IAF, who had been appointed to the new rank of MWOs, were announced by Air Headquarters.
The names of 12 MWOs were announced on February 14, 1950.
The rank of MWO was to be reckoned as the highest non-commissioned rank in the IAF and, for purposes of status, an MWO was to be equivalent to a Junior Commissioned Officer in the Army. The rank-braid of an MWO at the time consisted of a commissioned pilot officer’s shoulder or sleeve stripe, superimposed by a Warrant Officer badge.
Honourary ranks in defence services
In April 1950, a notification was issued regarding new rules for honorary ranks in the defence services to ensure uniformity.
“Hitherto, mostly ruling princes were entitled to honorary ranks in the Army, Navy and Air Force for contributing to India’s war effort or supplying contingents for active service with units of the Indian Army. Now such ranks are open to all Indian nationals who have rendered service of a high order to the Indian Republic and have done signal service to the country’s Armed Forces or taken a special interest in fostering their development,” the notification said.
At the time, the Nizam of Hyderabad was an honorary General in the Indian Army and the Maharajas of Kashmir, Gwalior, Jaipur, Bikaner, and Patiala were Lieutenant Generals. Similarly, the Nawab of Bhopal was an honorary Air Vice-Marshal in the Air Force and a Major General in the Army, and the Maharaja of Bhavnagar was an honorary Commodore in the Navy."

“Our OPD will function as usual. The holiday is only for the administrative staff and for offices at the B J Medical College. The medical staff in the OPD, ICU and emergency wards of Sassoon Hospital will work as usual,” Vinayak Kale, dean of Sassoon Hospital and B J Medical College told The Indian Express. Every day, at least 3,000 patients are examined at the out-patient department of Sassoon hospital.
Similarly, the YCM hospital run by the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will also remain open on Monday. ”We get around 2,500 patients at our general OPD and two patients at the emergency OPD. Both the OPDs will remain open,” said Dr Rajendra Wable, dean of YCM Hospital and Medical College.
In all, Pune has 26 government, civic, rural and sub-district hospitals. ”OPDs at all government, rural, sub-district and civic hospitals will operate like any other day. The OPD at the Aundh general hospital will also remain open,” said Nagnath Yempalle, civil surgeon at the government-run Aundh hospital.
Officials said in Maharashtra, the government had in the past made it a norm that no government or civic-run hospital OPDs can stay shut for two consecutive days to avoid inconvenience to patients.
”This government norm has been in existence for long. We never take holidays on two consecutive days. Since on Sundays, the general OPD will remain shut, we cannot keep it shut again on Monday as this will affect patients,” said Dr Wable. Similar views were expressed by the Sassoon dean.
Dr Wable said operations planned on Monday have been postponed by a day. ”But all emergency surgeries will take place at YCM hospital. Doctors and nurses in the OPDs and other wards will be on duty as usual,” he said. The Sassoon hospital has taken a similar stand."

You may not have before last Friday, when Katrina Kaif–Vijay Sethupathi’s Merry Christmas released– the same day when you might have also witnessed something unusual: Sriram Raghavan turning truly, deeply, romantic.
The filmmaker’s latest thriller opened to largely positive reviews, with people appreciating his slow-burn turn and Sriram’s magical ability to cook an appetizing film about two strangers meeting one lonely night in nostalgia-dipped Bombay. People love and live in Merry Christmas, but this is a Sriram Raghavan film, so they also die. Murder is anticipated, betrayal is expected.

Edited excerpts:

What’s with the cat in Merry Christmas? There was also one in Andhadhun. Am I missing more from your films?
No it is just these two. I love cats, I used to have a cat myself. In Merry Christmas, I just wanted the beginning to have things we don’t see often or don’t use. So, the post box, a cat sitting on top of it, someone scrawled ‘Merry Christmas’ on a wall, basically to give you a feeling that you are in a real and yet unreal place.
Did you watch the film first or read the book?
The book. If I watch the film based on a book, then I am never going to make my version because I feel someone has already gone through that adventure. Book is a movie in your head. When I read the book, I thought it was so tender. It is a beautiful French novel–I read a translation of course–but many things are different. I could visusalise the potential of a film while I was reading it; two people who meet each other one night. I read the book and then I came to know there is a film available, but we had already begun ours.
The movie is called Paris Pick-Up?
Yes. The culture is different there, so the context is more like what would be today a Tinder date. But Merry Christmas goes back in time, in a different era altogether, a time of innocence.
What about the book jumped at you?
It is a very slim novella and I got hooked right from the first line of the book: How old does a man have to be to not feel like an orphan when his mother is dead?  It is unlike a thriller, more about a person’s angst.
Vijay’s character does mention about the pain of loss when Katrina and him are walking back from the cinema hall…
Yes and there is a simple shot when he is lying on his mother’s bed and her specs are there, hopefully it evokes something in people when they see that shot. I read the book in 2016. I have a copy right here with me. (Sriram then opens the drawer and shows the book, which is full of markings made with pencils, pens, paragraphs highlighted, tiny notes mentioned in the pages to remember the important points). I read it before Andhadhun.
The film is not set in Pune–where your last two films were set–but Mumbai, why?
I was initially thinking to set it in Pune, it is my city and I love it. But because of COVID restrictions, nobody was willing to open their doors with regards to locations. On top of that, to go with a unit and the possibility of somebody falling sick… We thought Goa and Kolkata as well, because Christmas is celebrated there in a grand way. Eventually because of convenience we chose Mumbai, but it is also a city I have grown up in and I love it. The pre Mumbai Bombay was beautiful, only the Maruti car had just come so the streets were not populated, there were no cars blocking everything. Which is why I wanted to back to that era.


A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif)
It is a deeply romantic film; did you begin writing it with that intention?
Actually no, and that’s the funny part. Initially I thought this is a thriller and let me just focus on the thriller aspect of it. But there is a big reveal in the film, which can only happen in a movie. It is plausible, but not commonly done. To kill someone, then do this elaborate planning, execution… I thought this is a dangerous thing I am doing. This is not a thriller, I have to focus on the characters. Once you start focusing on that, they assume a life of their own. That became the focus.
Many years ago when I had started the film, I wanted it to be a 90-minute film without an interval. But then I also felt, there will be a lot of conversations in the film, like in Before Sunrise and the entire trilogy. There is a French filmmaker, Eric Rohmer, who I have thanked in the film, he also makes films about ordinary people talking but they are so watchable. Many people here may not have the patience to watch his films, but I have seen many of them in the Film Institute and I also have a t-shirt! That’s when the focus started shifting, about people, conversations and of course, falling in love.
Where do the names of Katrina and Vijay’s characters come from?
So usually, we pull of stunts of naming our characters popular character names. Here there is a character called Rosie, to hint at that unfaithful wife thing but at the end of the day we thought let’s keep it simple- Maria and Albert, the former I think is the name in the book also.


A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif)
Where did the teddy bear come from? It is a stunning imagery– a lady with her daughter walks alone at night holding a teddy bear.
I don’t know if this is there in the book. But it came pretty early in the scripts. There is a scene in the cinema hall when the kid wants to use the restroom and wants to lug the bear, but the mother requests the man to look after it. It is an ice-breaker between them, when she comes back and he tells her the teddy bear tried to run away. I just loved the imagery as you mentioned. If you notice, the bear actually grows in size!
Vijay’s character jokes about that as well!
There is no reason for that, people may think it is a continuity error! This is thought out, but not analytical. There was one review which mentioned that the growing teddy represents Maria and the kids’ growing woes. It was a wonderful theory, but I didn’t think of it that way.
Which scene was the hardest to crack?
The flashback one, where she demonstrates what happened, how that was done. Initially there was a proper scene– the guy gets up, there is a scuffle, which we also shot. But I thought this was not required. Because if you see, the film they watched together was Pinocchio, so there was a theme of lies and falsehoods running all through. So when she says, ‘This is what he did, this is what happened’, you have to take her word. Vijay is a stranger, and we wanted viewers to be him. Do you believe her when she is narrating a story? That’s what we wanted.
When Katrina and Vijay start opening up about their lives at her house, it was a very Ittefaq moment– two strangers in a strange situation sharing this intimacy.
Yes that’s what the intention was. When I was chatting with Thiyagarajan Kumararaja (director of Super Deluxe) and narrating him the story, he was the one who gave me the idea to make the film in Tamil also. If you look at the larger picture, she takes him home, they have a drink, they go out and come back. But then we said what if we use real time here, like she would put the kid to bed, they will have a drink, start chatting and keep talking for 15-20 minutes. We thought it would be a good challenge to do this in real-time. It was part of the design.
What was the direction to Katrina? She remains mysterious, you do find her fishy but are unable to pin point what exactly she is up to.
When I gave her a narration and the book to read, she just fell in love with the story. After that it was just fairly simple, where she waa adding her bits. I told her that whatever you say, people will have to take it in face value. Whether they believe your character or don’t. In thrillers and especially coming from me now, the lingering feeling is, ‘There is something more to this.’ I was hoping the viewers would speculate and start writing their own scripts in their heads.
Sanjay Kapoor’s character is a truly funny guy. How did you develop that part?
It was a lot of fun to work with him. The line where he says, ‘Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyu Aata Hai?’ That was a movie of that time! He was very participative throughout. Of course, the ring and other touches were in the final script, but it is not in the book.


A post shared by Matchbox Pictures (@matchboxpix)
At what point does the book end?
When Albert says he will not burn the wallet but give it to the church. Then he goes home and while opening the door he realises that he still has the wallet. When he goes to the church, the cops are waiting for him. They see where he is going and watch him put the wallet in the lost and found box. It was not cinematic.
Can you talk about the climax and the decision to have no dialogues in it?
We had the scene with dialogues! The climax is different from the book. The book ends somewhere else, and very tamely. It was not cinematic enough for me to use. So I knew I had to crack the end. In our script, we had dialogues, including this line which is not there anymore when the cop says: ‘Either I have witnessed a miracle on Christmas day, or you have been lying all through.’ And then hell starts breaking lose and whatever you deduce from the end happens.
Four days or a week before the shoot, we had our work ready, with dialogues in Hindi and Tamil. Suddenly from the South team (Thiyagarajan Kumararaja’s team), they were writing the Tamil dialogues and giving major ideas for the film, I got feedback: What if we go dialogue-less in the end? For a second, I thought this was incredible and it indeed was. It is not like I shot the scene with the background music on set. The idea was that there would no dialogues and no music as well!
It is an old police station, so the scene would have the sound of the ceiling fan, swinging doors, typewriter. But my editor Pooja (Ladha Surti), who was also the co-writer of the film and was on set, asked me to come and check when she got the material. In my head, I thought the music will start at the last shot, just when the title comes. But when I saw what she had done, I was blown away.
The background score is straight from a 70s Hindi film.  Even the soundtrack has an unusual combo: Pritam and Varun Grover.
Daniel B George is someone I have worked with since Johnny Gaddaar and Pooja also has great music sense. It is fantastic what Daniel scored. With Pritam, I had met him by chance and wanted to narrate the story to him. He is also from FTII and we have known each other for very long. He just loved the story and told me he will do music for the film. I thought Varun and Pritam will be an interesting mix. Varun was already doing something with Matchbox, so it worked it.

It meant that the wait was finally over,” says Nivedita R Nathoo, the vice president of the Mauritius branch of a group called the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, a group affiliated with the party.
One and a half years later, the Indian diaspora will be commemorating the consecration of the Ram temple on January 22. But perhaps non-resident Indians in a few countries will be celebrating the grand event in a form similar to that being witnessed in Mauritius.
The Mauritius government has approved a request by several Hindu socio-cultural and socio-religious organisations to grant a two-hour break on January 22 to allow devotees to participate in prayers and ritualistic ceremonies that are being held in temples across the country, in addition to the various cultural and religious programmes. The Hindu Council of Mauritius has organised a cultural programme to mark the consecration in Vacoas-Phoenix town, where Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth will be the chief guest.
Large display screens have also been set up inside the premises of temples, as well as in the centre of towns and cities by the municipality administration where the consecration will broadcast live from Ayodhya.
Let us rejoice as Shri Ram returns to Ayodhya. May his blessings and teachings continue to light our way towards peace and prosperity. Jai Hind! Jai Mauritius!#ShriRamBhajan

“The Arya Samaj headquarters has given us orders to decorate all Arya Samaj temples in the country. We will hold a yajna (sacred fire) in each temple and we will also recite the Valmiki Ramayan. We will also hold lectures on Lord Ram’s life and values and we will light oil lamps in Arya temples to welcome the deity on January 23,” says Dr Vedbhushan Chummun, vice president of the Arya Sabha of Mauritius, a religious organisation associated with the Arya Samaj.
This support for the Ram Mandir in Mauritius should not come as a surprise, says Ajay Kumar Dubey, professor, School of International Studies at JNU. More than 68 per cent of the island nation’s population are people of Indian origin. “The first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, adopted a policy of active disassociation with the Indian diaspora, saying they were foreign nationals and were of little concern to the Indian government. But he made an exception for Mauritius,” says Prof. Dubey.
There have been several socio-cultural reasons behind this. “The diaspora had retained its language, culture, and religion, far more effectively than any other Indian diasporic group because there was no indigenous population,” he says. Mauritius was uninhabited till the 10th century and human settlements developed there only after colonial conquests by Western powers over the subsequent years.
“Mauritius has also almost always had an Indian-led government since its independence in 1968. There are a lot of strong bilateral relations between India and Mauritius in many fields and very good people-to-people relations. So much so that in 1962, during the Indo-China war, the Indians in Mauritius dragged the Chinese out of their homes and beat them when India suffered losses,” he adds.
On the diplomatic front, Mauritius has never opposed India in any multilateral forum like the UN as well. The cultural connection between the two countries is visible in the fact that two major global institutions — the World Hindi Secretariat and the World Bhojpuri Secretariat — are based there. In 1999, the governments of India and Mauritius jointly set up these two international organisations to connect citizens of countries where Hindi and Bhojpuri were the first or customary languages, and where a significant percentage of the population consists of speakers of these languages and have an affiliation with Indian culture due to their origins. Therefore, when the Ram Janmabhoomi movement started in India, its impact was witnessed in Mauritius as well, says Prof. Dubey.
According to the 2011 census in Mauritius, approximately 48 percent of the population is Hindu. According to the Central Statics Office of the Mauritius government, Hinduism is the most practised faith in the country.
The migration of indentured labour to Mauritius is a lesser-known part of the history of global slavery and that of Indian migration. But it is also a story about how the Ramayana and the worship of Ram as a deity travelled across the seas.
Between 1830 and 1860, the British, French, and Portuguese, during the colonisation of the Indian subcontinent, prohibited slavery that was implemented by several acts under their domains. But slavery was only replaced with another form of bonded servitude, euphemistically termed ‘indentured labour’ or ‘Girmitiya’, where poor farmers were duped and exploited and sent to work in sugar and rubber plantations owned by colonial powers in the Caribbean, Fiji, Réunion, Natal, Mauritius, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, etc, where descendants of indentured labourers continue to live. In Mauritius, the first ship of indentured labourers arrived in 1834 at Aapravasi Ghat. Between 1834-1920, approximately half a million people arrived in Mauritius at this port to work as indentured labourers according to figures by UNESCO.
“When our ancestors started coming to Mauritius in 1834, they faced so many difficulties because of physical work in the sugar field. When they came here, they only had the Ramayana in their bags of personal belongings which they brought to Mauritius. I am the fifth generation of indentured labourers and I am proud of them. Because of them, my children and I know a lot about Ram and we worship him,” says Kritilata Ram, president of GOPIO Triolet, an international non-governmental organisation founded in 1989, that works to connect and support people of Indian origin around the world in remaining connected with the heritage and culture of their place of origin- India or the Indian subcontinent before 1947.
Since most indentured labourers came from the United Provinces — modern-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — where the worship of Ram and the Ramayana and other associated texts were important, they took these religious beliefs and practices with them when they settled in the plantations.
“Our ancestors had difficult lives. The only moment of respite was when they sat together and read the Ramayana in the baithak and we call them baitka,” says Nathoo. “So the Ramayana has supported the Hindu people of Mauritius in their difficult journey. I think that is why we are so connected with Ramayana and India and it was what kept us connected.”
Growing up, Nathoo would hear stories of the Ram Mandir but only understood why people in Mauritius considered it to be important when she grew older. Last year, in March, she travelled to Ayodhya carrying water from the Ganga Talao, a large crater lake in Mauritius that is considered by the Hindu community to be holy and symbolises a connection with the holy Ganga river in India.
This week, groups of people will also perform the Chowtal inside temples. “Usually Chowtal is performed only during Holi and Diwali, but this week, there will be special performances for the Ram Mandir,” says Professor Mohurlall Chummun, a lecturer of music at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in Mauritius. Chowtal is a form of folk music from the Bhojpur region and was one of the music styles that indentured labourers took with them when they settled in colonial plantations far away from their homeland.
“During Holi and Diwali, we have Chowtal performances, where we will take verses from the Ramcharitmanas or Ramayana. It is prevalent in Bihar even today. People will use a jhaal, which is like the manjira but slightly bigger, and they sit in a circle and sing, accompanied by a dholak,” says Professor Chummun.
While many people of Indian origin in Mauritius have wanted to travel to Ayodhya to watch the consecration in person, only a group of 20 musicians have succeeded. These musicians will be performing the Chowtal in Ayodhya on January 23, as well as in a few other Indian cities, including New Delhi. “We had won a major Ramayana chanting competition in Mauritius where we had to recite one to two chaupai within 12-15 minutes. It is judged based on sur, taal, music, and presentation. We had told our government’s Ministry of Arts and Culture that the winner of the competition in 2022 should be allowed to perform in India,” says Vikash Anghnoo, who is a part of the Roche Bois Vandana Group that has travelled from Mauritius to perform.
“We had been scheduled to come in 2023, but it just so happened that we got a chance to travel only this week, so we are now performing for the consecration events. In Ayodhya, we will perform dohe and chaupai from the Sundarkand and some Ram bhajan. We are devotees of Lord Ram, so I feel that the goal of my life is fulfilled. We do Ram paath every week, so it is a big blessing for us that we can participate in this consecration,” says Anghnoo.
Many citizens have been making plans to visit Ayodhya in the coming weeks, says Prof. Chummum, who is hoping to travel to India next month. The difficulties in securing entry permits and coordinating travel plans amidst such high security have made it difficult for people in Mauritius to travel specifically for January 22, Mauritians say.
“Mauritius means Ram bhakti (faith), Ram gaan (religious song) and Ram paath (prayer). This is a proud moment for us. When the Girmitya came to Mauritius, they brought only the Ramayan with them, so we consider Mauritius to be a country of Ramayan. That is why all religious organisations as well as children and adults, are all waiting for Lord Ram. While flying kites on Makar Sankranti, we wrote Lord Ram’s name on each kite, as well,” says Shivpoojan Lalbeeharry, general secretary of the Mauritius Sanatan Dharma Temples Federation, which oversees 347 temples in the country.
On Tuesday, Nathoo, along with her father, Pandit Rajgoorooh Ramsarah will be watching the consecration being broadcast live in Mauritius.
“If you are away from India, you hang onto your traditions and culture more. I have Indian friends and they don’t know about Indian culture like we do here. In Mauritius, every Hindu child, and every adult knows about and grew up listening to the Ramayana. We know that if we don’t do that, our children will lose their culture. They won’t remember where we come from and who we are. I think that is one of the reasons why this is so important for us,” she says."
60HHKWW56C_CZ9YNQTEBHIHXHZ,"How Ramayana became popular outside India, from east Asia to the Caribbean",Yashee,"Updated: January 25, 2024 11:48 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/how-ramayana-became-popular-outside-india-9119917/,"The Ramayana has been popular in India for millennia, as text in Sanskrit and many other languages, as folk theatre, as puppet shows, and as countless kathas or oral retellings organised in villages and small towns. However, the epic enjoys popularity much beyond Indian shores, and the spread of the Ramayana is also testimony to how Indians travelled across the world — as prosperous traders, as preachers, and as bonded labourers.
In this article, we look at two broad periods of the spread of Ram’s story: the first few centuries of the common era, when it reached countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, China, Tibet etc., and the 19th century, when it gained popularity in parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and Oceania.
As Santosh N Desai, then Assistant Professor of Asian History and Religion at St John’s University, New York, wrote in 1969, the Ramayana travelled from India to the rest of Asia in “the early centuries of the Christian era” along three routes, “by land, the northern route took the story from the Punjab and Kashmir into China, Tibet, and East Turkestan; by sea, the southern route carried the story from Gujarat and South India into Java, Sumatra, and Malaya; and again by land, the eastern route delivered the story from Bengal into Burma, Thailand, and Laos. Vietnam and Cambodia obtained their stories partly from Java and partly from India via the eastern route.”
Why were Indians travelling to this region “in the early centuries of the Christian era”? Mainly for trade, in spices, gold, and aromatic wood. Many stayed back there, either because they married local women or got jobs.
Historian Karmveer Singh, in a research paper titled, ‘Cultural dimensions of India-Thailand relations: A historical perspective’ (2022), writes that the traders brought with them “Indian religion, culture, traditions and philosophy”. “They were also accompanied by Brahmin priests, Buddhist monks, scholars and adventurers and all of them played an important role in the transmission of Indian culture to the natives of Southeast Asia.”
Over time, the Ramayana became an integral part of the culture of many of these countries. In Thailand, the Ayutthaya kingdom (1351 to 767) is believed to have been based on the Ayodhya of the Ramayana. A UNESCO article on the the city of Ayutthaya says, “When the capital of the restored kingdom was moved downstream and a new city built at Bangkok, there was a conscious attempt to recreate the urban template and architectural form of Ayutthaya…to emulate the perfection of the mythical city of Ayodhaya.”
In Cambodia, the Angkor Wat temple complex, built in the 12th century, features murals from the Ramayana, and was originally a temple dedicated to Vishnu.
How it survives in the region today
Even today, the Ramayana remains an important part of the culture of many of these Southeast Asian countries, though the dominant religions range here from Buddhism (for eg. Cambodia, Laos) to Islam (Malaysia, Indonesia).
The Ramakien, a version of the Ramayana, is Thailand’s national epic. The current king belongs to the Chakri dynasty, whose rulers are all named after Ram. Vajiralongkorn, the current constitutional monarch, is styled Rama X. In Laos too, the story of Phra Ram is the national epic.
Of course, in all these countries, the story of Ram has undergone various changes. Also, the inspiration for their versions of Ram’s tale are not necessarily the Valmiki Ramayana. For example, in the countries where the story was popularised by traders from south India, it bears more similarity to the Tamil epic Kamban Ramayana. The late scholar AK Ramanujan wrote, “ It has been convincingly shown that the eighteenth-century Thai Ramakien owes much to the Tamil epic. For instance, the names of many characters in the Thai work are not Sanskrit names, but clearly Tamil names.”
Some differences that these tales of Ram have from the Indian epic are: in Cambodia’s Reamker, a mermaid princess Suvannamaccha falls in love with Lord Hanuman; in Java, the Javanese deity Dhayana and his sons become part of the story; the Malaysian Hikayat Seri Rama is more sympathetic to Ravana (Maharaja Wana); while in Laos, “Phra Ram is considered a previous incarnation of Gautama Buddha…Hapmanasouane, the Lao Ravana, is considered the previous incarnation of Mara, the demon that tried to impede the Buddha’s ascent to enlightenment,” according to an article published by the University of Washington’s Center for Southeast Asia and its Diasporas.
In all these countries, the story has been kept alive through plays, dance dramas, puppet shows, etc.
Desai writes, “Generally the stories derived from the northern strand of legends emphasise the nobility and greatness of Rama. The versions based on the southern legends, on the other hand, depict Ravana as a hero and praise his scholarship.”
A major current that took the Ramayana to Africa, the Caribbean, etc. was the girmitiya migration outside India in the 19th century. After slavery was abolished, there was an urgent demand for labourers who could work on plantations earlier serviced through slave labour. Waves upon waves of men and women were sent out from British India as indentured labourers to countries like Fiji, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, etc. The word ‘girmitiya’ comes from ‘agreement’, which these people signed (or were made to sign) to work in the plantations.
Majority of these girmitiya labourers were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. While they could not carry much as they boarded ships towards an entirely new life, they did carry their culture and religion along, and a large part of this culture was Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas, written in Awadhi and arguably the most popular religious text in North India.
How it survived
The girmitiyas were not rich traders likely to influence kings, but there is a more personal element in how they remembered and preserved the tale of Ram. In an alien land, far away from their homes which they had left to flee either poverty or caste oppression or some form of social boycott, the Ramcharitmanas became a source of succour, of nostalgia, the symbol of a homeland more real than the actual home.
Author VS Naipaul, born in Trinidad to a family descended from indentured labourers, wrote, “The other where Gandhi and Nehru and the others operated was historical and real. The India from which we had come was impossibly remote, almost as imaginary as the land of the Ramayana, our Hindu epic.”
British historian Clem Seecharan, born in Guyana in a girmitiya family, wrote that for his forefathers, “The Ramayana…was constructed as an authentic representation of the motherland. The real eastern UP and western Bihar disappeared from the radar.”
He also explains that the “India of the Ramayana endured”, “because it is a narrative that answered many of the monumental, urgent needs of the girmitiyas”.
“The theme of Lord Rama in exile in the Dandak forest is resonant among Indians in the diaspora. His triumphal return to Ayodhya has a freshness… It is an evocation of hope and renewal, even of their own triumphal return, however illusory.”
He also writes about what Sita meant to girmitiya women. “…the Sita persona spoke to women who were in virtual exile, had severed all links with their families in India, had to endure aspersions cast on their sexual life on the plantations (occasionally ending in murder by jealous partners), while toiling to reshape a life and recreate a family in a distant land.”
Today, in many of these countries, the folk theatre of Ramleela is still popular. In 2017, on Ram Navmi, India gave Mauritian Rupee 8,376,000 to expand and renovate the Ramayana Centre complex in Mauritius. In Fiji, the Ramayana has been translated into the indigenous iTaukei language."

Fourteen people – 12 students and two teachers – died in the tragedy at Harni Lake in Vadodara city on Thursday.
The division bench of the High Court, comprising Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha Mayee, took suo motu notice of the matter in an order dated January 19. The order was made available on Sunday. The High Court took note of the incident after Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association president Brijesh Trivedi brought the incident-related news items to the notice of the court on Friday.
In its order, the division bench stated, “This whole incident has shocked the conscience of the public in general. We call upon the Secretary, Home Department, State of Gujarat, to submit an action taken report in the matter along with an affidavit of the Gazetted Officer from the Home Department, Government of Gujarat, by the next date fixed.”
Before passing the order, the bench stated that Trivedi had mentioned the news items related to the incident. “The said newspaper reports are taken on record. It is reported that the incident occurred at around 4:45 p.m. The boat was carrying 27 people on board when it capsized. It is further reported that the boat had the capacity to seat only 16 persons. It is also reported that there were several people; other teachers and students, who have witnessed the said accident of the boat being capsized in the lake. The newspaper reports further indicate that the said boating is managed by one firm – Fun Time Arena, under the contract given by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation under the PPP model. The newspaper reports are disturbing as it is reported that there was complete flouting of the safety norms as the children on the boat had not even been provided life jackets.”
Thirty-four people were on the boat when it overturned. The incident sparked massive outrage, with questions being raised about non-adherence to basic safety norms."

The CM was speaking at the 52nd Statehood Day observance held on Sunday at the 1st Manipur Rifles battalion parade ground in Imphal. Manipur, a princely state merged into India in 1949, was granted statehood in 1972. He said the role of central forces extends beyond observation to the protection of lives and property. They are in the state to help contain the violence and not to simply watch and observe, he added.
“You (Central forces) are not invited to observe what is going on. You are invited to protect the integrity of the state and life and properties of the innocent people. We are Indians,” the CM said.
Singh warned those challenging Manipur’s unity and integrity, saying they should know that the state’s indigenous people would unite to meet any such challenge."

K K Nair is described by the faithful as the “man who began the Ram Janmabhoomi Hindu revival movement”. Nair, a native of Kuttanad in Kerala’s Alappuzha, was appointed the district magistrate of Faizabad in June, 1949, months before the idol was placed in the masjid. UP state governemnt led by Govind Ballabh Pant and later PM Nehru intervened in the issue asking Nair to remove the idol, but the intransigent ICS officer refused to follow the directives.
The ICS officer whose favourite subject was mathematics, Nair had to go through a legal battle to be reinstated in the service after his suspension. Although he won the case, he quit the job as, by then, he had earned a degree in law.
Nair then contested as a Jana Sangh candidate from Bahraich Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh and became a member of the fourth Lok Sabha in 1967. Prior to that, Nair’s wife Shakuntala had contested as Jan Sangh candidate from Kaiserganj Lok Sabha in 1952 and won. She later became a member of the UP Assembly and a minister.
In Alappuzha, Nair’s nephew K K Padmanabha Pillai has fond memories of the family’s illustrious son. “For people of Ayodhya, he is still Nair saab.My son Sunil Pillai will attend the consecration ceremony as a special invitee,’’ said the 78-year-old Pillai, a chartered accountant.
Nair was one of the six children of Kandamkalathil Sankara Panicker, a farmer, and Parvathi Amma. Panicker was keen on educating his children – four boys and two girls. Born in 1907, Nair’s school days were spent in Alappuzha.
“My father Raghavan Pillai used to take Nair to school by rowing a country craft from Kainakari, where they lived. In fact, his name was Karunakaran Pillai. But at school, there was another student with that name. Hence, the teacher changed his name from Pillai to Nair. In our family, all others except him (Nair), have the family name Pillai,’’ said Pillai.
After his school education was over, Nair and his elder brother, Raghavan moved to Thiruvananthapuram, where their eldest brother Gopal Pillai was already in the judicial service. “Gopal wanted his brothers to continue studies. Nair obtained a degree honours with a gold medal. When Nair was 20, a marriage proposal came from an aristocratic family. After marriage, he went to Britain for higher studies. Mathematics was his favourite subject. He became an ICS at the age of 21 and his posting was in the United Provinces (later Uttar Pradesh),” recalls Pillai.
When Nair joined, he faced turmoil in his personal life. His wife Sarasamma, a native of Thiruvananthapuram, wanted to be around her parents and was not ready to relocate to the United Provinces. The couple had a child, Sudhakaran, who later died. But eventually, they were divorced. In 1946, Nair married Shakuntala, who belonged to a Kshatriya family from the UP-Nepal border. They had a son, Marthanda Vikraman Nair, who later joined the Indian Revenue Service.
Pillai, who had stayed with Nair in Lucknow in the early 1970s, recalls, “Nair was not Hindu die-hard. He wanted to stand for justice. Nair was of the view that he wanted to avoid a bloodbath of Hindu sanyasis by evicting them and removing the idol. ‘I don’t want a job at the cost of the blood of sanyasis’ was his stand as suspension was looming,’’ said Pillai.
Nair was 42 with a 21-year career in the ICS when he was suspended. “He was not keen to continue in service, but decided to fight it legally. He wanted to prove his decision was correct and that the political leadership was wrong. A suspended Nair studied law. When the court decided in his favour, Nair decided to quit the job,’’ he said.
Nair practised as a lawyer at Allahabad and played an active role in the Jan Sangh. In 1962, he became a member of the Lok Sabha. His wife Shakuntala Nair was a three-time LS member (1952, 1967 and 1971) from the Kaiserganj seat.
The couple had been in Kozhikode for the Jan Sangh conference in 1967. “Nair’s last visit to Kerala was in 1976, a year before his death. He had come for ayurvedic treatment at Arya Vaidya Sala at Kottakkal in Malappuram,’’ he said. In Alappuzha, the family has set up a trust named after Nair. “He is an unsung hero in Kerala. Now, the VHP has come forward to help the trust carry forward its activities,” he said.
On Saturday, the Kerala Hindu Aikya Vedi held a commemoration meeting for Nair."

There is no official word if the President, who was formally invited for the event a week ago, will attend the Pran Pratishtha. However, the Rashtrapati Bhawan is hosting the Rashtriya Bal Puraskar event on Monday.
“As you prepare yourself to go for the Pran Pratishtha of Prabhu Shri Ram’s murti at the new temple built in His birthplace, Ayodhya Dham, I can only contemplate the unique civilisational journey that will be accomplished with each step taken by you in the hallowed precincts,” President Murmu said in the letter, also making a mention of the “11-day rigorous anushthan” that the PM has undertaken ahead of the ceremony.
“As you head to Ayodhya Dham, I send my heartfelt wishes to you,” the note said, calling the celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration as an uninhibited expression of “the eternal soul of India”. The President added, “We all are fortunate to witness the commencement of a new cycle in the resurgence of our nation.”
The President also extolled the universal values that Lord Ram represents, such as courage, compassion and constant focus on duty, and how these “will be taken closer to the people through this magnificent temple”.
“Prabhu Shri Ram signifies the best aspects of our cultural and spiritual heritage,” the letter said, “Above all, he represents the good which is in constant battle with evil”. His life and principles have influenced many episodes of our history and inspired nation builders. Mahatma Gandhi Ji derived strength from Ramanama till his last breath, says the note.
Murmu also mentioned Lord Ram’s message of treating everyone with love and dignity, irrespective of their social background, and how it also appealed to the intellect of path-breaking thinkers.
Talking about Ram’s focus on justice and welfare of the people, President Murmu made a mention of Modi government’s PM-JANMAN initiative for the particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), under which the PM recently released the first instalment of Rs 540 crore for PVTGs.
“It was heartening to see you invoke Mata Shabari in your address on that occasion as well. Indeed, she would be doubly happy to see Prabhu Shri Ram’s temple as well as the welfare of the people,” Murmu remarked, concluding her note with “Siyavar Ramachandra Ki Jai!”
On January 12, President Murmu received the invitation for the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya scheduled for January 22. The invitation to the President was given by Nripendra Misra, Chairman, Ram temple construction committee and working president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Alok Kumar. The two were also accompanied by senior leader of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Ram Lal.
The president expressed immense joy on receiving the invitation and said that she will soon decide the time to come and visit Ayodhya, said a statement by the VHP.
Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had demanded that President Murmu be asked to perform the January 22 consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya as it was a matter of “national pride” and pertained to the “country’s self-respect”
The former Maharashtra Chief Minister also wrote to President Murmu, inviting her to participate in an aarti at Kalaram temple in Nashik on the day of the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
However, on Monday evening, President Murmu will present the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar to 19 children for their exceptional achievements, an official statement said. The children, comprising nine boys and 10 girls, hail from 18 States and Union Territories, including two aspirational districts."

The meeting was attended by the CM and Deputy CMs; along with senior officials, including Union Home Secretary, Director (IB), Director General of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Chhattisgarh Chief Secretary, and the state police chief.
Shah said that on account of the combined efforts of the security agencies, Central as well as from the state, the LWE problem has been confined to some pockets, which needs to be cleared in the next three years.
In order to achieve this, Shah emphasised the need for a well-coordinated detailed plan to target the entire ecosystem sustaining the LWE. Shah directed the Chhattisgarh Police to fill up the gaps in security, ensure comprehensive investigations, closely monitor prosecution, choke finance streams and continue intelligence-led operations. He also stressed the need to review all inputs shared through the Multi-Agency Centre and operationalise verified inputs.
Shah also stressed the need for saturation coverage of the Central and state government schemes in LWE-affected districts. He mentioned that the MHA should be flexible both in the allotment of funds as also its usage in affected areas.

8BJEPMB3IQ_5LMV4SDY2USVSZO,12th Fail distorts UPSC’s recruitment process,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 08:09 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/12th-fail-distorts-upscs-recruitment-process-9120289/,"Written by Ramanand Nand and Arjun
While Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s 12th Fail is breaking new records, its central theme is an old topic resonating deeply in Indian society. Perhaps unintentionally, it adeptly distorts the realities of the civil services recruitment process. These distorted realities have engendered a problematic mindset within Indian society, extending even into the bureaucracy. It is helpful to understand the realities accurately as individuals, institutions, and society. Moreover, an accurate understanding of the issue is essential for discourse on reforming the existing bureaucratic recruitment processes.
With nearly 1.5 million aspirants vying for roughly 1,000 seats, it’s helpful to realise that the Indian civil services examination process is a rejection process – and not a selection process. This reality doesn’t always align with popular culture’s heroic narratives of valour, discipline, persistence, and hard work. The success stories, as also depicted in 12th Fail, are mere bright spots in an otherwise blank canvas. Society must communicate and acknowledge this real picture. Failure to do so and acknowledge the reality has instilled a mindset with several problematic traits.
Firstly, it creates inspiring success stories of role models who conquered a high-stakes exam. These narratives completely dismiss the nature of the current recruitment process, advancing the false perception that success in the civil services examination process is a simple linear function of one’s hard work and ability. However, nothing can be further from the truth. It is an unpredictable process, often likened to gambling. To navigate an exam where success is an all-or-nothing affair, acknowledging this is essential for aspirants, their families, and society at large.
Secondly, the inability to step away from the exam launches a vicious cycle of attempts and re-attempts. Like Manoj’s experience, many aspirants begin to believe that selection is right around the corner. This cycle prompts aspirants and their families to endure significant financial, temporal, and mental sacrifices. However, as statistics show, this optimism is often unfounded.
Finally, this mindset has misrepresented the motivation of many aspirants. Most aspirants come from oppressed socio-economic backgrounds (recall the “stereotypical aspirant from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh”) where the delivery of public services remains inadequate. For them, apart from the tangible monetary benefits, public service is an opportunity to become a citizen with access to quality public services. Consequently, bureaucracy becomes a conduit for upward mobility in a society that is still working to provide equity and inclusive development, rather than an immediate catalyst for societal change.
A similar trajectory is seen in Manoj’s case. His pursuit of joining the government payroll began with the simple need for a stable monthly income to support his family. It was only after encountering misconduct by public servants that his aspirations aimed higher. In a society where inequality runs rampant, acknowledging that the path to bureaucracy is often the path to a better tomorrow for many is also the initial acknowledgement of the shortcomings within our governance systems.
While society’s obsession with the UPSC exams has been discussed extensively, less attention has been paid in public discourse to the bureaucracy’s obsession with UPSC. In the film, the evident disdain of interviewers towards Hindi-speaking candidates evokes colonial feelings. Further, the interviewers’ strong preference for “IIM and IIT toppers” is ironic. In a country rich in linguistic diversity but lacking high-quality educational institutions, favouring only English-proficient candidates with academic excellence is a narrow and flawed selection process. This parochial perspective has historically led to a bureaucratic monopoly on policy-making, stalling the promotion of an open-door policy-making process. Recently, this perspective surfaced in the bureaucratic resistance to lateral hires at senior levels.
In the past, in a still nascent independent India grappling with uncertainties, government jobs promised stability. Gradually, society granted bureaucrats a high pedestal. In several parts of the country even today, being a bureaucrat offers an escape from being just another ordinary and powerless citizen. This motivation and mindset compels millions of aspirants to undergo brutal recruitment processes which usually give false hope. With the brutality now ingrained, public discourse on reforming government recruitment processes is difficult.
Our governance system is still functioning on a 19th-century model, with no effort to reform the system to meet the challenges of today. While in other parts of the world, public service delivery is led through expertise and experience, we continue to run it through a straight-jacketed recruitment process. The intricacies of several policy domains, such as diplomacy, technology, trade, and education, cannot be met through a uniform set of skills as devised by the current UPSC model. Invariably, our current system promotes hierarchy within its ranks. Encouraging reform efforts, especially the inclusion of domain experts in the government under PM Modi, have occurred yet more is needed to be achieved.
While the civil services roles are integral for India’s effective governance, neither the roles nor their pursuit should be overly glorified to the extent that realities are distorted, perpetuating a problematic mindset. With its erratic nature, individuals continue to invest themselves and their families in the process in search of a better tomorrow. This should be a worrying trend for a developing country. However, until the surrounding realities are understood and appreciated in their truest sense, pieces of popular culture on India’s civil services exam ecosystem will continue to be misinterpreted.

Mittal, while speaking to The Indian Express said that they plan to expand their presence in precision technology as well as harvesting equipment in the country.
The company which celebrated 25 years of operation in India recently has presence in Pune, Noida and Pithampur(Madhya Pradesh). Other than tractors, harvesters and balers, the company also manufactures construction equipment. Mittal said the company has invested around $350 million in the country over the last 10-15 years. “Along with the domestic market, India is an important export hub for us with equipment being shipped across the world” he said.
At present the company has managed to localise 90 per cent of the sourcing for its equipment. “Some of the premium parts are imported and we are trying to localise that too,” he said. The company has recently inaugurated a new engine plant in its Greater Nodia facility with a production capacity of 40,000-50,000 units per year. “The engines produced would adhere to the new emission TREM V norms,” he said. Along with emission norms, the company plans to make its equipment more fuel efficient, which would in turn help the farmers.
Mittal talked about the setting up of the India Technology Centre (ITC), which would see the company working on ITC solutions for the farm sector. At present CNH is conducting trials with drones in Lakhimpur Kheri to test the usage of technology in precision agriculture. “The drones will survey the field and look at places where the crop is in stress. Thus localised approaches would be taken to remedy the same,” he said. The low penetration of harvesting and post harvest equipment in the country he said was due to lack of awareness. “Along with the government we have to make the conditions conducive for the adaptation of such technologies and equipment,” he said."

Sources said a team of cyber experts, comprising officers from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Information Technology, CERT-IN, and the Intelligence Bureau (IB), has been sent to Ayodhya to do real-time monitoring of associated websites.
“Any fake/deepfake videos on Shri Ram Mandir should be taken down immediately and such cases should be reported to MHA, Control Room in North Block. After finding some wrongful content, the Centre has blocked around 100 social media accounts from Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and X,” a source said, adding authorities have also asked to be extra vigilant for fake news.
The MHA has also said recent activities indicate that global jihadi groups and Pakistan-based outfits are planning to carry out terrorist attacks in India. These inputs may have a bearing on the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya on January 22, a source said.
On January 19, a deputy secretary rank officer of MHA wrote to the DGs of all states and UTs and police commissioners. In his letter, the officer said, “Developments on cyberspace/social media should be constantly monitored to look out for suspicious activities or attempts being made to vitiate the communal and law and order situation in the run-up to during the inauguration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” the source said, citing the letter.
The MHA has also asked all police chiefs to inform the Uttar Pradesh Police authorities if they find any input.
The MHA has also asked the police chiefs to increase deployment in mixed or communally sensitive localities in their states and UTs. “All the police chiefs are learnt to have been asked to be extra vigilant and make adequate law and order arrangements during the passage of processions/shobha yatras through Muslim-dominated areas,” the source added."

She stated that “one of the biggest procedural irregularities committed by these colleges is with respect to the creation of teaching and non-teaching posts and appointments without the government’s approval”.
In a statement, she said, “The pattern of assistance of these colleges very clearly stipulates no post will be created… without the approval of the government of NCT of Delhi.”
She also pointed out that “… the Directorate of Audit, Government of NCT Delhi, in its report, included a special audit of 6 of these 12 colleges, conducted in 2020… (it) found several instances of serious irregularities and procedural lapses committed by these colleges. These lapses involve expenditure worth hundreds of crores from public exchequer.”
In a letter to the secretary (higher education), she pointed out that “there are 939 illegal teaching posts and 958 illegal non-teaching posts in these colleges currently. Since these posts are ab initio illegally created, therefore, all appointments (ad-hoc or permanent) done on these posts are illegal”.
Atishi reiterated that as a consequence of irregularities by these colleges, 1,897 teaching and non-teaching employees — for no fault of theirs — have been appointed illegally.
The minister directed the secretary to identify and take strong action against the principals and officials responsible for creating illegal posts, including recovering salaries since 2015 of illegally appointed staff members. “These colleges are funded by the public exchequer and, therefore, must be held accountable for any misuse of funds,” she said.
Meanwhile, a DU official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have found out about this through the media. We will deliberate on the contents of this letter and then give our comments.”
Last week, the Delhi government had said it would only provide funding to the 12 colleges once they are de-affiliated from DU and become part of one of Delhi’s state universities. The statement came even as DU Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Singh wrote to Atishi saying the colleges will remain with it and the state should continue funding them. He had reiterated that “the question of de-affiliation of these colleges does not arise”."

DMVS will now be working towards making all Delhi government schools hybrid, i.e. teaching-learning will be available both offline and online. This will ensure that even if the government has to close schools due to weather uncertainties, children’s education remains unaffected.
Additionally, students of Delhi government schools can now prepare for JEE, NEET UG and CUET UG through this platform."

Delhi HC to decide who invented Butter Chicken, Dal Makhani",_,"Updated: January 21, 2024 11:23 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/moti-mahal-or-daryaganj-delhi-hc-butter-chicken-dal-makhani-invention-9119768/,"Who invented Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani? the question has come up for adjudication in the Delhi High Court with restaurant chain Moti Mahal suing renowned eatery Daryaganj for taking the credit for the two world famous dishes.
The proprietors of Moti Mahal have claimed before the court that it was their predecessor Late Kundal Lal Gujral who invented Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani and restaurant chain Daryaganj is “misleading people into believing” that their predecessor was the inventor of the two dishes.
The plaintiffs sued the owners of Daryaganj restaurants for claiming that there is a relation between Daryaganj restaurants and Moti Mahal whose first branch was opened in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi.
Moti Mahal’s owners have sought to restrain Daryaganj restaurants’ proprietors from claiming that their predecessor Late Kundan Lal Jaggi was the inventor of these two dishes, which are now world famous, and from using the tagline “by the inventors of butter chicken and dal makhani” on its website http://www.daryaganj.com and various social media websites including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter and in print and electronic media.
Justice Sanjeev Narula recently issued a summons to the owners of Daryaganj restaurants and asked them to file a written statement in response to the suit along with an affidavit of admission or denial of documents of the plaintiffs.
The court listed the matter for further hearing on May 29.
For so many years, the two restaurant chains have claimed that that they invented Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani.
In its suit, Moti Mahal’s owners have claimed that their predecessor Gujral created the first Tandoori Chicken and later went on to create Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani and brought it to India after partition.
They claim that in the early days, the unsold leftovers of chicken could not be stored in the refrigeration and Gujral began worrying about his cooked chicken drying out. He thus invented a sauce with which he could rehydrate them.
His invention was ‘the makhani’ or butter sauce (a gravy with tomatoes, butter, cream, and some spices) that now gives the dish a tangy and delectable taste, the claim goes.
“The invention of Dal Makhani is closely linked with the invention of Butter Chicken. He (Gujral) applied the same recipe with Black lentils and gave birth to Dal Makhani around the same time,” Moti Mahal said in its suit.
During the hearing on Tuesday, the counsel for Daryaganj restaurants vehemently opposed the claims and contended that the suit was misconceived, baseless and lacking a cause of action.
The counsel argued that the defendants have not engaged in any false representation or claim, and the allegations made in the suit are far from truth.
Regarding a photograph of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Peshawar, the defendants’ counsel said that it was established jointly by predecessors of both parties (Moti Mahal’s Gujral and Daryaganj’s Jaggi), thus invalidating any claims of exclusive rights over the image that the plaintiffs might claim."

In another post, she said, “TN govt is unofficially claiming law and order issues to justify the live telecast ban. False and fake narrative! There was no L&O issues on the day of #Ayodhya verdict. Not even the day when PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation, in any part of the country. The groundswell and the voluntary participation of people to celebrate #ShriRam in TN has rattled the anti-Hindu DMK”.
Reacting to Sitharaman’s allegation, Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister, P K Sekar Babu said there is no such ban on the conduct of puja for Lord Ram. Also, there is no bar to distribute ‘Annadhanam’ and ‘Prasadam.’ “A rumour is being disseminated to divert people’s attention from the DMK’s youth wing conference, underway now at Salem,” he said in a social media post.
Further, the minister called the news report as completely false and had ulterior motives. He added that it was regrettable that Sitharaman, who holds a high office, was circulating such fake news.

A princely state which became part of India in 1949, Manipur was granted statehood in 1972.
The BJP leader lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who recently said the central government would end the free-movement regime, fence the India-Myanmar border and prepare the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Singh, who appealed to the police force to stay alert all the time, warned that those “challenging Manipur’s unity and integrity” should know the state’s indigenous people would unite to meet any such challenge. He said that if there was scope for dialogue, he was ready for it, adding that attacks on unarmed civilians should cease on both sides for the sake of humanity.
Singh continued that in the past few years, the government had had been working towards ensuring development across the state without any divisions between the valley and the hills.
Stressing that there can be no peace and unity without equal development, he said the government had been developing infrastructure in the hills over the past five or so years. “Unfortunately, the unwanted incidents of May 3 have stopped developmental works in some districts,” he said at the parade ground of the 1st Manipur Rifles battalion.
The government is putting all efforts to safeguard the state, Singh said, adding, “We are Indians and every life is precious.”"

According to some Congress insiders, Patwari – who was named the MPCC chief last month following the party’s humiliating defeat by the incumbent BJP in the November 2023 Assembly polls – had been given the task of “breaking various syndicates plaguing the party” in Madhya Pradesh. He has currently been travelling through the entire state, addressing Congress workers in a bid to rejuvenate the party’s youth leadership. However, his attempts, some party leaders say, will not lead to a breakthrough anytime soon.
“Patwari has been trying to balance the old leaders with the young. That is difficult since his task is to break the influence of senior leaders and their syndicates. In the state the two tallest leaders are Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, and their syndicates still thrive. It is going to be a complex operation to reshape the party. No big leader came to his ceremony when he became the president even after youth leaders showed up. Patwari balanced this by showing respect to senior leaders which has irked the Congress high command since they want him to finish off the syndicates,” said a senior party leader.
Adding to the complications for Patwari, a former minister, is the fact that his political career was really launched with the backing of two-time CM Digvijaya Singh, who was said to have played an important role in ensuring that he became the state Youth Congress president. “Patwari tried to contest various local elections and lost. He was then given a chance by Digvijaya Singh. Furthermore, Patwari shares a complicated relationship with ex-CM Kamal Nath over the latter’s interference in the working of Patwari when he was a minister in the Nath Cabinet. If you look at a recent poster from Patwari’s office for a political programme on January 26, all the same leaders have come back and Patwari himself is missing. In the poster, among all the leaders, Digvijaya Singh is highlighted. That is a clear message,” said another senior leader.
A third leader said some changes in the state Congress would be effected after the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. “Patwari will change his entire team after the Lok Sabha elections. Currently there is no working committee, there are no responsibilities to leaders to reshape the party. Patwari is touring the state to make his own support base. By that time he is done his tenure will come to an end. There is not much he can do. The organisation is in dire straits after the loss in the Assembly elections – and there is no source of revenue. At least during Kamal Nath’s tenure as the MPCC chief the private jets were flying and sabhas were being organised.”
During his state-wide tours, Patwari has been emphasising on strengthening the organisation at the grassroots level, calling for the youth and women party leaders to take centre stage in state politics. He has also called for the training of block level party workers, especially women activists, before the Lok Sabha elections, looking to galvanise the party’s rank and file before Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra enters Madhya Pradesh.
Ex-Congress MLA from Kalapipal Kunal Chaudhary told The Indian Express, “I was an engineer and was promoted in politics by Patwari. He has the mind for this and has been focusing on propelling the youth leadership. He has the advantage of belonging to a farmers’ family and can connect with the people on the ground.”
Congress candidate from Ratlam Paras Saklecha, who lost the election, said,” Patwari has been travelling the whole state and talking to the ground level workers and he is taking their suggestions. He is also following up on the suggestions. He is planning actively for the Lok Sabha polls. He is trying to bring fire to the organisation, mount attacks against the BJP to show we are not broken. He is currently strategising and studying candidates for the Lok Sabha elections.”"

In the 1980 film Bombay 405 Miles, starring Shatrughan Sinha, MB Shetty was the action director. Mansoor, the body double of Shatrughan Sinha, had to jump from a godown as part of the stunt, which would end with a huge blast.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more
In an interview with The Lallantop, Rohit Shetty recalled the fatal accident and said the shot is still there in the film. “There was a lot of crowd when the scene was being shot. The understanding was that my father would tap the camera guy when he started running, and then the blast guy would be tapped, who was also standing there. But in chaos, no one knows how and when, they switched their places.
“When Mansoor started running, my father thought he was tapping the camera guy to start rolling, but he was actually the blast guy. So, the entire godown burst and Mansoor caught fire. He passed away in that. There was chaos on sets, we were kids, the news had reached us by evening.”
The director said a year after Mansoor passed away, his father died as well. “He had taken that guilt. Dad had a very good image among workers, even in the fighter’s association, he would work very hard. But he took this incident to heart. He started drinking a lot. Because he became an alcoholic, work started slipping away from him. He would remain in the house. We knew why he passed away when he did. Kismat (destiny).”


A post shared by Rohit Shetty (@itsrohitshetty)
The filmmaker then recalled a stunt in Chennai Express, where a car had to blast and eventually catch a controlled fire. Rohit Shetty shared that his team does remove the petrol tank of cars before executing such stunts.
“But by mistake, when the tank was being removed, some petrol was splashed on the chassis. The car we were using was an imported car which had a reserve tank, which we didn’t know. The shot got over, we filmed it, and went to extinguish the fire. But a spark flew, went behind and the car caught fire. The driver, Shankar Anna, who used to work with my dad, was still inside.
“We panicked and ran. Within a fraction of a second, the car was in flames, and it was upside down, so we couldn’t even get him out. Fortunately, there was a fire brigade on set, so we doused the fire, broke the glass and got him out. His hands were slightly burnt. It was a shocking incident because the same thing had happened with dad many years ago. It triggered that memory and after half an hour, I gathered myself. We took him to a hospital. He is fine now. ”
In the interview, the filmmaker called his mother Ratna a “fighter” and remembered how she brought him and his sister up with severe hardships. There was a struggle, a financial crunch, Rohit Shetty said, but “not a moment of sadness” where they would curse their lives.
“She never even let us feel this way. She worked hard, was into action as well and would be the stunt double of Hema Malini ji during films like Sita aur Geeta… That’s how she met my father as well. If you see the top angle shots of the song Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana from Andaaz, my mother is sitting there because my dad was the action director! In a lot of films when the heroine is falling from stairs, my mother would be that. So, this is our family profession.
“After my father passed away, she resumed work and continued to till I didn’t start working. Our entire family would just work, we never cried over our fate. That same attitude is in me, that if work is there, everything is there. It was a struggle of close to a decade for her. We earlier lived in Santacruz when dad was alive, but after his death, we shifted to Dahisar where my nani would live. We didn’t have money, so I would travel from there to school which was very far. We lived there for many years and when I started working, we shifted. I took over from her struggles then,” Shetty added.
The filmmaker has now made his streaming debut with the Prime Video series Indian Police Force, headlined by Sidharth Malhotra and also starring Vivek Oberoi and Shilpa Shetty, among others.

BY1OAT0QLH_6QVF64TSM8FKNXG,P Chidambaram writes: The dazzle of affluent India,P Chidambaram,"Updated: January 21, 2024 18:49 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-dazzle-of-affluent-india-9119480/,"The media has gone to town on Affluent India. Affluent India is our AI — persons having an annual income of USD 10,000 or about Rs 8,40,000. The media is gushing over the claims that AI is growing at a mind-boggling CAGR, AI is driving consumption, and AI will make India a USD 5 trillion economy by the year (yet undetermined because the goalpost is constantly shifting!).
I am happy for AI. Here comes the rider: according to the Goldman Sachs’ report, the size of AI by the year 2026 will be 100 million (10 crore) or roughly 7 per cent of India’s population. Why is Goldman Sachs concerned about AI and not the rest (93 per cent) of the Indian people? Because Goldman Sachs is a rich persons bank and, if AI were a separate country, AI would be a middle-income country and the 15th largest of the world. It is Affluent Indians (with honourable exceptions) who save, spend, invest, splurge, squander and shout about their income, wealth and everything else. When AI buys and consumes, it creates an illusion that all Indians buy and consume. AI has become the proxy for all India. The remaining 93 per cent earn modest incomes and some lead a satisfying life while the majority makes an effort to make both ends meet.
Upper Half, Bottom Half
Let’s stack the three customary numbers denoting income:
Affluent India: Rs 8,40,000 per year Median income: Rs 3,87,000 Per capita NNI: Rs  1,70,000
It is a tiny slice that is Affluent India. The per capita net national income (NNI) is meaningless because AI pulls the average upwards. The more relevant statistic is the median income. One-half of the Indian people (71 crore) have an income of Rs 3,87,000 per year or less, or about 32,000 a month or less. The lower you go down on the economic ladder, the income will be lesser. What does the bottom 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the population earn in a month?My generous estimate is that the per capita monthly income of the bottom 10 per cent will be Rs 6,000 and of the bottom 11-20 per cent Rs 12,000. We should worry about the conditions in which they live, the kind of food they eat, the healthcare they get, and so on.  According to the UNDP’s multi-dimensional poverty index, 22.8 crore people or about 16 per cent of the population are below the poverty line. (According to NITI Aayog, it is 11.28 per cent or 16.8 crore.)
Forgotten Poor
While celebrating the 7 crore people who will be Affluent India, we should also reflect on the pitiable status of three times more Indians (22.8 crore) who are in poverty. It is not difficult to identify the poor:
The 15.4 crore active registered workers under MGNREGS who were promised 100 days of work in a year but were allotted in the last five years, on average, only 49-51 days;
Most of the beneficiaries who were given an LPG connection but could afford, on average, only 3.7 cylinders in a year;
Those who own or cultivate less than 1-2 acres of land among the 10.47 crore farmers (the number dropped to 8.12 crore as on November 15, 2023) who received the kissan samman of Rs 6,000 per year;
Most daily wage workers who are engaged as agricultural labourers;
The ‘street people’ who live and sleep on pavements or under bridges;
Most single women old-age pensioners; and
Most persons who do so-called ‘unclean’ jobs like cleaning sewers, drains and public toilets; skin animals, make or repair footwear, etc.
The 21-50 per cent of the people who earn below the median income are only slightly better off than the bottom 20 per cent. They don’t go hungry or without shelter but they live on the edge of uncertainty. Most private jobs have no job security or social security benefits. For example, the 2.8 crore domestic help registered on the government’s e-SHRAM portal work at below-the-minimum wage (the actual number is many times more). Except government and public sector employees, the others live in fear of losing their jobs. In 2023, the tech companies alone laid off or retrenched 2,60,000 highly qualified employees. 100 start-ups axed 24,000 jobs. Blinded by Dazzle
The five-star hotels, resorts, glitzy malls, luxury brand stores, multiplex cinemas, private jets, destination weddings, Lamborghinis (priced in the range Rs 3.22 to 8.89 crore, the company sold a record 103 cars in 2023), etc. have enough patrons among AI. AI is able to sustain this high standard of living because AI owns 60 per cent of the nation’s wealth and earns 57 per cent of the national income.
The dazzle of AI has blinded the BJP government to the state of the bottom 20 per cent because it has the unflinching support of a steel frame called RSS; its coffers are brimming with money thanks to the rich corporates and electoral bonds; and it knows how to make a potent mixture of religion and hyper-nationalism. It is a government verily for Affluent India.
India is being pulled away from the idea of a social and economic democracy. The Opposition parties and the media may not be vigilant but the poor and middle classes — the 93 per cent — are watching and waiting."
C90KRNE10N_A6XRJ3YY8L1WBFJ,"Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes: What January 22 is, what it isn’t",Pratap Bhanu Mehta,"Updated: January 23, 2024 07:55 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pratap-bhanu-mehta-january-22-ayodhya-ram-temple-9120210/,"There are moments in history that appear to drive wave after wave of people in a great torrent of catharsis, ecstasy, emotion and an elevated group mood that almost all conventional analysis, historical categories, moral measures and political prognosis seem beside the point. It would be foolish to deny that the pran pratishtha of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya is one such event. Just in sheer magnitude, of the tens of millions of people mobilised, whose identity, emotions and hopes are, at least for the moment, oriented towards Ayodhya, this event has almost no precedent in history. It is a watershed moment. The pran pratishtha following the foundation stone of Ayodhya, marks the consecration of Hinduism as a political religion pure and simple. It is not just a moment where the state, which has pulled all its mighty power behind this event, ceases to be secular. It is also the moment where Hinduism ceases to be religious.
The sheer spectacle of the event, now fusing modified but still traditional yama and niyama, with mass broadcasting and mass mobilisation, is itself considered an achievement. The spectacle is the statement: That Hindus have asserted their collective power, reclaimed their historical agency, and overcome the deep sense of insecurity, and despite some murmurings, for once managed to make something a show of unity. The BJP has kept its promises. Prime Minister Narendra Modi now donning the mantle of Hindu kingship, has the ability to get millions of people to play their parts for an audience of One, with all institutions, corporations, sects, civil society, media singing the same tune. It is a terrifying spectacle on any proper measure of democracy. But as a form of deference to mass sentiment it is now carrying its own democratic imprimatur. There is something quite astonishing about this mobilisation of power. You have to struggle to remember its ominous origins and shadows.
Some parties may contest the ceremony. But everyone has to rush to declare their allegiance to Ram. Even Opposition parties are obliged to pay allegiance to Ram in the form that ironically was best described by Iqbal when he called Ram the Imam-e-Hind. The Ram whose role in Indian cultural and spiritual life was one whose centre was everywhere and circumference nowhere, has now been anchored to a centre. Ram has been transformed from a radiant glow of righteousness, compassion, and imaginative power into something merely instrumental: A litmus test for national loyalty. We are now more valorous devotees of Ram — more than Tulsidas or Gandhi, who rejected the logic of retaliation. You now have to swear allegiance to this Imam-e-Hind, or else.
In many ways, Bhagwad Gita 17.18 captures the spectacle being made out of this ceremony perfectly. It goes: satkara mana puja artham tapah dambehna cheva yat/kriyate tadiham proktam rajas am chalam adhruvam (Penance and austerities performed ostentatiously out of pride for the sake of gaining honour and recognition are all in the mode of a passion. Its benefits are unstable and fleeting). This is both an accurate description of this mode of worship and a warning. It names this worship for what it is: A spectacle. But the fact that the passions and emotional resonances it produces are transitory is not reassuring in this context. It will require that the deep insecurities and needs this spectacle has tapped into be constantly satiated. The passion around Ram is not a form of ecstasy finding its final repose in a radiant calm. It is going to be one in a long chain where our pride will have to be constantly fed. This is because in an inversion of dharma, the relation between pride and its object is reversed. We no longer take pride in genuine achievement; generating pride is considered the achievement.
In the Mahabharata there is an evocative word, Dharma Dhwajii. It is a pejorative for those who make a show of their worship in what is a sign of lack of real faith. The term Dharma Dhwajii refers to those who, as it were, care about the flag more than they care about dharma. The Dharma Dhwajiis have, for the moment, won the political, cultural and emotional battle fair and square. It is the overwhelming power of this moment, and the fact that we now inhabit a political universe solely dominated by power, that expressing even ambivalence about this pran pratishtha seems more like blowing straws in a hurricane. Bearing witness, fighting for republican ideals, are all now reduced to self-satisfied snarks or expressions of sour grapes. There is no real ideological counterpoint.
Rallying around the dhwaja is clear. What dharma it portends is less clear. The content of this new Ramrajya, is, for a moment, founded in a logic of retaliation and blood, rancour and division, that India’s post-1951 constitutional ideals sought so hard to avoid. That project was, first and foremost, betrayed in many different ways by its own custodians. The Dharma Dhwajiis, with popular acclaim, have reduced whatever was left of the dharma of that republic to ruins. The only content to the new dharma one can see on the horizon is, ironically, to intensify the logic of the 1930s: To create an ethno nationalist state with its cult of power and violence, its worship of purity and concentration of power. This is a project that never ends well. It produced devastating wars in Europe, and the partition of India.
This time the partition is more intimate and close: It is running through families. It is also a fissure within Hinduism. Worshipping idols is central to Hinduism, no matter what deracinated intellectuals might tell you. It gave Hinduism a playful intimacy. But the idols we worship are no longer intimate; they are mega showpieces. More grievously, concentration on the idol was a path to self-consciousness. But now, as the philosopher, Arindam Chakrabarti, once wrote, the idol has been replaced by the I-doll, the worship of the “I”. We are consecrating our own collective narcissism in the image of God.
In the Ramayana, in any version, there is always a sense of sadness around Ram himself. Bhavabhuti captured it beautifully: Ram has been filled with the rasa of pity/ kept hidden by his profound demeanour/the sharp pain of it held deep within/ like a clay pot baking in embers. This moment of triumphalism is also accompanied by a pain that cannot even be expressed. It will cook in the embers of this moment. Ram’s dhwaja has been planted. But the question of dharma is met only with a yawning and ominous silence."
CJM5K4GKTV_QZEIC8VM5RPKI5U,Officials report at least 25 dead in shelling of a market in Ukraine’s Donetsk,_,"Updated: January 21, 2024 18:46 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/ukraine-donetsk-market-shelling-25-dead-9120570/,"At least 25 people were killed Sunday by shelling at a market on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine, local officials reported Sunday. A further 20 people were injured in the strike on the suburb of Tekstilshchik, including two children, said Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian-installed authorities in Donetsk. He said that the shells had been fired by the Ukrainian military.
Kyiv has not commented on the event and the claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press. Emergency services continue to work on the scene, Pushilin said. Also Sunday, fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia’s Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said. Local media reported that the port had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode. The blaze was at a site run by Russia’s second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek, 165 kilometers southwest of St. Petersburg.
In a press statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company said that the fire was the result of an “external influence.” It also said that it had paused operations at the port. Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of Russia’s Kingisepp district, where the port is based, said in a statement that there were no casualties, but that the area had been placed on high alert. News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying towards St Petersburg Sunday morning, but that they were redirected towards the Kingisepp district.
The Associated Press could not independently verify the reports. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia’s Smolensk region, and that two more had been shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions. Russian officials previously confirmed that a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
In the fighting on the front line, Russia’s Ministry of Defense announced Sunday that Moscow’s forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces confirmed that the settlement had been occupied, but described its capture as a “temporary phenomenon.
”Volodymyr Fityo, spokesperson for Ukrainian Ground Forces Command, said that Kyiv’s troops had been pulled back to pre-prepared reserve positions. He said that Krokhmalne had a population of roughly 45 people before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. “That’s five houses, probably,” he was quoted as saying by Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske. “Our main goal is to save the lives of Ukraine’s defenders.”
Russian and Ukrainian forces have continued to fight from largely static positions along the roughly 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line throughout the winter. Recent Russian attacks have tried to find gaps in Ukraine’s defenses by using large numbers of various types of missiles in an apparent effort to saturate air defense systems. The massive barrages — more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, according to officials in Kyiv — are also using up Ukraine’s weapons stockpiles."
DCQYNVKATE_MFGVXUZKTX78K1U,WTO dispute settlement body revival faces delays over country differences: GTRI,_,"January 22, 2024 04:39 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/wto-dispute-settlement-body-revival-faces-delays-over-country-differences-gtri-9120895/,"Reinstating a fully functional WTO dispute settlement body to resolve trade disputes between countries could take longer than expected as there continues to be wide differences between developed and developing countries over the issue, a GTRI report said on Sunday.
This comes as the 164-member World Trade Organization (WTO) is set to gather next month in Abu Dhabi for the 13th ministerial conference (MC) to resolve different issues such as reforms in dispute settlement mechanisms, agriculture-related matters among other key issues.
Protectionism has been on the rise due to the lack of a functional dispute settlement body as the US, since 2017, has been blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO’s seven-member appellate court as it believes that that the body is hurting its interest.
GTRI said that balancing India’s demands for an appellate body, S&DT (special and differential treatment) provisions, and fairness while addressing other members’ concerns, including transparency and legal certainty, will require significant compromise and negotiation.
“Reaching a consensus on reform of the dispute settlement system is complex, with developed and developing countries holding different priorities and concerns,” economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.
GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said that for India, reforming the dispute settlement system remains a crucial priority at the upcoming MC13. MC is the highest decision-making body of the global trade watchdog. Reforming the dispute settlement mechanism is essential, as without a reliable way to resolve conflicts between countries, WTO rules are ineffective.
“The proper functioning of the WTO Appellate Body has a disproportionate impact on the United States because more than one- quarter of all disputes at the WTO have been challenges to US laws or other measures. Specifically, 155 disputes have been filed against the United States and no other member has faced even a hundred disputes,” the US had said in a report in 2020.
The United States Trade Representative (USTR) in its report had pointed out that up to approximately 90 percent of the disputes pursued against the US have led to a report finding that the US law or other measure was inconsistent with WTO agreements. “This means that, on average, over the past 25 years, the WTO has found a US law or measure WTO-inconsistent between five and six times per year, every year,” USTR added."
DKLMSAUG8D_ATUH9CLDITH4029,Court rejects actor’s plea to travel to Dubai for livelihood,_,"Updated: January 22, 2024 17:47 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/court-rejects-actors-plea-to-travel-to-dubai-for-livelihood-9120853/,"A special court on Saturday rejected a plea filed by actor Kriti Verma, named by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the probe related to the TDS scam, to travel to Dubai for work. The court said the ED was justified in its apprehension that Verma wants to travel to Dubai to deal with the proceeds of crime in the guise of work.
Verma was named in the chargesheet filed by ED in September 2023, in which the agency had arrested one former Income Tax officer and two of his associates. The ED had alleged that the former officer Tanaji Adhikari had allegedly generated fake TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) refunds to the tune of Rs 263 crore when he was posted in I-T’s Mumbai office. The agency had claimed that Verma was associated with co-accused businessman Bhushan Patil, and had alleged that proceeds of crime were traced to her.
Verma had this month sought permission to travel to Dubai for five days ‘to earn her livelihood and further establish herself in the film industry’. The ED opposed the plea stating that the statements of witnesses in the chargesheet show that proceeds of crime in the case were laundered through shell companies and invested in Dubai. If permitted, Verma may divert the money trail, the ED said. It also said that one of the co-accused was in touch with one Sheikh Almuallah in Dubai, as per its evidence.
“In this background, ED has a strong apprehension that the applicant (A6) (Verma) is visiting Dubai to deal with the proceeds of crime (POC) in the guise of earning for life. As noted above, the apprehension of ED is justified…… If the applicant (A6) deals with POC in Dubai, the same will ultimately paralyze further investigation of ED which is underway…,” special judge MG Deshpande said on Saturday.
The ED also submitted that while she was permitted to travel earlier as well, she was asked to inform the ED upon return but she had not done that in violation of the court order.
“…such conduct of the applicant (A6) if permitted, that would amount to use of process of the Court for the illegal activities in Dubai, which is not only detrimental to the case of the Prosecution but also amounts to throwing dust in the eyes of ED and the Court. Such conduct of the applicant (A6) cannot be entertained,” the court said rejecting the plea."

On Saturday, the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust released images showcasing the temple being adorned with “rich stocks” of flowers.
“These are all natural flowers and due to winter can last longer. So they will remain fresh on the day of the consecration ceremony. The fragrance and the aesthetic appeal of these vibrant flowers have lent another layer of divinity to the temple,” a source told PTI.
The source also mentioned that decorative lights used for external illumination are themed after diyas, providing a traditional aesthetic to accentuate the temple’s ornate elements.
“Inside the garbh griha, the traditional diya will be used,” he said, adding, the soft illumination on the inner side of the temple will highlight the architectural elements while the outer illumination will get turned on only after evening.
The 51-inch idol of Ram Lalla, sculpted by Mysuru-based artist Arun Yogiraj, was placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple on Thursday afternoon.
As part of the upcoming rituals today, a ‘puja’ of the deities with Havan will be done today, the temple trust informed.
“After that the bathing of the idol with various medicated water from 114 Kalash (vases) will take place. There will be ‘Vyahati Hom’, night vigil, with regular evening puja and aarti,” the trust was quoted saying by ANI.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also continue his visit to historical temples in Tamil Nadu that have a connection with Lord Ram today.
On Sunday, the PM will be in Dhanushkodi, offering prayers at the Sri Kothandaramar Swami Temple. The temple is believed to be the place where the younger brother of Ravan, Vibhishan, had come to meet Lord Ram and join his army because he was against Ravan’s abduction of Sita.
The PM, who is currently undertaking special rituals for 11 days in the run-up to the consecration, took a dip in the Agni theertha within the Ramanathaswamy temple complex yesterday.
Meanwhile, over 50 Musical instruments and their players have arrived from 18 states to play “Mangal Dhwani” to welcome “Ram” for the Consecration ceremony, informed the officials of the trust this this morning.
The selected musicians will showcase a variety of traditional Indian musical instruments, known as “vadya yantra,” native to their respective regions. The lineup includes bansuri and dholak artists from Uttar Pradesh, veena from Karnataka, sundari from Maharashtra, alghoza from Punjab, mardala from Odisha, santoor from Madhya Pradesh, pung from Manipur, nagada and kali from Assam, tamboora from Chhattisgarh, pakhawaj from Bihar, shehani from Delhi, and ravanhatha from Rajasthan."
EK13KQDD3B_71WVRF5P7KHRQJY,Davos meeting 2024: 5 key takeaways,_,"Updated: January 22, 2024 22:03 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/davos-meeting-2024-5-key-takeaways-9120670/,"This year’s edition of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting was held from January 15 to January 19.
Every year, leaders from various fields, such as business, politics, economics, etc., gather in the Swiss town to discuss challenges facing the world and explore the ways forward. The event has faced criticism for its elite and expensive nature, but the Davos summit still remains relevant, if only for the glimpse it offers into how the rich and powerful react to the most pressing issues.
This year, some key themes dominated proceedings at the meeting. Here are the five main takeaways (with a special mention of India).
Artificial Intelligence
The one issue that took centre stage at this year’s WEF meet was Artificial Intelligence (AI). While its many transformational abilities for human welfare were discussed, so were the need for regulation, fear of job losses, the risks of impersonation and misinformation, and the inequalities it can potentially worsen.
The overall mood, however, seemed to be that the positives outweigh the negatives, and human intelligence did not face a major threat from AI. This sentiment was perhaps best encapsulated by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, who until a few months ago was raising warnings of “the risk of extinction from AI”. “Humans know what other humans want. Humans are going to have better tools. We’ve had better tools before, but we’re still very focused on each other,”Altman said in Davos, according to the WEF’s website.
War and uncertainty
Business leaders spoke of the risk posed by a fragile geopolitical situation, wars in the Middle East and Europe, the threats to global supply chains, and the uncertainty around food security. Yet, no plans or roadmaps for peace were offered about the Israel-Gaza violence.
As CNBC said in a report, “Perhaps there are few obvious solutions, or maybe – as multiple conference attendees suggested – many people don’t want to speak out on the conflict in Gaza because they could irritate others or start a rhetorical conflagration.”
Reuters reported that the head of the Palestine Investment Fund estimated at least $15 billion would be needed to rebuild houses in Gaza alone, but Arab states said they would not fund reconstruction unless there was lasting peace.
“We agree that regional peace includes peace for Israel, but that could only happen through peace for the Palestinians through a Palestinian state,” Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told a WEF panel.
Climate
The need for businesses to adapt to climate change and for countries to unite for action against it despite differences was another hot topic. Ajay Banga, President, World Bank Group, said, we had an “existential climate crisis”on our hands and “a sense of urgency is our only saviour.” Others spoke about the ultimate benefit businesses will reap from adopting sustainable practices and about the need to allocate resources correctly in the fight against climate change.
Belgian trade unionist Luc Triangle reminded rich countries of their role. “Developed countries have to assist in the financing of climate action in the developing countries because if we don’t do that, this inequality will only grow and you will have winners and you will have losers… Rebuilding trust cannot be limited to only a number of countries. It has to include the whole world,” he said, as quoted by the WEF website.
China’s economy
Facing a slowing economy, China tried to attract more investment from the West, which has witnessed some cooling. At 5.2%, China’s GDP growth in 2023 is still below pre-pandemic levels, and it is battling American attempts to isolate it, as evidenced in the semiconductor trade standoff.
CNBC quoted Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, as saying, “China is experiencing very significant structural economic challenges. A lot of companies in the West are no longer investing what they used to invest… But even 3%, 4% growth in China is still fairly meaningful for a lot of companies that are attending the World Economic Forum this year.”
And finally, India
An assessment of Davos 2024 by consulting firm McKinsey and Company says, “India is transforming rapidly as one of the fastest growing large economies in the world. When it comes to technology, talent, healthcare, and other areas, its future in 2024—and beyond—is worth paying attention to.”
These sentiments were echoed by industrialist Gautam Adani, who said in a LinkedIn post, “If the first major theme at WEF 24 was about rebuilding trust, the second was about the rise of India.”
India also made its presence felt in ways other than its economic potential. One of the ideas discussed at WEF this year was how investment in women’s health could boost the global economy by $1 trillion annually by 2040. According to the Press Information Bureau (PIB), “One of the key takeaways from the Forum meeting was the announcement of the launch of a Global Good Alliance for Gender Equity and Equality with the support and endorsement by WEF and Government of India. The idea of this alliance emerged from the G20 Leaders’ Declaration and India’s abiding commitment to the cause of women-led development as propounded by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.”
The objective of this Alliance is to bring together global best practices, knowledge sharing and investments in the identified areas of women’s health, education, and enterprise,” the PIB said."

A former president of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), Mehta led delegations to seek a new airport for the city.
He also coordinated the unique model wherein industries coordinated closely with the authorities during the pandemic. He is now actively lobbying for a full-fledged international airport for Pune. Mehta spoke to The Indian Express about Pune.
What do you like about the city?
Pune is unique because it has the perfect recipe for success. Here, we have a city which is bustling with young energy and has a sizeable portion of senior citizens who can guide them. The city has its energy, culture and vibrancy, making it stand out worldwide. What I love the most about Pune is that it has the capacity and potential to be the country’s fastest-growing, most livable city.
What do you dislike about the city?
Unfortunately, Pune has been neglected by the government on some accounts, and thus, its full potential is yet to be harnessed. The most chronic pain for Pune is its lack of infrastructure and cleanliness. Both the citizens and the government are to be blamed for this. A world-class city needs world-class infrastructure and Pune is far from having that.
What can be done to address this?
As a city, we have to make efforts to ensure the lacunae are filled. The citizens have to take care of their surroundings and the government has to ensure the city gets the infrastructure and attention it deserves. We have to lobby as citizens for the same."

On Sunday, the PM will be in Dhanushkodi, offering prayers at the Sri Kothandaramar Swami Temple. The temple is believed to be the place where the younger brother of Ravan, Vibhishan, had come to meet Lord Ram and join his army because he was against Ravan’s abduction of Sita.
This visit comes a day after PM Modi offered prayers at the Srirangam temple in Tiruchirappalli, where he heard a local Ramayana recitation, and the Ramanathaswamy shrine in the Ramanathapuram district. While the former is a Vaishnavite temple, the latter is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
The PM, who is currently undertaking special rituals for 11 days in the run-up to the consecration, took a dip in the Agni theertha within the Ramanathaswamy temple complex.
The Srirangam temple has a religious and Tamil literary link to the Ramayana, with the idol of Sri Ranganathaswamy there, an avatar of Vishnu, believed to have been worshipped by Lord Ram and his ancestors.
The Ramanathaswamy temple also has a Ramayana connection, with the Shiva linga here believed to be installed by Lord Ram.
PM Modi’s rounds to the temples linked to Lord Ram have been taking place over the past several days.
On Wednesday, the PM offered prayers at Lord Krishna Temple in the Guruvayur town in Kerala. He then went to the Triprayar Sree Ramaswamy Temple, situated on the bank of the Karuvannur river, also known as Theevra river, in Thrissur.
A day earlier, the PM visited the Veerabhadra temple in the Lepakshi town of Sri Satyasai district of Andhra Pradesh. Lepakshi is the place where the mythical vulture Jatayu is said to have fallen when he was wounded by Ravan in his efforts to stop the abduction of Sita.
Modi hummed bhajans for Ram, listened to special hymns on Ram in Telugu, and also witnessed a puppet show on the Ramayana at the Lepakshi temple.
On January 12, the PM visited the Kalaram Mandir on the banks of the Godavari in the Panchavati area of the city. Apart from one of the places that Ram visited during his exile, Panchavati is believed to have been the site of many events described in the Ramayana, including the abduction of Sita.
The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra led by senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will re-enter Assam on Sunday.
The Yatra was on its third day of passing through Assam on Saturday. By afternoon, through the Lakhimpur district, the yatra entered Arunachal Pradesh. After a night at a village near Itanagar and an address in the morning, the yatra will again move to Assam where it will continue till January 25.
While interacting with the residents of Doimukh as he entered Arunachal, Gandhi alleged that the BJP was instigating “people to fight among themselves in the name of religion and language”.
“We gave statehood to Arunachal Pradesh and our party is always ready to raise the issues of the poor and to work for the betterment of the youth, women and weaker sections of the society,” Gandhi said.
The Congress on Saturday alleged that BJP workers tore its posters and banners and vandalised vehicles in Lakhimpur. The party has released a 54-second video purportedly showing a street in a town at night. The people can be heard shouting “Jai Shri Ram” while a man wielding a stick is seen tearing posters attached to pillars. The clip further shows another man pulling down a hoarding bearing the photograph of Gandhi and two other Congress leaders.
The Assam Police, however, has junked the claims of attack on the Congress yatra.
This comes amidst Gandhi’s statements hitting out at Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.
Meanwhile, the Congress claimed that its yatra has been denied permission to pass through Guwahati, where it is scheduled to reach on January 23, though the police maintained that the request was “under consideration”.
“We had applied for permission for a roadshow and padayatra through a definite route in Guwahati. But it has been refused,” Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Debabrata Saikia said. He also said the application, seeking permission for the march, was submitted to the police on January 12 and again on January 19, with a follow-up email sent on Saturday.
Newly-appointed Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) chief Y S Sharmila, the sister of Chief Minister and YSRCP supremo Jagan Mohan Reddy, will take charge of her new role on January 21 at a meeting scheduled to be held at 11 am at the Andhra Ratna Bhavan in Vijayawada.
The All India Congress Committee (AICC)’s Andhra in-charge Manickam Tagore and AICC secretaries CD Meyyappan and Christopher Tilak would be present on the occasion.
Sharmila’s joining the Congress will now officially kickstart the brother-sister duo’s face-off in the state in the run-up to the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, which are just a few months away.

The CM, who also holds the home portfolio, said the state has experienced a decline in the crime rate and this has resulted in a rise in employment opportunities.
He claimed Tripura was now one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, especially in sectors like education, health, and citizen services.

HHW3DGOEDY_LC8UO1PP5JM7GHW,Why Ankita Lokhande is facing backlash for remembering Sushant Singh Rajput on Bigg Boss 17?,Vibha Maru,"January 21, 2024 08:14 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/why-ankita-lokhande-is-facing-backlash-for-remembering-sushant-singh-rajput-on-bigg-boss-17-9115222/,"“Sympathy jata rahi hai lagta hai, apne liye (It seems like she is trying to gain sympathy),” remarked Ankita Lokhande’s mother-in-law when questioned about the actor discussing her ex-boyfriend, the late Sushant Singh Rajput, on the reality show Bigg Boss 17. While this statement may appear exaggerated to some, those following Ankita’s journey or monitoring her Instagram profile are familiar with such comments. She faced criticism for sharing her grief in the public eye after Sushant’s death, accused by trolls of seeking sympathy.
History repeated itself when Ankita entered the reality show. As she reminisced about the late actor in the Bigg Boss house, the audience outside got divided. Some accused her of using Sushant’s name for votes, others defended her authenticity on the show. Life is a double-edged sword for any public figure, and it becomes more complicated and subject to judgment when they openly discuss their emotional struggles.
Despite grief being a universal emotion, irrespective of social stature, celebrities often face scrutiny from society. To understand this, we consulted counselors, and Parul Adlakha, a psychologist from Delhi, helped decipher the audience’s mindset and explained how grieving on camera can be misconstrued. She said, “Be it a celebrity or anybody else, grieving doesn’t have one singular phenomenon. For some, it can be a prolonged process. Because Ankita is a celebrity and she is on a show that itself is very controversial, so whatever she says is bound to be taken out of context.”
Parul Adlakha also highlighted that when a person shares a deeply personal story, they may forget about the cameras recording them. She said, “I am sure that the person who is speaking is also aware that there are cameras, but sometimes you forget about them when you recall something emotional and speaking your heart out. I am not taking sides here, but there is no particular mandate about grieving, that you can’t do it in public or that it has to be done only in private.”
The psychologist emphasised that speaking up and acknowledging the past is considered healthy and blamed the audience for misjudging. She said, “It is evident that some trigger or when someone asks about Sushant only then Ankita speaks about him. Also, she remembers him like a fond memory. She didn’t cry saying why did he do it. If somebody is expressing their views, especially on camera or in the public eye, it is usually taken out of context. Because there is a general perception that camera ke liye toh acting he hai (If it is for the camera, it is acting). The problem is perception here. If I talk about the therapy process, we make the person talk because that helps. The means of expression can be different, but the expression in itself is not wrong.”
Ankita and Sushant were in a relationship for seven years before they parted ways in 2016. After the actor died in 2020, the Pavitra Rishta actor was very vocal on social media, sharing her cherished memories of the late actor. This invited a lot of scrutiny from Sushant’s fans who accused her of using his death for fame. This raises the question: Why was Ankita labeled an opportunist for sharing memories on Instagram when those seven years were a significant part of her life?
Noida-based psychologist Samriddhi Khatri sheds light on this, explaining how silence has traditionally been the accepted way of grieving. When a person chooses to grieve on social media, it is often perceived as frivolous. She said, “There is no code of grieving. Some people might need silence and that’s traditionally acceptable and some might require social support that they do not have in their network and they seek it on social media. Some people might do it for attention but not everybody, but who are we to judge? Maybe getting those supportive comments on social media helps someone get reassurance and helps them deal with things better. When you go to meet someone who is grieving, you don’t start commenting on them, then why do it on social media?”
Mumbai-based psychologist Aanchal, founder of Another Light Counselling, and believes that openly discussing trauma and struggles promotes a healthy outlook. She said, “Grief is such a normal emotion that we all go through. And if celebrities are openly sharing their journey in the public eye it is nice because it promotes a healthy outlook towards things. One has to be very authentic so that people can relate to it and see that some of these emotional struggles aren’t concentrated on money or fame and that they can happen to people who have money and fame.”
Recently, amid the troll storm, Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Shweta Singh Kirti came out in the actor’s support. She posted an old picture with her and called her the, ‘best and the purest.’ Fans also rallied behind Ankita, defending her emotional moments on the show.
A fan defended Ankita saying that since she spent a lot of time with Sushant it is normal for her to share his memory. He wrote, “Ankita Gets Emotional Talking About Sushant Singh Rajput. She has spent a lot of time with him and it’s normal when she talks about her past. Stay strong Ankita 🥹♥️.” Another fan defended the actor and pointed out how Ankita has also said positive things about Sushant. The fan wrote, “Ankita- ‘Uske baare me baat krna achha lagta hai, proud feeling ati hai.’ A lot of SSR fans had trolled and blamed Ankita, but never tried to feel and understand the love she had for Sushant ❤️✨.”
The Bigg Boss 17 finale is on January 28, and while it remains to be seen if Ankita will take home the trophy, she has already won hearts by being her authentic self."

In a joint statement, Raghbir Singh and Dhami said as followers of the divine Gurbani and unique Gurmat philosophy blessed by the ten Gurus, and being advocates of inclusiveness and interfaith harmony, they respect the beliefs of every religion.
In the statement, they said, “In the hearts of the people of every religion, there is determination and belief in the holy shrines of their prophets/incarnations. Everyone is blessed with his faith and sacred belief and we wish that religious freedom, communal harmony and peace should prevail in the world, so that every human being is free, safe and fearless to practice his/her religious beliefs while being in the devotional memory of the leaders and follow the holy beliefs.”
Expressing “deep gratitude” for invitation, Badal, in a letter to Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai, stated, “On this pious occasion, I offer my best wishes and congratulate the entire Hindu community settled in the country and abroad.”
A post on the official Akali Dal account on X (formerly Twitter) read, “Fully in accordance with and total devotion and commitment to the high sacred principles, spiritual guidance and direction as enshrined in Jugo Jugo Atal Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji Maharaj, Shiromani Akali Dal extends sincerest good wishes and heartiest congratulations to the entire Hindu Bhaichara all over the world and pious inter faith reverence on the occasion of Shri Ram Janambhoomi Pran Pratishtha Samaroh at Ayodhya tomorrow.”

Shiromani Akali Dal also offers sincerest prayers at the abode of Akal Purakh that this occasion may help in ushering in an era of peace, communal harmony and sincere love and mutual respect among people of all faiths across the world.”
Although there has been no word yet on whether Giani Raghbir Singh and Harjinder Singh Dhami will attend the Ayodhya temple event, Badal is expected to attend an event being organised by SAD member Anil Joshi celebrating the consecration.
Joshi, who is one of Hindu faces of Akali Dal, confirmed Badal’s attendance at the ceremony in Amritsar, while adding that local party leaders, including constituency in-charges of all the nine assembly segments under the parliamentary constituency would also be present.
Meanwhile, no other leader from Akali Dal is scheduled to attend the ceremony at Ayodhya either. Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said, “The invitation was for party president Sukhbir Singh Badal only. And since the entry is strictly by invitation, no other party leader is going to attend the ceremony.”
Over 70 Sikh religious leaders were invited to attend the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya as BJP, RSS, and VHP workers in Punjab carried out a door-to-door campaign.
There were reports of a section of Sikhs living in the US urging the jathedars of the five Sikh Takhts and the community to stay away from the consecration ceremony of the Ram Mandir.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over the ‘pran pratishtha’ ceremony in Ayodhya. The deity Ram’s idol has been positioned within the temple’s sanctum sanctorum."

January 22 is a day foretold, its intimations borne by the years and decades that followed the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. And yet the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya with full state honours is a new moment.
Something has passed, and in a country with no full stops, something else is in its place.
In days to come, after the temple is consecrated, a full reckoning with what has passed and what has replaced it will not be easy — as the drumbeats of the Lok Sabha election become louder, a moment of pause to look ahead, or a minute of silence to look back, will be difficult to come by.
But today, if you stand on tiptoe and look over the head of January 22, what do you see?
You see a BJP with a long arc. It has achieved what it set out to do. The party of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani moved tentatively after December 6 1992. It was seen as a political “untouchable”, compelled to place its “core issues” including the Ram temple “on the back burner”, seen to wear a mask or “mukhauta” to make friends. Now, it is the dominant party winning elections on its own, having redrawn the political lines and reset the terms of debate. The party of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah is aggressive and predatory, it observes no niceties.
Power has not diminished its appetite for absolute power, and it seeks to stamp its imprint in all spaces, those that are governed by the majority principle in an electoral democracy, and even those domains of a constitutional democracy that aren’t. The temple that will be consecrated in Ayodhya consecrates these several successes of the BJP — in pushing its way to the centre of the polity, in forcing its opponents on the back foot, in conquering institutions and bending them to its will, in appropriating words and filling them with new meanings.
From Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, a story of “New Ayodhya” that is home to the “National Temple” is being written and told — it is projected as a site of a grand convergence.
This story does not talk of the silences and erasures on which the plinth of New Ayodhya also stands — of the masjid that was, and of the guilt or even remembrance of its demolition. And of the crucial degrees of separation between the majority religion and the state in a diverse country.
The loss is not just of that unlamented notion of secularism which had lost its way, in practice, on the secularists’ watch. It is also a bleaching out of the possibilities of what secularism might have been, of what it could have become, in a plural polity. For the foreseeable future, that particular what-if of history will lie buried deep under the Ram temple at Ayodhya, it will not be resurrected.
This story does not talk, either, of the future challenge that seems to have no owners, and that has not even been given a name. It begins after the temple is consecrated on January 22 — of reaching out to the country’s minorities and reassuring them that while the construction of the temple may have seen an unrestrained majoritarian triumphalism, its consecration would drain the poison, not feed it.
If you are still standing on tiptoe, you will also see a Supreme Court that called the demolition of the Babri Masjid a crime and then handed over the land on which it stood for the construction of a temple.
And an Opposition that, in the face of a political force that knows its mind and has a plan, mainly looks bewildered, and swings into action only to cover the unremarkable political distance between a me-too stance and ambivalence.
Over the years, Opposition parties have had no story to tell that could vie with the one the BJP was telling the people. A story that could invoke larger wholes, and make individuals feel a part of them. A story that, like the BJP’s, also conjured optimism and a sense of forward movement.
Instead, anti-BJP parties only told anti-BJP stories. From religion to culture to nationalism, they ceded vast spaces of emotion and imagination, for the BJP to seize and spin into its narratives, uncontested.
At the same time, though belatedly, you might also see a new tweak in the script. By starting his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Manipur, still strife-torn, while the government is turning the spotlight to shiny Ayodhya, Rahul Gandhi has flung down the gauntlet in a more pointed way than he has so far. His task will now be to remain with it, build on it.
Mamata Banerjee has announced she will visit the Kali temple — the local deity — and hold an inter-faith rally on January 22. And Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP is plucking its own piece from the Ramcharitmanas and attending recitations of the Sundar Kand, Lord Hanuman at its centre, across Delhi. Implicit in both programmes is a questioning of the BJP’s projection of a monolithic piety.
Of course, these Opposition moves may be too little and too late in the case of the Congress, and in the case of AAP-TMC, they are undeniably circumscribed by the BJP’s framework of public religiosity.
Yet, in the pause before January 22, that is the picture and those are the stirrings.
Till next week,
Vandita"

The Senior Advocate said he is writing the letter on behalf of the Executive Committee of the SCBA “to request your Lordship to advise all benches of the Supreme Court not to pass any adverse orders due to non-appearance in any matter listed on 22.1.2024, in light of the Pran Pratishtha of Shree Ram Temple in Ayodhya”.
Aggarwala said, “Your Lordship is undoubtedly aware of the significance of this celebration”, adding that “some of my Muslim brethren have also approached me to request Your Lordship to declare it a holiday.”
He said “while acknowledging the importance of maintaining an adequate number of working days, we are specifically requesting that no adverse orders be passed in any case due to the absence of anyone – lawyer or litigant”.
Aggarwala said that “even though the main prayers are in Ayodhya, simultaneous ceremonies will take place in temples not only in India but throughout the world.
The celebrations will commence early in the morning and continue until late evening”.
He said “I understand that many Hon’ble Judges and Senior Law Officers have been invited to Ayodhya, and they may also be participating in the prayers”, adding that he himself will be attending the prayer ceremony in Ayodhya.
Aggarwala said that the Central Government and most state governments, including the Delhi government, have declared a half-day holiday to provide citizens with the opportunity to participate in this prayer ceremony and requested the CJI “to advise the Registry of the Supreme Court to issue a public notification in this regard”."

“He (Chauhan) has an illegal gang… The gang leader, along with his accomplices commit crimes for their gain. There is so much fear of them that no common person submits a complaint against them to lodge a case and no one gives a statement against them… They assaulted a female student of IIT by illegally confining her and then gangraped her. They also threatened to kill her. A case was lodged in this connection,” read the complaint.
The sexual assault on the IIT-BHU campus took place on the intervening night of November 1-2. According to the student, three unidentified men, who came on a motorcycle, forcibly kissed her and recorded a video of her after disrobing her. The next day, hundreds of students gathered in protest at the institute director’s office demanding better security on campus.
The initial FIR was lodged against unidentified men under IPC sections 354-B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and under the IT Act.Later, police said added charges of gangrape after the victim gave a fresh statement.
The three accused told the police during questioning that they were involved in three other incidents of molestation on campus, and that they would visit the premises regularly, ostensibly to look for “opportunities”. An analysis of their call detail records corroborated this, showing their location on the campus between 11 pm and 1 am frequently.
As per their social media profiles and their neighbours, the three men were associated with the Varanasi unit of the BJP IT cell. However, BJP Varanasi (Mahanagar) president Vidyasagar had said the three are no longer members of the party’s IT cell."

This is the first time that Sharmila has criticised her brother.
Stating that Telugu Desam Party’s N Chandrababu Naidu and now Jagan had pushed the state into financial crisis, Sharmila said: “The financial condition of the state is such that we do not even have money to repair the roads. In the last five years of Jagan Reddy’s rule, he has borrowed Rs 3 lakh crore. Before that, Naidu borrowed Rs 2 lakh crore. When the state was bifurcated, we had a debt of Rs 1 lakh crore, now it has risen to Rs 6-7 lakh crore. Do we have a capital city? Do we have at least a metro? Are government employees receiving salaries on time? What will you all say if I ask did any development take place in the past five years of Jagan Reddy and YSRCP rule?” Sharmila said, which was replied with a loud “No”. She said Dalits were under attack in the state and sand mafia had become powerful and were ruling the state.
Sharmila, who was appointed president of APCC on January 16, took charge on Sunday and arrived at Vijayawada party headquarters in a huge convoy. Police initially halted the procession, saying the Congress had not taken permission but as Sharmila sat on a dharna, the police let the convoy proceed.
On January 19, she and Jagan shared a few icy moments when he attended her son’s engagement in Hyderabad. Sharmila also singled out Naidu, accusing him of not pursuing the special category status.
“If Andhra was granted SCS status, we would have got industries and development, and youth would have got employment opportunities, but Naidu failed to do it. He and Jagan have cheated the state… even Jagan who made a big issue of SCS did not pursue the matter with the Centre. The BJP is denying SCS status to Andhra but both Jagan and Naidu support the BJP. Even after 10 years of bifurcation, we do not have a capital city. Naidu did not complete Amaravati, while Jagan has not made any city as capital,’’ she said.
Sharmila who had launched YSR Telangana Party, which she merged with the Congress, has never criticised her brother before."
ME4PW9QUL7_1ER20RG9N5GEU9E,Maharashtra Deputy CM Fadnavis to monitor a special aid cell for poor patients,Alok Deshpande,"January 21, 2024 20:18 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-fadnavis-special-aid-cell-poor-patients-healthcare-9120701/,"While the Chief Minister Medical Assistance Cell is working on extending monetary assistance to poor patients in need, a new medical cell under state’s deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will now work to ensure a bed for poor patients at charitable hospitals run by trusts.
Maharashtra has over 468 charitable hospitals. As per provisions under Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 and Bombay High Court orders, around 10 per cent of the total beds in these hospitals should be kept reserved for poor patients with free treatment, and 10 per cent beds for treatment at concessional rates. The total number of beds that can be made available under this is around 11,000.
“Despite this, we’re getting numerous complaints from across the state that hospitals are not following orders for the poorer sections of society. It was also observed that beds were not made available through a transparent system,” said Rameshwar Naik, who has been appointed as the head of the new cell. Those with annual income upto Rs 1.80 lakh will get free treatment and those with income between Rs 1.80 lakh to Rs 3.60 lakh will get the treatment at 50% cost.
Naik said the CM Medical Assistance cell and this one are two different bodies, and this has not been done to overpower the other.
Since the subject ‘charity’ falls under the Law and Judiciary department, Fadnavis who handles it, had directed to form a committee in July 2023 for effective implementation. The special cell will work under this department. All previous decisions, except for those from the Law and Judiciary, regarding availability of beds in charitable hospitals have been cancelled and all power is now centralised with the new cell.
“The cell will coordinate availability of beds across the state. A needy patient can apply to the charitable hospital concerned. In case of no response, the Medical College nearby, charity commissioner or collector’s office can be contacted. The cell can also be contacted in case of non-cooperation and a bed will be made available within 72 hours,” said Naik.
The documents required will be —an application from a patient or public representative, Aadhaar Card, Ration card, Income proof from Tehsildar and doctor’s prescription."

“I read around 10 books while I was in jail. The only time I cried in jail was when I read in a book about how the kingdom of Maharaja Ranjit Singh was annexed. Now I am going to change my life. Nelson Mandela from South Africa inspired me the most in the books I read. What am I in front of Mandela, who remained in jail from 1963 to 1990? I stopped holding grudges after looking at the illegal confinement of my father, Waris Punjab De head Amritpal Singh and former Pakistan PM Imran Khan,” he said at his first public gathering since being released on bail in a drugs case.
Khaira held the gathering in Bulath in Kapurthala district on the issues of the “imposition of the National Security Act on innocents, fake police encounters and government oppression”.
Khaira said, “My father was first jailed during the Emergency. Parkash Singh Badal sacked him from the cabinet in 1978 after levelling fake allegations. He was later jailed several times only because he was an associate of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was a warrior born once in centuries. Our family loves Punjab. My father was repeatedly sent to jail under the NSA just like now our youth have been sent to Dibrugarh.”
With stories of how my father was again and again booked under the NSA, I want to tell (Chief Minister) Bhagwant Mann who I am,” said Khaira.
Khaira also thanked and praised his political opponents Bibi Jagir Kaur, BJP state president Sunil Jakhar, Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) former minister Bikram Majithia, Sangrur MP Simranjit Singh Mann and Lakha Sidhana for supporting him while he was in jail.
“I believe what is happening with me is also happening with Bikram Singh Majithia. Bhagwant Mann is hell-bent upon sending Majithia to jail. If they do so, I will be standing with Majithia,” he added.
The Supreme Court recently dismissed a state government plea against bail granted to Khaira by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
Amid allegations that the Congress left Khaira alone while he was in jail, Khaira praised the party’s state president, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Opposition leader Partap Singh Bajwa, former chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, and former ministers Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sukhjinder Singh Sukhi Randhawa and Pargat Singh, and Congress state in-charge Devender Yadav.
“We will have to stop speaking against each other. We have to speak for Punjab. We have many issues at hand,” Khaira said. “Our Punjab is getting empty. Parents are sending their children to foreign countries. Every year, lakhs of students are going to Canada. Forget about the economy; our language, our turban and our state will not be able to be saved.”
“I want to ask my party Congress if you don’t talk about Sikhs, how will they vote for you? The Canadian prime minister has accused Indian agencies of being behind the murder of (Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh) Nijjar. The US has also levelled similar allegations. Bhagwant Mann and Sukhbir Badal didn’t speak on the issue. If Sikhs are not safe in foreign countries, how can they be safe in India? Now I am sure that it was not an accident in which Waris Punjab De founder Sandeep Singh Deep Sidhu died,” he said.
Khaira said, “Anyone can come to Punjab and work. But none should be allowed to buy land in Punjab. If it can happen in Himachal, then why not in Punjab? But those sitting in Delhi didn’t allow this. Akalis should have done this. Bhagwant Mann can do this. But his hands are tied behind.”
“We have only one asset in the state, water. We are emptying our groundwater. Give MSP for other crops than paddy. We can remove paddy by using part of the CCL (cash credit limit) in phases. There is a need to open the border with Pakistan to support the industry in the state,” he suggested."
MPWRVRYE02_JLBCA0FV1UZQIBM,Mumbai Coastal road: Challenges in digging the twin tunnels,Pratip Acharya,"Updated: January 24, 2024 19:07 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mumbai-coastal-road-challenges-in-digging-the-twin-tunnels-9120619/,"Within a fortnight after mining of tunnels for the Mumbai Coastal Road Project (MCRP) began from Priyadarshini Park (PDP), the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) had reached underneath the reclaimed portion of the sea after having mined eight metres. It was then that suddenly civic officials realised that the sea bed above them was sinking and was on the verge of a collapse.
“We immediately rushed and sprayed slurry on the cavity, so the sunken parts hardened and concretised, preventing the sea-bed from collapsing on us,” recalls a senior civic official with the project from the beginning. The official recalls that a similar incident happened yet again within the next fortnight, and it was again prevented in a similar manner.
The making of the country’s first undersea tunnel, set to be opened to vehicles next month, has had its share of challenges, from conceptualising it on paper to its execution, but this was a near disaster they encountered right at the beginning.
To complete all civil works pertaining to the twin tunnels, forty men worked day and night for more than two years with a Chinese TBM — Mavala, to dig through complex geological strata, geopolitical tensions and even navigate through pandemic outbreak.
Named after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s mountain warfare experts belonging to the Koli and Kunbi community, TBM – Mavala was manufactured by China Railway Construction Heavy Industry company (CRCHI). Assembly of the mammoth machine and initial digging too has had its share of challenges and was impacted by Covid lockdown.
Weighing over 1,700 tonne and 12 metres in height, the massive TBM arrived at Mumbai’s Jawaharlal Nehru Port from Shanghai in April 2020, from where it was transferred to PDP via 17 trucks after it was dismantled.
Since the TBM was imported from China, the contract stated that a delegation of engineers from TBM’s parent company CRCHI was to visit India and train MCRP engineers to operate the machine while digging the first 500-metre stretch.
However, owing to the pandemic and skirmishes between Indo-Chinese forces in Galwan Valley, the visit of Chinese engineers was deferred by a year.
“Since the Chinese couldn’t arrive in time, Indians started work on their own and finished mining the first 400 metres all by themselves,” said Namkak Cho, the tunnel expert from the Project Management Consultant (PMC), M/s Yooshin Engineering Co.
The BMC, along with PMC staff and contractors assembled the TBM and brought it to the launching site at PDP in a 200-wheel self-propelled transporter and freight wings. Civic officials said it took them three months just to assemble the entire TBM from the day it arrived and in December, 2020, the TBM with a tri-colour themed cutterhead was lowered 20 metres to begin boring.
Digging of the first tunnel began in January 2021 from PDP, and the breakthrough of the first tunnel was achieved in January 2022 at Marine Drive. The boring of the second tunnel began in April 2022 from the Marine Drive end and the final breakthrough at PDP was recorded on May 30, 2023.
Of the total length, around 900 metres of the tunnel would run beneath the Arabian Sea as per the plan, while 1 km would pass through Malabar Hills. This posed another challenge as mining the tunnels through this complex topography and geology included cutting through hard geological elements like breccia, basalt and shale, as well as components including mixture of sand and clay found in seabed.
Officials said the depth under the seabed was very shallow and the gap between the crown of the tunnel and the seabed was very small. “Due to the presence of weathered rocks, sea water would leak on the TBM, to deal with which we would spray slurry continuously to prevent saline water leaking from the gaps,” an official said.
In one such instance, the TBM’s main-bearing seal made of rubber malfunctioned, resulting in the project coming to standstill for three months. The function of the bearing that broke down was to protect TBM’s main gearbox and prevent hard rocks and stones from entering the machine. “The rules state that one set of spare parts for the machine should be housed at the site that would not take more than 24 hours to reach. In this case, we were not anticipating the malfunction therefore we didn’t keep any spare parts either with us,” Cho said.
Mining works stalled for three months and the TBM became operational only after a bearing was imported from Italy. The overall manpower inside the TBM would include a maximum of 10 people from BMC, 20 people from PMC and five more people from the Chinese maker of the TBM.
Civic officials recall that often due to frequent impacts with rock-solid structures underground, the spokes in the cutterhead would slow down. Behind the cutterhead lies a chamber that collects sediments and rocks that would fall like debris during mining. These collected sediments would be transported out through a suction pipeline to prevent accumulation of debris in the tunnel.
Simultaneously, through another pipe-line system, the TBM would continuously spray slurry on the surface of the tunnel to prevent any cavity that would cause a landslide. Slurry is a thick liquid-like chemical component made by mixing bentonite with water.
The 2.07 km twin tunnels are part of the 10.58 km MCRP, a high-speed vehicular corridor being built by BMC at a cost of Rs 13,983 crore. The tunnels originate from Marine Drive in south Mumbai and extend till PDP at Breach Candy. The TBM – Mavala had a working diameter of 12.19 metres, making it the largest TBM to ever be used in India’s history of infrastructure works."

The stance came even as BJP and Janata Dal (Secular) leaders mounted pressure on the government to declare a holiday to mark the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
Responding to media queries at Tumakuru, Siddaramaiah said the government would not declare a holiday but the Muzrai department will conduct special rituals at all state-run temples during the Ram Mandir consecration event in Ayodhya.
“Tomorrow (Monday), I am inaugurating a new Ram Temple constructed at Mahadevapura constituency in Bengaluru,” Siddaramaiah said.
Earlier in the day, Leader of Opposition R Ashok wrote to Siddaramaiah, requesting the government to declare leave on Monday. JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy was also of the same view, saying that a holiday be announced.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already declared a half-day leave in all Central government offices. There is a big celebration being held in the state too. Working during the day would hamper the celebrations. Therefore, I request you to declare one day leave for all government offices, schools and colleges, public enterprises, and other institutions,” Ashok wrote in the letter.
Over the last two days, BJP leaders have branded Chief Minister Siddaramaiah as ‘anti-Hindu’ for not declaring leave on January 22. Congress leaders including Deputy CM D K Shivakumar have defended the government, saying that “we don’t need to learn from others about religion and devotion.”"
NNC1BQRPB2_N8HFTRSDU952UWL,The myth and mystery behind Ram Setu,Adrija Roychowdhury,"Updated: January 21, 2024 18:50 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/research/why-the-ram-setu-debate-has-ignored-both-mythology-and-environment-8222105/,"The Ram Setu, or the Adam’s Bridge, a limestone trail connecting Pamban island off the coast of Tamil Nadu to the Mannar island off the coast of Sri Lanka has been the focal point of political, religious and ecological controversies for decades. Present-day politics around the nature of the ‘bridge’ stems from the Hindu mythological belief that the structure was built by an army of monkeys, led by Lord Hanuman on behalf of Lord Ram whose army was marching towards Lanka to rescue his wife Sita, held captive by Ravan. The structure is also said to be of importance in Abrahamic religions for it is believed to be Adam’s footprints from the time he was expelled from paradise, thereby giving it the name ‘Adam’s Bridge’.
But its location is also of strategic interest. As early as the 19th century, the British had planned to dredge this channel to enable big ships to navigate along the Indian coast or to travel between the east and west coasts. While the British plans never succeeded, the project was revived in Independent India as the Sethusamudram Project. The proposal, however, has been continuously opposed by groups who believe in the connection between the structure and the Ramayana. Consequently, there emerged in the political scene of independent India, a debate over whether the Ram Setu was indeed built by Lord Ram or not.
It is worth noting that contrary to the colonial practice of denigrating Indian religious beliefs, when it came to the Ram Setu, the European attitude, in fact, subtly reinforced the mythology surrounding the structure in their writings. “They had a very cautious policy of epistemic humility,” explains Professor Arup K. Chatterjee, the author of two forthcoming books — Adam’s Bridge (Routledge 2023) and Ram Setu (Rupa 2023). “Colonial geologists did not take any position on the veracity of the myth surrounding the Ram Setu. They were absolutely confident that they did not need to explain whether Ram was a real person or not, but rather looked at the mythography with a great deal of respect simply because they did not have a better explanation,” says Chatterjee.
He cites the example of the writings of Johannes Walther, a German geologist who had undertaken the research on Ram Setu in 1891. His work has also been cited by sceptics of the myth — particularly those belonging to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the political party in Tamil Nadu — to suggest that the bridge was not man made. “Actually Walther did not believe nor disbelieve in the myth. He was confident that an ancient route existed between India and Sri Lanka, that the geological origins of the route were inexplicable by ordinary geology and he also recognised that these corals were not native to the place in which the bridge is situated,” says Chatterjee.
Ram Setu had, in fact, become a matter of great interest among colonial cartographers and geologists long before Walther came to India. Chatterjee, in his upcoming research paper, Do believe in Ram Setu? Adam’s Bridge, Epistemic Plurality and Colonial Legacy to be published by the journal ‘Island Studies’, suggests that the oldest known British colonial surveyor of the Adam’s Bridge was the father of Oceanography, the geographer James Rennel. Rennel published a legendary map of India in 1782 and the following year published ‘Memoir of a map of Hindoostan’ in which, for the first time, the suggestion was made of the possibility of deepening the Adam’s Bridge to reduce navigational challenges between India and Ceylon.
During the same time the mythology surrounding the Ram Setu had become a matter of great fascination for European historians. For instance, the oriental scholar and historian Thomas Maurice, in his work The history of Hindostan: Its Arts and its Sciences (1798), was convinced of the historical plausibility of the myth around Adam’s Bridge. “Maurice thought it was credible that ‘innumerable battalions of apes, or mountaineers had constructed a bridge of rocks one hundred leagues in length and that this ‘miraculous bridge’ was then crossed by Lord Ram ‘at the head of no less formidable a body than 360,000 apes, commanded by eighteen kings, each having under him 20,000,” writes Chatterjee in his paper.
Further, the Geological Survey of India published several articles combining scientific reports with Hindu mythology. While they did not say that Ram was a real person, they emphasised that one cannot also dismiss the mythology. “Reporting on the submarine shoal bridge, it remarked that its ‘series of large flat blocks which so strongly resemble a series of gigantic stepping stone that it is impossible to wonder at the imagination of the author…of the Ramayana that the rocky ridge was really an old causeway of human construction,” cites Chatterjee in his 2021 paper, “Lord Ram’s own Sethu: Adam’s Bridge envisaged as an aquapelago.”
The British attitude of caution towards the structure was combined with the interest in building a canal through the Palk Strait. Everytime they did a survey of the area for this purpose they were faced with two or three unchanging conclusions. “First of all they concluded if the Adam’s Bridge is canalised, six months of the year it will not last there,” explains Chatterjee. “The second conclusion was that it would be tremendously costly to dredge the Adam’s Bridge. Thirdly, there was something fuzzy about the waters, which we today recognise as the existence of a river flowing in the opposite direction towards the sea. Consequently, the surveyors who had no interest in religion, continuously advised against the dredging of the Adam’s Bridge,” he adds.
Due to these ecological conclusions and because even the Geological Survey of India had no better explanation other than the myth of Lord Ram, they continued to put off proposals to dredge the Adam’s Bridge. As Chatterjee explains, for the British, the mythology around Ram Setu served another purpose.
It was the perfect antecedent they needed for building the Pamban Bridge in 1914. “The legend of the Sethu was nearly materialised in the two-kilometre long railway bridge, an extended signifier of India, across the Indian Ocean, into Rameshwaram, en route to Ceylon,” he writes. The Pamban Bridge was built 30 kilometres ahead of the Ram Setu. It was India’s first sea bridge and the longest one till Bandra-Worli-Sea Link was inaugurated in 2010.
The plan of dredging the channel where the Ram Setu is located, though dropped by the British, was once again mooted by Independent India’s first government in 1955. The Sethusamudram Project Committee was formed for this purpose, with A. Ramaswamy Mudaliar as its chairperson. The committee recommended that the canal project be linked with the Tuticorin Harbour Project. The supporters of the Sethusamudram Project argued that it would help develop the backward districts of Tamil Nadu, such as Tiruneveli and Ramanathapuram. In 1963, the government of India sanctioned the Tuticorin Harbour Project to transform the deep sea port into a major maritime hub. The Sethusamudram Project, however, was not taken up any further.
“Keeping in mind the ecological problems and economic costs of dredging the Adam’s Bridge, the Mudaliar committee had advised against canaling this area and had suggested building an overland bridge instead,” says Chatterjee. The suggestion of the committee was indeed accepted but the project was eventually dropped.
However, interest in the project was revived once again in 1983 and, yet again, in 1994 when the Tamil Nadu government updated and detailed the project. By then the Sethusamudram Project had turned into a motif, increasingly used in electoral campaigns. In 1999, the BJP-led government under the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took up the project under pressure from its local ally, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).
In a research paper published in 2008, political scientist Christoffe Jaffrelot notes that in the “2000-2001 budget, Yashwant Sinha, the then Union Finance Minister, allocated 4.8 crore rupees for the feasibility of the Sethusamudran project. The project then began in 2004, under the NDA regime, when the Vajpayee government approved a 3500 crore rupees budget to create a shipping channel.”
At the same time, members of the BJP’s ideological parent — the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — staged several protests against the project in outrage against the feared destruction of the Setu. It is to be noted that these protests were staged only after Vajpayee exited from the government and were targeted towards the DMK rather than the central government.
The first concrete step in reviving the project though was taken by the Congress-led UPA regime which came to power in 2004. The then prime minister Manmohan Singh inaugurated the project on June 2, 2004 and dredging began in July 2006.
Several among those who identified as Hindu nationalists immediately denounced an attack on what they believed was a sacred site. Chief among them was Subramanian Swamy who filed a petition in the Supreme Court. To this the government filed a counter affidavit questioning the very existence of the Ram Setu, which according to them was purely a product of mythology.
In the ensuing months and years, a campaign was carried out by Hindu nationalists opposing the project. Jaffrelot in his paper writes about how the RSS’ mouthpiece, The Organiser devoted its 2007 Diwali special issue to the Ram Setu controversy. “The dredging of the Ram Setu channel on the grounds that there was neither Ram nor any historic bridge is simply outrageous. It is the equivalent of orphaning an entire civilisation by denying the well-springs of its foundation,” wrote Gautam Sen, a political economist and RSS leader based in England.
In an article in The Organiser, Sunita Vakil, emphasised, “by denying the existence of Lord Ram armed with a non descript affidavit in the apex court, the Congress leaders have dealt a heavy blow to the collective Hindu psyche besides reducing a sacred epic that defined Hindu identity and nationhood for ages, to a mere work of fiction.”
Further, the RSS created the Rameshwaram Ram Setu Raksha Manch — a new organisation devoted exclusively to the defence of the Ram Setu. The organisation started an agitation campaign in Tamil Nadu in August 2007 and organised a huge rally in Delhi’s Rohini in December 2007, which was attended by leaders of the VHP, BJP and RSS.
Those against the Sethusamudram Project also mobilised scientific proof in the form of archaeological findings to substantiate the historicity of Lord Ram. In 1997, for instance, Chamanlal of the RSS referred to a set of pictures taken by NASA to claim the Sethu’s existence as a chain of shoal stones. The pictures were reproduced as part of petitions filed in the courts to back the claim that not only was the Ram Setu man-made, it was also 1.75 million years old, the period of the Ramayana. Later, NASA clarified on record that the pictures, though taken by them, were being misrepresented. “The mysterious bridge was nothing more than a 30-km long, naturally occurring chain of sandbanks called ‘Adam’s bridge’ NASA had been taking pictures of these shoals for years. Its images of these shoals had never resulted in any scientific discovery in the area,” stated Mark Hess, a NASA official in 2002, as cited by Jaffrelot.
In 2007, a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated that the Ram Setu was nothing more than a natural formation. The government of India, with the support of the ASI filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that there was no historical proof of the structure being built by Lord Ram.
In January 2021, the Narendra Modi government announced a three-year long scientific expedition to ascertain whether the Ram Setu is a man-made structure or not and whether its dates corroborate with that of the Ramayana.
Interestingly, the debate on Ram Setu has now become a tussle between political parties over the veracity of the Ramayana epic. “In the process both sides have created new myths of their own,” says Chatterjee. He emphasises that those in support of the Sethusamudram Project overlook the fact that the Ram Setu cannot be dredged easily, is economically disastrous to India, and the fact that it would have huge environmental ramifications. Those opposing the project in fear of it destroying a Hindu sacred site, meanwhile, overlook many details in the Ramayana epic that are of key importance in understanding the Ram Setu.
Nilesh Nilkanth Oak, author of ‘The Historic Rama: Indian Civilisation at the End of Pleistocene’, says that while we do not know the exact location of the Ram Setu, if description of the route as given in Valmiki’s Ramayana is to be believed, then it is not located between India and Sri Lanka as is popularly believed. “As per the descriptions in Valmiki’s writings, the Vanar Sena went through the Western Ghats to reach where Kerala is today. After that, Hanuman is believed to have gone to Mahendra Parvat which is near the Kerala and Tamil Nadu border and from there he jumped towards Lanka,” he explains. “The plausible location of Lanka by that logic would be somewhere in the south west region of Kerala, close to where Male is located today,” he adds.
Speaking about how the location of the Ram Setu between India and Sri Lanka acquired popularity, Oak says it seems to have found references in the Puranas, which though of ancient origins were frequently updated as newer versions of the epics were written across the subcontinent.
Oak also says that the original name of the Ram Setu was Nala Setu, after Nala, the vanara who is known to have engineered the bridge to Lanka. That is how it is mentioned both in Valmiki’s Ramayana and in the Ramopakhyana of the Mahabharata. “It is in reverence to Lord Ram that the name ‘Ram Setu’ acquired popularity later,” he says.
Despite the details of the epic contradicting the popular imagination of the Ram Setu, Oak believes that one cannot disregard the popular faith of a community either. He emphasises, “regardless of whether I agree or not with the claim that the structure between India and Sri Lanka is Ram Setu, the value of its assumption by those who believe and revere it is the same as what Jerusalem would be for Jews or Mecca for Muslims.”"
NS8Z6K9J4R_QFQTX0T9EKJVEEA,"Brutally cold weather, storms lead to at least 61 deaths in US",_,"Updated: January 21, 2024 08:07 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/brutally-cold-weather-storms-lead-at-least-61-deaths-us-9119724/,"Arctic weather brought more misery to much of the US on Saturday, especially for people unaccustomed to such bitter cold in places like Memphis, Tennessee, where residents were urged to boil water and some had no water at all after freezing temperatures broke water mains across the city. Temperatures weren’t expected to rise until after the weekend.
The bracing cold followed a week of storms blamed for at least 61 deaths around the US, many involving hypothermia or road accidents.
At the Four Way Grill in Memphis, owner Patrice Bates Thompson said the water problems have closed their soul food kitchen for days.
“This is our staple, and this is what basically drives the force of my family financially,” Thompson told Fox-13 Memphis. “We depend on business, and we have been at home.”
So many pipes broke in Memphis that water pressure fell throughout the city. Concerned about possible contamination, Memphis Light, Gas & Water urged its more than 400,000 customers to boil water for drinking or teeth-brushing or use bottled supplies on Saturday while crews worked around the clock to make repairs.
“Our production and treatment of water is working well,” the utility said in an email. “We cannot give restoration estimates until all leaks are identified.”
The utility said more than 100 employees volunteered Saturday to identify breaks, and residents were urged to report leaks in the street, at homes and in unoccupied buildings.
Without water since Thursday morning, Pamela Wells was visited Saturday by a worker who asked whether they had a leak.
“My husband said, ‘How can we have a leak, if we don’t have any water?’” she said.
They had filled a bathtub with water to flush toilets with when they noticed the pressure dropping, Wells said. For everything else they were using a dwindling supply of bottled water until their street became passable on Saturday and friends brought in fresh supplies.
“It’s been a struggle,” she said, recalling how they lost water for a 10-day stretch in December 2022. “You don’t know how long it’ll be out.”
Meanwhile, the Memphis City Council opened seven bottled water distribution stations on Saturday, one in each council district. Two others were operating at fire stations. One had 300 cars lined up when it opened on Saturday, Shelby County Emergency Management Director Brenda Jones said in a telephone interview.
“You have people with absolutely no water, people with low water pressure, and you have the boil water advisory,” she said.
A huge swath of the U.S. was under wind chill advisories, from Montana into central Florida. It was particularly harsh in the Midwest. The wind made it feel like minus 16 degrees (minus 26 Celsius) in Iowa City on Saturday, and overnight wind chills hovered around zero in Oklahoma City, where David Overholser sought shelter at the non-profit Homeless Alliance.
“Being 63 and from Florida originally, I don’t like cold. I can’t handle it,” Overholser told The Oklahoman. “It’s been very, very rough and painful and I just, you know, try to hang on one day, one hour at a time … it’s definitely scary.”
Wind chills dipped to minus 20 Fahrenheit (minus 28 Celsius) early Saturday in Vermont, where the Stowe Mountain Resort urged hardy skiers to “bust out all the stuff you need to hang on the mountain safely, take frequent warm up breaks inside, and keep a close eye on each other for signs of frostbite.”
Ravens fans unaccustomed to such cold in Baltimore were bundling up for wind chills near zero (minus 17 Celsius) for Saturday’s playoff, but the weekend weather was business as usual in Buffalo, where the Bills called out for more shovelers to finish clearing snow from the stands before Sunday’s big game. Highmark Stadium got smothered by five feet of lake-effect snow in five days.
Snow tapered in the Northeast after blanketing a large area including Washington and New York City. In New York, aid groups distributed food and clothes near an elementary school Saturday to migrants who bundled up in thick coats and knit caps to ward off the freezing temperatures.
More snow was coming to West Virginia, where the weather service predicted up to 4 more inches (10 centimeters) Saturday, along with winds gusting to 40 mph (64 kph), driving wind chills down to 20 below zero (minus 29 Celsius).
More lake-effect snow pounded northwestern Indiana Friday into Saturday, creating near white-out conditions near Lake Michigan and making the busy highway corridor in and out of Chicago treacherous.
“We’re kind of taking a chance — rolling the dice,” Frank Finney told WBBM-TV. Finney and his family were navigating Interstate 94 through Michigan City to La Porte, Indiana.
Tennessee alone recorded 19 deaths, including a 25-year-old man found dead on the floor of a mobile home in Lewisburg after a space heater overturned and turned off, said Bob Johnson, chief deputy for the Marshall County Sheriff’s Office.
“There was ice on the walls in there,” Johnson said.
On the West Coast, more freezing rain was forecast Saturday in the Columbia River Gorge and the area was expected to remain near or below freezing through at least Sunday night. Trees and power lines already coated with ice could topple if they get more, the National Weather Service warned.
“Stay safe out there over the next several days as our region tries to thaw out,” the weather service said. “Chunks of falling ice will remain a hazard as well.”
Thousands have been without power since last weekend in parts of Oregon’s Willamette Valley because of storm damage. Despite work by repair crews, about 25,000 customers were without electricity in Oregon on Saturday, according to the website poweroutage.us.
The weather service forecast above-average temperatures across most of the country next week. Meanwhile, not everyone hated the white stuff.
“It’s fun right now,” Michigan City resident Andrew Smith told WBBM-TV. “We haven’t had this much snow in a minute, and Christmas wasn’t snowy, so it’s fun to do this. I can play with the kids, make snowballs, make a snowman.”"

Police have identified the deceased as Dnyaneshwar Balaji Manale (18), resident of Kharadi in Pune city. A team of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) fire brigade retrieved his body from the dam.
PMRDA officer Sujit Patil said, “We got information around 3.21 pm about the incident. Soon, our fire brigade team reached the spot….. It was known that the deceased Manale and three others including the two girls had come to Panshet dam for a picnic. Two girls slipped into the water while taking selfies. Manale entered the water to save them. But unfortunately he died. The girls were rescued and are safe.”
Patil said there have been similar incidents at this location in the past. “We appeal to the citizens to be careful and avoid taking selfies at such spots,” he said."

Unverified videos shared on social media show people pushing up against security officials shouting “Dina is a murderer!”
One woman, who said her husband had been killed in mid-December 2022 in protests that would go on for months, managed to evade security and shake up the president. Local media reported that she was taken away by police but not detained.
The woman identified herself to reporters as Ruth Barcena and said her late husband, Leonardo Hancco, had been fatally shot during protests in December 2022.
“My husband was murdered here. They killed my husband, and they want me to calm down?” Barcena shouted in the crowd.
The December 2022 protests broke out after former President Pedro Castillo was ousted and arrested while illegally trying to close Congress. His vice-president, Boluarte, was rapidly sworn in but dozens died in ensuing protests, mostly in southern Peru.
Boluarte has faced a constitutional complaint and probe on charges of “genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries,” charges she denies.
Prime Minister Jorge Otarola condemned Saturday’s protest as a “lamentable” act on X, saying it had “put in danger the head of state’s integrity and this is very serious. With violence, we all lose as a country.”
Peru’s interior ministry said it would carry out investigations to identify those responsible."
OR1JKMID3J_4IS6RB2LN0VETPC,Justice Varale – a public-spirited judge with an Ambedkar connection,Johnson T A,"Updated: January 23, 2024 09:11 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/justice-varale-a-public-spirited-judge-with-an-ambedkar-connection-9120934/,"Down to earth and public-spirited – this is how lawyers at the Karnataka High Court described Justice Prasanna B Varale, who the SC collegium on Friday recommended for elevation to top court.
As Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court since October 2022, he has been known to initiate several suo motu cases in the public interest. Before his move to the Karnataka HC, he served as a judge of the Bombay High Court for around 14 years.
While recommending his elevation, the collegium pointed out that he is the only chief justice of a high court to be from a Scheduled Caste. “I was fortunate to be born in a family that was blessed by Dr B R Ambedkar. I am in this noble institution all because of the great scholar and political thinker,” Justice Varale had said at a farewell event organised for him by the Bombay Bar Association on October 12, 2022.
He said his grandfather was taken to Aurangabad (now known as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar) by Ambedkar and appointed as superintendent of the college that Ambedkar had started there – Milind Mahavidyalaya.
“Otherwise a small person from a remote area (referring to his grandfather) could not have even dreamt of going to Aurangabad, and then his future generations taking up the legal profession and adorning the seat of a judge of the High Court,” Justice Varale said at the event. He has also said that Ambedkar had advised his father, Bhalchandra Varale, to pursue legal education. Bhalchandra Varale went on to become a judicial officer in several courts and ultimately Registrar of the Bombay High Court.
Born in 1962 at Karnataka’s Nipani, on the border with Maharashtra, Justice Varale studied Arts and Law from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Maratha University, before getting enrolled as an advocate in 1985.
At the beginning of his career, he joined the chamber of advocate S N Loya, and practised civil and criminal law. He was also a lecturer at Ambedkar Law College in Aurangabad from 1990 to 1992. He went on to work as an assistant government pleader and additional public prosecutor at the Bombay High Court bench in Aurangabad, and as additional standing counsel for the Union of India. He was appointed as a Bombay High Court judge on July 18, 2008.
As Bombay HC judge, benches headed by him initiated suo motu cases in public interest, including a PIL on a stalled project to publish the writings and speeches of Ambedkar.
A bench headed by Justice Varale also initiated a suo motu PIL in January 2022, taking cognisance of a news report about the risky boat ride that girls from Khirkhindi village in Maharashtra’s Satara district have to undertake daily to reach their school. The bench asked the government to provide help to school children facing a similar plight in the state.
After becoming Karnataka HC Chief Justice on October 15, 2022, he continued taking up public interest cases. When a Bengaluru metro pillar collapsed in January 2023, killing a young mother and her daughter, Justice Varale demanded answers from the city’s civic authorities by initiating a suo motu PIL based on reportage of the incident in the media.
In December 2023, he initiated a suo motu PIL after a tribal woman was stripped and beaten up in Belagavi because her son eloped with a woman from a wealthier family.
Strongly condemning the incident, Justice Varale said, “How does this happen? On the one hand we are celebrating Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, and after 75 years this is the situation? We can only borrow the words of Shakespeare in Hamlet and say: ‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark’.”
He also had strong words for the Karnataka government for tardy implementation of laws meant to protect Scheduled Castes and Tribes from being subjected to discrimination.
In February 2023, a bench headed by Chief Justice Varale, pulled up the state government over failures in the implementation of the SC/ST Act. “The state government cannot be only a mute spectator in such matters. When the Act provides for at least two statutory meetings to be conducted in the calendar year, not conducting even a single meeting for one year, is certainly not in compliance with the assurance given to this court…,” the bench ruled. Subsequently, the state government held a meeting of the high-powered vigilance committee set up to oversee the implementation of the Act."

The party had planned to organise ‘Bongo Sangeet Utsav’ (Bengal Music Festival) at Prinsep Ghat to counter a recent music festival ‘Gaan Mela’ which was organised by the West Bengal government.
The event was scheduled to be held under the banner of ‘Cultural and Literary Forum of Bengal’. However, the police denied permission to hold the event. There was no official word from the police about why permission was denied.
The BJP, meanwhile, targeted the state government for not even allowing the party to hold cultural programmes. “Here in West Bengal, only Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her “select few” artistes will hold such programmes. Only those who will be selected by the state government will get the opportunity to sing in state-sponsored events. There is no place for others. There is also no space for the Opposition to honour artists who do not get invited in such programmes,” said Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari.
The Trinamool Congress, meanwhile, said that the police probably denied permission as Gangasagar fair is going on near the venue. “Maybe the police could not give permission as Gangasagar Mela is being held near Prinsep Ghat. It is an administrative matter. Now BJP leaders need to entertain their workers by taking the stage. Their leaders are talented. Therefore, they must keep the show on,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh."

Potts was speaking during a seminar on ‘New Creative Worlds: AI & Robotics at the Frontiers of Innovation’ at the UK pavillion at the International Kolkata Book Fair, which is being held at Central Park in the city.
In response to concerns about “AI invasion” in job sectors, Potts said, “We have been witness to successive changes in our society, and our abilities to weather those changes or shocks.”
Addressing the role of AI in creativity, Potts acknowledged its widespread use in education, with students relying on tools like ChatGPT for homework. Despite concerns, he stressed the inevitability of technological integration, saying, “We cannot be anti-technology, but we can foster a more intimate relationship with it.”
Expressing concerns about deepfake technology, Potts acknowledged its potential threat by saying, “The reality is that some people may use use technology in the wrong way.” He also addressed how AI is revolutionising photography, comparing its impact to the groundbreaking shift brought about by the introduction of photography. “It changes the nature of photography, in the same way photography changed nature,” he said. Dr. Potts emphasised the symbiotic relationship between people and AI in generating novel ideas and solutions. “Simple, playful engagement with these technologies which are emerging as a platform, which is free and easy to access, and usually taking hold of chat gpt or other AI tools are ways to engage with their own creativity,” he said.
In a statement to The Indian Express, Director of British Council, India, Alison Barret expressed delight at Dr Robert Potts’ participation in the book fair, emphasising AI’s potential to enrich the arts. She highlighted initiatives like the Future Fantastic festival, showcasing AI’s fusion of art and tech. Recognising narrative’s evolution, Barret looks forward to supporting emerging professionals in integrating AI and technology into their artistic pursuits.

Speaking to reporters after the launch of annual Tata Marathon in Mumbai, Shinde said, “Ayodhya is a matter of faith and pride for us all. Hence we all decided that instead of only two or three of us visiting the temple, we all in the cabinet, our MLAs and MPs and all those who believe in Lord Ram will go together to Ayodhya soon.”
Shinde received the invitation for the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, too, had received the invitation. While the date has yet not been fixed, the CM said the entire cabinet will visit Ayodhya in the coming days.
Adding that the entire state is excited to witness the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya, Shinde said, “All our ministers and MLAs will clean each and every temple in state. We will be lighting the lamp in the evening at every house, road and lane. All administrative buildings will be decorated. Everybody will be a part of this celebration across the state.”
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said, “The Chief Minister and I received invitation for attending the consecration ceremony… Yesterday (Saturday) the Chief Minister told me that instead of two of us going, we will take the entire cabinet to Ayodhya on a later date. Others not getting an opportunity will not be appropriate…”
Meanwhile, Shinde also appealed to Maratha activist Manoj Jarange Patil to call off his march to Mumbai. Patil began his march demanding Kunbi (OBC) status to Marathas towards Mumbai from Marathwada on January 20.
The state government is committed to give reservation to Marathas and has taken positive steps, Shinde said, adding, “We appeal that since the government is positive on their demands, the protesters should also respond positively. We have accepted many of their demands. They should call off the protest as it will impact the common public.”
Shinde said that the government has given directions to state Backward Class Commission to collect the empirical data and over 1.50 lakh people are working on this project. “The report will do justice to Marathas. The state government is also organising a special session of the legislature in February when the community will be given reservation,” he said."
R196XQIS0I_EL7HZ418BBAGM7V,‘Politically motivated’: HC dismisses law students’ PIL against Maharashtra govt decision of holiday for Ram Mandir event,Omkar Gokhale,"Updated: January 21, 2024 22:20 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-ayodhya-ram-mandir-pil-maharashtra-law-students-9120243/,"The Bombay High Court, in a special hearing on Sunday, dismissed as “politically motivated” a PIL by four law students challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision declaring a public holiday on January 22 to mark the consecration ceremony of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.
The court termed the proceedings to be in “patent abuse of process of law” and said the PIL was filed with “political overtones”. However, the high court refrained from imposing exemplary costs on the students “with a hope that petitioners will be in future more careful in pursuing any PIL.”
A special bench of Justices Girish S Kulkarni and Neela K Gokhale was hearing the PIL which sought the quashing of a January 19 notification of the Maharashtra government that declared January 22 as a public holiday.
Pending hearing of the plea, they sought a stay on the effect of the notification. The petitioners, Shivangi Agarwal, Satyajeet Salve, Vedant Agrawal and Khushi Bangia, also challenged a notification issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on May 8, 1968 that empowered states to exercise powers under the Negotiable Instruments Act to declare public holidays.
The petitioners claimed that the impugned notification by the state government was arbitrary and against secular principles enshrined in the Constitution. “Even if there is no notification on record, the Act itself does not provide power to the State government and State cannot declare holiday,” the petitioners submitted.
“We find ourselves in complete agreement to the consistent view taken by different courts that declaration of holidays falls in the realm of executive decision, which is declared as a matter of policy considering the requirements of different religions and same cannot be in any manner an arbitrary decision. In fact such a decision is to foster secular principles enshrined in the Constitution and take it forward,” the bench observed.
“We are of the considered view that petitioners have failed to make a case of arbitrary decision and more so when the notification of the central government of 1968 itself is not assailed in the petition. Mere assailing the notification without supporting the prayer does not warrant to be entertained as PIL,” the court said.
“We find substance in contentions by Advocate General Birendra Saraf for the state government and intervenors that the petition has political overtones and it appears to be the petition being politically motivated and a Publicity Interest litigation. The motivation and glare for publicity is apparent from the tenor of petition and arguments,” it added.
In response to the plea, AG Saraf argued that the 1968 notification has been in operation for the last 55 years and has been resorted to by the state government to issue notifications to declare public holidays since. He added that in any event the state government declaring a holiday is completely within the realm of executive policy of the government and for such a reason, it is not open for judicial scrutiny.
Additional Solicitor General Devang Vyas, appearing for the Centre, supported Saraf’s submissions and argued that the petition was not “bona fide” and should be dismissed. The intervenors contended that the petition was not maintainable and was “frivolous, vexatious and malicious”.
The bench held that its “judicial conscience was shocked” about the understanding of petitioners who are to enter the “noble profession” on questioning the Supreme Court’s observations as “startling”, and said the petition was “no doubt filed for extraneous reasons”.
The court, while dismissing the PIL, said it cannot be “unmindful or overlook” the proceedings before it and intended to caution petitioners “to be more careful and circumspect when they take upon themselves to espouse such cause and which are purported to be in public interest.”"

Behold Orry – the paparazzi’s favourite and celebrities’ bestie, who effortlessly turns celebrities into mere backdrops for his iconic selfies. After causing an internet storm last year, he made a grand entrance on the final episode of Koffee with Karan Season 8, graciously uttering “what an honour” not once but thrice, thanks to a gentle nudge from Karan Johar himself, of course.
He’s practically the mayor of the Internet, and if social media had a congregation, he’d be leading the Sunday meme-service. In this lacklustre season, as Johar strains to appease the PR teams of Bollywood celebrities, Orry’s brain operates on a constant stream of 0s and 1s, with a dash of witty banter.
With a knack for leaving people clueless about his endeavours, merely revealing his affinity for sleeping with the moon and rising with the sun, Johar aptly labels him as a “human startup”. Orry wholeheartedly embraces this description, quipping, “I’ve taken your shade and turned it into a parade; you’re laughing, and I’m making money. You make memes, I’m making money,” signalling that his next business move could be his own undoing. As he asks, “Who’s the success story here?”
This social media luminary doubles as a philosopher (he’s everything), acknowledging the challenges of staying relevant. As social media and editorial desks scramble to decipher the Orry hype, he effortlessly narrates his tale to the world, divulging exactly what he intends to convey. Memes are just one way of staying relevant. But as he says, “This is a hustle. This is a struggle”. Currently, Orry, accompanied by five managers (“mini-Orrys”, he calls them), orchestrates his downfall in the “relevance room, in the Orry office”, a dedicated space to strategically maintain his star, rather, relevance status.
On first glimpse, his outfit adorned with Orry’s cartoons (later clarified as Orry-jis, akin to emojis), has an astonished Karan Johar exclaim, “There are so many of you.” Little did he anticipate that this fashion choice would unveil the existence of Orry’s three silent doppelgangers. Disclosing the origins of it all, Orry revealed, “I was in London one day and someone’s like, Orry, your photos from Bastian were so cute last night. I am like what pictures? I am not even in the city. And then I open Instagram and there is some boy posing like this is me.” What happened next? Orry hired the person. Regardless of the authenticity of his claims, Orry has demonstrated that sheer existence can be sufficient if you possess marketing genius.
Orry remains an enigma, skillfully navigating the spotlight while keeping the intricacies of his identity and day-to-day activities concealed. When asked about his role as special project Manager at Reliance Industries Limited chairperson’s office, he casually dismissed the question with, “This page is a hoax. A smart clickbait for LinkedIn,” to Hello! Magazine.
Making yet another appearance on a talk show notorious for extracting all the hot tea, Orry effortlessly eludes revealing all his secrets. Expertly spinning a new set of intricate webs, he presents stories that demand further investigation, potentially spawning a hundred more talk shows to unravel the depths of his enigmatic narratives. Perhaps, Orry thrives on crafting stories and facts whose origins he alone holds, leaving the audience puzzled. Orry still manages to keep its audience clueless about what he does. Alternatively, in Orry’s own words, he simply states, “I do my best.”

Warring, accompanied by a few party workers, has been going door-to-door in Gidderbaha town distributing packets containing earthen diyas and laddoos ahead of the January 22 event. Earlier, Shri Ram Janambhoomi Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai had urged people across the country to celebrate the consecration by lighting diyas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had urged common public to “light a diya at home on January 22; that day should be Diwali across India”.
A Congress leader said that the packets being distributed in Gidderbaha were packed in Warring’s office. While one packet contains laddoos, the other one has a set of diyas, cotton wick, and mustard oil. Posting a video on his Facebook page, warring wrote: “On the occasion of the Pran Pratishtha of Shri Ram Lalla Ji, all the residents of Gidderbaha were congratulated by distributing laddu and lamps”.
Warring had earlier put up hoardings in his constituency congratulating people on the Ram temple consecration Meanwhile, RSS’s Ludhiana wing’s Prachar Pramukh Yashdeep Puri said they have extended an invitation to Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal to attend the event at Ayodhya. The BJP too has extended an invite to Badal, added Puri.
Badal’s office, however, informed that he is yet to take a call on attending the event. Social activist Samira Bector too has received an invitation and said that she will be attending the event in Ayodhya."

Ananya had said that Jackie sent her a one-word text which just read, ‘Bhidu’. Now, Jackie has revealed why he sent her that text message. The actor said that he sent her the message because he wanted her to know that he would always have her back.
In a conversation with Humans of Bombay, when Jackie was asked about sending a one-word message to Ananya, the actor said, “It was just to let her know that I am always there. Mere dost ka baccha hai. (She is my friend’s kid). All these kids are my friends. Their fathers aren’t my friends. They were at one time.”
He continued, “These kids, they all go to parties. Even I party. Their fathers don’t party. I like all kinds of music, I like to dance sometimes on my own. I do my thing, so this is where I find my little buddies. Jitne bhi bhidu hai mere, they don’t think that some relic is coming, some dinosaur is coming. They accept me. Because I am of their level. My childhood hasn’t gone. Mera bachpana nahi gaya hai.”
During a podcast with Rohan Joshi and Tanmay Bhat, Ananya recalled the incident and said, “Can I tell what happened with me about Jackie sir? He just randomly texted me saying ‘Bhidu’. I asked him, ‘yes sir?’ and he didn’t reply. Then I met him a few days later at a screening or some event. I said, ‘Sir, you just sent me Bhidu and you didn’t reply, what’s up?’. He said, ‘I just wanted to tell you ki main hoon’.”

TASO0E30TT_2IVWST9D0TD5CT5,‘Don’t care’: Adhir as TMC eyes 42 seats in West Bengal,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 08:55 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/dont-care-adhir-as-tmc-eyes-42-seats-in-west-bengal-9120952/,"Days after the TMC hinted at planning to contest all 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, state Congress unit president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that he didn’t care about what the INDIA bloc partner thought and knew how to fight and win.
Speaking to reporters in Siliguri Saturday, the Baharampur MP said, “I don’t care about anyone. Our leaders have already spoken. I have reached here (being a five-time MP) only by contesting and winning. We know how to contest and win,” said Chowdhury.
Chowdhury has been a five-time Congress MP from Baharampur since 1999. “My priority is to contest the election and win. I don’t care what others think and that’s how I have worked in my political career. I know that I have to fight and win,” he said.
The sharp reaction from the Congress leader came days TMC chief Mamata Banerjee told her party workers that they should gear up to contest all the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, including the three seats in Murshidabad district — Jangipur, Murshidabad and Baharampur.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the TMC won 22 seats, the BJP bagged 18 seats and the Congress won 2 seats in Bengal. While Chowdhury won from the Baharampore seat, Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury, a former Union minister, won from the Malda Dakshin constituency.
According to sources in the party, during a closed-door meeting in Murshidabad district on Friday, Banerjee reportedly told TMC workers, “If you all fight unitedly, you can defeat Adhir Chowdhury.”
The TMC, Congress and the Left Front are part of the INDIA bloc, which is opposed to the BJP.
Reacting to Chowdhury’s statements, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “The state unit of Congress is attacking TMC in Bengal. By doing so, it is giving oxygen to the BJP. We are ready to contest all 42 seats. The Congress should talk about seat-sharing on the basis of ground reality. However, they are indulging in politics of pressure. TMC alone can contest and win the election."

The hoardings, carrying his picture and that of his father, had the tagline – “I will certainly fight” – written in Gujarati. The hoardings contained no symbol any party but brought out in the open the divide within the family. Faisal’s sister Mumtaz has also vocally expressed her desire to contest the polls from the seat as a Congress candidate.
A senior party leader said, “Faisal Patel is an individual and he can have aspirations. The party has nothing to do with the hoardings as the candidate for the seat will be decided by the AICC.”

Dabboo said that Saif’s then-girlfriend was ‘freaking out’ and was not very happy about the shoot. The photographer said that she kept asking him questions about their shoot and was angry because of the shoot.
In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Dabboo opened up about Saif and Kareena’s first shoot. He said, “There was a good chemistry. Saif ki wo time mei jo girlfriend thi, wo bahot gussa ho gayi thi (Saif’s then-girlfriend got very angry). She was there at the shoot. She was like, ‘What is this shoot? Why are they shooting together? They’re not doing a film together right now. Ye shoot kyun ho raha hai? (Why is this shoot happening).’ It was a magazine cover shoot. So, I remember she was freaking out.”
When asked if he saw the spark between the two of them, Dabboo said, “Both were obviously seeing different people. They had their respective boyfriend and girlfriend and I never thought.”
Later, when Saif and Kareena got together, Dabboo sent them a framed picture from their first photoshoot. Saif remembered that photoshoot and asked Dabboo to write on it that that was the first time when he Kareena. Before dating Kareena, Saif was reportedly in a relationship with an Italian model, Rosa Catalano.
Kareena and Saif’s romance started on the sets of the movie Tashan. The two reportedly were in a live-in relationship and dated for five years before deciding to make things official. They tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in 2012. The couple have two children together–Taimur and Jeh Ali Khan.

V5EGYR7UI2_W4BQ8RUUN4BVGG2,Manipur: Police deny charges of security forces collaborating with militants,_,"Updated: January 21, 2024 11:12 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/north-east-india/manipur/manipur-police-charges-security-forces-collaborating-militants-9119861/,"Manipur Police rejected the allegations by Kuki organisation that security forces collaborated with insurgent groups in Moreh town where incidents of violence were reported recently.
Moreh is a town bordering Myanmar and it has been alleged by the state government that miscreants from the neighbouring country are fomenting trouble in the northeastern state.
“The allegation of the Committee on Tribal Unity (COTU) and the Kuki Inpi Manipur regarding collaborations with valley-based insurgent groups and Meitei militants disguised as security force personnel in Moreh is not true. The allegations are baseless and misleading,” the police said in a statement.
Two police commandos were killed on January 17 in militant attacks in Moreh, while several others were injured.
Kuki organisations alleged that surrendered valley-based insurgents were allowed to “mix freely” with the state police.
Manipur has been rocked by ethnic strife since May last year and more than 180 people were killed.
The violence erupted on May 3 after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.
Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts."

Based on the 2021 assembly poll results in the state, in which the Congress in alliance with the CPI(M)-led Left Front had fared badly, the Trinamool Congress top leadership offered the grand old party two seats, out of the 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal, in the coming general elections, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said.
“The Congress state unit cannot do unjustified bargaining on the matter,” Ghosh said.

V8GGK667NO_5EEAHKK8L2SAIAT,Missing Pune youth linked to banned CPI-Maoist hospitalised; wants to ‘surrender’,Chandan Haygunde,"Updated: January 22, 2024 08:26 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/missing-pune-youth-banned-cpi-maoist-hospitalised-surrender-9120562/,"A youth from a Pune slum, Santosh Vasant Shelar alias Vishwa alias Painter, wanted by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) for his alleged links with the banned CPI Maoist outfit, has been hospitalised at the Sassoon General Hospital in the city. He is currently under the watch of the ATS.
Missing since 2010, Shelar came back home to Kashewadi slum in Bhavani Peth area of Pune on the intervening night of January 19 and January 20 in a bad medical condition. His family members then informed the ATS and apparently he was also admitted to Sassoon General Hospital for treatment.
Shelar was wanted in a case lodged at by Thane unit of the state ATS in 2011 under sections of the IPC and UAPA. A top ATS officer confirmed that Shelar has been traced. Sassoon hospital authorities said Shelar is suffering from medical problems and is being provided treatment accordingly. Sources close to Shelar’s family said he wants to surrender.
A school dropout after ninth class and known for his drawings and paintings, Santosh Shelar was alleged to be associated with the Pune based cultural outfit Kabir Kala Manch (KKM), which according to the police is a “Maoist front organisation”.
Police said Shelar has been missing for over a decade. A “missing report” lodged by Shelar’s family with the Khadak police station in Pune on January 10, 2011 stated that he left home on November 7, 2010 saying he was going to Mumbai to work on an exhibition for two months, but did not return thereafter. He was 20 years old at that time.
As per police records, one more youth identified as Prashant Kamble of Pune’s Tadiwala Road slums, had gone missing along with Shelar and he too is alleged to have joined the banned CPI-Maoist.
In mid 2011, Shelar and Kamble were booked by Maharashtra ATS along with 14 other persons, including an alleged top CPI Maoist operative Angela Sontakke and a few artists of the Pune based cultural group Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) for their alleged links to the banned maoist group. According to the ATS, Angela and her husband Milind alias Deepak Teltumbe (central committee member of CPI-Maoist, who was gunned down in a police encounter in Gadchiroli in November 2021) had allegedly indoctrinated some of the KKM members including Shelar and Kamble towards Maoist ideology.
While Shelar and Kamble were absconding, all those who were arrested in this case by the ATS including Angela and KKM members were later released on bail by different courts and have claimed that they were framed by the police.
Meanwhile, two accused in this case, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor, both KKM artists, who were among the key organisers of the Elgaar Parishad in Pune, were arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in September 2020, for alleged links with CPI-Maoist.
According to a police probe, the Elgaar Parishad held at Shaniwar Wada on December 31, 2017 allegedly received funds from the CPI-Maoist and that speeches delivered at the conclave along with previous campaigns for the event were among the factors that led to the Koregaon Bhima violence on January 1, 2018.
It may be recalled that on May 5, 2014, the Gadchiroli police in Maharashtra had allegedly recovered notebooks, cartoons and literature along with claymore mines and walkie talkies during an encounter with about 60 armed maoists of Tipagad Dalam of the CPI Maoist in Murzar jungles in the jurisdiction of Purada police station.
Police said the index of one of these notebooks had a signature of “Vishwa”, which is suspected to be the “revolutionary name” given by Maoists to Santosh Shelar. Police said along with the notebook, cartoons, drawings drawn by Vishwa were also found.
Some of the Maoists who surrendered in Gadchiroli had allegedly told police that Shelar had been named as “Vishwa” by the banned party and was also called “painter” by the cadres because of his expertise in painting. They had also revealed that Kamble was named as “Madhukar” and “Madhu” by the Maoist party and is also called “Laptop”, because of his expertise in handling and repairing electronic items.
Police said Kamble was then part of the technical team of CPI- Maoists and Shelar was part of ‘platoon number 56 or platoon B’ of North Gadchiroli Gondia Division of the banned party and allegedly carried a 12 bore shotgun.
Police probe revealed that Shelar alias Vishwa allegedly became the deputy commander of the Tanda Area Committee of CPI-Maoist, which is active in the jungles of Chattisgarh’s Rajnandgaon district.
A list prepared by Chhattisgarh police about “active Maoist operatives in Rajnandgaon as per the situation dated March 25, 2019”, included a name “Vishwa, age 28, resident of Pune, Maharashtra” with Shelar’s photograph in the green uniform that Maoist guerrillas wear in jungles.
The list accessed by The Indian Express, has several names and mentions 14 persons under the “Tanda Area Committee” of CPI Maoist, with Vishwa’s name at number four, stating him to be “Area committee deputy commander” and that he allegedly carries a .303 rifle."

The court had annulled the remission and premature release granted to the convicts by the Gujarat government on August 15, 2022.
The 11 convicts — Radheshyam Shah, Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai, Kesar Vohania, Baka Vohania, Raju Soni, Ramesh Chandana, Shailesh Bhatt, Bipin Joshi, Pradip Modhiya, and Mitesh Bhatt — arrived from Singwad in Dahod district to the Godhra sub-jail in Panchmahal district shortly before midnight, in two separate vehicles.
Most of the convicts arrived in a 10-seater multi-utility vehicle that was led by an SUV – the two cars made their way into the jail premises within minutes of each other. Officials of the district police confirmed that they had “tracked and escorted” all 11 accused into the jail premises.
In anticipation of the surrender, the Panchmahal district police had deployed several units of personnel on bandobast outside the Godhra sub-jail since late evening on Sunday. Authorities of Godhra sub-jail confirmed that the 11 convicts had surrendered at 11.45 pm on Sunday.
This comes two days after the Supreme Court dismissed their petitions seeking more time to surrender. The convicts had cited various reasons such as ill-health of ageing parents, a wedding in the family, and crop harvest, among others.
On January 8, the top court had quashed the Gujarat government decision to grant remission to the 11 convicts, who had been sentenced to life term for raping Bano and killing her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The court had said the Gujarat government “usurped” the power of the Maharashtra government and lacked competence and jurisdiction in the matter.
The Gujarat government had released the convicts on August 15 last year as per its 1992 remission policy, based on a May 2022 Supreme Court order in a petition filed by one of the convicts, Radheshyam Shah. Bano had challenged the state government’s decision before the apex court.
Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was gangraped while fleeing with her family from Randhikpur in the aftermath of the 2002 Sabarmati train carnage. In the same incident, 14 members of her family, including her three-year-old daughter, were killed."
WB9O8864TX_EYZBJPLVSJ6NREP,Why Delhi’s slums are the front line in AAP-BJP battle for National Capital,Mallica Joshi,"Updated: January 21, 2024 15:16 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/delhi-slum-aap-bjp-arvind-kejriwal-9120220/,"A clutch of official documents and court orders in hand, Delhi urban development minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, in a press conference last week, accused the BJP-led Centre of “destroying people’s homes and rendering them homeless”. Within a few days, he, along with several other MLAs started visiting slum clusters and jhuggi jhopri colonies where notices of demolition had been pasted.
During one such visit on Wednesday, AAP MLA Dilip Pandey told the people living in the slums of Wazirpur Industrial Area that the BJP was using central bodies and agencies such as the Railways, Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the Land and Development Office (L&DO) to remove slums because it knows that people living in jhuggis vote for the AAP.
With political parties sharpening their attacks before the Lok Sabha elections, the AAP is hoping to retain its hold on a constituency of voters that it believes has been its biggest support base since 2013, when it contested its first election.
Battling the BJP on several fronts, from allegations of corruption in the Delhi excise policy case to a raging war with the bureaucracy in the state, the AAP has decided to take up the issue that hits home for a large number of Delhi residents. According to a Lokniti survey conducted on the eve of the 2020 Assembly elections, 61% of the poorest voters in Delhi voted for the AAP. This, however, was a drop from the 66% in 2015.
In fact, it was the BJP that made the most gains among the poorest voters and won 33% of their vote, an increase of 12% compared to 2015. According to the survey, the data suggested that the highest gain in the segment may have come from JJ clusters and slums, possibly because of the AAP’s jahan jhuggi wahin makaan promise. This also explains Delhi BJP’s targeting of the AAP on the issue.
Hours after Bharadwaj and Atishi started their yatras in two clusters, the BJP blamed the ruling party in the National Capital for the condition that the residents found themselves in. State BJP President Virendra Sachdeva was quick to point to the in-situ slum redevelopment clusters of Kathputli Colony, Kalkaji, and Jailerwala Bagh “How many houses has Arvind Kejriwal given to the poor during his tenure?” he asked.
Sachdeva went on to list the benefits that people had got because of the Centre. “Modi government is continuously providing free ration to 72 lakh people in Delhi. It has provided around two lakh free Ujjwala gas connections and provided Sunidhi employment loans to lakhs of poor. On the contrary, despite the promise, Kejriwal has neither allowed the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to reach the real poor living in rented houses nor given them free electricity and water connections,” he said.
The BJP’s attempt is to highlight not just the housing crisis but also the loophole that those living on rent do not get the benefit of free power and water as landlords do not pass them on to the tenants, a sour point for the poorest of the poor in the city.
The AAP, meanwhile, is focusing on turning its biggest weakness — that the elected government does not have the power of land and police — into its strength on the issue. “All homes that are being demolished are on land owned by the Centre. The Delhi government owns very little land; most of it is with DDA and Railways. If they are the ones who remove the homes of people, they also have to be the ones to provide alternative living arrangements. The people of Delhi know and understand this,” said a senior party leader.
Bharadwaj, meanwhile, has accused the Centre of removing even those houses that were built before January 1, 2006, and are protected under Supreme Court guidelines. “The houses near Sundar Nursery were part of this list but the court was misled. We have documentary proof of this. The Centre wants to empty the houses irrespective of whether it is legal or not. We vehemently oppose this and our fight for the people of Delhi will continue,” he said.
With the Ayodhya Ram Mandir being at the centre of political discourse in the country — the Delhi government has also announced a three-day Ramlila in the city starting Saturday — the AAP is keen on bringing the slum demolition into focus.
“A lot of people living in these areas are misled into believing that we are carrying out the demolition. In Sundar Nursery, for example, the people were told it was the MCD which was razing their houses. This is why these visits are important. We want to tell people that MCD has been ordered to send machines, the orders are coming from the Centre and cannot be disobeyed. Residents of these areas are happy with AAP and the BJP wants to take that away,” said a party leader.
Another survey by Lokniti CSDS conducted in October last year said that while 52.4% of residents of slum clusters and unauthorised colonies were fully satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the Narendra Modi-led Central government over the last four years, this figure was 61.7% for the AAP government in Delhi since 2020."

The parties are caught between the inevitable rock and a hard place as the BJP will frame their absence in political terms. These Opposition parties cannot go to the event as all of them believe the Sangh Parivar has turned it into a political event with the Lok Sabha elections in view. The Congress and the Left have publicly called the consecration ceremony a political event while leaders such as Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar have politely turned down the invitations saying they will visit the temple at a later date. Other INDIA leaders such as Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar have remained silent on the issue.
On Monday, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on a Manipur to Mumbai yatra, will be in Nagaon district of Assam. There, he was scheduled to pay a visit to the Batadrava Than/Sattra (monastery) in Nagaon, which is the birthplace of renowned Vaishnavite saint-reformer Srimanta Sankardeva. But Nagaon MP Pradyut Bordoloi on Sunday said the Batadrava Than Management Committee had “forbidden” Rahul from visiting the shrine. Bordoloi alleged it had been done under pressure from the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led BJP government in Assam.
“We are happy that Rahul Gandhi will visit the Than, but tomorrow around 10,000 people will gather here. At that time we do not want Rahul Gandhi to come here, because there may be some difficulties in the process of welcoming him. Today the Karnadhar Committee of Batadrava Than Management Committee has decided that he can come tomorrow after 3 pm and we will be able to give him a grand welcome. We have already informed the local MLA, District Commissioner and SP,” news agency ANI quoted the Committee’s president Jogendra Narayan Dev Mahanta as saying.
Sankardeva propagated a form of Bhakti called Ekasharana Naam Dharma and espoused a society based on equality and fraternity, free from caste differences, orthodox Brahmanical rituals, and sacrifices. His teaching focused on prayer and chanting (naam) instead of idol worship. His dharma was based on the four components of deva (god), naam (prayers), bhaktas (devotees), and guru (teacher).
“Sri Sri Sankardev was one of India’s greatest religious leaders, social reformers and cultural figures. A 15th-16th century personality he continues to be a source of inspiration to people not only in Assam but all over our country. His life and teachings have acquired even greater significance now,” said Congress communications head Jairam Ramesh.
The AAP, which has flirted with Hindutva in the past, announced it would organise Shobha yatras across Delhi on Monday which will be attended by its senior leaders. It will also organise community kitchens.
Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had already announced that she will visit the Kalighat temple in Kolkata to offer prayers to Goddess Kali and then lead an all-faith rally. The framing for her is different given the mixed nature of her support base. The “Sarba Dharma” rally will see religious leaders from all faiths in attendance and cover different shrines, before culminating at the Park Circus Maidan, which is in a minority-dominated area.
“I will first visit the Kali Mandir on my own. Then I will do an interfaith rally from Hazra to Park Circus Maidan and hold a meeting there. We will cover mosques, temples, churches and gurdwaras along the way. Everybody is welcome to join. People of all faiths will be there at the rally,” Mamata said earlier this week.
Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray, who in the past openly spoke of the Sena’s participation in the demolition of the Babri Masjid, will visit the Kalaram temple in Nashik. On his visit to Maharashtra on January 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the temple located in the Panchavati area, which finds mention in the Ramayana.
Not all leaders of the INDIA alliance, however, will be visiting temples. On Monday, Akhilesh will be in Lucknow. Party sources said he would visit the Janeshwar Mishra Park to pay tribute to the late socialist leader on his death anniversary. Later, he will attend a couple of meetings at the party office in the city. The Janata Dal (United) is organising a three-day event from January 22 to 24 to mark the birth anniversary of socialist icon Karpoori Thakur. On Monday, several of its leaders, as well as those of friendly socialist parties, will attend an event in Karpoori Gram, kickstarting the three-day celebrations."

After appearing on the show, Vicky Jain’s mother, Rajani Jain, in a bunch of interviews with the media, has been speaking against Ankita. Bigg Boss 17’s host and actor Salman Khan is certainly not happy with this. In the recent Weekend Ka Vaar episode, when Ankita Lokhande’s mother and Vicky Jain’s sister Reshu Jain became a part of the show, Salman asked about the surprising revelations made by Vicky’s mother last week.
For the unversed Vicky Jain’s mother, in her interviews, mentioned that the family was against the couple’s union from the beginning and also shared that Vicky has been taking care of Ankita financially.

Host Salman asked Reshu why Rajani Jain wasn’t here this time, to which Reshu said that she was unwell and had been keeping a fast. Salman asked Reshu about Rajani’s comments where she said the family was against Ankita and Vicky’s marriage. Reshu shared that it was untrue as the whole family was in support of their union from the beginning. Ankita’s mother added that the family came to their residence for a roka. Ankita’s mother said she was surprised at Rajani’s words and mentioned again and again how Ankita is the happiest when she goes to Vicky’s home in Bilaspur.
Reshu added on the Bigg Boss stage that many people and relatives were calling up Vicky’s parents to talk about the couple’s fights on the show. This made Salman speak strongly against them; the actor said such people should be cut out of one’s life like ‘gangrene’.
“They are jealous, they are poking your mother and she is getting poked. If they say how Ankita entered such a ‘big family’, does she belong to a smaller family? Aapke parivaar ko koi nhi jaanta tha, Bilaspur mein koi nhi janta tha. Isko Hindustan mein bachcha bachcha janta hai (No one knew your family, even in Bilaspur. Now, every kid in India knows him (Vicky),” said Salman.
Salman added that Ankita has been offered the show many times but she only wanted to appear on it with Vicky.

Panihati Sanatan Mancha has taken this initiative to create a massive diya, which has been kept for public viewing. The lamp, which is 14 ft long, 8 ft in diameter and 4.5 f tall, has been made by artist Radharaman Pal, who is a resident of the Panihati area in North 24 Parganas district.
“We have taken this initiative so that people here get a chance to celebrate the occasion in a unique way. The inauguration of Ram Temple is a historic moment for the people of the country. Therefore, we will light this massive diya on January 22 to mark the occasion,” said Joy Saha, local BJP leader while speaking to The Indian Express.
Leader of Opposition in state Assembly Suvendu Adhikari inaugurated the lamp on January 18. Since then it has been kept open for public viewing. The organisation also plans to distribute 50,000 earthen diyas to the people in the run-up to the event. “Every day, we distribute around 500 diyas to the people. A large number of people will assemble on January 22 to attend the event when it will be lit,” added Saha.
Both the BJP and Hindu Jagran Manch have planned several rallies across the state on that day to celebrate the occasion. Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress has planned to conduct harmony rallies on the same day to spread the message of communal harmony."
YN0X50N81B_23XUOL7T9UX5TBZ,"What is the India-Myanmar border Free Movement Regime, which the Centre is planning to end?",Deeptiman Tiwary,"Updated: January 23, 2024 08:06 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-myanmar-border-free-movement-regime-explained-9120124/,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday (January 20) announced that the Centre has decided to fence the entire length of the India-Myanmar border to stop the free movement of people. The two countries share a largely unfenced 1,643 km border, which goes through the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.
Shah said in Guwahati: “Our border with Myanmar is an open border. The Narendra Modi government has taken a decision that the India-Myanmar border will be secure and the whole border will be fenced like the Bangladesh border. The government is reconsidering our Free Movement Regime (FMR) agreement with Myanmar, and is going to end this ease of coming and going.”
The FMR agreement was implemented in 2018. What was the rationale behind it and why was there some discussion around withdrawing it last year, amid the ongoing ethnic conflict between Meiteis and Kukis in Manipur?
The FMR is a mutually agreed arrangement between the two countries that allows tribes living along the border on either side to travel up to 16 km inside the other country without a visa.
It was implemented in 2018 as part of the Narendra Modi government’s Act East policy, at a time when diplomatic relations between India and Myanmar were on the upswing. In fact, the FMR was to be put in place in 2017 itself but was deferred due to the Rohingya refugee crisis that erupted that August.
But why was such a regime conceptualised?
The border between India and Myanmar was demarcated by the British in 1826, without seeking the opinion of the people living in the region. The border effectively divided people of the same ethnicity and culture into two nations without their consent. The current India-Myanmar Border reflects the line the British drew.
People in the region have strong ethnic and familial ties across the border. In Manipur’s Moreh region, there are villages where some homes are in Myanmar. In Nagaland’s Mon district, the border actually passes through the house of the chief of Longwa village, splitting his home into two.
Apart from facilitating people-to-people contact, the FMR was supposed to provide impetus to local trade and business. The region has a long history of trans-border commerce through customs and border haats. Given the low-income economy, such exchanges are vital for the sustenance of local livelihoods. For border people in Myanmar too, Indian towns are closer for business, education, and healthcare than those in their own country.
The illegal migration of tribal Kuki-Chin peoples into India from Myanmar is one of the key issues in the ongoing Manipur conflict. While the Meiteis have accused these illegal migrants and the alleged “narco-terror network” along the India-Myanmar Border (IMB) of fomenting trouble in the state, the Kukis have blamed the Meiteis and Chief Minister N Biren Singh, a Meitei himself, of using this as a pretext for “ethnic cleansing”.
Amid this charged and sensitive debate in the state, questions have been raised about the FMR.
Although beneficial to local people and helpful in improving Indo-Myanmar ties, it has been criticised in the past for unintentionally aiding illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and gun running.
The border runs through forested and undulating terrain, is almost entirely unfenced, and difficult to monitor. In Manipur, less than 6 km of the border is fenced.
Since the military coup in Myanmar on February 1, 2021, the ruling junta has launched a campaign of persecution against the Kuki-Chin peoples. This has pushed large numbers of Myanmarese tribals across the country’s western border into India, especially into Manipur and Mizoram, where they have sought shelter. Mizoram, where a large section of the population has close ethnic and cultural ties with people across the border, has set up camps for more than 40,000 refugees, despite protests from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.
Manipur too has received a chunk of illegal migrants in the last few months. A committee set up by the state government to identify such migrants in 2023 put their number at 2,187. In September 2022, 5,500 illegal immigrants were caught in Moreh, and 4,300 were pushed back, sources said. Biometrics of these individuals have been recorded.
In 2023, Manipur Chief Secretary Vineet Joshi wrote to the Assam Rifles, expressing concern over reports of 718 new infiltrations from Myanmar, and asked the paramilitary force to identify and deport them.
The Manipur government has alleged that village chiefs have been illegally settling migrants from Myanmar in new villages in the hills, leading to deforestation. An eviction drive against these new villages became the flashpoint between Kukis in the hills and the government last March, leading to violence in the state. The Kuki and Naga peoples live in the hills that surround the Imphal valley, whereas the valley itself is home to the majority Meiteis.
On May 2, 2023, a day before the violence erupted in Manipur, Chief Minister Biren Singh said at a press conference in Imphal: “Illegal immigration from Myanmar to Manipur is such that we have so far detained 410 people from that country who have been staying in the state without proper documents. There is an additional 2,400 of them seeking shelter in detention homes along the border areas…who have fled Myanmar…”
He added: “We have reasons to believe that there must be many more Myanmarese residing illegally in Manipur… In the larger interests of the nation and the state and for security purposes, I appeal to the people residing in the border areas where infiltration can take place to cooperate so that details of such immigrants can be recorded.”
According to a paper published by Anuradha Oinam of the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), several insurgent groups such as the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), and small groups of Kukis and Zomis have built camps in Sagaing Division, Kachin State, and Chin State (in Myanmar).
“They took shelter there, obtained arms, trained cadres, and, most importantly, engaged in illegal activities such as smuggling drugs and selling weapons to raise funds. This is possible because of the porous borders and frequent misuse of FMR. Therefore, managing and administering the border areas effectively is pertinent for reducing drug trafficking and illegal cross-border movement on unfenced borders,” the paper said. (Revisiting Free Movement Regime (FMR): Challenges and Implications, November 2022)
Data from the Manipur Chief Minister’s Office show that 500 cases were registered and 625 individuals were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in Manipur in 2022.
A large quantity of narcotics, including heroin, opium, brown sugar, and ganja, crystal meth and yaba (methamphetamine and caffeine), and prescription drugs such as the stimulant pseudoephedrine and analgesic spasmoproxyvon, were seized, several thousand acres of poppy were destroyed during the same period. The value of the drugs seized or destroyed is estimated to have been more than Rs 1,227 crore in the international market.
The regime has been reviewed from time to time, and most experts agree that the FMR needs better regulation. As the crisis in Myanmar escalated and the influx of refugees increased, India suspended the FMR in September 2022.
Given the interests of the local population, however, neither the complete removal of the FMR nor full fencing of the border may be desirable. Livelihoods will be impacted, and essential travel for health care and education may be hit. Oinam’s paper argued that “it is imperative for New Delhi to tackle the issue by pursuing ‘killing the snake without breaking the stick’ approach.”
Sources in the security establishment said it is not easy to plug illegal immigration or drug trafficking across an unfenced border in treacherous terrain. “Even with robust patrolling and intelligence, people do sneak through, especially when there is no hostility towards the immigrant on our side. FMR or no FMR, it is not an easy task. And all borders, even the fenced ones, are struggling to deal with drug trafficking,” a senior officer said.

Ashish Joshi, Corporator of Ward number 15, has demanded penal action against officers of the VMC, who, he said, “should have inspected and supervised” the boating facility at stipulated intervals.
On Sunday, Joshi took to social media and expressed his “grief at the loss of 14 lives, including many children” while also taking the “moral responsibility” for the mishap. Joshi, who is the corporator of the VMC ward where the New Sunrise School is located, said that he “felt guilty being part of the system” that could “not provide a safe picnic spot to the innocent”. Ward number 15 is also where most of the victims of the tragedy resided.
A first-time corporator, Joshi stated that the VMC officials, who should have been responsible for checking the fitness certificate of the boats and other safety measures should be suspended. “I have decided that I will visit the Ram Temple in Ayodhya only when the people whose names are in the FIR, as well as other irresponsible persons, are brought to book as per the penal law… The officials of the VMC, who have slacked in their duty of inspection and supervision should be suspended and even booked in the case, as it was done after the Morbi bridge collapse when civic body officials were also accused in the case. I am saying this as the representative of the people who have become victims of the system,” he said.
Breaking down during the conversation with The Indian Express, Joshi said that he felt a “moral guilt” when the administration entrusted him with the task of gathering Aadhar card numbers and bank account details of the deceased for the direct transfer of compensation announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as the state government, amounting to Rs 6 lakh per victim.
“I am the corporator of the Ward where most of the deceased resided and the school is also located here. After the incident, the party entrusted me with the task of making phone calls to families to seek Aadhar numbers and bank account details for immediate transfer of compensation… They were inconsolable and angry. Each one of them told me that Rs 6 lakh or Rs 6 crore… no compensation can fill the vacuum that they would feel for their life after losing their innocent children. It burdened my conscience… I have not slept peacefully, knowing that justice needs to be done,” Joshi said.
He added that he had decided to put off his visit to the Ram Temple in Ayodhya because Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III had “settled” the boatmen’s community — which are known to have sailed Lord Rama’s boat in the Ganges– in the erstwhile Baroda state.
“Maharaja Sayajirao III had settled the boatmen’s community of Kevats, Machchis, and Kahars. The Kevat community had helped Lord Ram’s boat (cross the River Ganga). Being a citizen and a corporator of this city, if we fail to safely sail a boat comprising children, I cannot muster the courage to face Lord Ram at his temple… We speak of the Smart City project but it is a shame that we were not able to provide one safe boat for little children of this city. We are morally responsible for this,” the BJP corporator said.
Adding that he would make aggressive representations to have the VMC officials held liable, Joshi, further stressed, “I believe that the lives of the children who have been killed were above the party I belong to… I will put forth my point before the party as well and make aggressive petitions for the officers concerned to be booked as accused… I do not mind if the party shows me the door because I am a human being first and I will stand with the families who are seeking justice.”"
ZQ6SKIZOC8_BEG1GUD5IQ8ZVPW,The other two Ram Lalla idols will also get a ‘pride of place’ in temple,Lalmani Verma,"Updated: January 22, 2024 07:54 IST",20240121,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/two-ram-lalla-idols-pride-place-temple-trust-9120604/,"The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has compensated all the three sculptors, and they said that the two idols, which couldn’t make it to the sanctum sanctorum, will be installed inside the temple complex.
Vinod Bansal of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad told The Indian Express, “We have respectfully accepted all the three idols, even though only one could have made it to the Garbha Griha.”

The trust has selected the 51-inch Ram Lalla idol sculpted by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj for the sanctum sanctorum out of the three commissioned by it.
He added that the other two idols by Ganesh Bhatt and Satyanarayan Pandey will also get a pride of place in the temple complex and their exact location will be decided and divulged at an appropriate time. Parts of the temple complex are still under construction and will be completed by December 2025.
Bhatt and Pandey said they are not disappointed that their Ram Lalla idols did not get selected for the sanctum sanctorum. They said they are proud of their work and claim their idols were unique. Both have been invited by the trust for Monday’s consecration ceremony, along with Yogiraj.
“All the three sculptors have been compensated by the trust for their efforts, which ran into months,” Nripendra Mishra, the chairman of the temple construction committee told The Indian Express.
Bhatt (62) hails from Idagunji, Karnataka, and has made idols of Ganesha, Vishnu, Hanuman, and Adi Shankaracharya for many temples in India and abroad, including in the US, UK, and France.
Son of a priest, he started carving at the age of seven. Bhatt took a formal training from KG Shantappa Gudigar and learnt ancient Indian traditional carvings from Devalakunda Vadiraj. He also studied “Shilpsastram” from professor S K Ramchandra Rao.
For making Ram Lalla idol, Bhatt used high-density stone of Krishna Shila. Speaking to The Indian Express, he said, “I am not disappointed… It was like a competition in which at least one person should win. It is not like that another one is not good. I feel Ram Lalla in a different way. To me, my (idol) is the best… I made a pure Indian traditional Ram Lalla.”
In Ayodhya, he was provided accommodation on a campus near his workshop where he lived along with some of his “disciples” who assisted him. During his seven months in Ayodhya, he visited his family only a couple of times particularly to meet his grandson.

He had started carving the stone in May 2023 after performing a ritual and puja. From the start of work to completion, he kept ghee-fuelled diyas lit. He prayed twice daily, and listened to stories from Ramayana. He completed making a 54-inch idol on December 10 and handed it over to the trust and now it is up to them where they wish to place it.
Pandey (65) of Jaipur is originally from Uttar Pradesh but his grandparents had moved to Rajasthan several decades ago. He learnt the art of sculpting from his father and grandfather. Having expertise in making idols using marbles, Pandey, a satsangi, and a devotee of Hanuman, also has expertise in clay modelling. He has a workshop and showroom in Jaipur that he runs with his two sons.
He had come into contact with a senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) functionary in Ayodhya in 2022 to whom he had shown two small-sized idols (1.25 feet) of Ram Lalla that he had made from a white marble in Jaipur.
In December 2022, he had given one Ram Lalla to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. “I told Pankaj ji (VHP leader) that I want to make Ram Lalla here in Ayodhya. He also came to my workshop in Jaipur,” Pandey said. After a meeting in Delhi, Pandey and other two sculptors were selected and they were provided key guidelines on the idol and also a drawing of the Ram Lalla.
“I imagined Lord Ram according to whatever I had heard about him in satsangs,” Pandey said. To achieve his goal, Pandey used to meditate by chanting “Sita Ram, Shri Ram” daily, performed yagna in a nearby temple and organised bhandara (community feast).
Pandey clicked 25 photographs of his sister’s five-year-old grandson, Raghav, and put it up in the workshop to visualise and depict the ideal features with innocence of Ram Lalla. He sculpted the Ram Lalla idol in a white makrana marble.
His younger son stayed with him mostly at the workshop in Ayodhya, while his elder son stayed in Jaipur. Though his Ram Lalla idol was not selected, Pandey’s makrana marble sculptures of Jay-Vijay, Ganesha, and Hanuman have been placed at the sanctum sanctorum, and pink sandstone sculptures of elephant, lion, Hanuman, and garuda have been placed at the main entrance of the temple. His team of over 200 workers made the sculptures.
On his idol not getting selected for sanctum sanctorum, Pandey said, “I am not disappointed. I trust Lord Hanuman who gave me strength to carve the Ram Lalla idol.”"
