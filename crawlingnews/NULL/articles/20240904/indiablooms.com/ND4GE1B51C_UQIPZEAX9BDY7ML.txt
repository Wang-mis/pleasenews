The deceased minor girl was identified as Anjali.
Kamala Devi, who was injured in the attack, told India Today she had gone to the washroom at around 11.30 pm on Sunday night when she was attacked by the wolf.
"While I was returning from the washroom, the wolf attacked me and scratched my neck and ear. I started screaming, after which the wolf left," she said.
Monika Rani, the District Magistrate of Bahraich, told media that four wolves have been caught so far.
She said forest department officials are trying to catch the rest of the wolves.
Over the past several months, seven children and a woman died after they were attacked by wolves. The incidents have triggered panic in the region.
