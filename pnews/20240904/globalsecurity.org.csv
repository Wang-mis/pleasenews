As the 79th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 79) is set to open on September 10, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities from the island of Taiwan again intends to misinterpret the UN Resolution 2758 and challenge the one-China principle in an attempt to push for the island's illegal inclusion at the UN.
This, condemned by Chinese analysts, is an act to play with fire and go against the trend of history.
Speaking during a press event, Taiwan regional official Tien Chung-kwang said Taiwan will again invite ""allies"" to speak up for the island during the upcoming UN General Debate in pushing for its inclusion at the UN, local media reported on Tuesday.
According to the news report, the island will also seek to deliberately distort the interpretation of Resolution 2758 at the UN.
Resolution 2758, adopted at the 26th Session of the UN General Assembly in 1971, stated in black and white that it ""decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.""
The resolution made it clear that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, including Taiwan, at the UN; Taiwan is not a country but a part of China's territory. It makes clear Taiwan's status as a non-sovereign entity.
Despite the clear statement of the resolution, the DPP authorities led by Lai Ching-te, which want to misinterpret the resolution, is apparently trying in vain to root out the international consensus of one-China principle, Chinese analysts pointed out.
""Lai's idea is extremely destructive,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
Li continued, on the one hand, Lai's attempts are undermining the authority of the UN and the authority of the resolution; on the other hand, Lai is a gambler who tries to risk the safety of the island of Taiwan.
""This is of course an act to subvert the international order, undermine world stability and go against the trend of history,"" Li stated.
Recently, the US has repeatedly distortedâtheâResolution 2758.â
For example, in May at a seminar held by a US think tank Mark Lambert, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and China Coordinator said that Resolution 2758 does not endorse, equate to, or reflect an international consensus on the one-China principle and has absolutely no bearing on countries' sovereignty choices with respect to their relationships with the Taiwan region.â
In response, Lin Jian, spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that ""MarkâLambert'sâremarksâareâaâtotalâdistortionâofâtheâresolutionâandâfacts.âTheyâmisrepresentâtheâhistory,âandâtreadâuponâtheâinternationalâlawâandâbasicânormsâofâinternationalârelations.""
The intention of the US side is very clear - it is to tamper with the core spirit of Resolution 2758, and to achieve the plot of damaging the development environment of China by manipulating the Taiwan question, according to Li.
China has repeatedly stated that it firmly opposes any action that undermines this spirit within the UN system and the international community."

Washington, Sept. 3 (CNA) Taiwan is determined to defend itself against China, the secretary-general of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) told an American audience on Tuesday.
""Taiwan's will to defend itself, as well as our investments in national security, continue to grow stronger,"" said Lin Yu-chang (æå³æ) at the public seminar hosted by the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, D.C.
""We have the ideal of pursuing peace, but we must not have illusions about China,"" Lin said, addressing the audience in English.
""China's intention to seize Taiwan has never changed depending on which party is in power in Taiwan,"" Lin said.
According to Lin, Beijing has only adjusted its approach from using ""shells and missiles"" during Chen Shui-bian's (é³æ°´æ) presidency, ""money"" during Ma Ying-jeou's (é¦¬è±ä¹) presidency, and ""shells, missiles, silver bullets, and cognitive warfare"" during Tsai Ing-wen's (è¡è±æ) presidency.
""Now, under President Lai, China is using all of the above as well as disinformation and legal battles in an attempt to disrupt and infiltrate Taiwanese society,"" the DPP official said.
Lin emphasized Taiwan's commitment to defense, noting that Taiwan's defense budget has increased 70 percent from NT$358 billion (US$11.14 million) to NT$607 billion over the past eight years of DPP rule.
After coming to power in 2016, former President Tsai Ing-wen promoted military reform and ""domestic production of aircraft and ships,"" and incumbent President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸å¾·) is ""committed to continuing these policies,"" Lin said.
In addition, Lin told the audience that ""compulsory military service in Taiwan has been restored to one year starting this year."" From around 2013 to 2023, all eligible male citizens were required to complete four months of military service.
""More than 83 percent of our citizens"" agreed with the policy of extending military service, Lin said. ""Even among young people aged 18 to 29 who may be directly affected, more than 70 percent support the decision.""
On the question of whether Taiwan should increase its defense budget to 3-5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Lin said that such suggestions should more clearly point out whether the additional spending would be expected to be directed at more expensive and superior weaponry or other items.
Elbridge Colby, who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development under the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump, had written an article in May suggesting Taiwan raise its defense budget to 5 percent from the current 2.5 percent.
Lin emphasized that Taiwan has three main defense strategies: asymmetric warfare capabilities, whole-of-society defense resilience, and deterrence.
These strategies do not necessarily depend on the amount of money spent, but rather in their effectiveness, he said.
Lin is currently on a 13-day visit to the U.S., which began on Aug. 31. After visiting Washington, D.C., he will also stop at Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
According to its website, the Global Taiwan Institute is a nonprofit organization that aims to ""raise awareness, deepen affinity, and create opportunities for strengthening the relationship between Taiwan and the international community.""

PRAGUE -- Kosovo's President Vjosa Osmani has defended her country's right to protect its sovereignty in line with its constitution but acknowledged that the success and sustainability of those efforts depend on better cooperation with allies.
Kosovar authorities have increasingly imposed central authority over aspects of daily life in the north of the Balkan country where many Serbs, who are a majority locally, are resisting recognition of Kosovo's independence, which was declared by its ethnic Albanian majority in 2008.
The moves have drawn blunt criticism from partly recognized Kosovo's Western partners as being uncoordinated and unilateral and potentially harmful to decadelong international efforts to help normalize Serbian-Kosovar relations.
Speaking to RFE/RL's Kosovo Service at the Globsec security conference in Prague on August 31, Osmani cautioned against allowing ""any dark force, any state that has malicious intentions toward Kosovo and the region, to create division between us and our allies.""
She was responding to criticism from the United States, the European Union, and Britain, Germany, and France over Kosovar security forces' closure on August 30 of five so-called ""parallel"" facilities in majority-Serb municipalities.
""The situation in the north of Kosovo is very challenging, because according to the 2013 agreement, which requires all illegal structures to be dismantled, [those illegal structures] have been strengthened by [Serbian President Aleksandar] Vucic in this decade and have turned into mafia groups that challenge security and sovereignty but also the very lives of citizens living in the north of the country.""
Neighboring Serbia -- along with Russia, China, and a few EU member states -- does not recognize Kosovo's sovereignty and continues to encourage Kosovar Serbs' reliance on Belgrade for shadow institutions that Pristina calls illegal.
Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti's government has called the shuttered facilities a violation of the country's constitution and laws, an accusation that echoes recent crackdowns on the use of Serbian dinars and Serbian postal and bank outlets by the tens of thousands of ethnic Serbs in the area.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O'Brien this week urged Kurti once again to stop ""uncoordinated actions that negatively affect our partnership.""
Washington has been among Pristina's strongest allies since independence but has signaled increasing frustration with the Kurti government's actions over the past 18 months, when violence has erupted that has pitted Serbs against Kosovar authorities and sometimes NATO KFOR peacekeepers.
""This separation, in the long term, costs Kosovo a lot,"" Osmani told RFE/RL. ""Kosovo has the opportunity to be successful in extending its sovereignty, together with its allies. More communication, more consultation, more coordination is required.""
Serbian and others' refusal to recognize Kosovo's statehood costs Pristina deeply and blocks its integration into international institutions.
But a failure to resolve the impasse through the mediated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is also hindering Serbia's EU accession efforts -- a point Vucic reiterated on August 31 was ""a very difficult issue for us.""

0LGKDFNZ2V_GE2G0JDWMCS1459,Meeting on infrastructure development in the Far Eastern Federal District,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/09/russia-240904-kremlin01.htm,"The President held a meeting on expanding Far Eastern energy and transport infrastructure.
September 4, 2024  17:50  Russky Island, Primorye Territory
Today, we will focus on issues that are crucial to our long-term systematic plans to develop the Far East, to ensure the unfaltering operation of enterprises, and the implementation of investment programmes. Without a doubt, the matters under discussion are vital for improving the quality of life of the people who live in this vast macro-region.
We will primarily focus on improving the energy and transport infrastructure.
Let us start with the energy sector and look into current priorities in addition to long-term goals.
Everyone is aware of a major technological disruption in the high-voltage equipment of 500 kilowatts that took place in the Primorye Territory in August. Almost two million people felt the consequences. I hope to hear about the lessons learned from this situation and the specific solutions to be implemented in the near future.
By the way, an extended heat dome over southern Russia has led to power outages as well. True, to a certain extent they were due to severe abnormal weather, but it does happen, and we must be prepared for it. Swift response must be part of the systemic work.
In this regard, power consumption in the Russian Far East is steadily growing. This is good news, because this tells us that the economic growth rates here are higher than national average. Power consumption increased by 1.4 per cent last year on average nationwide, whereas in the Far East it was up by 3.5 percent. This reflects, as I earlier said, an increase in business activity in the Far Eastern regions where manufacturing sites are expanding dynamically, and housing and social facilities are being built.
We expect energy consumption in Russia's Far East to increase at an annual rate of about five percent until 2030, which means doubling the national average.
Therefore, we need to anticipate these developments by expanding the generating capacity in the Far Eastern region accordingly. We must build power plants and grids and develop respective infrastructure taking into consideration the specific nature of the power grid there, as well as the forecasted demand for electricity in terms of powering businesses and households.
We are working on the corresponding decisions with the Government. Overall, I can say that we must build 2.6 gigawatts of capacity in Russia's Far East by 2030.
What are the key takeaways on this topic? The Energy Ministry, as well as other agencies, will be involved in these efforts. There is a considerable amount of obsolete equipment in this region, and it has to be taken out of operation. In order to reach the required capacity, we must take these circumstances into account as well.
Priority projects include building the Yuzhno-Yakutskaya Thermal Power Plant, as well as almost quadrupling capacity at the Svobodnenskaya Thermal Power Plant in the Amur Region. In addition to this, there is a need to upgrade 270 diesel power plants, including in Yakutia and Kamchatka. At the same time, we need to look beyond this horizon and to draft plans for a longer period.
Let me remind you that there was an instruction following last year's Eastern Economic Forum to draft a long-term development programme for the Far Eastern Federal District's power supply sector until 2050. These are long-term plans, and it is essential that we complete all these tasks on time.
The programme must be based on the General Layout of Russia's Electric Power Facilities, setting forth the deadlines for building thermal power plants, NPPs, hydropower plants, and power generating plants relying on renewables. Regarding the NPPs, I was referring to the Far East, of course. Why not? This is a promising sector. If we can build so many NPPs abroad - I cannot even remember the exact number; about 20, right - and provide funding for most of these projects, this means that we can also execute our plans to expand nuclear power generation within the country.
We also need to expand our power grids. The Government must approve this document by December 1, 2024. Time is running out. Today, I expect to hear reports on these efforts.
We should also look into ways to improve logistics and to increase transport access to the Far East and connectivity of its regions. Understandably, this is a tall order considering the immense territory of the Far Eastern Federal District. The priorities here include expanding air transport and creating new more convenient routes.
Notably, the air traffic volume in the Far East is growing steadily as well. Passenger traffic has doubled in ten years to a record-breaking high of 10.5 million passengers last year, of whom almost a quarter - 2.4 million passengers - used local flights connecting the Far Eastern regions.
Last year, a goal was set at the Eastern Economic Forum to increase passenger traffic on domestic flights in the Far East to at least 4 million passengers a year by 2030. To get there, we need to build and to upgrade the airfield infrastructure, to expand the itinerary network between the Far Eastern regions, to expand the aircraft fleet, and to make airfare more affordable.
We need regional aircraft. Mr Trutnev reported, and I know it from other sources as well, that we keep putting off the construction of this regional aircraft, which we need so badly.
I would like our colleagues today to share with us in detail the progress of implementation of the plans and projects with a special emphasis on supporting air transport on socially important Far Eastern routes, as well as the plans to build domestic aircraft for regional and small aviation. Without a doubt, the new aircraft must be competitive both in terms of specifications and price.
Next, we focus a lot on building motorways in the Far East. Their condition plays a key role in ensuring efficient logistics and strengthening the region's economy as a whole and, of course, improving the quality of life, as I earlier said.
The crossing over the Zeya River in the Amur Region ranks among the largest and most significant road facilities that have been built in the Far East most recently. We must also complete the construction of a bridge across the Lena River near Yakutsk which is another important and long-awaited project, all the more so as this is no longer a dead end destination.
As you are aware, we have set clear benchmarks regarding the condition of motorways. At least 85 percent of the road network in the metropolitan areas and at least half of regional roads must be brought up to code by the end of this year.
Please update us on the progress of this work and on the efforts to improve the road infrastructure which are part of the implementation of the Far Eastern master plans. We are aware that a number of the Far Eastern regions are running the risk of not achieving the goals within the established timeframe. In this regard, I look forward to hearing a report on the plans to catch up with the schedule. In the future, we need the Government and the regional authorities to keep this matter under special control.
Please provide a separate update on plans to provide high-quality access roads to border crossing points at the state border. We are fast tracking the development of their infrastructure, and it is crucial for these activities to be synchronised with the road construction plans.
On a final note, the Far East's proximity to international logistics routes and it being part of the goods flow global system constitute an exceptional competitive advantage, and our plans to develop transport corridors in the Far East must be aligned with the projects to develop the Northern Sea Route which we discuss fairly often, if not constantly.
Far Eastern seaports play an important role in our access to foreign markets and account for a quarter of the cargo turnover of all Russian ports. Without a doubt, this figure will continue to grow.
I am aware that in conjunction with the regions and federal authorities, businesses are implementing far-reaching plans to upgrade and build moorings and other port infrastructure facilities. We should support these projects by all means. At the same time, it is important to expand access roads to seaports and increase the capacity of railways.
We work systematically and consistently to remove the bottlenecks that are stifling the operation of the BAM and the Trans-Siberian Railway. Their capacity should increase to 180 million tonnes by the end of this year.
This year gave start to the third phase of upgrading the Eastern Operating Domain which envisages an increase in carrying capacity to 270 million tonnes by late 2032, as well as a more efficient distribution of freight flows to the ports of the Primorye transport hub of Vanino and Sovetskaya Gavan.
Please update us in detail on the progress of implementation of this core project of major importance.
Let us start with the energy sector. Minister of Energy Sergei Tsivilev is our next speaker.

As you know, we are one of the top 3-4 countries in the world in this field.""
President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan delivered a speech at the Commencement and Flag Handover Ceremony at Air War College in Istanbul.
Congratulating the 198 cadets, graduating today, President ErdoÄan   said: ""In the last 8 years, 1379 cadets, including 126 guests, have   graduated from the Air War College.""
""WE STRENGTHENED OUR MILITARY IN EVERY FIELD""
Highlighting the tremendous progress over the last 8 years, President   ErdoÄan said: ""Let me underscore once again that the Turkish Armed   Forces have managed to overcome one of the most severe tests, a military   can face, with the least damage possible. We not only uprooted that   treacherous gang called the FETO, which had grown like a malignant tumor   for nearly 40 years, but also strengthened our military in every   field.""
Thanking everyone who contributes to building the Century of TÃ¼rkiye,   President ErdoÄan said: ""Our aviators, who are our source of pride with   their wings of steel, also play critical roles in the defense of our   homeland. Our Air Forces take great responsibilities in eliminating   threats to the security of our country, especially in the fight against   terror. We are endeavoring to strengthen our Air Force in every field   with the motto 'The future is in the skies'. ""The momentum we have   achieved in unmanned aerial vehicles is admired not only by friendly and   brotherly nations, but also across the whole world. As you know, we are   one of the top 3-4 countries in the world in this field. Turkish UCAVs   produced by our companies are used in more than 50 countries from Europe   to Asia, Africa to the Middle East,"" President ErdoÄan said.
""With the commissioning of KÄ±zÄ±lelma and ANKA-3, which are currently   being tested, we will be a player in a new league in this field. KAAN,   our national combat aircraft, is one of our most exciting projects.   While developing our 5th generation fighter jet, we are   simultaneously modernizing our F-16s. We use our ATAK helicopters very   effectively in the fight against terror. We will also meet an important   need with our multi-purpose helicopter GÃKBEY and our training aircraft   HÃRJET. In the EFES-2024 Exercise, many of our systems, especially   HÃRJET and GÃKBEY, took part for the first time,"" President ErdoÄan   said.
""Inshallah, we will accomplish our 'Steel Dome' project, which we   will develop as a system of systems, with all its components. If they   have the Iron Dome, we will have the Steel Dome. The Steel Dome will   enable our layered air defense systems and all our sensors and weapons   to work integrated with each other. From missiles to air defense   systems, we strive to produce, develop or procure whatever our Air Force   needs for the defense of the homeland without hesitation,"" President   ErdoÄan said.
""WE WILL NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF PUTTING ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET""
Pointing to the importance of TÃ¼rkiye's progress in defense industry   in the last 22 years in the face of regional developments, President   ErdoÄan said: ""Every sagacious and wise person can easily see this fact.   TÃ¼rkiye is a country that has to take the matters into its own hands.   In the Syrian crisis, we have all seen how the alliances we are a member   of behaved in case of our need. Except for one or two countries, they   even refrained from sending Patriot batteries. They did not hesitate to   openly support the Syrian extension of the PKK and welcome the   ringleaders of the separatist terrorist organization with red carpets. I   do not even need to count here the overt and covert embargoes and   export restrictions we have been subjected to in the field of defense   industry.""
Stating that TÃ¼rkiye has always faced the same obstacles, from the   Cyprus Peace Operation to the cross-border operations against terrorist   organizations in recent years, President ErdoÄan said: ""Always   ambivalent attitudes... Allah forbid, if something happens to our   country tomorrow, it is highly probable that we will face the same   situation again. Therefore, whatever we do as a state, we do it in the   light of these painful experiences of the past. We do not rely on anyone   other than our own abilities and our own strength. Apart from our   brothers and sisters whom we have always stood by us in our difficult   times, we rely only on our nation, we rely on our own human resources.   We will continue on our path in the same way. Of course, we will not   turn our backs on those who want to walk with us, but we will not make   the mistake of putting all our eggs in one basket."""
0S6XROHG70_UTRWK3L7SLQAX3V,EU Expresses Regret That Mongolia Didn't Arrest Putin On ICC Warrant,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/09/russia-240903-rferl01.htm,"By Current Time and RFE/RL September 03, 2024
The European Union on September 3 criticized Mongolia for failing to enforce an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to the country.
""The EU regrets that Mongolia, a State Party to the Rome Statute of the ICC, did not comply with its obligations under the statute to execute the arrest warrant,"" an EU statement said.
Putin met earlier on September 3 with Mongolian President Ukhna Khurelsukh in Ulan Bator on his first trip to a member state of the ICC since it issued an arrest warrant for him in March 2023.
Putin has been sought by the intergovernmental ICC over the illegal deportation and transfer of children from occupied parts of Ukraine to Russia since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.
A government spokesman said Mongolia, which is home to more than 3 million people and borders Russia and China, cannot arrest Putin because it is energy-dependent. Mongolia imports 95 percent of its petroleum products and more than 20 percent of its electricity from its immediate neighbors, and these supplies are critical to the country's survival, the spokesman told Politico.
""Mongolia has always maintained a policy of neutrality in all its diplomatic relations, as evidenced by our official statements to date,"" the government spokesman added.
Mongolian officials rolled out a red carpet and honor guard for Putin at Ulan Bator's international airport as he arrived overnight from the Russian region of Tuva.
Khurelsukh escorted Putin into the Government Palace, where they both paid respects to a statue of Genghis Khan before going inside for closed-door meetings.
The leaders reportedly signed deals on aviation-fuel supplies to Ulan Bator and a feasibility study and renovation work on a Mongolian power plant, and Putin described plans to better link the countries by rail.
Russian media also said Putin invited Khurelsukh to attend an October meeting in the southern Russian city of Kazan of the BRICS group of developing nations.
It is Putin's first trip to Mongolia in five years.
Mongolia joined the ICC in 2003.
Western institutions and officials called for Putin's arrest on his arrival.
""Mongolia, like all other countries, has the right to develop its international ties according to its own interests,"" European Commission spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said. ""However, there is an arrest warrant against Putin issued by the international Criminal Court.""
Russian opposition political activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was released from a Russian prison last month in a major prisoner swap between Russia and the West, says Mongolian authorities ""must arrest"" Putin.
He is one of dozens of prominent Russians abroad who signed an open letter urging Ulan Bator to arrest the Russian leader immediately on his arrival.
""In terms of the International Criminal Court, in terms of the Rome Statute, in terms of international law, Vladimir Putin should be arrested,"" Kara-Murza told Current Time in Prague on September 1.
The Kremlin said days before the trip that it had ""no worries"" about the visit.
The former Russian president and currently deputy secretary of its Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said in a statement on September 3 that the ICC warrant was ""illegal."" He accused those calling for Putin's arrest of being ""madmen.""
Putin's visit is timed to coincide with the 85th anniversary of the victory of Soviet and Mongolian troops over the Japanese Army at Khalkhin Gol in 1939.

By RFA Burmese 2024.09.04 -- Fighting in central Myanmar has trapped about 1,000 people in a monastery where they are running out of food and the sick and wounded face death without medical help, residents told Radio Free Asia on Wednesday.
Fighting across Myanmar has displaced about 3 million people, according to humanitarian agencies, with little prospect of relief as the military, which seized power in 2021, struggles against increasingly determined insurgent forces.
Some of the worst violence has been in the Sagaing region where the military often accuses civilians of supporting the insurgents, who launch guerrilla attacks and melt away. In response, junta forces take out their anger on villagers, rights groups and residents say.
In Indaw town, in the north of Sagaing, about 1,000 residents who did not flee earlier with most other residents have become cut off by junta blockades in a monastery with dwindling supplies of food and medical supplies, residents said.
A 28-year-old woman and 20-year-old man died last week from untreated battle wounds with prospects grim for others, said one Indaw resident who escaped.
""Although people tried to leave, the junta troops didn't allow them to,"" said the resident, who declined to be identified in fear of reprisals.
""Several children are suffering from head injuries. They're being treated with whatever medicine they have to hand.""
Five civilians were killed and six were wounded on Aug. 16 in fighting between the junta forces and the Kachin Independence Army, or KIA, and its allies, as they tried unsuccessfully to seize military positions, residents said.
More than 20,000 residents were able to flee Indaw, but Buddhist monks, children, elderly people, and civil servants aligned with the junta administration are among those trapped, the residents said.
RFA telephoned the Sagaing region's junta spokesperson, Nyunt Win Aung, to ask about the situation but he did not answer calls.
The KIA, which is fighting for self-determination for the ethnic minority Kachin people, has made significant gains in Kachin state and the Sagaing region since late last year.
A three-member alliance of rebel factions in Shan state, to the east, has captured major towns and military bases while the military has also lost ground to ethnic minority insurgents in Rakhine state in the west, and in Kayah and Kayin states in the east, as well as in parts of the deep south.
In southern Sagaing, thousands of villagers have fled from junta raids in Khin-U township, 215 km (134 miles) south of Indaw, since Tuesday, residents there said.
Junta troops burned homes in two villages and occupied eight others, said a relief worker.
""Residents are fleeing everywhere, especially to villages they know are safe. Others are going to urban areas,"" said the relief worker, who also declined to be named for security reasons.
On Friday, pro-democracy fighters in Khin-U township tried to capture a junta stronghold in Ma Daung Hla village but were forced to retreat due to airstrikes, which killed 10 members of the insurgent force, said an official from a rebel group who also declined to be identified.

StÃ©phane Dujarric informed journalists at the regular press briefing in New York that operations have resumed in Tulkarm and continue in Jenin.
""The UN has recorded more than two dozen fatalities over the past week, including children,"" he said.
He added that on Tuesday, multiple organizations mobilized by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) were set to carry out an assessment in Jenin but were denied access by the Israeli authorities.
""OCHA warns that access impediments are impacting the ability to provide meaningful humanitarian response,"" he said, noting also that the movement of ambulances and medical teams has been impeded and delayed since the onset of the now week-long operation.
UN envoy visits Gaza
Meanwhile, Tor Wennesland, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, visited Gaza on Monday.
He described the scale of destruction as ""immense"", and the humanitarian needs as ""colossal and soaring.""
""I unequivocally condemn the horrifying civilian death toll in Gaza,"" he said, condemning also the killing of six hostages in Gaza by Palestinian armed groups.
""Every day that passes puts more lives in danger,"" he said. ""I reiterate my call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and urge all sides to reach an agreement that will bring about an immediate release of all hostages and a humanitarian ceasefire.""
While in the Gaza Strip, Mr. Wennesland also met with the heads and staff of UN agencies, and visited a polio vaccination centre."
12VYKRDHY3_DWTT1DP7NLFCPPY,Analysts: Vietnamese leader visited China to reassure Beijing,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/08/china-240831-voa01.htm,"By Le Nguyen August 31, 2024
Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary To Lam visited China to make sure that bilateral ties are on track under his country's new leadership and to build personal ties with China's top leaders, experts told VOA.
Lam landed in China on August 18 in his first foreign trip in his new role at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, just two weeks after Lam had been appointed party chief following the sudden passing of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong.
At the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi reportedly told Lam that China ""has always regarded Vietnam as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy,"" while Lam described ties with Beijing as ""a top priority in Vietnam's foreign policy.""
The two leaders witnessed the signing of 14 cooperation documents on topics ranging from cross-border railways to crocodile exports. Xi also promised to widen the market for Vietnam's agricultural produce.
According to China's Xinhua News Agency, Xi visited then-party chief Trong in Hanoi late last year to promote the deepening of the two countries' bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership to a ""China-Vietnam community with a shared future."" Xi did not meet Lam, who was then the minister of public security.
This time, Lam and his wife traveled to Beijing with a high-level entourage that included five members of the Politburo, the country's highest decision-making body, and were greeted at the airport by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
Lam was later received by Xi and his wife outside the Great Hall with a 21-cannon salute, the highest level for a head of state.
The next day, he was seen off at the airport by Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong.
The pomp that Beijing arranged for Lam is ""indicative of it valuing ties with Hanoi and treating Hanoi as a heavyweight in its neighborhood diplomacy,"" Khang Vu, a visiting international relations scholar at Boston College, wrote to VOA in an email.
Apart from Xi, Lam also familiarized himself with other top Chinese leaders during his visit, including Premier Li Qiang, Chairman of the National People's Congress Zhao Leji, and Chairman of the People's Political Consultative Conference Wang Huning.
The fact that Lam traveled to China first and early into his party leadership speaks to a relationship that is on track and growing, even though Vietnam had just gone through an abrupt leadership change, Khang observed.
Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Hawaii-based Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, pointed to a possible meeting between Lam and U.S. President Joe Biden next month at the U.N. General Assembly in New York as the main reason Lam wanted to meet with Xi so quickly.
""This is to reassure Beijing of any progress in the Vietnam-U.S. relations and to express Hanoi's deference to Beijing, which is an important element of Vietnam's current approach to the great powers,"" Vuving told VOA in an email.
Hanoi has made great efforts to strike a balance between the superpowers, an approach famously known as ""bamboo diplomacy."" Biden visited Hanoi a year ago to elevate bilateral ties to the highest level â another comprehensive strategic partnership three months before Xi's arrival in Hanoi.
The fact that Lam's first foreign trip was to Beijing signifies the great importance Hanoi attaches to ties with its big neighbor, said Sang Huynh, a visiting scholar of international relations at the National University of Taiwan, in an email.
""Hanoi wants to keep the relationship stable, while Beijing is keen to keep Hanoi in its orbit,"" he noted. ""In general, the relationship is unlikely to take a different trajectory under To Lam.""
Party-to-party ties
Both Lam and Xi are chiefs of the largest communist parties in the world, and party-to-party ties have been exclusively at the core of bilateral ties. The joint declaration issued at the conclusion of the visit stressed the ""historic mission"" of the two parties to steadfastly pursue the socialist path.
In fact, Lam seized the opportunity on this trip to stress the countries' shared communist heritage. He kicked off the visit not in Beijing but in Guangzhou, where late Vietnamese President Ho Chi Minh, the country's founder, trained Vietnam's first communists 100 years ago.
""The stop in Guangzhou is highly symbolic because Vietnam wants to show appreciation for Chinese support a century ago,"" Sang said.
Khang noted that party-to-party ties, which have been active since the countries normalized ties in 1991, have played out well in mitigating tension, especially in the South China Sea.
""Hanoi is in a better position than Manila to deal with Beijing,"" he observed.
However, Sang noted that Lam is less of an ideologue than Trong, so he is more pragmatic in his approach to China."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this morning:
""This is a difficult day for us.
Together with all citizens of Israel, I was outraged to the depths of my soul by the horrific, cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages:
Carmel Gat,
Eden Yerushalmi,
Hersh Goldberg-Polin,
Alexander Lobanov,
Almog Sarusi,
and Master-Sergeant Ori Danino.
May G-d avenge them.
Together with the entire nation, my wife and I share in the families' deep mourning.
I would like to express deep appreciation for our forces, for the brave IDF soldiers and ISA fighters, who risked their lives in order to return our sons and daughters.
I say to the Hamas terrorists who murdered our hostages and I say to their leaders: You will pay the price. We will not rest, nor will be silent. We will pursue you, we will find you and we will settle accounts with you.
Citizens of Israel,
We are fighting on all fronts against a brutal enemy who wants to murder us all. Only this morning, it murdered three police officers in Hebron. My wife and I send heartfelt condolences to their families.
We saw the inconceivable brutality of the Hamas murderers on October 7 and we have seen it again in the tunnels under Rafah.
The fact that Hamas is continuing to perpetrate atrocities like those it carried out on October 7 requires us to do everything so that it will be unable to perpetrate these atrocities again.
Citizens of Israel,
Our efforts to free our hostages are continuing constantly. Since December, Hamas has refused to hold genuine negotiations.
Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with full backing from the US. Hamas refused.
Even after the US updated the deal framework on August 16 - we agreed, and Hamas again refused.
In recent days, as Israel has been holding intensive negotiations with the mediator in a supreme effort to reach a deal, Hamas is continuing to steadfastly refuse all proposals.
Even worse, at the exact same time, it murdered six of our hostages.
Whoever murders hostages - does not want a deal.
For our part, we will not relent. The Government of Israel is committed, and I am personally committed, to continue striving toward a deal that will return all of our hostages and ensure our security and our existence."""

09/02/2024 - 18:30  In Latvia  Military exercise  Capabilities
Information prepared by Communications Division of the Information Analysis and Management Department of the National Armed Forces Headquarters
From September 3rd to October 8th, the National Armed Forces will conduct comprehensive national defense exercise ""Namejs 2024"" across Latvia.
The ""Namejs 2024"" exercise will involve soldiers from  all National Armed Forces units, including Conscript Service soldiers, reserve soldiers, and soldiers from allied armed forces.
To enhance and strengthen the ability to perform tasks in the event of a national threat, ""Namejs 2024"" will involve collaboration with the Civil Protection Operational Management Center, including the State Chancellery, sectoral ministries, their subordinate institutions, national security agencies, several municipalities, and commercial entities, providing necessary support for national defense needs, thereby strengthening Latvia's comprehensive national defense system.
The exercise is organized in collaboration with the NATO Multinational Division North Headquarters. In the exercise will participate allied soldiers from the United States, Estonia, and Lithuania, NATO multinational battle groups as part of the Land Forces Mechanized Infantry Brigade, the NATO Multinational Brigade Headquarters in Latvia, the NATO Force Integration Unit Latvia, and the Canadian Armed Forces Task Force Latvia. The exercises will be supported by the Joint Expeditionary Force and representatives from various NATO headquarters.
Approximately 11,000 Latvian and allied soldiers and National Guard members will participate in the exercises.
As part of ""Namejs 2024"", the National Armed Forces plan to conduct a three day mobilization exercise in September for a limited number of personnel to test and further improve mobilization mechanisms. This exercise will take place in the area of responsibility of the National Guard 3rd Latgale Brigade.
During the comprehensive national defense exercise ""Namejs 2024"", the National Armed Forces, in collaboration with the State Border Guard, will continue strengthening border security measures. It is planned to begin deploying purchased counter mobility materials in nature, primarily for road blocking, as well as fortifying the infrastructure of State Border Guard checkpoints and units.
Responding to changing security challenges, Latvia's national defense system must be comprehensive, relying on the readiness of the entire society and state institutions to overcome crises and resist external influence. The comprehensive national defense system includes not only national defense and state administration institutions but also representatives of the private sector, businesses, non-governmental organizations, citizens, and other individuals. The goal of a comprehensive national defense system is to promote the functioning of vital national functions by establishing a planning, coordination, and partnership system between state institutions, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and citizens. The practical task of the comprehensive national defense system is to assign each state institution specific tasks and roles in national defense.
The ""Namejs"" exercise have been planned in advance and have been taking place throughout Latvia since 2014. The regular conduct of military exercises plays a crucial role in maintaining and strengthening the combat capabilities of the National Armed Forces, which must always be at a high level. The Armed Forces must always be ready to respond promptly and effectively to potential threats and ensure Latvia's security. Strengthening cooperation with state and municipal institutions, various sectoral businesses, and their involvement in the exercises strengthens Latvia's comprehensive national defense system.
For Public Awareness:
Throughout the autumn period, intensive exercises will take place across Latvia, during which Latvian and allied soldiers and military equipment will move along Latvia's main and regional roads. Military aircraft will conduct flights in Latvian airspace, including at low altitudes, and live fire exercises will be held in training areas.
We encourage everyone to follow the latest information about the exercises in Latvia's regions on the National Armed Forces' social media accounts, as well as on the National Armed Forces' website and municipal websites.  During the exercises, an information hotline will be available: +371 28637064.

Tuesday, 03 September 2024 3:26 PM
The Islamic Jihad says the criminal cabinet of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be completely deluded if it believes it is capable of wresting control over the occupied West Bank and annexing it.
The Gaza Strip-based Palestinian resistance movement issued a statement on Tuesday, a week after the occupying entity launched a massive bloody offensive against Palestinians in the West Bank.
""The brutal aggression on the occupied West Bank enters its seventh day, with the criminal 'Israeli' Nazi occupation army continuing its onslaught, committing all forms of war crimes, including field executions, random arrests, brutal torture, hospital sieges, home demolitions, forced displacement of residents, destruction of infrastructure, and the fragmentation of regions, all amid international and Arab silence, which grants the enemy a green light to continue its blatant aggression,"" the resistance movement said.
In the early hours of August 28, the Israeli military conducted its biggest operation - dubbed ""Camps of Summer"" - in the West Bank in over 20 years, deploying hundreds of troops and airstrikes on Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the occupying entity.
""Throughout the days of this aggression, resistance fighters in the West Bank have been valiantly confronting the onslaught, executing heroic and qualitative operations against the enemy soldiers at every point of engagement, inflicting casualties in their ranks in defense of our people, our land, and our sanctities, fulfilling their duty in the face of this aggression,"" the Islamic Jihad added.
The ongoing military aggression in the West Bank is currently concentrated in the city of Jenin, whose streets and infrastructure have been damaged by over 70 percent since the onset of the ""Camps of Summer"", according to its municipality.
The Islamic Jihad further said that the ""criminal"" cabinet of ""Benjamin Netanyahu is deluded if it believes it can advance its plan to extend its control over the occupied West Bank, annex it to the entity, and pave the way for building a synagogue on the ruins of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque. Just as the resistance in Gaza refuses to surrender to the occupation, it will likewise not submit to the occupation in the West Bank, where Tel Aviv ""seeks to build the illusion of a Talmudic"" regime.
Early last week, Israel's far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir provocatively announced his intention to build a synagogue at the Al-Asqa Mosque compound in the occupied Old City of al-Quds, drawing condemnations from all over the Islamic world.
It was the first time for the Israeli minister to openly speak about building a synagogue inside the complex, strengthening the narrative that the Muslim holy site and Palestinian national symbol is under threat from the occupying regime.
""Netanyahu and members of his"" cabinet's ""insistence on portraying the West Bank as part of the entity's map, both before and after the Al-Aqsa Flood battle, is evidence that the aggression on the West Bank is part of a premeditated plan that the entity's"" cabinet ""seeks to implement and make a reality. It has become clear that this plan involves making demographic changes in the West Bank, threatening the security of the region, particularly Jordan and the [Persian] Gulf states,"" the Islamic Jihad stated.
Israel launched the ongoing war on the besieged Gaza Strip on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.
The movement also said Netanyahu's ""stubborn stance"" on repeatedly rejecting a lasting ceasefire in Gaza ""is an obvious attempt to buy time and gamble on changes within the United States to reoccupy the Gaza Strip and advance the plan to seize the West Bank to establish a state for those obsessed with Talmudic myths.""
The regime's bloody onslaught on Gaza has so far killed over 40,780 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured more than 93,000 others. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble.
""We call on the Palestinian Authority to reconsider its positions before it loses the last remnants of the illusion of sovereignty over violated areas while continuing to bet on an international community and an Arab stance that have proven to be impotent and complicit,"" the Islamic Jihad said in its statement.
According to Palestinian health officials, more than 680 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war on Gaza.
The Islamic Jihad also warned Arab countries against normalization of relations with the Israeli regime, urging them ""to recognize the true nature of the Zionist project and its goals.""
""This racist usurping entity seeks land and does not value all the peace rhetoric, except to the extent that it provides time to fracture the Arab and Muslim front to complete its domination of the region and its peoples,"" it added.
Since Israel unleashed the current brutal war on Gaza, casualties have been rising in the West Bank as a result of intensified near-daily Israeli raids into villages and cities in the occupied territories."

The Hamas militant group Thursday accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of working to prevent a cease-fire deal for the war in Gaza, a day after Netanyahu said Israel will combine military pressure with a firm stance on its demands.
A Hamas statement said talks about a new cease-fire proposal are unnecessary since the group agreed to a July proposal put forward by the United States.
""We warn against falling into Netanyahu's trap and tricks, as he uses negotiations to prolong the aggression against our people,"" the statement said.
During a news conference Wednesday in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel agreed to earlier cease-fire proposals, while Hamas refused.
Netanyahu also stuck to his position that Israel retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer strip of land in the Egypt-Gaza border area.
""As far as Gaza is concerned, three war goals: The first war goal was to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel,"" he said. ""And all three of those goals, all three of them, go through Israel's control of the Philadelphi Corridor.""
In Washington, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Wednesday that cease-fire negotiations continue, and a deal is ""basically done,"" except for two sticking points - which Palestinian prisoners will be released in exchange for the remaining hostages, and the deployment of Israeli forces during Phase 1 of the deal.
U.N. Security Council members expressed frustration Wednesday with the failure to conclude a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, amid the killing of six Israeli hostages and the escalation of violence in the West Bank.
""There is a sense of outrage felt around the globe. Outrage in Palestine that the international community is failing them,"" said Slovenian Ambassador Samuel Å½bogar, whose delegation holds the council's rotating presidency this month. ""Outrage on Israeli streets that the hostages continue being held in Gaza. Outrage of the global public that this war does not stop.""
During a meeting requested by Israel about the six hostages killed by Hamas, whose bodies were recovered on Saturday, Å½bogar reminded the 15-nation council that it is their job to push for peace.
Algeria also requested that the council discuss the escalation of violence in the West Bank, where the United Nations says at least 30 Palestinians have been killed, including seven children, since Israel launched a large-scale military operation on Aug. 27.
""It is gravely alarming that with each briefing this council receives, the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel steadily worsens,"" Malta's Ambassador Vanessa Frazier said.
There was general concern that U.S., Egyptian and Qatari efforts to broker a cease-fire and hostage release deal have not been successful after three months of mediation, especially after the Security Council backed the deal in a resolution on June 10.
""Things have only gotten worse for Palestinians, for Israeli hostages and indeed, the entire region since adoption of that resolution,"" Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett of Guyana said.
U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged patience.
""Diplomacy is not a matter of snapping our fingers and â voila. It takes hard work. It takes effort, and unfortunately, it takes time,"" she said. ""It has not failed.""
She noted that diplomacy helped secure the release in November of more than 100 of the 250 hostages that Hamas took during their terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023.
""And it is through diplomacy that we aim to bring the remaining hostages home and finally put this horrific conflict on a path toward a durable conclusion,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""The Israeli people should understand that the deal on the table is one their leaders can accept, because this is a deal that ensures Israel's security.""
Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured some 250 hostages during the Oct. 7 terror attack on southern Israel. The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.
Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. At the Security Council on Wednesday, Israel's envoy reiterated his demand that council members designate Hamas a terror organization.

By Joyce Ann L. Rocamora and Ruth Abbey Gita-Carlos  August 31, 2024, 5:28 pm Updated on August 31, 2024, 5:52 pm
MANILA -- The Philippines expressed its ""serious   concern"" over the latest ramming incident in Escoda Shoal, National   Maritime Council (NMC) spokesperson Vice Adm. Alexander Lopez said on   Saturday afternoon.
This was after China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel   5205 on Saturday repeatedly rammed into BRP-Teresa Magbanua, the biggest   ship of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) deployed in April to Escoda   Shoal, which is about 75 nautical miles from Palawan.
""Well, the   position of the government, especially the National Maritime Council, we   take this with serious concern,"" Lopez said in a press briefing   following the latest collision between a CCG vessel and a PCG vessel.
The BRP Teresa Magbanua sustained damage in its bridge wing and freeboard. No injuries to the crew were reported.
As of this posting, the Filipino ship remained anchored inside the Sabina Shoal.
Lopez said a report will be submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) for appropriate action.
""This   is part of the reports that we will be submitting to the Department of   Foreign Affairs, and then the DFA will come up with its own study to   come up with the most appropriate actions,"" he said.
What happened
PCG   spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said   the vessel lifted its anchor 8 a.m. with the intention of ""loitering   around Escoda Shoal.""
When it was already on the move at 12:07   p.m., CCG vessel 5205 carried out the ""dangerous maneuver resulting to   its direct ramming"" into the port bow of BRP Teresa Magbanua.
The Chinese ship turned around, then rammed the PCG vessel anew, hitting the starboard quarter.
""After   this, it went around and then did another ramming to the PCG vessel. On   the port beam of MRRV-9701, the CCG vessel 5205 has once again directly   and intentionally rammed the PCG vessel,"" Tarriela narrated.
In a   drone shot presented before the press, Tarriela showed that BRP Teresa   Magbanua was originally surrounded by People's Liberation Army Navy   tugboats 175 and 185, CCG vessels 4301 and 3104, and Chinese maritime   militias.
As the Filipino ship heaved up its anchor, CCG vessel 5205 joined the fray.
Illegal presence
Lopez   said China's presence in Escoda Shoal is illegal, considering that it   is ""well within our 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone.""
He   added that the PCG, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on   the Law of the Sea and the 2016 arbitral ruling on the South China Sea,   is merely exercising its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over Escoda   Shoal.
""So, the Chinese Coast Guard vessels are the ones illegally [patrolling]. 'Yung presence nila diyan ang (Their presence there is) illegal. We are there on a legal basis dahil atin 'yun. Hindi tayo puwedeng magpaalam sa sariling bahay natin (because that is ours. We do not ask for permission because that's ours). Let us be very clear about it,"" he said.
Lopez   earlier said the Philippine government is eyeing to file a case before   an international body against China following the recent ""unlawful and   aggressive maneuvers"" by CCG ships against PCG vessels in waters   adjacent to Escoda Shoal.
US condemns China's 'intentional ramming'
Meanwhile, the United States condemned the ramming, saying it was a dangerous act and a violation of international law.
""The   US condemns the multiple dangerous violations of international law by   the PRC (People's Republic of China), including today's intentional   ramming of the BRP Teresa Magbanua while it was conducting lawful   operations within the (Philippine) exclusive economic zone,"" US   Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said in a statement.
""We stand with the Philippines in upholding international law,"" she added. (PNA)"

A far-right Israeli minister has called on the regime authorities to declare a state of war across the occupied West Bank.
""I believe that, at the end of the day, the sin of the disengagement will be reversed,"" Orit Strock, the Israeli minister of settlement, told Israeli Channel 7 on Monday.
She suggested this would require going to war. ""Sadly, a return to the Gaza Strip will involve many casualties.""
Strock has been at the forefront of the movement calling for the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians from Gaza to settle Israelis.
In July 2023, before the current Israeli campaign of genocide in Gaza started, she called for launching a war on Gaza to retake the strip and rebuild settlements, including Gush Katif, which was evacuated in 2005.
Earlier this week, the Israeli military launched its largest incursion into the occupied West Bank in decades, as its forces invaded Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tuba.
In Tulkarm, north of the West Bank, widespread destruction has been reported as several bulldozers accompanied by troops entered the city from the west.
The bulldozers are destroying the city's infrastructure, property and roads. Two hospitals have been besieged by Israeli forces preventing those injured from receiving medical treatment.
Also in the city of Jenin, bulldozers are razing structures, roads and sidewalks.
The regime forces are threatening members of press with shooting and confiscating their news gathering gears in Ramallah and al-Khalil.
Violence by settlers and raids by Israeli forces have surged in the West Bank since Israel launched its barbaric military campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip in early October 2023.
Palestinian human rights organizations have warned of escalating violence in the West Bank and the use of tactics by Israeli forces that the world has witnessed in the genocidal campaign in Gaza.

Russia launched drones and cruise and ballistic missiles at Kyiv early on September 2, with falling debris injuring at least two people while sparking fires and damaging homes and infrastructure, the city's mayor said.
A boiler at a Kyiv water plant was partially damaged, as was the entrance to a subway station also serving as a bomb shelter in the Svyatoshynk district, according to Vitaliy Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv.
At least two people were injured in the attack, Klitschko said, adding that emergency services were dispatched to several districts where debris fell from destroyed missiles.
""There will be an answer for everything. The enemy will feel it,"" Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office, wrote on his Telegram page following the attack.
Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's city military administration, said more than 10 cruise missiles, about 10 ballistic missiles, and a drone fired by Russia at the Ukrainian capital and its suburbs were destroyed by Ukraine's air defenses.
Later, the Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched 35 missiles of various types and 26 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight on September 1-2, adding that nine ballistic missiles, 13 cruise missiles, and 20 drones were downed.
Air-raid alerts went out across Ukraine for nearly two hours before the air force declared the skies clear early on September 2. Neighboring NATO member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to keep its airspace safe during the attacks, according to Reuters.
Meanwhile, in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, two drones hit a residential building and a school, Ukrainian media reported. No casualties were reported in that attack.
The barrage comes a day after Russia's military reported intercepting and destroying 158 Ukrainian drones targeting multiple Russian regions in what was described as one of the biggest Ukrainian attacks since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.
It also comes weeks after Ukrainian forces launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk region, which Moscow's forces have struggled to push back so far and to which the Kremlin has vowed to respond.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on September 2 that Ukraine's Kursk assault wouldn't prevent Russian forces from advancing in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces haven't achieved their goal of diverting Russian troops from the fighting there, he said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last month that the aim of the Kursk incursion was to create a buffer zone that might prevent further attacks by Moscow across the border.
Zelenskiy on September 2 met in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhya with visiting Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and repeated his plea to allies to provide additional long-range weapons and to allow his forces to use them to fire deeper into Russian territory.
""For today, only to allow -- is also not enough,"" he told a briefing, adding that additional supplies of such weapons are desperately needed.

Tehran, IRNA -- Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has reported a rocket attack on the Israeli military base Al-Marj, hitting it directly.
In a statement on Saturday, the group emphasized that the strike was taken in solidarity with the people of Gaza and in support of Palestinian resistance.
Simultaneously, Israeli military radio reported that the three missiles fired from Lebanon struck the area of Misgav Am in Upper Galilee.
Sirens sounded continuously across eight different sites in northern occupied Palestine as a warning of the incoming threat.
In response to the missile strikes, Israeli forces launched artillery attacks on the Yohmor al-Shaqif area in southern Lebanon.
The situation remains tense as both sides continue to exchange rocket and missile fire across the border.
In a separate statement, Hezbollah said it had launched an aerial attack with a swarm of armed drones on the headquarters of the Sahel Battalion in the Beit Hillel barracks.
Hezbollah said the drone strike was in response to the Israeli aggression on the southern Lebanese towns.
The resistance movement also said it had hit Israeli military sites of Branit Barracks and Birkat Risha with rockets and other weapons.

In Zaporizhzhia, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held negotiations with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dick Schoof.
The President thanked the Dutch Prime Minister for visiting Zaporizhzhia, which is located just a few dozen kilometers from the frontlines. He proposed that the Netherlands take patronage over thee Zaporizhzhia region, particularly in areas such as energy needs, school protection, and shelter construction.
The discussions focused on strengthening Ukraine's defense against Russian terror and advancing towards a just peace for Ukraine.
""The key priorities are air defense, the supply of Patriot systems and missiles, and increasing our fleet of F-16s. We have ideas on this. Additionally, defense packages for Ukraine - ammunition, equipment - and sanctions against Russia - everything necessary to prevent Russia from opening new fronts against Ukraine,"" the President stated.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy also highlighted that the Netherlands is a leader in the air defense and F-16 coalitions, as well as in implementing the justice-related points of the Peace Formula. The Netherlands is also actively involved in joint efforts to hold Russia accountable for the war.
""It is crucial that we work together to ensure that Putin personally, and all those carrying out his madness, are held accountable for this aggression - for the murders of Ukrainians, the deportation of children, and all other crimes of this war,"" the President said.
The parties also discussed increasing sanctions pressure on Russia, ensuring shelters are in place, assisting Ukraine's energy sector, and preparing for the next NATO Summit, which will be held in the Netherlands.
Dick Schoof assured of continued support for Ukraine in defending against Russian aggression and announced a new aid package focused on supporting the energy system, which will include demining equipment, medical assistance, and more.
Additionally, in Zaporizhzhia, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Dick Schoof listened to a briefing from representatives of the Ukrainian Air Force and the Defense Intelligence on the specifics of Russian air terror, including the tactics of using missiles, drones, and guided aerial bombs against civilian targets and energy infrastructure. They emphasized the need for efforts to stop this terror, including granting Ukraine the authorization and means to strike at airbases and increasing sanctions pressure on Russia. Dick Schoof was provided with detailed information about the missiles Russia is using against Ukraine and the extent to which they contain Western components - both American and European.
""We appreciate that the Netherlands has taken the lead and will work with us. I've asked them to also work with other partners to ensure that the sanctions are truly effective and fully work against this war,"" the President added.  v  Videos"

20WXQPEXQX_MYZ18CZ486HAAW5,Azerbaijan's Second Snap Vote Since Karabakh Victory Could Further Signal Democratic Dead-End,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/08/mil-240831-rferl02.htm,"By RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service and Andy Heil August 31, 2024
Azerbaijan holds parliamentary elections on September 1 that will almost certainly be dominated by allies -- and their children -- eager to help President Ilham Aliyev further consolidate his dynastic rule.
The carefully vetted process offers Azerbaijan's 6 million-plus voters limited alternatives to Aliyev loyalists and comes early in a fifth term built for decades on petro-wealth and carefully choreographed elections, and more recently on the culmination of a generation-defining dispute with neighboring Armenia.
Many Azerbaijanis and outsiders speculated that a resolution of the ""Karabakh question,"" ending the post-Soviet world's longest-running frozen conflict, could offer a chance for rejuvenating democratic impulses in Baku even if Aliyev remained firmly in place.
But the absence of any ""genuine alternative"" to the 62-year-old Aliyev's re-election in February, Baku's bitter fallout with the Council of Europe's rights- and democracy-promotion arm PACE, and its recent encouragement of Moscow and embrace of the BRICS alliance all suggest otherwise.
Moreover, the emergence of a handful of children of aging, establishment-linked lawmakers vying to replace their fathers in this weekend's parliamentary elections could portend a whole new generation of Azerbaijani elites beholden to Aliyev and his system.
And a crackdown on journalists and civil-society activists since the repatriation of Nagorno-Karabakh last year is being likened to a notorious spate of jailings and harassment a decade earlier, only broader.
""It just seems to be trying to clear everyone [else] out,"" Michael Runey, an adviser on democracy assessment for the intergovernmental International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), told RFE/RL. ""That's really a sign of a government that's trying to wipe out any sort of independent organization in society.""
He cited recent arrests including that of Bahruz Samadov, a 29-year-old Azerbaijani doctoral student abroad accused of high treason, apparently over critical statements about the 2020 war and 2023 military operations around Nagorno-Karabakh.
In metrics like representation, rule of law, and participation, Runey said, Azerbaijan already fared poorly. There were hopes that a more democratic path might open once the Karabakh conflict was resolved, he said, but ""people are experiencing that this is not the case.""
Instead, he warned, ""the government is attempting to consolidate and close off any sort of possible avenues for democratization.""
Runey said that especially since retaking Karabakh last year, ""I feel like the government in Baku feels they just don't really need to placate the West anymore.""
Baku's tightly controlled analytical community routinely describes Aliyev's recent moves as ""independent foreign policy,"" as opposed to any turn away from the West and toward Russia or other authoritarian counterparts by a key oil and gas provider in an unstable corner of the former Soviet Union.
Western observers have consistently criticized elections cementing Aliyev's reign as undemocratic, and Azerbaijani votes stretching back to 2003 and as recently as 2020 have been marred by violence.
As a result, Aliyev's New Azerbaijan Party -- which is formally chaired by first lady and Vice President Mehriban Aliyeva -- and an assemblage of loyalist parties have dominated the 125-seat National Assembly.
The leading opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (AXCP) is staying away from ""the government's masquerade of a fraudulent election"" for the seventh straight time. But the Musavat Party is participating despite serial problems like obstacles to monitoring, campaigning and media that is heavily skewed toward the ruling party, and serious election-day irregularities, saying, ""Even if only five or 10 people show up, the election will be considered as held"" because of the lack of any turnout threshold since 2003 .
At least a handful of next-generation elites are likely to join the existing loyalist ranks in parliament. Candidates in the September 1 vote reportedly include Samir Ahmadoglu Valiyev, a son of former lawmaker and university rector Ahmad Valiyev; Mahir Tahiroglu Suleymanli, a son of influential former lawmaker Tahir Suleymanov; and Gunay Agamali, who is running to replace her father, Fazail Agamali, a nearly 30-year parliamentary veteran and Motherland Party leader who is said to be stepping down for health reasons. Aygun Manyeva, the daughter of a former legislator who is now a member of the Central Election Commission, initially appeared on the New Azerbaijan Party list but reportedly withdrew her candidacy.
Aliyev has ruled Azerbaijan since taking over from his dying father in 2003 and won a new seven-year term in a snap vote seen by international observers as deeply flawed.

20XGCJSM5I_T8XY27NNTQA3G7S,African leaders gather in Beijing for summit,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/09/china-240904-voa02.htm,"By VOA News September 04, 2024
China's President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, hosted a lavish banquet Wednesday for more than two dozen African leaders, kicking off the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing.
At the forum, which lasts until Friday, African leaders will be looking for possible investments and loans as Beijing seeks markets for its goods - everything from household products to green technologies - and to deepen China's ties with Africa.
Earlier Wednesday, China, Tanzania and Zambia signed an initial agreement to reboot a decades old railway project that aims to boost trade between the two African countries. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority project, or TAZARA, aims to connect landlocked Zambia with Tanzania's access to the sea by linking it up with the main port in Dar es Salaam.
Beijing helped launch the TAZARA railway project in the 1970s when Mao Zedong was China's leader.
""China is willing to take this summit as an opportunity to make new progress in the revitalization of the Tanzania-Zambia railway, cooperate to improve the rail-sea intermodal transport network in East Africa, and build Tanzania into a demonstration zone for deepening high-quality China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation,"" Xi said, according to state media.
China is Africa's largest trading partner and Beijing relies heavily on the continent for natural resources including copper, gold, lithium and rare earth minerals. Zambia is Africa's second largest producer of copper.
In the run up to the forum, Chinese state media described Xi as ""a true friend of Africa,"" saying China's relations with Africa have reached ""new heights"" under his leadership.
During the last FOCAC Summit in 2021, Beijing committed to buy more than $300 billion in imports from Africa. According to China's foreign ministry, China has already exceeded that goal, purchasing $305.9 billion worth of imports in roughly 2Â½ years.
Beijing has provided billions of dollars to African nations for infrastructure projects and analysts expect that debt restructuring will be discussed during the meeting.
According to new research revealed by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, Chinese lending to Africa rose for the first time in years in 2023 to $4.61 billion.
The research found China's increased investment was largely due to de-risking and China's increased commitment to energy lending. China invested in three renewable projects in Africa last year in solar and hydropower.
Analysts say Africa provides Beijing with access to many new markets that may help to make up for some of the pushback China is currently facing from the West and other countries over subsidies and cheaper products. The green energy transition is expected to be a large focus of the summit as well.
An additional factor at play has been the recent crackdown from the West on Chinese green technology imports with some Western countries implementing large tariffs. Last week, Canada implemented a 100% tariff on Chinese made electric vehicles and the United States is evaluating a similar tax on green tech from China."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Gaza Health Ministry reports that the death toll from the Israeli regime's genocidal war in the Palestinian enclave has reached 40,861.
The ministry said on Wednesday that the Israeli regime committed three more massacres in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, leaving 42 Palestinians dead and 107 injured.
The casualties bring the total death toll since the start of the war to 40,861, with the number of injured reaching 94,398, the ministry said.
Despite these ongoing atrocities, the Israeli regime has admitted that after nearly 11 months of warfare, it has yet to achieve its objectives of dismantling the Hamas movement and securing the release of Israeli captives.

2EPLIODDVD_6EM4ZBGSQTPFELJ,Analysts: China tests US commitment to Indo-Pacific with maritime operations,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-voa03.htm,"By William Yang September 03, 2024
China's recently increased maritime and aerial operations near the Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan is part of Beijing's attempt to gauge the United States' commitment to supporting allies in the Indo-Pacific region, say analysts. They noted the increased activity comes as Tokyo and Washington gear up for elections in the coming weeks.
""China sees an opportunity to test the United States' commitment to the broader region. So, it is sending a signal to Washington that if they try to invest more in the Philippines and other relationships in the South China Sea, Beijing will try to complicate their security architecture and their ability to manage many issues at once,"" said Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan.
Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels collided at least twice since last month near Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea. Sabina Shoal lies within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, or EEZ but Beijing says the partially submerged reef is part of its territory.
The latest collision happened shortly after noon on Saturday, August 31. Videos released by both China's state broadcaster CCTV and the Philippine coast guard showed a Chinese coast guard vessel ramming into a Philippine vessel. Each side accused the other of ""deliberately"" causing the collision.
Meanwhile, Japan's defense ministry says a Chinese military aircraft breached its airspace for the first time on August 26 and a Chinese survey ship intruded into Japan's southwestern territorial waters on August 31.
Tokyo lodged formal complaints to the Chinese Embassy in Japan, describing the series of incursions as ""unacceptable,"" but Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during a regular press conference Monday that the Chinese survey ship's activity was ""fully lawful and legitimate.""
In addition to areas near the Philippines and Japan, China has deployed at least 172 military aircraft and 87 naval vessels to areas around Taiwan since August 26. Some experts say China's concerted activities in the three locations are aimed at ""punishing its most vocal adversaries"" in the Indo-Pacific region.
""It seems that China believes it enjoys a certain amount of force overmatch and escalation dominance, so it is trying to make examples out of some countries that refuse to accept Chinese dominance in its near abroad,"" Ray Powell, director of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, told VOA in a phone interview.
Warnings not enough
The United States and other democratic countries, including Japan, Australia, and those of the European Union, have issued statements to condemn China's maritime aggression following the latest collision between Chinese and Philippine vessels near Sabina Shoal. Some experts, however, say Beijing's persistent aggression in the South China Sea suggests these warnings are insufficient to force it to soften its stance.
""Over the last year, China has disregarded all the warnings from the United States and its allies and continues to do what they have been doing in the South China Sea,"" Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told VOA in a phone interview.
Koh and Nagy both say the U.S. and its allies need to roll out more forceful measures to counter China's persistent maritime aggression across the Indo-Pacific. These, they say, include conducting more transits through regional waters, increasing the presence of naval vessels in the region and initiating a consultation of the mutual defense treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines.
""More countries need to conduct international transits through the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, regularize the presence of their naval vessels in the Indo-Pacific region, increase the frequency of joint training between Southeast Asian countries and other allies, and consider imposing sanctions on China,"" Nagy told VOA by phone.
According to reports, two German warships, the frigate Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and its supply ship Frankfurt am Main, are waiting for orders regarding possible passage through the Taiwan Strait during their transit from South Korea to the Philippines.
Since the start of 2024, U.S. naval vessels have conducted at least four transits through international waters in the Taiwan Strait, the 180-kilometer-wide body of water between Taiwan and China's southern Fujian Province. Naval vessels from Canada and the Netherlands have transited through the strait this year as well.
In recent weeks, the U.S. has reiterated its willingness to support the Philippines' resupply missions to the disputed reefs in the South China Sea while deploying extremely long-range air-to-air missiles to the Indo-Pacific, which experts say could erase China's advantage in aerial reach.
While China is trying to test Washington's resolve in the Indo-Pacific region and increase its military activities in the western Pacific, some analysts say it is not clear how long Beijing can sustain the intensity of its maritime operations.
""[While China] can still afford to put more money into defense and press its maritime claims, how much they can do so in the future remains an open question as their economy matures and their demographics provide more of a drain on growth,"" Ian Chong, a political scientist at National University of Singapore, told VOA in a written response.
Last week, the Reuters news agency reported that China spent $15 billion in 2023, or 7% of its defense budget, on military activities in the waters off its coast in the north and in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and the western Pacific Ocean. The data was based on previously unpublished internal research conducted by Taiwan's armed forces, the report said.
With Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party set to elect its new leader later this month and the U.S. presidential election entering its final weeks, Powell at Stanford expects China to maintain the same level of maritime aggression in the Indo-Pacific in the coming months.
""If China sees ways for them to advance their objectives when democratic governments are focused on elections, they do like to take advantage of that,"" he told VOA, adding that the international community should closely monitor Beijing's activities in the Indo-Pacific region in the next few months."

U.N. Security Council members expressed frustration Wednesday with the failure to conclude a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, amid the killing of six Israeli hostages and the escalation of violence in the West Bank.
""There is a sense of outrage felt around the globe,"" said Slovenia's Ambassador Samuel Å½bogar, whose delegation holds the council's rotating presidency this month. ""Outrage in Palestine that the international community is failing them; outrage on Israeli streets that the hostages continue being held in Gaza; outrage of the global public that this war does not stop.""
During a meeting requested by Israel about the six hostages killed by Hamas, whose bodies were recovered Saturday, Å½bogar reminded the 15-nation council that it is its job to push for peace.
Algeria also requested that the council discuss the escalation of violence in the West Bank, where the United Nations says at least 30 Palestinians have been killed, including seven children, since Israel launched a large-scale military operation on August 27.
""It is gravely alarming that with each briefing this council receives, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel steadily worsens,"" Malta's Ambassador Vanessa Frazier said.
There was general concern that U.S., Egyptian and Qatari efforts to broker a cease-fire and hostage release deal have not been successful after three months of mediation, especially after the Security Council backed the deal in a resolution on June 10.
""Things have only gotten worse for Palestinians, for Israeli hostages and indeed the entire region since adoption of that resolution,"" Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett of Guyana said.
U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged patience.
""Diplomacy is not a matter of snapping our fingers and â voila. It takes hard work. It takes effort, and unfortunately, it takes time,"" she said. ""It has not failed.""
She noted that diplomacy helped secure the release in November of more than 100 of the 250 hostages that Hamas took during its terror attack on October 7, 2023.
""And it is through diplomacy that we aim to bring the remaining hostages home and finally put this horrific conflict on a path toward a durable conclusion,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""The Israeli people should understand that the deal on the table is one their leaders can accept, because this is a deal that ensures Israel's security.""
In Washington, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that cease-fire negotiations were ongoing and a deal was ""basically done,"" except for two sticking points: which Palestinian prisoners will be released in exchange for the remaining hostages, and where Israeli forces will be deployed during phase one of the deal. Israel has demanded it retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer strip of land in the Egypt-Gaza border area.
During a press conference Wednesday in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stuck to his position that the corridor was non-negotiable.
""So, we said, as far as Gaza is concerned, three war goals: The first war goal was to destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel,"" he said. ""And all three of those goals, all three of them, go through Israel's control of the Philadelphi Corridor.""
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out negotiations by issuing new demands, including that Israel remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor and a second corridor running across Gaza.
In Tel Aviv, family members of some of the remaining hostages protested Wednesday outside the headquarters of Netanyahu's Likud Party, calling for a cease-fire deal with Hamas that includes the release of their relatives.
Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured some 250 hostages during the October 7 terror attack on southern Israel. The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.
Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. At the Security Council on Wednesday, Israel's envoy reiterated his demand that council members designate Hamas a terror organization.

Trinidad, meanwhile, said there is still no need to deploy more assets to the Escoda Shoal.
""This could be done by one ship, this could be done by an aircraft, this could be done yung mga nagrereport sa atin na mga fishermen natin, so hindi naman ito padamihan ng barko dun sa Sabina or Escoda (this could be reported to us by Filipino fishermen operating in the area, this is not a contest of who has the most ships in Sabina or Escoda),"" the PN official said.
As of Sunday, Trinidad said there are three China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, two People's Liberation Army-Navy ships, one Chinese hospital vessel, one research ship and 47 maritime militia vessels in Escoda Shoal ranged against the BRP Teresa Magbanua.
On Saturday, the PCG ship was damaged after being repeatedly rammed by CCG vessels while attempting to loiter around Escoda Shoal.
The BRP Teresa Magbanua was able to return to Escoda Shoal later in the day without any injuries to its crew. (PNA)"
2PL6NG2TLQ_WKK55D9WYQVJX1J,China In Eurasia Briefing: What Eurasia Can Learn From China's Footprint In Africa,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/09/china-240904-rferl01.htm,"By Reid Standish September 04, 2024
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is rolling out the red carpet for African   leaders this week at a high-level summit in Beijing as China looks to   deepen ties with the resource-rich continent that it has furnished with   billions in loans for infrastructure and development projects.
But what kind of lessons does the experience of African countries   hold for other regions where China has also become a political and   economic force?
Finding Perspective: Beijing has said the September   4-6 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit will be its largest   diplomatic event since the COVID-19 pandemic, with leaders and other   delegates from every African state except Eswatini.
China has increasingly expanded ties with African countries in the   past decade and Beijing has become the continent's largest bilateral   lender, investor, and trade partner.
This has seen China furnish governments with billions of dollars in   loans that have helped build much-needed infrastructure and bring   economic growth, but also sometimes stoked controversy by saddling   countries with huge debts.
FOCAC is Beijing's main forum for engaging with Africa and this   year's gathering will tackle issues ranging from health-care cooperation   to debt relief to securing the rights for critical minerals.
African leaders are looking for more balanced trade and continued   investments from China, while Beijing is expected to push its green   technologies products like electric vehicles (EVs) and its solar   industry, especially amid Western curbs on those exports.
A New Era: As Alex Vines, the Africa research   director at Chatham House, told me, the green-technology push isn't a   surprise and has buy-in from both sides.
""Energy provision is key for Africa's development trajectory, and so investing in renewables will be welcomed,"" he said.
Chinese investment in Africa peaked around 2016 and Chinese loans to   African governments have since declined significantly. The old China   model of offering loans for large infrastructure projects and rapid   industrialization has not quite disappeared, but certainly lost steam   amid China's slowing economy and the difficulty some African countries   have had in repaying loans.
As Beijing is eyeing new markets for its renewables sector, Africa is   a logical target. It's a young and fast-growing continent that, according to the International Monetary Fund, contains nine of the world's 20 fastest-growing economies in 2024 and China sees it as a vital market for its products and its own economic growth.
And while there are petro-states in Africa, many countries deal with   energy insecurity and are eager for the more affordable products like   Chinese-made smartphones and EVs that have seen their quality   dramatically increase in recent years.
Why It Matters: If any lessons can be drawn from   Africa's trajectory with China for other regions around the world, it's   that local governments are just as influential in this process as   Beijing.
It can be easy to view everything through the lens of China's global   ambitions, which are very real, but they only tell part of the story.
Debt owed to China is a major factor on the continent, and some   African countries have large Chinese loans that they're struggling to   repay.
But Vines says that their situations can't be entirely blamed on   Chinese loans. Countries like Kenya and Zambia have poorly managed their   debt to all creditors, not only China, while others have managed to   navigate their Chinese debt arrangements without risk or incident.
Added to that, African countries know they are becoming more   attractive to multiple outside powers and using this dynamic to have   more room to balance their ties with partners beyond China and the West, like Russia, India, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey.
""Local agency needs to be strengthened more robustly,"" Mandira   Bagwandeen, an expert on China's ties to Africa and a lecturer at   Stellenbosch University in South Africa, told me.
""It's not China's responsibility to be sure that whatever deal they   strike is in the local country's interest. It's the responsibility of   African officials and it's ultimately up to them to make sure that it   works for their country.""
1. Middle Corridor Chokepoint
Kazakhstan announced on September 2 that it will temporarily stop accepting containers   heading to China through its Dostyk border crossing due to inadequate   infrastructure to process the cargo.
The Details: The news is something of a positive sign for those cheerleading the viability of the so-called Middle Corridor trade route that runs through the Caucasus and Central Asia and connects to China.
The press release said that the infrastructure at the border crossing   can't handle the large volumes of freight now going east. At the time   of the announcement, there were 55 trains waiting in Kazakhstan to cross   into China.
Dostyk is one of two main rail crossings between Kazakhstan and   China. The other crossing, Khorgos, was built as one of China's key Belt   and Road Initiative (BRI) investments in Central Asia.
2. BYD's Big Uzbek Plans
Chinese electric car production is gearing up in Uzbekistan and the Central Asian news site Vlast has a good look at where things stand today.
What It Means: The factory was opened in late June by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoev and will be a joint venture with state-owned UzAuto.
BYD pledged a $160 million investment in the production line, which   is poised to put around 50,000 cars to market in its first phase, with   an outlook of up to 500,000 cars. As the factory develops and expands,   the company also plans to grow its China-trained local workforce from   1,200 to 10,000.
The flagship factory is the first large-scale investment of its kind   in Central Asia and could be used as a template to be replicated   elsewhere in Central Asia as China looks to build up the EV market   across the region with its offering of affordable and increasingly reliable options.
As another interesting wrinkle, Vlast reports that ""most of the   electric cars that the production lines of [Central Asia] will churn out   seem to be earmarked for export, with Russia being one of the main   destination markets.""
3. A Pakistani Great Firewall?
Millions of Pakistanis have for weeks experienced slow Internet connections and problems with accessing social media platforms.
And local activists say it's because Pakistani authorities are   installing a Chinese-style national Internet firewall aimed at exerting   more control over the online space and crushing dissent, my colleague   Abubakar Siddique reports.
What You Need To Know: Islamabad has denied   allegations that it is behind the Internet slowdown, which has disrupted   businesses and triggered widespread complaints in the South Asian   country of some 240 million.
Pakistanis have been unable to promptly send e-mails or use the   messaging application WhatsApp, which is used by tens of millions of   people. Businesses and entrepreneurs say the Internet slowdown has   disrupted their daily work.
For weeks, Islamabad refused to comment, but then officials provided   some contradictory remarks about the reason behind the disruptions.
Information Technology and Telecommunication Minister Shaza Fatima   Khawaja admitted on August 15 that the government was tinkering with the   Internet, revealing that it was ""upgrading a web-management system"" it   had previously installed.
Then on August 21, Hafeezur Rehman, the chairman of the Pakistan   Telecommunication Authority (PTA), claimed that a faulty undersea   Internet cable was to blame.
Multiple digital-rights groups inside the country have accused the   government of implementing new measures to monitor and regulate content   and social media platforms in order to increase surveillance and stifle   dissent, especially criticism of the country's all-powerful military.
The civilian government is backed by the military and the PTA is overseen by a retired general.
The alleged implementation of the firewall comes as Pakistan's   military, which has an oversized role in the country's domestic and   foreign affairs, says it is battling ""digital terrorism.""
Taipei's Rhetorical Counter: Taiwanese President Lai   Ching-te has challenged China's claim over the self-ruled island by   suggesting in recent comments that if China is truly concerned about its   territorial integrity then it should also seek to reclaim the land it   ceded to Russia in the 19th century.
""If China wants to annex Taiwan.... It's not for the sake of   territorial integrity. If it is really for the sake of territorial   integrity, why doesn't China take back Russia?"" Lai said during a TV interview.
Kazakh Nuclear Referendum: Kazakh President   Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev announced that the country will hold a national   referendum on October 6 on whether to build a new nuclear power plant,   RFE/RL's Kazakh Service reports.
According to public statements by the government, companies from   China, France, Russia, and South Korea are all in the running to carry   out the project if it gets enough support at the ballot box.
New Semiconductor Investment: Taiwan is planning to team up with the Czech government to build a semiconductor cluster   in the Czech Republic, Taiwanese National Security Council   Secretary-General Joseph Wu said on August 30 during a press conference   at the annual Globsec security conference in Prague.
Lining Up For BRICS : Bloomberg reports that Turkey has formally asked to join the BRICS group of emerging-market countries.
A new investigation from The Washington Post found that Chinese diplomats and pro-China   diaspora groups based in the United States organized demonstrations in   San Francisco that harassed and silenced protesters opposed to Beijing's   policies during Xi's visit to the city in November 2023.
The investigation around the events in San Francisco is another key   piece of evidence that helps illustrate how the Chinese Communist Party   takes steps to stifle anti-government dissent abroad, particularly in   countries with large Chinese diasporas.

Media Note  Office of the Spokesperson  September 4, 2024
On September 4, 2024, the foreign affairs and defense agencies of the United States and Republic of Korea (ROK) convened the fifth meeting of the Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) in Washington.  Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins and Acting Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Cara Abercrombie led the U.S. delegation.  ROK First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Hong Kyun and Deputy Minister for National Defense Policy Dr. Cho Chang Lae led the ROK delegation.
The EDSCG serves as a key annual forum for the Alliance to discuss and coordinate on security strategy and policy issues affecting the Korean Peninsula and broader Indo-Pacific.  The fifth EDSCG built on the progress of the previous years' meetings and carried forward the significant Alliance efforts to strengthen extended deterrence since the April 2023 announcement of the Washington Declaration.
In the meeting, participants shared assessments on the DPRK's dangerous and irresponsible behavior, including its ongoing missile launches and continued pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.  Both sides also shared concerns on the DPRK's recent reckless and dangerous behaviors along the DMZ that raise the risk of inadvertent escalation on the Peninsula.  Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula consistent with UNSC resolutions.  The two sides committed to further enhance coordination to address DPRK sanctions evasion, including malicious cyber activities, and bolster deterrence against DPRK nuclear attacks, as well as non-nuclear WMD attacks, which pose a threat of high consequence, strategic-level attacks to the Alliance.  The United States reiterated its strong support for President Yoon's aim to open a path for serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK, and the goals of the ROK's Audacious Initiative. Both sides reaffirmed that they remain open to dialogue without preconditions.
The ROK and the United States condemned the military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including arms transfers, which are in direct violation of UNSC resolutions, and identified measures to address the challenge posed by increased DPRK-Russia security cooperation.  Both sides resolved to closely monitor what Russia provides to the DPRK and urged Russia and the DPRK to abide by the relevant UNSC resolutions.
The ROK and the United States recognized the deepening interconnectedness between the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic and discussed the implications for deterrence and U.S. nuclear posture.  The two sides considered the impact of non-nuclear threats to the Alliance, including emerging technologies, and committed to leverage Alliance technology advantages to enhance the Alliance's deterrence and defense posture.  They pledged to continue to utilize the diplomatic, informational, military, and economic tools available to the Alliance to strengthen deterrence and reinforce the U.S. security commitment to the ROK.  To that end, both sides committed to cooperating with likeminded partners to counter foreign misinformation on extended deterrence.  Both sides welcomed the significant advances made by the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) in its first year, including the completion and signing of the NCG Guidelines.  In the context of a deteriorating security environment, the principals conducted a scenario-based discussion, for the first time at the EDSCG, to strengthen policy planning and coordination.
Acknowledging mounting regional threats, the ROK and the United States committed to continue close cooperation to ensure that ROK and U.S. strategies and postures enhance peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.  The United States reiterated its ironclad commitment to draw on the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear, to support extended deterrence for the ROK.  Both sides reaffirmed that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the ROK will be met with a swift, overwhelming, and decisive response, and the United States reiterated that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the United States or its allies is unacceptable and will result in the end of that regime.
The co-chairs met with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell in the State Department Treaty Room, where they applauded the EDSCG as an enduring Alliance forum to strengthen extended deterrence through cooperation between both countries' diplomatic and defense establishments.  Following the meeting, the principals visited the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center and praised the rich history of the Alliance at a press conference, where they commended the continued progress of the EDSCG. The next high-level EDSCG meeting will be held in 2025."

China is full of confidence in the prospects of cooperation between the two countries, said Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, while meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok, Russia on Wednesday on the sidelines of the ninth Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).
Han said at this new historical starting point of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties, China-Russia relations in the new era continue to operate at a high level under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, according to Xinhua News Agency.
The Vice President said China is full of confidence in the prospects of cooperation between the two countries. China highly values the role and influence of the Eastern Economic Forum, actively supports and participates in the development and cooperation of Russia's Far East region and stands ready to share development opportunities with Russia, so as to benefit the two peoples with more achievements and promote common development and revitalization.
Putin pointed out that thanks to the two countries' joint efforts, ""relations between Russia and China have reached unprecedented heights,"" according to Russia's TASS.
""I hope that we will be able to search for and find new areas for cooperation during our meeting today and our joint work at the Eastern Economic Forum tomorrow,"" said the Russian President.
""We particularly attach great importance to cooperation between regions,"" Putin added.
Putin is expected to attend Thursday's plenary session to discuss economic and geopolitical topics, Xinhua reported.
The ninth EEF, running from Tuesday to Friday, has attracted more than 6,000 people from 76 countries and territories, official data showed.
""The business activities conducted on the forum sidelines will take interaction with countries of the Asia-Pacific region to a new level and enable us to develop specific solutions to unlock the economic potential of the Russian Far East,"" Anton Kobyakov, adviser to the Russian President and Executive Secretary of the EEF Organizing Committee, said in a press release sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.
""The attendance of senior Chinese officials and Chinese companies underlines China's active attitude in participating in the development of Russia's Far East region, sending a clear signal of enhanced China-Russia friendly cooperation for mutual benefits,"" Li Xin, director of the Center for Russian and Central Asian Studies at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
Given some Western countries' intensifying unreasonable suppression and the unilateral sanctions levied on Russian and Chinese companies, there is a need for the two sides to expand cooperation in more fields, Li said.
Linking and combining the strategy of full revitalization of northeast China and Russia's development of the Far East will not only benefit the two countries but also economic cooperation in Northeast Asia, contributing to the goal of maintaining peace and stability in the area, according to Li.
Mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia's Far East and China's Northeast region showed strong momentum in recent years.
Han and Putin also attended the opening ceremony of the 8th China-Russia Expo in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, in May.
While an increasing number of Chinese companies are being set up in the Far East region, infrastructure projects like the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge and the Tongjiang-Nizhneleninskoye railway bridge play an important role in the increase in trade turnover.
In 2023, China-Russia two-way trade exceeded $240 billion, close to 1.7 times that of a decade ago, which is a good indication of the all-round cooperation of mutual benefit that continues to deepen between the two countries.
""The quality and quantity of China-Russia bilateral trade continues to see improvement in 2024,"" Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
In addition to traditional sectors like energy and machinery, there is huge potential for the two sides to deepen economic and trade cooperation in emerging industries including green development and digital economy, according to Zhang.
Cooperation on the local level between China and Russia has gained a firmer foothold over recent years, with official and business delegations from China's Northeast region and Russia's Far East paying mutual visits to explore opportunities in economic and trade cooperation."

Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak met with the U.S. delegation led by U.S. Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer.
The Ukrainian side held briefings for the U.S. delegation on the security situation in the face of Russia's full-scale aggression, the development of Ukraine's Defense Forces capabilities, and the sanctions policy.
Andriy Yermak noted that over the past few days, Russia has launched a series of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Poltava and Lviv, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds more.
""We want to give you full information. Because you know the position of President Zelensky that the United States is our friend, we are strategic partners, and we want to be completely open, because without trust it is impossible to advance together towards Ukraine's victory. And, of course, we are grateful to the people and the Government of the United States, to President Biden, for the assistance provided,"" he said.
Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Khortytsia Operational Strategic Troops Group Andriy Hnatov described the situation on the frontline, particularly in the Pokrovsk direction, and on the operation in the Kursk region.
Acting Commander of the Air Forces of Ukraine Anatolii Kryvonozhko provided information on the use of F-16s, the tactics of Russian shelling, and Ukraine's need for additional air defense systems, anti-aircraft missile systems, missiles, electronic reconnaissance equipment, and more.
Deputy Minister for Strategic Industries Anna Gvozdiar spoke about the capabilities of the Ukrainian defense sector, current and potential cooperation with U.S. companies to improve the defense capabilities of Ukraine's Defense Forces, and the need for spare parts and components.
During the discussion of sanctions, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko emphasized the need to strengthen export controls in order to prevent critical Western-made technologies from entering the Russian Federation (including through third countries), and to exert sanctions pressure on Russian metallurgical companies.
Advisor and Presidential Commissioner for Sanctions Policy Vladyslav Vlasiuk drew attention to the correlation between the sanctions imposed and the enemy's macroeconomic indicators. He emphasized the expediency of strengthening sanctions in the financial sector to prevent the aggressor country from conducting cross-border transactions. In addition, according to the Advisor and Commissioner, it is necessary to take measures to further restrict Russian oil exports and the work of Rosatom."

Africa has witnessed a steady process of regional economic integration in recent years. In February 2024, the African Union (AU) launched the Second 10-Year Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063 during the 37th AU Summit.
Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani, Mauritanian president and chairperson of the AU for 2024, said that the AU is committed to unleashing the development potential of the African continent, promoting regional economic integration, increasing infrastructure connectivity, and enhancing agricultural productivity, so as to ensure the smooth implementation of the second 10-year implementation plan.
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) was officially established in July 2019 and went into operation in January 2021. It aims to facilitate trade and investment and achieve the free movement of goods, services, and capital across the African continent through tariff reduction and removal of trade barriers. It works to create a large single market of over 1.3 billion people and with a combined gross domestic product of $2.3 trillion.
According to the Economic Development in Africa Report 2023 released by the United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the AfCFTA offers advantages by easing regional market access and strengthening production chains across the continent, helping African domestic industries become more prepared for the global arena.
As Africa's largest trading partner, China actively supports African regional economic integration and the development of the AfCFTA. Recent years have seen an expansion in both the volume and quality of trade between China and the African continent.
According to the China-Africa Trade Index, published for the first time in 2023, the value of China's imports from and exports to Africa increased from less than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in 2000 to 1.88 trillion yuan in 2022, a cumulative growth of over 20 times. In 2023, the China-Africa trade volume reached a record high of $282.1 billion, a year-on-year increase of 1.5 percent. Among them, China's imports of African nuts, vegetables, flowers and fruits increased by 130 percent, 32 percent, 14 percent, and 7 percent year-on-year, respectively. Meanwhile, Chinese exports of new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic products to Africa increased by 291 percent, 109 percent, and 57 percent year-on-year, respectively, strongly supporting Africa's green transition.
China and the AfCFTA Secretariat have jointly established an expert group for economic cooperation, aiming to enhance the sharing of policies and experiences to facilitate trade and investment. Both sides have been deepening cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, trade and finance, industrial investment, talent training, and capacity building, providing continuous support for Africa's regional economic integration.
Over the past decade, China has provided Africa with development support as much as it can and has been involved in the construction of over 6,000 kilometers of railways, 6,000 kilometers of roads, and more than 80 large power facilities in Africa.
Among them, the 2Africa submarine cable project, invested and developed by China Mobile International and other companies, encircles the African continent with a total length of over 45,000 kilometers. Once completed, it will become the longest submarine cable in the world. This cable project will deliver much-needed internet capacity and reliability in Africa, promote digital transformation in sectors such as healthcare, education, and finance, and provide digital support for the regional economic integration of the African continent.
In August 2023, at the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue, China proposed to launch the Initiative on Supporting Africa's Industrialization, the Plan for China Supporting Africa's Agricultural Modernization, and the Plan for China-Africa Cooperation on Talent Development, to help Africa bring its integration and modernization into a fast track.
According to an article published in the African Leadership Magazine, large-scale infrastructure projects, like the building of roads, trains, ports, and power plants, are common in China. These investments support economic growth and regional integration by filling the infrastructural deficit in Africa.
James Mwangi, chief executive officer of Equity Group Holdings based in Kenya, said that China is an important source of investment for Africa and the largest export market for African countries. This strong support has enabled African nations to participate in global trade.
He said Africa welcomes advanced financial payment tools from China, which can help the continent achieve financial integration and inject new momentum into global financial infrastructure connectivity."

The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces says the country's forces have carried out an attack on an Israeli-bound ship in the Gulf of Aden in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Brigadier General Yahya Saree made the remarks in a statement on Saturday, a day after two missiles targeted a Liberian-flagged container ship transiting the Gulf of Aden.
""We carried out a military operation targeting the 'Groton' ship in the Gulf of Aden because the company that owns it violated Yemen's decision to ban entry to the ports of occupied Palestine,"" he said.
Saree went on to say that the operation involved many missiles and drones, adding that the hit was accurate.
The spokesperson further emphasized that the naval operations of the Yemeni armed forces will continue in support of Palestinians in Gaza as well as until the Israeli aggression stops and the blockade on the besieged enclave is completely lifted.
On Friday, two missiles suspected to have been fired by Yemen's armed forces targeted the ""Groton"" ship.
Britain's maritime safety agency, UKMTO, said the attack saw two missiles ""exploding in close proximity to the vessel"" some 240 kilometers east of the Gulf of Aden.
The ship ""reports all crew are safe and proceeding to next port of call,"" the UKMTO said, adding that ""Investigations are ongoing.""
The Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC) later identified the vessel targeted as the Liberian-flagged container ship Groton, adding that one of the missiles had caused minor damage.
The ship ""was targeted due to other vessels within its company structure making recent port calls in Israel,"" the center said.
This was the second time the ""Groton"" ship was targeted by Yemeni armed forces. Back in August, the naval and missile forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a joint military operation in which they targeted the ""Groton"" ship in the Gulf of Aden with many ballistic missiles.
Israel launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the Israelis in response to the regime's decades-long campaign of death and destruction of Palestinians.
The Israeli war on Gaza has so far killed at least 40,700 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 93,855 more, according to Palestinian health officials."

Good afternoon. I'd like to start by thanking Under Secretary Jenkins and her team for hosting us at the State Department today. I'd also like to thank First Vice Minister Kim and Deputy Minister Cho for their significant contributions to our productive meeting.
Our governments have made historic progress on extended deterrence cooperation over the past year, including through the EDSCG dialogue today and the work of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG). The EDSCG serves as a key forum for the U.S.-ROK Alliance to discuss integrating and coordinating all levers of national power - diplomatic, informational, military, and economic - to address security challenges affecting the Korean Peninsula and the broader Indo-Pacific region.
Today, we discussed the dangerous and irresponsible behavior of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including the ongoing expansion, diversification, and improvement of nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities as well as the growing DPRK-Russia strategic partnership, which violates several UN Security Council Resolutions.
We remain committed to taking appropriate actions in response to destabilizing DPRK activities. The U.S. commitment to the ROK is enduring and ironclad. Any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the United States or its allies and partners is unacceptable and will result in the end of that regime.
However, our goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We remain willing to engage in dialogue with the DPRK, without preconditions. We will also continue to urge the DPRK and Russia to abide by UNSC resolutions.
We look forward to working together with the ROK, across all our extended deterrence forums, to engage in deeper, cooperative efforts to further strengthen our extended deterrence cooperation. Let me take a moment to again thank U/S Jenkins, First Vice Minister Kim, and Deputy Minister Cho for the thoughtful, productive discussion today.

Tehran, IRNA -- Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kiev on Monday morning with a barrage of drones, cruise, and ballistic missiles, media outlets reported.
According to Reuters, Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced that emergency services had been dispatched to several areas following reports of damage and injuries caused by falling rubble.
Reuters quoted eyewitnesses as saying that loud explosions were heard in the city.
Russian broadsheet newspaper The Pravda reported that 2 people have been injured and four cars, a boiler house, company premises, and non-residential buildings in three districts of Kiev have caught fire.
The report added that Ukraine is in a state of alert, and neighboring Poland, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has put all its aircraft on alert to ensure safety of its airspace.
The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed on its Telegram channel that Russia repeatedly targeted Kiev using ballistic missiles. Ukrainian officials claimed that the country's air defense units repelled the attacks.
Russia's Monday attack came just a week after Moscow pounded Ukraine using more than 200 missiles and drones, which left seven people dead and targeted Ukraine's energy facilities.
On the other hand, the Russian Defense Ministry has announced that the country's air defense intercepted and destroyed 158 Ukrainian drones on Sunday night and that Russian forces had taken control of the cities of Pyonychin and Vymka in Ukraine's Donetsk region.

4 September 2024
Last week, we heard the news that the bodies of six Israeli hostages were recovered in Gaza. We condemn their murder by Hamas.
My Prime Minister has conveyed his thoughts and prayers for the families and the Israeli people.
The UK supported Israel's request for this briefing to shine a spotlight on the abhorrent crimes of Hamas and their impact on innocent civilians. It is also entirely right, as Algeria proposed, to focus on recent grave developments in the West Bank and Gaza.
President, of the 253 hostages taken in the horrific October 7th terrorist attacks, 101 hostages remain captive in Gaza and subject to unimaginable horror. We once again condemn Hamas' terrorist acts in the strongest terms. We reiterate our demand for Hamas to release the hostages immediately. There can be no doubt that Hamas pays not the slightest heed to international humanitarian law. We urge all parties to agree a ceasefire deal which would bring an end to the ordeal of these hostages.
Israel continues to face threats, not only from Hamas, but also from Iran and its range of hostile proxies who openly call for Israel's annihilation. Iran should be in no doubt of our commitment to challenge their malign and destabilising activity, and our commitment to Israel's security.
President, the suffering of Palestinians also worsens each day. Over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of whom are women and children. The most basic needs of children and thousands of orphaned children are unmet. A ceasefire deal offers an opportunity to end their suffering.
As we've heard, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is beyond appalling, with dire sanitary conditions, a serious risk of famine and now polio. We welcome the polio vaccination campaign and urge Israel to continue to cooperate with the WHO and health agencies to ensure that the full 90% of children who need to be are vaccinated.
More generally, as we've heard, humanitarian access remains inadequate with attacks on convoys, evacuation orders undermining operations and aid far below Israel's stated commitment to 'flood Gaza with aid'. We urge Israel to do much more to ensure lifesaving food and medical supplies reach civilians in Gaza.
As my Foreign Secretary said this week, we are also deeply concerned by credible claims of mistreatment of Palestinian detainees, which the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot investigate after being denied access by Israel.
President, concerns on the treatment of detainees and humanitarian access were part of my Government's review into Israel's International Humanitarian Law compliance. As a result, my Foreign Secretary took the decision to suspend certain UK arms export licences to Israel earlier this week. This decision in no way undermines our unwavering commitment to Israel's security.
Whilst we recognise Israel's need to defend itself against security threats, the UK is also deeply worried by the ongoing IDF operations in the West Bank, particularly the reports of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Israel must also tackle the accelerating settler violence and end its illegal expansion of settlements which undermine prospects for the realisation of the two-state solution.
President, let me conclude by thanking the US, Qatar and Egypt for their efforts on the ongoing negotiations. The parties have had time to study the deal on the table. The parties must now bridge their differences and end the suffering by agreeing to a deal and immediate ceasefire and rediscover the path to a two-state solution."

Sep 1, 2024
Tehran, IRNA -- Three Israeli policemen have been killed and some others injured in a shooting operation near the southern West Bank city of al-Khalil.
According to reports, the fighters of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas targeted a vehicle in al-Khalil on Sunday.
Also, Israeli radio reported that a Hamas shooting operation took place at a checkpoint in the southern West Bank, in the west of the Jordan River.
Hamas's two operations near two Zionist settlements in the north of al-Khalil carry a clear message that the resistance will fight powerfully as long as the Israeli regime continues aggression against the Palestinians, the resistance movement said in a statement.
The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the military wing of the Fatah movement, has claimed responsibility for a dual attack on Friday in the Israeli settlement of Gush Etzion in al-Khalil.
According to a report on Sunday by Al-Mayadeen, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades said that the purpose of this martyrdom operation, carried out by two Palestinian youths was to avenge the blood of Palestinian martyrs and respond to the Israeli crimes in Gaza and the West Bank.
It also emphasized that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank can expect nothing from Palestinian fighters but death, bullets, and gunpowder.
Since the start of the war in Gaza last October, at least 40,700 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the enclave.

4 September 2024
In his first visit to Scotland since being appointed, the Defence   Secretary boarded the Vanguard-Class submarine for the final leg of its   return journey to HM Naval Base Clyde after completing the UK's latest   patrol.
The mission, known as Operation Relentless, or the Continuous At Sea   Deterrent (CASD), ensures that at least one nuclear-powered and armed   ballistic missile submarine is at sea at all times to deter potential   adversaries and protect the nation and NATO allies. The next vessel in   the deterrent cycle is already at sea and patrolling.
During his visit to the 15,000-tonne vessel, the Defence Secretary   thanked the crew of 140 Royal Navy submariners for their dedicated   service and wished them well as they prepared to reunite with their   families. He was also given an operational briefing and toured the   submarine, which is armed with the UK's Trident nuclear missiles.
John Healey also used the visit to reinforce the new Government's   commitment to its 'triple-lock' on the deterrent, which includes:   building four new nuclear submarines in Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria;   maintaining our continuous at sea nuclear deterrent; and delivering all   future upgrades needed.
The government's commitment to security is clear, with a Strategic   Defence Review already underway that will determine the roles,   capabilities and reforms required by UK Defence to meet the challenges,   threats and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
Royal Navy submariners make extraordinary sacrifices to keep us all   safe and it was an honour to thank the crew on behalf of the British   people. As they return home, we salute their courage, dedication, and   professionalism.
Our new Government is unwavering in our commitment to our nuclear   deterrent, maintained on behalf of the UK and our NATO allies. Our   'triple-lock' will safeguard Britain for generations to come.
As the home of our nuclear submarines and major   shipbuilding yards, Scotland is central to UK defence. I am determined   to make defence a foundation for jobs, growth and prosperity across   Scotland.
The Government is committed to the nuclear deterrent triple Lock:
Joining the Defence Secretary in thanking the returning submariners   was First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Ben Key; Director Submarines, Rear   Admiral Andy Perks; Commodore of the Submarine Flotilla, Commodore Paul   Dunn; and Naval Base Commander Clyde, Commodore Sharon Malkin.
The name of the vessel, length of patrol, and its location at sea are   all closely guarded secrets. On board, only a select few are authorised   to know where in the ocean depths they are operating, with the rest of   the crew dutifully carrying out their roles unaware of their location.
It is this secrecy that makes the nuclear deterrent so effective. A   potential enemy can never predict where a Vanguard Class is operating,   making the cost of attacking the UK or NATO allies far outweigh the   benefits.
Thousands of Royal Navy submariners and their families, MOD   civilians, and industry partners continue to contribute to maintaining   the nuclear deterrent.
For every minute of every day for more than 55-years a deterrent   submarine has been on patrol, keeping the nation secure by deterring the   most extreme threats to national security and the UK's way of life -   threats that cannot be deterred by other means.
A new class of ballistic submarine - the Dreadnought Class - is   currently under construction at Barrow-in-Furness and is expected to   replace the Vanguard submarines by the 2030s, securing the future of the   UK's nuclear deterrent. More than 40,000 UK jobs are supported through   defence nuclear work, making it a key area that boosts economic growth.
The UK Government is investing millions of pounds at HM Naval Base   Clyde to prepare for the Dreadnought submarines, while at the same time,   ensuring that the Vanguard Class can continue the mission until handing   over to the next generation of vessels."

The United States joins a broad range of international partners in strongly condemning the unjustified arrest warrant issued in Venezuela for Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez Urrutia. GonzÃ¡lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's July 28 presidential election, and this arbitrary and politically motivated action is a low point in NicolÃ¡s Maduro's ruthless pursuit of his political opponents following his attempts to steal the July 28 presidential election.
Maduro and his representatives cannot indefinitely suppress the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people and maintain power by force. The will of the people and their rights must be respected. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of those who have been unjustly detained. The path forward should be a peaceful, transparent, and inclusive democratic transition process that puts the well-being of Venezuelans at its center."

The United States accused Russia on September 4 of attempting to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election through Kremlin-run media outlets and online platforms that are designed to trick Americans into unwittingly consuming Russian propaganda, a Justice Department news release said on September 4.
The Kremlin has used media outlets such as RT, formerly Russia Today, and online platforms it backs to target U.S. voters with disinformation, the department said. RT, a major focus of the announcement, is seen as a key part of the Kremlin's propaganda efforts.
The department announced the seizure of 32 Internet domains that it said had been used in ""Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns"" that FBI Director Christopher Wray said operate at the direction of the Russian government, setting up websites ""filled with Russian government propaganda"" meant to deceive American users.
Russian companies under the control of the Russian presidential administration use the domains to covertly spread Russian government propaganda, which in addition to attempting to influence the presidential election also aims to reduce international support for Ukraine and bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, the Justice Department said.
""As alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including [first deputy chief of staff] Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a campaign to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the news release. ""An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is to secure Russia's preferred outcome in the election.""
Garland did not specify the outcome preferred by the Kremlin, but Putin said earlier this year prior to President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race, allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic party nominee, that Biden was more ""predictable"" than former President Donald Trump. Putin also said the Kremlin is prepared to work with whomever wins the election.
The department also announced the unsealing of an indictment charging Russian nationals Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27, with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Garland said the two employees of RT were charged in a $10 million scheme ""to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences with hidden Russian government messaging.""
The United States ""will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to covertly further its own propaganda efforts,"" Garland said, adding that the investigation into the matter remains ongoing. Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva are at large.
The announcement came a month after Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a speech that Russia was the primary threat to the U.S. election.
Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division said in the statement that the seizure of domains ""illustrates vividly what the U.S. government and private sector partners have warned for months: the Russian government and its proxies are aggressively accelerating the Kremlin's covert efforts to seed false stories and amplify disinformation directed at the American public.""
The Russian government has long sought to ""sow discord and chaos in the United States through propaganda and foreign malign influence campaigns,"" Olsen said, adding that the new accusations reveal that Russia is ""willing to impersonate our free and open press in its egregious schemes.""
The tactics include using RT to advance anti-U.S. messages and content and promote networks of fake websites and social media accounts that amplify the claims. Typically, these networks seize on polarizing political topics such as immigration and crime. Americans who view the content may have no idea that it either originated or was amplified by the Kremlin.
In conjunction with the domain seizures, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the designation of 10 individuals and two entities for sanctions as part of the government's response to Russia's malign influence efforts targeting the U.S. presidential election. Among the 10 individuals are Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of RT, and Elizaveta Brodskaia deputy editor in chief of RT.
The sanctions announced by the Treasury Department complement the law enforcement actions announced by the Justice Department and the State Department's designation of the Rossiya Segodnya media group and five of its subsidiaries -- RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik -- as foreign missions.
As designated entities under the Foreign Mission Act, they will be required to notify the department of all personnel working in the United States and will be required to disclose all real property they hold within the United States, the State Department said in a news release.
The State Department also announced steps to impose visa restrictions on people who act on behalf of Kremlin-supported media organizations, use those organizations as cover for covert activities, and are complicit in engaging in covert influence. Noting that visa applications are confidential, the State Department said it would not be disclosing the names of the people affected.
Moreover, the State Department announced a reward of up to $10 million relating to an organization known as RaHDit (Russian Angry Hackers Did It). The group engaged in election influence in other countries and is a threat to the 2024 U.S. election, particularly through cyberenabled influence operations, the State Department said.
""Members of RaHDit disseminate and amplify propaganda and disinformation from the Kremlin-funded and -directed organization RT and RaHDit is associated with Russian intelligence services. RaHDit is led by Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officer Aleksei Garashchenko,"" the department said.

On the morning of September 2, 2024, President Xi Jinping met with Comorian President Azali Assoumani, who is in China for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The two heads of state announced the elevation of the China-Comoros relationship to a strategic partnership.
Xi Jinping pointed out that China was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with the Comoros, and next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The two countries have firmly supported each other politically and achieved fruitful results in practical cooperation in various fields, setting a fine example of equality, solidarity and cooperation between countries of different sizes. Although China and the Comoros are far apart, the people of the two countries share the same aspiration for a better life. Xi Jinping said that he heard that the Chinese TV series ""Minning Town"" was recently aired in the Comoros. China is ready to carry out cooperation with the Comoros in poverty reduction, support the Comorian people in turning their geographical advantages and marine resources into momentum for development, and continue the cooperative partnership as the ""Minning Town"" has shown to build a China-Comoros community with a shared future. China is ready to continue to cooperate with the Comoros to implement the rapid malaria eradication program and help the Comoros achieve the goal of ""eradicating malaria by 2025"" at an early date. The two sides should take this summit as an opportunity to expand practical cooperation in such areas as economy, trade, investment, infrastructure, marine fisheries and climate change, and inject new momentum into the development of bilateral relations.
Xi Jinping appreciated the positive role the Comoros played during its rotating chairmanship of the African Union. He pointed out that China is ready to work with the Comoros to uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, enhance communication and coordination within the frameworks of the African Union, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, strengthen the emerging forces of the ""Global South"" and promote the reform of the global governance system.
Azali Assoumani thanked the Chinese side for the fraternal friendly reception and congratulated China on the successful convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. He expressed the belief that under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China will surely make greater achievements in development. The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, the Belt and Road Initiative and the three global initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are crucial to promoting the world in realizing peace, development and common prosperity, and the Comoros fully supports them. The Comoros is ready to consolidate and enhance friendly relations with China and make bilateral relations a model for Africa-China cooperation. He expressed the belief that this FOCAC summit will further boost the development of African countries. The Comoros supports China in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and supports China in achieving national reunification. The Comoros believes that Taiwan is bound to return to China. He thanked China for supporting the Comoros in performing its rotating chairmanship of the African Union and expressed willingness to work with the Chinese side for closer communication and coordination within multilateral frameworks, promote developing countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and resolve regional conflicts through dialogue.
During the summit, China and the Comoros will sign bilateral cooperation documents covering such areas as economy, trade and development.
Wang Yi was present at the meeting."

Iran's police force has fired the police commander in the city of Lahijan shortly after the death in custody of Mohammad Mirmusavi.
In announcement issued late on August 30, the national police command said the Lahijan commander was dismissed for ""lack of sufficient supervision over the performance and behavior of employees.""
Earlier, rights activists published a video of Mirmusavi's lifeless body and alleged that he had died ""due to a severe beating.""
The August 30 police statement said officials were awaiting a final report on the ""cause of the death of this citizen.""
A police statement earlier on August 30 said local police in the city in the northern Gilan Province had exhibited a ""lack of anger control"" in handling Mirmusavi. A police station commander and several officers were reportedly suspended.
Mirmusavi was arrested on August 24 after being involved in a fight. The Norway-based Kurdish rights group Hengaw said on August 28 that Mirmusavi died the day of his arrest, but it was not known whether his body had been handed over to relatives.
The incident occurred shortly before the second anniversary of the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died after being detained by Iran's so-called morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict Islamic dress code.
Her death sparked national outrage and a wave of anti-government protests.
Javad Ruhi, who was involved in the Amini protests, died in custody under unclear circumstances in September 2023. Ruhi's supporters said he had been told he would ""never leave prison alive.""
Following Ruhi's death, Amnesty International called for those responsible to be ""criminally investigated and held to account,"" adding that his ""death in custody again exposes the Iranian authorities' assault on the right to life.""

Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak took part in a thematic conference on the implementation of the agreements reached at the Global Peace Summit; the conference was dedicated to the implementation of the Food Security point of the Peace Formula. It was held online.
The event was attended by representatives of 75 partner countries and international organizations from different regions of the world. The Ukrainian side was also represented by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko, Deputy Heads of the Presidential Office Ihor Zhovkva and Mykola Tochytskyi, and Advisor to the Head of the Presidential Office Oleksandr Bevz.
Opening the event, Andriy Yermak noted that Russian aggression against Ukraine aggravates the food crisis in the world, where already every eleventh person on the planet is malnourished. However, even under these circumstances, Ukraine remains one of the leading guarantors of global food security.
""Global food security depends on the uninterrupted production, storage and supply of food. Therefore, Ukraine expects that this meeting will launch a series of very concrete steps aimed at ensuring the unimpeded supply of Ukrainian agricultural products to the countries concerned,"" he said.
First of all, this means ensuring the freedom and safety of commercial navigation in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov basins, in particular, demining and mine countermeasures along the trade routes, restoration of Ukrainian port infrastructure and its protection by air defense systems.
It is also necessary to continue supporting the ""Grain from Ukraine"" program and to reduce vulnerabilities in the logistics of Ukraine's food export system. There is a need to restore and increase the production capacity of the Ukrainian agricultural sector, in particular by de-mining farmland.
First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko spoke in detail about the situation of Ukrainian agricultural production and supply, including a significant recovery of exports from our state to countries in need.
In 2023-2024, Ukraine exported 69.86 million tons of grain, oilseeds and oil. In particular, the country managed to increase wheat exports to Africa by 41% and sunflower oil exports by 153%. In total, Ukraine exported nearly 70 million tons of grains, oilseeds, and oil. This was achieved primarily due to the restoration of logistics through the ports of the Odesa region.
In addition, thanks to the support of partners from around the world, Ukraine has been able to increase the pace of landmine clearance. Our country looks forward to further steps in support of these efforts.
Principal Deputy National Security Advisor to the U.S. President Jon Finer, who personally attended the conference in Kyiv, noted that the United States continues to support Ukraine on its path to restoring a just, lasting peace, and ending this war.
He emphasized that Russia's aggression against Ukraine has affected not only the lives of Ukrainians, but also people around the world, particularly through food security challenges.
""Thanks to the courage and resilience of Ukrainians, as well as the support of many partner countries, Ukraine was able to protect its exports and push back the Russian Black Sea Fleet,"" he emphasized.
This thematic conference was already the second of those planned in the wake of the first Peace Summit. The first, which focused on energy security, was held on August 22. Preparations are also underway for the third, which will address the release of all captured and deported Ukrainians. These events are aimed at developing a comprehensive peace plan initiated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Speech by Vladimir Putin at the official reception
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, friends,
I am sincerely delighted to visit the hospitable Mongolian land once again and to celebrate, in an impressive setting, the anniversary of our common victory in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol together with our Mongolian friends.
We are paying tribute to Soviet and Mongolian soldiers who fought in those intense and bloody battles. Their feat will forever be remembered by our nations, and it will be emblazoned in the history of Russia and Mongolia. The courage and fortitude of the heroes of Khalkhin Gol stopped a dangerous enemy who hatched far-reaching plans to occupy the whole of Mongolia.
The victory at Khalkhin Gol greatly influenced the destinies of the region and the entire course of World War II. After sustaining the defeat, Japan refrained from attacking the Soviet Union, and our country was able to deploy all its forces, including fresh Far Eastern divisions, against Nazi Germany.
Of course, we remember the substantial support offered to us by the Mongolian nation during World War II, during the Great Patriotic War. Mongolia assisted the front by supplying food, warm clothing and also raised funds to manufacture tanks and aircraft.
Loyal to the traditions of combat brotherhood laid down by our fathers and grandfathers, Russia and Mongolia continue to actively collaborate and to develop their all-encompassing strategic partnership. I would like to stress that Russia has always aimed to strengthen friendly relations with Mongolia; it has perceived and continues to perceive this as one of its foreign policy priorities.
In turn, we appreciate the fact that Mongolia also steers towards mutually beneficial cooperation with us. Our current talks with President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh and other Mongolian leaders have clearly confirmed this. All meetings took place in a traditionally constructive and substantive atmosphere and made it possible to review a wide range of issues and topical regional and international problems, and to chart future prospects of our diverse partnership.
The people of Mongolia have a nice saying: ""Choose a new robe but an old friend."" I am convinced that we will certainly raise and address the most ambitious objectives, while relying on our time-tested solid friendship. We will actively expand our collaboration in traditional sectors, and we will launch cooperation in new high-tech spheres; we will work hand-in-hand to strengthen the entire range of our bilateral partnership for the benefit of the peoples of Russia and Mongolia.
In conclusion, I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate the President of Mongolia, as well as all Mongolian and Russian citizens who are present here, on the 85th anniversary of the glorious victory in the battle on the river Khalkhin Gol.
I would like to offer a toast to our common victory, to further development of Russian-Mongolian comprehensive strategic partnership, to the health of the President of Mongolia, Mr Khurelsukh, and everyone present here, and for the well-being and prosperity of our nations."

New York, IRNA -- Iran's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York Amir Saied Iravani has said that the Israeli regime is threatening other regional countries with nuclear annihilation, and its nuclear arsenal poses a significant threat to both regional and global peace and security.
Iravani made the comment on Wednesday as a addressed the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on the International Day Against Nuclear Tests.
The following is the full text of the Iranian envoy's speech at the UNGA meeting:
In the Name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful
Mr. President,
Allow me to begin by thanking you for convening this meeting. I would also like to join other delegates in commending Kazakhstan for taking the initiative to promote the International Day against Nuclear Tests.
Indeed, observance of this day is the commemoration of the victims of nuclear tests- the peoples who suffered, is suffering and will continue to suffer due to the enduring effects of radioactive fallout; the peoples most of whom were not the citizens of countries that conducted the nuclear tests.
Celebrating this day also signifies the international community's commitment to protecting the environment from the destructive effects of nuclear tests, many of which have occurred beyond the borders of the countries that conducted them.
Similarly, recognizing this day as an international event reflects the longstanding commitment of the international community to ending nuclear weapon tests, which is essential for achieving a world free of nuclear weapons.
Mr. President,
In commemoration of the International Day against Nuclear Tests, Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs) should be mainly addressed, as they possess the capability to conduct such tests, with approximately 2,000 tests carried out since 1945, including 1,054 by the US alone.
At a time when all nuclear-armed states are planning to modernize, upgrade, or extend the life of their nuclear weapons and facilities, as well as develop new easy-to-use nuclear weapons, ending nuclear weapon testing is of outmost importance.
To that end, Nuclear-Weapon States have the primary responsibility. They need to adopt practical measures to stop all kinds of nuclear weapon tests. In 2000 NPT Review Conference the Nuclear Weapon States committed themselves to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) without delay as one of the 13 practical steps in implementing the Article VI of the NPT.
Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs) hold the primary responsibility for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and should take the lead in this effort. The ratification of the CTBT by NWSs would be a significant step toward rebuilding the confidence of Non-Nuclear Weapon States (NNWSs) and the international community.
Current situation testifies that, no matter how important the voluntary moratoria on nuclear tests are, they cannot substitute for a comprehensive universal and verifiable legally-binding prohibition on all types of nuclear explosions, including in alternative ways.
Mr. President,
Commemoration of this day is also an opportunity for international community to make Israeli regime promptly accede to the NPT without any precondition and to place all of its nuclear facilities under the full-scope IAEA safeguards. The current situation is alarming, as the Israeli regime is threatening other regional countries with nuclear annihilation, and its nuclear arsenal poses a significant threat to both regional and global peace and security.
Mr. President,
By observing this day, we should also renew our commitment to the noble goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons- the only absolute guarantee against the threat or use of these inhumane weapons.
As a signatory to the CTBT, the Islamic Republic of Iran considers this treaty a step toward nuclear disarmament, and in this context, believes it cannot substitute for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Consequently, nuclear disarmament must remain a top priority for the international community, and all forms of nuclear testing must be unequivocally prohibited. Such tests contradict both the letter and spirit of the CTBT and, more importantly, violate the legal obligations of the Nuclear-Weapon States under Article VI of the NPT.

4 September 2024
The UK and Kuwait have today (Wednesday 4 September) announced new   joint funding plans to help UNICEF deliver lifesaving aid to almost 2.5   million people in Gaza and Yemen.
The funding will go towards UNICEF's efforts to restore water supply   and sanitation systems in Gaza, and to sustain primary healthcare   services in Yemen, and has been set out in two Memoranda of   Understanding (MoUs) signed by both parties.
The UK and Kuwait will provide Â£4.5 million of joint support ($6   million in total - $3 million to each project), to UNICEF, whose work is   expected to benefit approximately 1,000,000 in Gaza and 1,450,000   people in Yemen.
Minister for the Middle East Hamish Falconer said:
Conflict has aggravated the humanitarian crises in Gaza and Yemen   and the UK is committed to pushing for more lifesaving aid to reach   those in desperate need.
The UK and Kuwait's joint funding towards UNICEF's lifesaving work   in Gaza and Yemen demonstrates our shared commitment to tackle some of   the worst humanitarian crises in the world.
I am proud of the UK and Kuwait's close ties,   which have now endured for more than 125 years and continue to go from   strength to strength.
Kuwait's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs His Excellency Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said:
This year marks an important milestone for both the State of Kuwait   and the UK as we jointly commemorate 125 years of partnership. Kuwait   is proud of its deep-rooted and historic ties with the UK and is   committed to deepening this partnership in all its aspects. This week in   London, we were happy to witness the commencement of the Kuwait   cultural week in the UK and the successful convening of the 21st session   of the JSG. The Action Plan signed during the JSG paves the way for   further collaboration in a number of fields.
We are pleased to cooperate with the UK to   support the essential work of UNICEF in both Palestine and Yemen. As   pioneers in the field of international development, both our countries   will continue to explore avenues of cooperation to provide development   and humanitarian assistance to populations affected by conflicts and   natural disasters.
UNICEF's Representative to the Gulf Area Eltayeb Adam said:
UNICEF deeply appreciates the generous contributions from both the   UK and Kuwait, which will have a transformative impact on the lives of   children and families in Gaza and Yemen.
This funding is not just a financial commitment;   it is a beacon of hope for communities struggling with the devastating   consequences of conflict. Together, we can ensure that essential   services such as water, sanitation, and healthcare reach those who need   them most, restoring dignity and a sense of normalcy to countless lives.
The 21st UK-Kuwait Joint Steering Group (JSG) was co-chaired in   London today by the UK Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer,   and Kuwait's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Sheikh   Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
In the margins of the JSG, Minister Falconer and the Director General   of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development Waleed Al-Bahar signed   the two MoUs.
In addition, Minister Falconer and Sheikh Jarrah also reached an   agreement for planned UK support to Kuwait's Civil Service Commission on   the delivery of training programmes to Kuwaiti Government employees,   and signed an action plan detailing how their respective Governments   will drive forward cooperation on a range of key issues such as defence   and security and international development and humanitarian   partnerships, over the coming months.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba submitted his resignation Wednesday as part of an expected government reshuffle.
Parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk posted Kuleba's resignation letter on Facebook.
Lawmakers are expected to consider the resignation of multiple officials, including the deputy prime minister and the justice minister, with new appointments coming Thursday, officials said.
Kuleba, who became foreign minister in 2020, has helped lead Ukraine's outreach to the world throughout the Russian invasion that began in early 2022. He met regularly with Western officials, including European Union foreign ministers last week as Ukraine sought more military aid.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address Tuesday that Ukraine needs to ""strengthen some areas"" of its government and that ""personnel decisions have been prepared.""
""We need a new level of simultaneous information work, cultural and diplomatic. And a new level of relations with the global Ukrainian community,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Now is the time to give new strength to Ukraine's governmental institutions, and I am grateful to everyone who will help.""

Sunday, 01 September 2024 3:23 AM
The forces enlisted with Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) have arrested a member of the so-called Jaish al-Adl terrorist group in Sistan and Baluchestan Province in the country's extreme southeast.
The arrest took place in the Pishin District of the province's Rask County, the Corps reported on Saturday.
It followed intelligence surveillance operation and prompt action by the forces of the Quds Headquarters of the IRGC's Ground Force in the province, the report added.
Upon facing imminent arrest, the terrorist wounded himself with a self-inflicted gunshot, but was transferred to the hospital, where he is receiving treatment, it noted.
According to the report, the arrestee had in the past engaged in armed attack against the headquarters of the Basij volunteer force and the police station in Pishin.
In May, the Corps' Ground Force captured primary sponsors of the terrorist group in Sistan and Baluchestan during two separate joint operations conducted by intelligence and security forces.
Jaish al-Adl is a notorious terrorist group with headquarters in Pakistan, and has been involved in numerous terror attacks against Iran.
The latest of the attacks took place in April, when at least five police officers were killed in an attack staged by members of the group in the province.
On January 16, two major strongholds of the group in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan were precisely struck and completely wiped out by a salvo of missiles as well as a squadron of combat drones.
That occurred after the group claimed responsibility for an assault on Rask County's police headquarters on December 15 last year that had claimed the lives of 11 police forces and injured at least six others."

The United States on Wednesday hit Moscow-linked companies and their employees with a combination of criminal charges, sanctions and other measures in response to what U.S. officials described as a malicious influence campaign meant to upend American society and impact the outcome of the presidential election.
The announcements by the departments of Justice, State and Treasury charge Russia with breaking U.S. laws and international norms in a wide-ranging effort directed, in part, by members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.
The schemes ""make clear the ends to which the Russian government, including at its highest levels, is willing to go to undermine our democratic process,"" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, addressing a meeting of the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force.
""This is deadly serious, and we are going to treat it accordingly,"" he added.
The Justice Department indictment unsealed Wednesday alleges Russia tried to ""hide its hand,"" using two employees of the state-controlled RT media outlet, shell companies and fake personas to funnel nearly $10 million to a U.S. company in Tennessee to promote and distribute English-language material favorable to the Russian government.
Officials said the unnamed company has produced almost 2,000 videos since November 2023, posting on social media platforms such as TikTok, X and YouTube, garnering more than 16 million views on YouTube alone.
But there are concerns the Russian operation may be even bigger.
""While RT America suspended its official operations in the U.S. back in early 2022, our investigation revealed that since at least last year, RT has used people living and working inside the U.S. to facilitate contracts with American media figures to create and disseminate Russian propaganda,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.
""The content was pitched as legitimate independent news, when in fact, much of it was created in Russia by RT employees who work for the Russian government,"" he added.
VOA has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington and to a media company matching the description of the company in the indictment, for comment. Neither have so far responded.
Some of the commentators and influencers who say they are linked to the company in question, Tenet Media, have spoken out.
""Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims,"" podcast host Tim Pool posted on X.
""I cannot speak for anyone else at the company as to what they do or to what they are instructed,"" he wrote, adding, ""Never at any point did anyone other than I have full editorial control of the show and the contents of the show are often apolitical.""
Benny Johnson, host of ""The Benny Show"" podcast, called the allegations in the Justice Department indictment disturbing, adding that they also ""make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme.""
The U.S.-based company has not been charged, although the Justice Department said it failed to inform audiences that it was funded and directed by RT. Officials also noted that the U.S. company and its founders also failed to register, as required, as foreign agents.
RT ridiculed the U.S. allegations on its website and on social media.
""If they kick us out completely, how will they conduct the next elections?"" RT's website quoted Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan as writing on Telegram. ""They don't have any other strategies except to scaremonger about the almighty RT.""
The RT employees identified in the indictment â 31-year-old Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and 27-year-old Elena Afanasyeva â are charged with failing to register as foreign agents and money laundering.
The violation of the foreign agent registration rules carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. If convicted on the money laundering charge, they could each face a maximum of 20 years behind bars.
In addition to targeting the main players in the RT-led influence operation, U.S. officials took aim at another Russian operation Wednesday, seizing 32 internet domains used by Moscow to spread disinformation.
The separate indictment alleges three Russian companies â Social Design Agency, Structura National Technology and ANO Dialog â violated U.S. money laundering and trademark laws in another attempt to confuse Americans in what was known as Operation Doppelganger.
""These websites were designed to appear to American readers as if they were major U.S. news sites like The Washington Post or Fox News,"" Garland said. ""But in fact, they were fake sites.""
Instead, internal Kremlin documents obtained by the U.S. allege Russian officials sought to fill the sites with propaganda designed to bolster the chances of former President Donald Trump, assessed by U.S. intelligence agencies to be Moscow's preferred candidate, winning the White House in November.
In addition to the actions taken by the U.S. Justice Department, the Treasury Department on Wednesday sanctioned two Russian entities and 10 Russia nationals, including the RT's Simonyan.
And the State Department announced Wednesday new visa restrictions for individuals acting on behalf on Russian-supported media organizations.
State Department officials also designated several Russian media outlets as foreign missions.
Rossiya Segodnya, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly and Sputnik must now notify the U.S. government of all personnel they have working in the U.S. and also disclose any property holdings.
""Russia remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,"" said a senior FBI official, briefing reporters following the announcement of the U.S. actions.
""Moscow continues to use a broad stable of influence actors and tactics and is working to hide its hand, enhance its reach and create content that resonates more with United States-based audiences,"" the official added.
Not all of Russia's tactics are new.
Moscow began leaning heavily on social media personalities in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential elections four years ago. And some of the Russian companies charged with creating fake news sites have also been called out for trying to seed Russian-generated content in news outlets across Latin America.
What worries, U.S. officials now, though, is the pace and scale of the Russian operations targeting the upcoming U.S. presidential election.
""It's an acceleration,"" Garland said. ""It's use of AI and cyber techniques that were not available in earlier elections ... therefore, it's a bigger threat than it ever was before.""
And Russia is not alone. U.S. officials have also shared worries about China and Iran, expressing particular concerns about Tehran's meddling efforts.
""We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle that includes recently reported activities by Iran to compromise former President [Donald] Trump's campaign and to avoid an election outcome that it regards as against its interests,"" Garland said.
""The Justice Department's message is clear,"" he added. ""We have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our demographic, our democratic system of government."""

Saturday, 31 August 2024 9:29 AM
Germany has pulled out its military forces from the country of Niger in the restive Sahel region of Africa.
At a signing ceremony on Friday in Niamey, representatives from both the Nigerian and German Defense Ministries signed an agreement finalizing ""the withdrawal of German troops and equipment from Niger.""
Nigerien and German officials read out joint statements announcing the completion of the withdrawal.
""This withdrawal does not mark the end of military cooperation between Niger and Germany, in fact the two sides are committed to maintaining military relations,"" they said.
The Bundeswehr, Germany's army, said it removed the last 60 soldiers and equipment from Niger.
For eight years German soldiers had served in the international MINUSMA (United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali).
MINUSMA was established under the auspices of the United Nations on April 25, 2013 after the Tuareg rebellion of 2012. The UN peacekeeping mission was terminated on June 30, 2023.
Germany's airbase in Niamey, which served as a logistics center for the UN mission, had been staffed by up to 120 men and women at any one time. Since February 2016, some 3,200 German soldiers deployed to the airbase served in the region.
Last year on July 26, the country witnessed a coup d'Ã©tat widely supported by Malians, resulting in the removal and detention of pro-West president Mohamed Bazoum.
The Bundeswehr initially announced its decision to withdraw German troops in July, noting that it had no cooperative working agreement with the new military government.
In May, Germany and Niger reached an interim agreement allowing the German military to continue operating its airbase in the capital Niamey until the end of August.
Negotiations between the two sides to extend that agreement broke down, notably because the German military would no longer benefit from immunity from prosecution.
The withdrawal of German troops from Niger followed the pullout of troops from the United States and France, the former colonial power.
Niger's coup was one of several in the region in the recent past as countries cut their traditional colonial ties linking them to Western imperialism.
In Niger, Russian ""military trainers"" have replaced the Western troops in Niamey."

Russia launched a new aerial bombardment of Ukraine on Monday, its third in a week, as it targeted the capital Kyiv and other cities on the first day of the school year.
The massive assault came around 5:30 a.m. after a countrywide air alert, although Ukrainian officials said the number of casualties was limited and property damage minor. But an attack Sunday night on an orphanage in the northeastern city of Sumy wounded two children and 11 adults, according to Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspilne.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has attacked Russia with drones aimed at refineries and electrical plants, including one near Moscow on Sunday that caused fires and other damage.
Ukraine's air force said it shot down nine ballistic missiles. In all, Ukraine said Moscow's forces had launched 58 missiles and one-way attack drones targeting Ukraine sites.
Fighting also raged on near the eastern Ukraine city of Pokrovsk, where Russia has gained territory in recent weeks. In the latest fighting, Ukraine's general staff said that Russian troops had attacked 63 times in the past day.
In Kyiv, Serhii Popko, the head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram that Russia launched a drone along with more than 10 cruise missiles and 10 ballistic missiles aimed at the city.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said falling debris from intercepts made by Ukrainian air defenses injured at least two people.
The Russian attack also damaged a boiler house at a water plant and the entrance to a subway station that is used as a bomb shelter.
The governors of the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Poltava regions said Monday that air defenses shot down Russian drones over their regions, while the governor of Cherkasy said a missile was destroyed in the region's skies.
Russia said Monday it shot down two Ukrainian drones, including one over the Belgorod region and another over the Black Sea.
Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces hit multiple districts, damaging a commercial facility as well as several homes. At least one person was injured, he said.

Tehran, IRNA -- The head of the religious council of Hezbollah, Mohammad Yazbek, has emphasized confronting the Zionist regime with the language of force.
According to Alahed, Yazbek expressed confidence in victory over the occupiers.
He added that if the Zionist enemy is not confronted, a day will come when everyone will understand that the enemy does not differentiate between people and that the only way to control the enemy is by force.
Yazbek noted that the resistance was formed based on their values to confront the enemy, and that the disappearance of Imam Musa Sadr and his companions was the price for his stances against the Zionist-American project.
On August 25, Hezbollah targeted important positions in northern Tel Aviv in the first phase of a retaliatory response to Israel's assassination of Hezbollah's top commander, Fuad Shukr.

Warships of the Chinese and Singaporean navies have launched the harbor phase of a joint exercise ahead of the sea phase off the southern Chinese coast, a move experts said on Sunday displays how China and Southeast Asian countries can have military cooperation that contributes to peace and stability.
After the frigate Sanya and the minesweeper Hejian of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy as well as the frigate RSS Stalwart of the Singaporean navy assembled at a naval port in Zhanjiang, South China's Guangdong Province on Thursday for the China-Singapore Exercise Cooperation 2024 joint maritime exercise scheduled from Friday to September 5, these vessels, together with the PLA Navy's destroyer Zhanjiang, opened to the public as a part of the harbor phase of the exercise on Saturday, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Sunday.
The harbor phase will last until Tuesday, after which the participating vessels will embark on the sea phase in waters off Zhanjiang, CCTV reported.
The exercise aims to consolidate a mechanism that sees the two navies host joint drills alternately in their countries every year, expand the drills' the scale and influence, and build a good situation for China's military cooperation with countries in Southeast Asia, the PLA Navy said in a press release.
The two sides will organize training courses including joint anti-surface strike, replenishment-at-sea, joint search and rescue, as well as VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure), Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said at a regular press conference on Thursday. He noted that as it is the third edition of this exercise, this year's drill will further enhance mutual trust and friendship, and promote pragmatic exchanges and cooperation.
A Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday that the frigates and the minesweeper sent by the two sides could serve to maintain the openness of key international shipping lanes in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, demonstrating the two navies' capabilities in safeguarding peace and stability in the region.
It will set a good example for military exchanges and cooperation among Southeast Asian countries, especially the Philippines, against the background of tensions in the South China Sea, the expert said."

The famed ""Russian spy"" beluga whale was found dead in the Stavanger area of Norway last week, according to a statement by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, and an autopsy has been ordered to find out if he was deliberately killed.
The whale, discovered in 2019 off the coast of Norway, became a international phenomenon after it was seen wearing a harness with ""Equipment of St. Petersburg"" written on it, creating speculation that it might be linked to Russian espionage.
The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir after the Norwegian word for whale, hval, and the whale's connection to Russia, was found dead on August 31. Initial official reports did not indicate a cause of death.
But NOAH, a Norwegian animal rights group, and One Whale, a group created to track Hvaldimir, released a joint statement saying there are ""strong indications that he may have been harmed by people.""
After viewing the body on September 2, Regina Crosby Haug, the head of One Whale, told the AFP news agency that the whale ""had multiple bullet wounds around his body."" Several veterinarians and biologists viewed images of Hvaldimir's body and also indicated to One Whale and NOAH that he had been harmed by people.
Hvaldimir's body was sent on September 2 to undergo an autopsy, with a report expected in around three weeks, according to a spokesperson at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute.
Hvaldimir had aroused speculation about Russian spying since his discovery. According to Joergen Ree Wiig of the Norwegian Fisheries Directorate in 2019, even Norwegian military officials were interested in the whale's origins.
Wiig said that the harness that Hvaldimir was wearing when he was discovered had a camera mount but no camera. The harness was apparently removed at some point after he was first seen in the Arctic Sea.
While Russia does not have a known history of using whales for military purposes, Dmitry Glazov, the deputy head of a beluga whale program who works at the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Interfax in April 2019 that the Russian military may be working with belugas.
Moscow has never issued any official reaction to speculation that he could have been used as a Russian spy.

Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi has expressed confidence that Moldovan authorities and society can ensure smooth and democratic elections despite fears of Russian meddling when voters go to the polls in three months to pick a president and weigh in on EU aspirations.
Senior Moldovan officials have repeatedly accused Moscow of hybrid and other attempts to undermine the pro-Western government in Chisinau -- including through covert operations and influence campaigns -- since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in early 2022.
Reform-minded President Maia Sandu is running for reelection on October 20 in a vote that will coincide with a referendum asking Moldovans if they want the pursuit of EU membership enshrined in the constitution.
""We are confident...like in previous elections, when we've had challenges, but we've always had democratic elections,"" Popsoi told RFE/RL at the Globsec security conference in Prague on August 31, after acknowledging the perceived risk from Russian and pro-Russian elements.
""And democratic standards for elections are sacrosanct in Moldova,"" he added.
The United States, in particular, has warned of alleged Russian plans to use disinformation to interfere in the October voting to derail Moldova's significant progress on reforms.
Moldova lies between Ukraine and Romania and has been riven for decades by a pro-Russian breakaway leadership in its Transdniester region, where Russia maintains hundreds of troops at a former Soviet weapons depot.
""We are working with our electorate, campaigning, explaining, the risks and the threats that Moldova faces in a democratic environment, in a competitive democratic space, which unfortunately the pro-Russian candidates would not be able to enjoy in Russia,"" Popsoi said.
Moldovan authorities initially banned a party founded by fugitive businessman Ihan Shor, a 37-year-old entrepreneur convicted in Moldova of masterminding the theft in 2014 of around $1 billion in banking assets who has since resettled in Russia.
But critics have also suggested that pro-Russian parties are trying to unseat Sandu and her allies but also use the threat of unrest to destabilize the vote.
""Of course there might be attempts, but as long as there is a democratic election, our citizens have learned through many iterations to accept the outcomes of elections,"" Popsoi said. ""You may not like it, but it's a democratic election.""
U.S. officials have said the election will be ""historic and pivotal"" for the country of around 3 million people.
""We are optimistic that our citizens, by and large the majority, know to make the difference between right and wrong,"" Popsoi said. ""And those that may be full victims to certain instrumentalizations by the Kremlin will not be large enough to cause any significant troubles.""

""We have produced our required [defensive] equipment based on existing threats and even ahead of the threats, which have been evaluated rigorously, so we can use them precisely if need be,"" Sabahifard noted.
The commander said the enemies were well aware that the country's combat capability had been considerably enhanced compared to the previous years.
He considered the Islamic Republic's current defensive systems to be incomparable in quality to its past equipment as well as being in a ""more modern and advanced"" state than the most sophisticated equipment across the world.
He hailed that the Air Defense Force's equipment were ""at the cutting edge of the world's state-of-the-art technology,"" adding that the entire equipment had been produced indigenously without dependence on any other country.
""This is the power of the Air Defense Force,"" Sabahifard asserted.
The country has been relying on domestic endeavors and know-how to make significant advances in the direction of enhancing the self-sufficiency of its Armed Forces.
Heeding the directives of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the country would not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, which are entirely meant for defensive purposes and are, therefore, never subject to negotiation.
Sabahifard, meanwhile, noted that the IRIADF had invariably ""flaunted"" its power in the face of Iran's enemies, most notably the United States and the Israeli regime, throughout the 45 years that had past since the victory of the country's Islamic Revolution in 1979.
He cited the force's ""invariable steadfastness"" in its efforts to advance the goals of the Revolution, including during former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's Western-backed imposed war of the 1980s and the other crises that have faced the country over the recent years."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Islamic resistance in Iraq targeted Haifa, the largest port in the occupied territories, with drones on Wednesday.
Through a statement, the resistance group referred to the attack as a response to the Zionist regime's massacre against the Palestinian people.
The attack was carried out in support of the Palestinians, the statement says.
The Israeli army has confirmed the drone attack and claimed its anticipation.
The Islamic resistance in Iraq has stressed that it continues to target the enemy as the resistance groups have already warned the occupying regime that they will heighten anti-Israel operations if the regime does not halt aggression.

The European Union has told Serbia that maintaining ties with Russia during the ongoing invasion of Ukraine is incompatible with the bloc's values and the EU accession process, highlighting a running dispute between Brussels and the candidate country.
The warning followed the announcement of a meeting between Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an economic forum in Vladivostok on September 3-6.
""The European Union has been crystal clear with our partners: Relations with Russia cannot be business as usual after Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine,"" the bloc said in response to a request from RFE/RL's Balkan Service for comment on September 3.
Brussels also said the EU ""wants to count on all candidate countries as reliable European partners for common principles, values, security, and prosperity.""
Putin's office announced that the Russian president will meet with Vulin on September 4.
Putin will be meeting with Malaysian and Chinese officials the same day.
Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic told RFE/RL that he saw the announcement of the meeting in the media, adding that ""it is nothing epochal or so terrible"" for Vulin to meet with Putin in Russia.
""We have not broken off diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation; it is not forbidden for someone to meet with representatives of the Russian Federation,"" Vucevic added during a visit to Novi Pazar in southwestern Serbia.
Vucevic also emphasized that Serbia doesn't encourage the war in Ukraine and does not support the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. ""We have voted for all the resolutions confirming Ukraine's integrity, but we are not giving up our friendship with the Russian Federation, we have not imposed sanctions, we have not expelled the ambassador. On the contrary, we maintain normal communication,"" Vucevic said.
He noted that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- whose policies have angered the European Union -- had met with Putin.
""We will not apologize for our policy or justify it. We can explain our policy,"" Vucevic said.
Vulin was put under U.S. sanctions over his dealings with Russia, among other things.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on August 31 denied having close ties to Putin, telling attendees at a Prague security conference that his country is no ""Trojan horse"" for Moscow despite its refusal to join sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine invasion.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi says the country's core policy is based on the continuation of support for the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah.
Araqchi made the remarks on Sunday in a meeting with Abdullah Safioddin, the representative of Hezbollah in Iran.
He expressed Iran's support for the resistance front and the legitimate fight of regional nations against the Israeli regime's occupation.
Safioddin, for his part, said Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other officials have extended their congratulations to Araqchi over his appointment as Iran's new foreign minister.
During the meeting, the top Iranian diplomat and Hezbollah representative discussed the latest developments in the region, particularly the resistance front's battle against Israel in Lebanon, and the ongoing incidents in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
In a meeting with Iran's former acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani back in June, Nasrallah expressed his gratitude to Iran for its ""steadfast"" support for peoples and resistance movements in the region in defiance of sanctions and threats."

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the Ukrainian forces' incursion into Russia's Kursk region will not stop Russia's armed forces from advancing in eastern Ukraine, vowing to deal with the Ukrainian ""bandits"" on Russian territory.
""Their calculation was to stop our offensive actions in key parts of the Donbas,"" Putin told a group of students in the republic of Tyva on Monday, adding that ""The result is known... They did not achieve stopping our advance in the Donbas.""
The Ukrainian forces' attack on the Kursk region on August 6 took Russia by surprise, with Kiev forces seizing control of dozens of towns and villages near the border in an attempt to divert Russian forces away from the front line in eastern Ukraine. The surprise incursion has so far displaced around 130,000 people.
Putin also acknowledged that despite Kiev's failure to implement its objective, the Ukrainian offensive has caused some difficulties for the local residents who were forced to evacuate from their homes in Russia's Kursk region.
""People are going through difficult experiences, especially in the Kursk region. But the main aim that the enemy had -- to stop our offensive in Donbas -- it did not achieve,"" Putin said.
He emphasized that Moscow is presently seeing advances at a ""rate that we did not have for a long time.""
""Of course, we have to deal with these bandits that entered the territory of the Russian Federation, specifically the Kursk region, attempting to destabilize the situation in the border areas,"" Putin said.
In the meantime, Russia launched a barrage of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles at Kiev and other Ukrainian cities on Monday.
Ukrainian officials confirmed attacks in Kiev, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Poltava, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions.
Head of Kiev's military administration said more than 10 cruise missiles, about 10 ballistic missiles, and a drone fired at the Ukrainian capital and its suburbs had been destroyed.
Russia's attack came a day after the Ukrainian forces launched a heavy drone attack on Russian territory in which its air defense forces intercepted and destroyed 158 Ukrainian drones targeting multiple Russian targets.
Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its troops had liberated two more settlements in the Donetsk region, including Ptyche, just 21 km southeast of Pokrovsk, and were ""continuing to advance deep into the enemy defenses.""
Two-and-a-half years have passed since the conflict turned into a full-fledged war between the two neighboring countries.
Russian troops launched the special military operation on February 24, 2022, aiming to liberate the Donbas region where the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk were suffering from regular attacks on them by Ukrainian forces."

A commander of the Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) warns that Tehran's response to Israel's assassination of Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, will be ""different and surprising.""
Brigadier General Mohsen Chizari, deputy commander for operations of the IRGC Quds Force, made the remarks in an interview with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) on Wednesday, stressing that Iran will respond to Haniyeh's assassination ""in due time.""
Touching upon ""Operation Arbaeen"" carried out by Lebanon's resistance movement Hezbollah against the Israeli regime, Chizari stressed that the attack was in response to the assassination of the group's top commander Fuad Shukr, adding that Iran's crushing response will definitely be different.
Haniyeh was assassinated alongside one of his bodyguards in the Iranian capital Tehran on July 31, a day after he attended the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian.
Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has warned the Israeli regime of a ""harsh response"" for the assassination of Haniyeh, saying the Islamic Republic must avenge the blood of the Palestinian resistance leader.
Elsewhere in his remarks, Chizari said that the Israeli regime's crimes against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have convinced people around the world that Israel is a ""usurping and oppressive occupation regime.""
The senior Iranian commander further noted that the more Israel persists with its full-scale military onslaught against different areas across the West Bank, the more difficult the situation will be for it.
""The resistance structure remains strong in Gaza, and is emerging and strengthening in the West Bank. Today, the Israeli regime is taking measures to prevent the formation and strengthening of the resistance in the West Bank, but it will never succeed,"" he asserted.
Chizari further noted that the ""Zionist leaders"" definitely know that their crimes and operations in the West Bank as well as the Gaza Strip will be in vain and they are looking for a way to get out of this predicament by any means.
He also emphasized that the resistance will definitely emerge victorious out of the current battle in Gaza, noting that the Israelis will fail to achieve their goals.
On August 28, the Israeli military launched a massive West Bank assault, deploying hundreds of troops and conducting airstrikes on Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the usurping regime.
Local Palestinian resistance forces have been confronting the invading Israeli military since the start of the aggression, which is the largest in the occupied West Bank in more than two decades.
So far, dozens of Palestinians have been killed in Israel's West Bank assault.
Israeli forces and settlers have killed almost 680 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since 7 October, 2023 when the regime launched its genocidal war on Gaza.."

3 September 2024
Security challenges facing Europe were at the top of the agenda   during the first visit by Minister for Europe Stephen Doughty to Central   Europe, concluding today (3 September).
During a dual-leg visit to the region including stints in both the   Czech Republic and Slovenia, the minister attended the GLOBSEC forum in   Prague followed by the Bled Strategic Forum at Lake Bled in Slovenia.
European security was front and centre of those conversations, as   threats including disinformation, cyber-attacks, organised immigration   crime and Putin's illegal war in Ukraine continue to transpire across   the continent.
The visit comes as the UK continues work to reset the country's   relationship with Europe, an ambition grounded in a new spirit of   co-operation intended to strengthen ties, tackle barriers to trade and   collaborate in the face of shared global challenges from climate change   to illegal migration.
That reset was emphasised by the Prime Minister during a visit to   Germany and France last week, and by the Foreign Secretary during his   travels to Germany, Poland and Sweden in recent weeks. It has also been   the focus of discussions by the European Union Relations Minister Nick   Thomas-Symonds in Brussels.
Minister Doughty spoke at the GLOBSEC Forum, the premier Central and   Eastern European security forum held in Prague this year, alongside   counterparts from the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Moldova.
At a panel event on countering Russian hybrid threats, the minister   emphasised work being done by the UK and partners to degrade Russia's   network of spies and take action against Putin's destabilising activity.   This includes the largest and most severe package of sanctions ever   imposed on Russia, and joint efforts in countering Russian   disinformation intended to negatively influence elections across Europe.
The minister then travelled to Slovenia for the Bled Strategic Forum,   where he made clear that the UK will continue to support Slovenia in   tackling the shared challenges of illegal migration and criminal gangs.   The UK and Slovenia's continued co-operation in this field follows   discussions at this year's European Political Community Summit in July,   where the Prime Minister met Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, releasing a joint statement committing to further cooperation on tackling organised immigration crime.
He also focused attention on promoting stability in the Western   Balkans, amid increasing tensions and attempted interference from malign   actors in the region.
Speaking at a panel event at the Bled Strategic Forum, Minister Doughty said:
As a new government to the UK, we are absolutely clear we are   committed to multilateral systems, we're committed to the rule of law,   we're committed to NATO.
We're committed to Ukraine; we're committed to standing up to   Russia; to Iran ... and we're committed to working with our allies whether   that's in the EU, whether that's outside the EU in Europe; whether   that's across the transatlantic relationship or whether that's around   the World.
Not only on those security challenges, but also   on climate change, on growth and prosperity for people, on tackling   poverty, on equal rights, on gender equality.
During the visit, the minister also met Czech and Slovenian   counterparts - Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Marian, and Foreign   Minister Jan Lipavsky, as well as Slovenian Foreign Minister Marko   Stucin - to emphasise plans to pursue a positive, forward-looking   relationship with allies across the region as part of the wider   UK-Europe reset.
The visit also builds upon progress made at Blenheim Palace during the European Political Community in July,   where European nations underscored the strength of international   support for Ukraine, and joint commitment to regional security."
6M5673V7XO_X1RJ3RDXJ99LE99,First phase of polio campaign concludes successfully in Gaza,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240904-who01.htm,"4 September 2024  News release  Jerusalem, Amman, Geneva
Over 187 000 children under ten years of age were   vaccinated with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) in central Gaza   during the first phase of a two-round polio vaccination campaign,   conducted between 1-3 September 2024. Vaccination coverage in this   phase exceeded the initial estimated target of 157 000 children due to   population movement towards central Gaza, and expanded coverage in areas   outside the humanitarian pause zone.
To ensure no child is   missed in this area, polio vaccination will continue at four large   health facilities in central Gaza over the next few days. Vaccine doses   have been supplied to these sites to meet any additional needs.
""It   has been extremely encouraging to see thousands of children being able   to access polio vaccines, with the support of their resilient families   and courageous health workers, despite the deplorable conditions they   have braved over the last 11 months. All parties respected the   humanitarian pause and we hope to see this positive momentum continue,""   said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the occupied   Palestinian territory.
The first phase of the campaign was   conducted by 513 teams, consisting of over 2180 health and community   outreach workers. Vaccination was provided at 143 fixed sites, including   hospitals, medical points, primary care centres, camps where displaced   people are living, key public gathering spaces such as temporary   learning spaces, food and water distribution points, and transit routes   leading from central towards northern and southern Gaza. Additionally,   mobile teams visited tents and hard to-reach areas to ensure they   reached families who were unable to visit fixed sites. The presence of a   substantial number of children eligible for vaccination who were unable   to reach vaccination sites due to insecurity, necessitated special   missions to Al-Maghazi, Al-Bureij and Al-Mussader - areas just outside   of the agreed zone for the humanitarian pause.
Preparations   are underway to roll out the next phase of the campaign, which will be   conducted in southern Gaza from 5-8 September 2024, targeting an   estimated 340 000 children below ten years of age. Some 517 teams,   including 384 mobile teams, will be deployed. Nearly 300 community   outreach workers have already begun outreach to families in southern   Gaza to raise awareness about the campaign, while 490 vaccine carriers,   90 cold storage boxes, and other supplies have been transferred to Khan   Younis for distribution to vaccination sites.
The third and last   phase of the polio vaccination campaign will be implemented in northern   Gaza from 9-11 September 2024, targeting around 150 000 children.
At   least 90% vaccination coverage during each round of the campaign is   needed to stop the outbreak, prevent the international spread of polio   and reduce the risk of its re-emergence, given the severely disrupted   health, water and sanitation systems in the Gaza Strip. Vaccination   coverage will be monitored throughout the campaign, and, when necessary,   vaccinations will be extended to meet coverage targets as part of   flexible strategies to ensure every eligible child receives their   vaccine dose.
The two-round campaign, being conducted by the   Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with the World   Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), the   United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)   and many partners, aims to provide two drops of nOPV2 to around 640 000   children during each round.
""The successful delivery of the   first phase of the campaign in central Gaza is a culmination of immense   coordination among various partners, including the Global Polio   Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and donors, and underscores the importance   of peace for the health and well-being of people in Gaza. We call on   all parties to continue fulfilling their commitment to the humanitarian   pauses as the second phase of the campaign begins tomorrow,"" said Dr   Peeperkorn.

September 02, 2024
Shri Randhir Jaiswal, Official Spokesperson: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to this special briefing on Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Brunei and Singapore. We have with us Secretary East, Shri Jaideep Mazumdar and we are also joined by Shri Ashish Sinha who is Joint Secretary South, in the Ministry of External Affairs. With that I invite Secretary East to make his opening remarks and thereafter we will take questions from you. Sir, over to you.
Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Secretary (East): Thank you Randhir and a very good morning to all of you. As you know, Prime Minister is undertaking a visit to Brunei and to Singapore. He is travelling to Brunei at the invitation of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and the visit is scheduled for 3rd and 4th of September and after that he will travel to Singapore at the invitation of His Excellency Mr. Lawrence Wong, the Prime Minister of Singapore. That visit will be over 4th and 5th of September.
Let us take up the Brunei leg first. This will be the first ever bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Brunei and it coincides with the 40th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between our two countries this year. Some of you may recall that His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah paid State visits to India in 1992 and in 2008 and he also attended the ASEAN India commemorative Summits in 2012 and in 2018. In the last visit he was also Chief Guest for our Republic Day along with other ASEAN leaders.
During the visit the Prime Minister will engage in bilateral discussions on all aspects of our bilateral relations and cooperation with Brunei and also explore new areas for cooperation. As you know we share a very warm and friendly relationship with Brunei and our engagements cover multiple areas such as Defence, Trade and Investment, Energy, Space technology, Health, Capacity Building, Culture and vibrant people to people exchanges. The Indian diaspora in Brunei is about 14,000 and they comprise a substantial number of doctors and teachers in Brunei who have earned goodwill and respect for their contributions to Brunei's economy and society.
We have received valuable support from Brunei in our space program. We have three MoUs with Brunei in this area. We have established a Telemetry, Tracking and Command station in Brunei in 2000 and this tracks and monitors all our eastward launches of satellites and satellite launch vehicles. Defence is another important pillar in our bilateral cooperation. We have an MoU on defence, which was signed in 2016 and has since been renewed in 2021. It provides a framework for our collaboration that covers regular exchanges at high levels, Naval and Coast Guard ship exchange visits, training and joint exercises and participation in each other's exhibitions. We are also working towards establishing a joint working group for cooperation in the area of defence.
Brunei is an important partner for India's Act East Policy and our vision for the Indo-Pacific, and as we mark a decade of our 'Act East' Policy this year, the visit assumes additional significance. Brunei has been our country coordinator in ASEAN from 2012 to 2015 and played a key role in our further engagements with ASEAN and continues to do so today.
Now let's move on to the visit to Singapore. Prime Minister is visiting Singapore after nearly six years. In fact, his last visit to Singapore was in his first term as Prime Minister and an early visit during his third term is something that is particularly welcomed by the Singaporean side; and also this is at the time when a new leader in Singapore, His Excellency Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has just taken over, and this is an opportune time to set the stage for the next stage of our vibrant bilateral relationship.
Our ties have evolved and we have a dynamic Strategic Partnership, encompassing diverse areas from our shared history and people to people ties, which form an important link between us. Our trade and investment flows have shown a steady growth. We have robust defence cooperation and growing exchanges in culture and education and we have identified new anchors of our partnership under the India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable Framework.
The visit will also take place in the light of our 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations which we are celebrating in 2025 and the 10th year of our Strategic Partnership with Singapore. During the recently concluded India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable which is a very unique forum between Ministers on both sides in diverse areas, a number of new forward-looking futuristic cooperation areas were identified in Digitalization, Sustainability, Skills, Health, Advanced Manufacturing and Connectivity and we are likely to exchange a number of MoUs in these areas during the forthcoming visit of the Prime Minister.
From the point of trade and investment also the Prime Minister's visit to Singapore is very significant. Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN and it is a leading source of foreign direct investment. Singapore is India's sixth largest trade partner worldwide and the largest source of FDI during the last financial year. Investments have also been very large since 2000 till now we have had cumulative FDI of about 160 billion US dollars. There will be an interaction with business leaders during Prime Minister's visit and this will be an important element of the visit as the CEOs will be listening to India's growth story first hand from the Prime Minister and the opportunities that it presents for them.
If you have any questions, I would be happy to seek to respond to them, thank you.
Rishabh: Secretary, good morning, this is Rishabh from Times Now. Sir if we can get any idea where as you mentioned there are 14,000 Indian diaspora members in Brunei and Singapore also has a sizeable number of Indian diaspora, will there be any engagement with the diaspora for the Prime Minister? A, and B, are we expecting anything on semiconductors between India and Singapore given that 10% of the semiconductor business comes from Singapore?
Rishikesh Kumar: Good morning Sir, Rishikesh from PTI. So it is believed that there is a huge hydrocarbon reserve in Brunei, especially its EEZ zone, so is there any possibility of India may sign or assist Brunei in exploration of this hydrocarbon reserve as we did with Vietnam I guess?
Sidhant Sibal: Hi, Sir. Sidhant from WION. Sir, how much will there be conversation on the situation in Myanmar with the leadership in both Brunei and in Singapore?
Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Secretary (East): This is merely a curtain raiser as you put it, so I will not go into specifics of the programme at this stage. But to say that always of course diaspora and interests of diasporas are uppermost in Prime Minister's conversations and interactions when he goes abroad, so wait and watch is what I will say.
On semiconductors, yes as you know Singapore is very well plugged into the global semiconductor ecosystem. It has experience of more than 20 years in this area. This is an area where we are very keen to get into and already we are seeing how we can cooperate with Singapore. Singapore is already setting up facilities in India and there will be many other areas of the semiconductor industry itself which will be discussed and cooperation moved forward during the visit. We expect the visit to really give thrust to this particular area in our cooperation.
On hydrocarbons, we have been importing hydrocarbons from Brunei and in the long run we would like to have more predictable supplies with longer term contracts from Brunei especially in the area of gas in which we see that our India's demand for natural gas will increase many times in the near future. So that is an opportunity for the Brunei side to lock in long term supply arrangements if they wish to do so.
On Myanmar, of course as a common member of ASEAN for both Singapore and Brunei, these discussions regarding the region will of course come up whenever there are bilateral visits. The situation in the neighborhood and neighbors often always comes up, so I expect that it will also be discussed.
Ayushi Agarwal: Sir this is Ayushi Agarwal from ANI. You mentioned about the space and defence cooperation with Brunei. So when Prime Minister visits there, can we expect any major outcome when it comes to these sectors?
Yeshi Seli: Good morning. This is Yeshi Seli from the New Indian Express. Can you please quantify the amount of hydrocarbons that we import from Brunei as of now and also what was the FDI from Singapore to India in the last financial year?
Siddhant Mishra: Sir, I am Siddhant from CNN News 18. Sir, my question is regarding the space sector. As you mentioned, there are already three existing MoUs in space sector between India and Brunei. Are we looking at a possibility of some big ticket announcement as Prime Minister is visiting Brunei in the space sector, and what would be the focus area for India in the space sector in Brunei? Thank you. If you could elaborate a little bit.
Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Secretary (East): To take the space sector first, we have ongoing cooperation with Brunei as I mentioned, in Telemetry, Tracking and Command and we will take this forward. As technology develops, as our requirements develop, so also the need for enhancing those capabilities in the various centers we have worldwide for our Telemetry Tracking and Command increase or change. So you will see that, I mean I don't want to jump the gun here, but you will see some discussion and outcomes from that as well, but wait and watch this space.
On hydrocarbons, I would say that in our bilateral trade of about 250 million dollars odd, about 60% to 70% is comprised of hydrocarbons, which is not a very large figure at the moment. But as I said, especially in the case of natural gas, the amount could increase significantly. In actual terms, it is about 270 million dollars worth of crude oil imports.
Regarding the figure of FDI from Singapore, we will give you the figure in a minute, but as I said, it is the largest in the whole world last year. I hope I have covered all the questions. On the defence side, we are still in discussion with Brunei on setting up a joint working group in the area of defence. So I don't have anything specific to report at this time.
Pia Krishnankutty: Sir, Pia with the Print. In 2015, India and Singapore signed Strategic Partnership and now that it is almost a decade since then. Can we expect the ties during this visit to be elevated to the level of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership?
Suhasini Haidar: Secretary, this is Suhasini Haidar from the Hindu. I have two questions. One is on, the 2005 SICA with Singapore and the 2009 FTA with ASEAN, we have been reviewing them for a long while. Do you expect to see any movement on these? We know that the ASEAN-India talks in Indonesia in July, kind of discussed cutting some of India's tariff concessions on things like mobiles into India and that kind of thing, but if you could give us a sense of where India and Singapore, who really lead the ASEAN talks as well, are on this review of the FTA. And the other is, since the Prime Minister is obviously embarking on this visit to Brunei because he was earlier supposed to go to Thailand for the BIMSTEC Summit, do you think the BIMSTEC Summit that has been put off now can be rescheduled within this calendar year? Thank you.
Sudhi Ranjan: Sudhi Ranjan from Bloomberg, Sir. The Singaporean Foreign Minister after the round table kind of talked about India and Singapore trying to develop common standards for digital payments, so that other countries like Malaysia and other ASEAN countries can be brought under the umbrella. Can you give us an understanding whether talks are going to happen in this regard and how advanced are these talks? And also, Sir, we get to hear that there are four MoUs in the works including on food security and stuff like that. If you could give us an understanding on that.
Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Secretary (East): So on the FTA, the ASEAN-India, we have a trade in goods agreement and a review on that is underway. It has been underway for some time. We are very keen that we conclude that review by 2025. Singapore is our facilitator and coordinator for discussions on the economic aspects of our relations with ASEAN and they play a very important role in that, and no doubt during the visit we will be impressing upon Singapore and also on Brunei on the need to move quickly on the AITGA review process.
As far as BIMSTEC is concerned, although this is not the subject for today's meeting, but we do expect the summit to be held whenever it is convenient for the hosts.
On carbon standards, these are aspects which are discussed at a technical level and although we do expect to have discussions on a broader cooperation in this area, but really the nitty gritties of this will be tied up at the technical level.
And on the MoUs, I will again ask you to watch this space, so you will not be disappointed.
Abhishek: Hi Sir, this is Abhishek. I am a freelance journalist. My question is regarding Singapore coming in this entire quad scheme of things, we have been collaborating on digital connectivity and other infrastructural projects also, so will that be taken up for discussion? And also in the maritime sector domain, we have seen recent skirmishes between Chinese ships and Philippines ships, so when we talk about maritime security, Singapore happens to be a close partner, so will these issues be also taken up with the leadership of Singapore?
Sumita Kareer: Hi Sir, Sumita from ET now. I have two questions. You have spoken about several sectors, but which will be the key sectors for India to deepen its partnership with Singapore, and second question is a follow-up, one on the semiconductor point that you raised. I understand that it might be difficult for you to delve a bit deeper, but what is the nature of this partnership going to be on considering that India also has a $10 billion chip subsidy scheme, we have attracted major investments from the United States last year from Micron, LAM Research and others, if you could also give us a sense of the kind of investments and expectations that India has from Singapore in this particular domain.
Ayanangsha Maitra: Sir, this is Ayanangsha Maitra, an independent journalist. In the first lack of visit, Prime Minister will be in Brunei, which is known for a hedge diplomacy and quite comfortable to China. Will we expect any (inaudible) announcement in the areas, in the arenas of port, textile and fertilizer? Secondly, Sir you mentioned the round table, the Ministerial round table, if you kindly elaborate the framework of the round table, how different it is and if it's a unique template for any country. Thank you, sir.
Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Secretary (East): Thank you for those questions.
On maritime security and safety, of course you know India's position on the South China Sea. In the case of Singapore as well, it is important for them to maintain sea lines of communication that are safe, secure, free. So we have congruence of views on that and no doubt such issues will be discussed. I can't say to what degree it will be discussed but these are issues that are important for all of our countries in the region and therefore I have no doubt that they will be discussed.
On the area of semiconductors, the area of semiconductors is very wide and we are embarking upon a relationship with Singapore, which has experience and expertise in a wide range of areas within that ecosystem of semiconductor, whether it be in semiconductor design, whether in fabrication, whether in testing, whether in manufacture of equipment that are used for fabricating semiconductors. So this entire ecosystem is what we are discussing between the two of us and how we can cooperate in that.
As far as the ISMR framework is concerned, it is rather unique because we really don't have such a round table system with any other country where independent of a summit level interaction we have on our side, this time we had four ministers and on the Singaporean side six ministers who sat down and discussed all the new thrust areas that we can identify for our bilateral cooperation in futuristic areas of cooperation. So I would say that it is rather unique for us and I don't know if that is replicated between any other two countries. Thank you.
Chandrakala Choudhury: Chandrakala this side from ETV Bharat. Sir, just a quick question, how do you see India-Singapore relations going ahead, especially with the new regime in place and as far as China's influence in the region is concerned? Thank you.
Shri Jaideep Mazumdar, Secretary (East): So independent of our relations with any third country, India and Singapore relations are poised for an even bigger takeoff I think than what it has been in the last 10-15 years or so. That is because we have now gone to the next level of identifying areas of bilateral cooperation whether it be in food security, in renewables, in green hydrogen, in semiconductors, these are all areas where we have great complementarities and we can really complement each other in each of them. So I see our relationship as really taking off to the next stage and this is entirely driven by the logic of our respective situations. For Singapore, India presents tremendous opportunities and for us, Singapore presents us with many options regarding whether it be value chains, digital technologies and semiconductors, so yes I would say it. Thank you.
FDI from Singapore, somebody had asked, so FDI from Singapore, it was $11.77 billion last year.
Shri Randhir Jaiswal, Official Spokesperson: With that we come to the close of this session. Thank you very much for your participation."
6RLBWX0GO8_GHGFYX1LJ2DBBHI,Kyrgyzstan resettlement of Uzbekistan enclave gets mixed reviews,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/08/mil-240831-voa04.htm,"By VOA News August 31, 2024
While Kyrgyz state media have portrayed the recent resettlement of residents of a Kyrgyz enclave in Uzbekistan in glowing terms, a different picture emerged during a VOA visit to the residents' new home.
At issue is Barak, a Kyrgyz hamlet of less than 1,000 inhabitants in Uzbekistan that was moved in April as part of a border deal with Uzbekistan.
Barak is one of a number of parcels of land shared by Soviet Central Asian republics that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, became problematic. The Uzbek territories of Shakhimardan, Sokh, Qalacha, and Jangail are all located within Kyrgyzstan's Batken province. Vorukh and Western Qalacha, two Tajik districts, are also surrounded by Batken province. Tajikistan's Sarvak lies within Uzbekistan's Fergana province. Enclave residents have long complained about stiff border control measures by the Central Asian governments that have hampered travel and trade. As a result, the enclaves often become flashpoints for border-related confrontations.
Nurgul, a Barak primary school teacher who only provided her first name, described to VOA the difficulties of living in Barak, which was connected to Kyrgyzstan by a 3-kilometer road through Uzbekistani territory.
""To reach Kyrgyzstan, we had to cross several border and police checkpoints. Border guards frequently closed the road, and this left Barak without food and medicine for weeks."" She added that, exhausted by such difficulties, some of her relatives left Barak to resettle in Kyrgyzstan's Osh province, about 20 kilometers away, in 2018.
In late 2022, in accordance with a Kyrgyz-Uzbek border agreement, Barak's territory was absorbed by Uzbekistan. In exchange, Kyrgyzatan received an equivalent parcel of land from Uzbekistan.
In November 2022, Kyrgyz officials said that Barak residents would be permanently resettled in a new village in Osh province.
The new settlement is called Jany Barak, or ""New Barak"" in Kyrgyz. Construction began in April and was to be completed by August 31, the anniversary of Kyrgyzstan's independence.
Osh provincial Governor Elchibek Jantaev told local media in April that Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov had allotted $3 million for the construction of 101 new houses, a secondary school, and a health clinic for the resettled Barak residents and Kyrgyz state media provided extensive coverage of government's resettlement works.
An early May broadcast on Kyrgyz state TV described the resettlement as a historic event. The broadcast also presented interviews with several Barak residents who said they were joyous about being reunited with mainland Kyrgyzstan.
A different picture
That is not the picture that emerged during a VOA visit to the site of Jany Barak.
Kalyssa, a retired accountant from Kara-Suu, a town in Osh province near Jany Barak, who would only let her first name be used, said construction is still in progress, adding, ""people have questions about quality of the new houses. They are also worried the houses will not be completed until winter.""
VOA observed August 17 that the new houses being built are not winterproof and there are no paved access roads or sewage system.
Nurgul, the primary school teacher from Barak, said Barak residents were not given a choice between financial compensation and housing.
""Some people would rather take money instead of moving into government-built houses,"" she told VOA.
Marat Imankulov, the head of Kyrgyzstan's Security Council - part of Kyrgyz President's Office - said in a May interview with Kyrgyz media that the land-swap deal allowing for resettlement of Barak could serve as model for ""solving border issues with Tajikistan."" Some experts, though, have expressed doubts about land-swap solutions for enclaves.
Chris Rickleton, a journalist based in Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, wrote in a late April analysis paper published by RFE/RL that 2021 comments by Kyrgyz President Japarov's ally and national security chief Kamchybek Tashiev about a potential transfer of Tajik enclave Vorukh to Kyrgyz control ""were met with anger from Vorukh locals, not to mention a former top Tajik official who publicly lambasted Tashiev.""
Kyrgyz political analyst Emil Juraev, in an April interview, described Vorukh, compared with Barak, as ""a massively more difficult situation, with around 40,000 people in Vorukh compared to just a few hundred in Barak.""
A Kyrgyzstani journalist who covered the enclaves for Kyrgyz media pointed to high economic costs from potential land-swap deals, saying Central Asian governments ""are cash-strapped, and they cannot afford such costly resettlement projects.""
Uzbek officials have their own reasons to oppose further land-swap deals with Kyrgyzstan. An Uzbek government official from Ferghana province, which has jurisdiction over Uzbekistani enclaves of Shakhimardan and Sokh, told VOA on condition of anonymity that the two territories ""have strategic importance for Uzbekistan.""
""They are major holiday destinations due to their picturesque sceneries and mountain lakes,"" the official said, adding that both enclaves house small Uzbek military outposts.
Nevertheless, there are positive developments related to enclave solutions.
Since November 2022, the Uzbek and Kyrgyz governments have eased border restrictions for Shakhimardan and Sokh inhabitants and have pledged to jointly develop the tourism potential of the enclaves.
""This step is a crucial move forward,"" the Uzbek government official from Ferghana said."
6Z644O2FH2_L03B2CRKJRW0GJA,"A former political aide tried to secretly advance China's interests, say prosecutors",_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2024/intell-240903-rfa01.htm,"Chinese officials allegedly plied the aide with money and favors â including Nanjing-style salted duck.
By Tara McKelvey for RFA 2024.09.03 -- U.S. prosecutors accused Linda Sun, 40, of secretly working to push the interests of the Chinese government while working as an aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.
In exchange, the prosecutors said, Sun's family reaped benefits. U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said ""the illicit scheme enriched the defendant's family to the tune of millions of dollars.""
Sun was arrested on Tuesday in New York and has been charged with failure to register as a foreign agent, money laundering, conspiracy and other crimes.
Her husband, Christopher Hu, 41, who runs a store called Leivine Wine and Spirits in Flushing, Queens, was also arrested. According to the indictment, he helped with kickbacks, facilitating the transfer of millions of dollars. He has been charged with money laundering, conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
The case may be further evidence of how Chinese officials try to influence political policies in the United States, former FBI counterintelligence agent Holden Triplett, co-founder of a risk management consultancy, Trenchcoat Advisors, said.
""This helps to demonstrate how widespread and real this threat is - and also acts as a warning to people and serves as a lesson in what is illegal,"" Triplett said in an interview.
Sun started working for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2012 and was promoted to the position of director of Asian American Affairs, according to her online posts. She then served as an aide to Hochul. Sun was hired by the state's Department of Labor in 2022, but she left after several months.
Tickets and other gifts
According to court documents, Sun tried to cut out references to Taiwan, a hot-button issue for the Chinese government, in state communications. In addition, prosecutors said, she procured unauthorized letters from the governor's office to help Chinese government officials travel to the United States for meetings with state officials.
In exchange, Sun and her husband received profits from business funneled to his Flushing liquor store, as well as event tickets, a job for her cousin in China and gifts. One of these gifts, salted duck prepared by the personal chef of a Chinese consulate official, was sent to her parents' house, according to the prosecutors.
According to the indictment, the couple laundered the money and used the profits to buy a $3.5 million dollar house in Manhasset and a new Ferrari, among other items.
Sun and Hu pleaded not guilty on Tuesday and were released on bond. Seth DuCharme, a lawyer for Sun, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Neither did Ken Abell, a lawyer for Hu.
The arrests of Sun and Hu follow a crackdown on the Chinese government's attempt to influence U.S. views and to spy on people in this country. A pro-democracy activist, Yuanjun Tang, was recently accused of working secretly for the Chinese Ministry of State Security.
In August, Shujun Wang, a historian, was found guilty of serving as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general.
Wang faces up to 25 years in prison and will be sentenced in January.
Some analysts say that the significance of the cases like Sun's and Hu's may be overblown, however. The charges are held up as examples of pernicious Chinese influence on the United States, but they do not always pan out. Or they may not be as damaging as they initially seem.
Alex Nowrasteh, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and the author of a study ""Espionage, Espionage-Related Crimes, and Immigration,"" said that the charges against Sun and Hu seem to indicate a ""classic New York state corruption case.""
But the allegations, even if they turn out to be true, do not necessarily mean that these individuals posed a threat to the security of the United States.
""It's not the same as a spy trying to steal U.S. nuclear secrets,"" Nowrasteh said. ""This case might be used as, 'Americans should worry more about Chinese espionage.'"" In fact, he said, many of these cases, perhaps including this one, have no impact on national security.

79XXQHJNTU_ZIX85GREJ6GMHZX,Month of fighting leaves once-bustling Myanmar town eerily quiet,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240904-rfa01.htm,"Displaced residents say they won't return while the threat of junta airstrikes remains.
By RFA Burmese 2024.09.04 -- The normally bustling town of Kyaukme in northern Myanmar's Shan state is a shadow of its former self one month after ethnic rebels captured it from the military, according to residents who say they won't return because they fear retaliation from the junta.
On Aug. 5, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, and allied forces seized control of Kyaukme after more than a month of fighting by taking over the junta's Military Operations Command No. 1, about 1.5 km (a mile) outside of the town, as well as two junta Light Infantry Battalions bases inside it.
During the weeks of fighting, the junta dropped 500-pound bombs and fired heavy weapons to defend its positions, destroying many of the town's buildings and forcing many of its more than 40,000 inhabitants to flee for their safety.
Residents say that more than 400 people - including civilians, junta troops and rebel fighters - were killed in the clashes. The Kyaukme-based Namp Khone Tai Charitable Organization said it collected 219 bodies for burial in the first eight days after the town fell to the TNLA.
Nearly a month later, the town feels empty, said Nwe Nwe, a vendor at the fresh market in Kyaukme's Ti Lin ward.
""Sales haven't returned to normal, as not all residents have come back,"" she told RFA Burmese. ""Only a few [people] can be seen in the downtown area. The major shops remain closed.""
Most residents continue to take refuge in Nawng Ping and Sa Khan Thar villages, located around 16 km (10 miles) outside of Kyaukme, while others have relocated to the Shan state capital of Taunggyi, about 290 km (180 miles) to the south, or southwest to Mandalay region.
'None of us dare go back'
Displaced residents told RFA that they won't return home while the threat of junta airstrikes remains.
On Aug. 27 and 29, when some residents returned to Kyaukme to check on their homes, the junta dropped bombs on the town's police station and State High School No. 2, said one of the displaced, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns.
""While the displaced from Kyaukme were preparing to return home, the first group of returnees came back to the camp after the junta attacked with three 500-pound bombs,"" he said. ""Now, none of us dare go back, and meanwhile, some new displaced residents [from Kyaukme] have arrived at our shelter.""
Other residents of Kyaukme told RFA that their homes and shops were looted after they fled the fighting.
Ma Khaing said she and her family members ""fled with whatever we could carry"" in the middle of a junta artillery attack, only to learn that thieves ransacked her home while she was gone.
""Every item from our house was taken,"" she said. ""We have no idea how to resume our lives.""
Picking up the pieces
In the meantime, the TNLA said it has deployed a ""police force"" to provide security and law enforcement in Kyaukme, although judicial, medical and other administrative services have yet to resume.
After the junta lost Kyaukme, it restricted the transportation of goods, causing prices to nearly double, according to merchant Nyi Nyi Lwin.
""The prices of commodities, including fuel, have skyrocketed,"" he said.
Electricity and mobile communications also have yet to be restored, and residents said they expect it will take time for the banking system to come back online.
While residents of Kyaukme pick up the pieces, intense fighting between the TNLA and junta forces continues in nearby Nawnghkio and Hsipaw townships, they said.

WASHINGTON, September 3, 2024 -- The State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to the Government of Japan of AEGIS Class Destroyer Follow-On Technical Support and related equipment for an estimated cost of $150 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale today.
The Government of Japan has requested to buy follow-on technical support of AEGIS Class Destroyers, which will include sustainment support and services; AEGIS computer software updates; system integration and testing; in-country and on-site engineering support; familiarization; sustainment; all necessary emergent support engineering and technical support services; operational support; system overhauls; system upgrades; on-the-job practical operations and maintenance; combat systems integration; development, testing, and installation of program patches and adaptation data and annual service agreements; technical inquiries by the purchaser; operation; integration; maintenance; field service engineering; problem investigation; technical assistance; solutions to the technical problems arising from post production and testing capabilities; U.S. Government and contractor technical assistance; and other related elements of logistics and program support. The estimated total cost is $150 million.
This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific region.
The proposed sale is critical to ensure the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force's (JMSDF) AEGIS Destroyer fleet and computer program test sites remain ready to provide capabilities in the defense of Japan. Specifically, the requested AEGIS computer program maintenance services will provide JMSDF with software patches and adaptation data support that are vital to the effective and safe operations of the AEGIS Combat Systems (ACS) suite. The in-country engineering and emergent support will assist JMSDF to address any malfunctions or faults that may arise with the ACS suite. Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these services and support into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.
The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Corporation, located in Moorestown, NJ. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will require the temporary assignment of five U.S. Government and two contractor representatives to Japan.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.
The description and dollar value are for the highest estimated quantity and dollar value based on initial requirements. Actual dollar value will be lower depending on final requirements, budget authority, and signed sales agreement(s), if and when concluded.
All questions regarding this proposed Foreign Military Sale should be directed to the State Department's Bureau of Political Military-Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, pm-cpa@state.gov."

Sep 2, 2024
London, IRNA -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi says he has received a response from Iran's new president.
In an interview with Al Arabiya on Monday, Grossi said that he had received a response from Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, which he said signals a potential for renewed dialogue aimed at what Grossi described as ensuring the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear activities.
The IAEA chief stressed the need for increased transparency and cooperation from Iran, especially in light of what he called advancements in their nuclear capabilities.
Commenting on the revival of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), he claimed that the deal needs some amendment as Iran has made atomic progress.
It is possible to reach an agreement with the Islamic Republic on nuclear energy, he said.
Additionally, the IAEA chief touched on broader issues of nuclear proliferation and the IAEA's role in mitigating the risks of nuclear escalation, particularly in regions of heightened tension.
He mentioned the importance of continued dialogue and the necessity of international cooperation to address these challenges effectively.
In late July, Grossi in a message congratulated Pezeshkian on his election victory, expressing readiness to visit Iran and meet the new president.
Iran clinched the JCPOA with world powers in 2015, but the deal was thrown into disarray after the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement and reinstated sanctions on Iran. The Islamic Republic, in response, reduced its commitments, after the remaining Western parties to the accord failed to compensate for the US pullout. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is only meant for peaceful purposes and is aimed at meeting domestic needs. Iran also says it has maintained its constructive cooperation with the IAEA and has always asked the UN nuclear agency to avoid politicizing issues under pressure from Israel and some Western states.

Washington's sanctions outrage knows no limits. In their typical neocolonialist zeal, the US authorities have seized the jet used by the Venezuelan president, which was undergoing maintenance in the Dominican Republic. Once again, they have shown an utter disregard for international legal norms, relying on the rule of force to send yet another signal that the United States, as they see it, can dispose of another state's sovereign property.
Incidentally, this is not the first time Washington has seized Venezuelan aircraft: earlier this year, a Venezuelan transport plane was detained in Argentina upon an order from the US.
However, this seizure of property was conducted in an imperial and arrogant manner, with a claim to moralising. It was done to show everyone that no one and nothing is immune to sanctions and robbery, be it business assets, bank reserves, real estate, or vehicles. The lack of legal norms is at the top of the list of notorious rules used by the collective West to build a world order model in the vein of the global Monroe Doctrine.
Washington's actions are reminiscent of those by the evil and ruthless criminal boss Bill Sykes, the main antagonist in Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, a renowned English author of the 19th century (hopefully, the people in the White House have read his works or are at least familiar with the name). We consider it extremely important for this mode of thinking not to prevail in global affairs.
We support our Bolivarian friends in their legitimate demands to have the stolen property returned to the Venezuelan state, and we stand in solidarity with them in their determination to further defend their independence and sovereignty."

Ukraine's military has launched a massive drone attack on Russia as Russian troops take more Ukrainian territory.
Ukrainian forces overnight on Saturday leading to Sunday, launched one of their biggest drone attacks against Russia since the full-scale war began in 2022.
The Ukrainian drones targeted Russia's energy infrastructure, including power plants and an oil refinery.
The assault caused fires at several facilities, including in Moscow.
Officials said dozens of the Ukrainian drones were shot down.
On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded on Telegram for ""a decision on long-range strikes on missile launch sites in Russia, destruction of Russian military logistics, joint shooting down of missiles and drones.""
In addition to military and intelligence aid, Kiev seeks more support from the West, insisting on full-out engagement on the field, joint operations and permission to use its Western-supplied warplanes, weapons and ammunition to strike targets deep inside Russian soil.
On the opposite side, Russian officials said its military air defense units had destroyed 158 drones launched by Ukraine overnight, and that debris caused fires at the Moscow Oil Refinery and the Konakovo Power Station in the neighboring Tver region.
The strikes prompted military offices to put temporary restrictions in place at Moscow's Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports overnight.
The restrictions were lifted on Sunday morning, according to aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia.
On the frontline, military officials said on Sunday that Russian troops had made further advances towards a key town in eastern Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Russian troops are pressing forward in eastern Ukraine while pushing out Ukrainian forces that broke through its western border in a surprise incursion on Aug. 6.
Ukraine had hoped that its surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched last month would force Russia to re-deploy troops and take the pressure off besieged forces in the east, but so far it does not appear to have had the desired effect.
Russia's defense ministry said on Sunday its forces had captured two more settlements in the Donetsk region, including Ptyche, just 21 km southeast of Pokrovsk, and were ""continuing to advance deep into the enemy defenses.""
Russian forces also seized the settlement of Vyimka, it said.
Two-and-a-half years have passed since the conflict gained steam and turned into a full-fledged war between the two neighboring countries, leaving a multitude of casualties on both sides.
Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, aiming to liberate the Donbas region where the People's republics of Donetsk and Lugansk had been living under regular attacks from the forces under the command of Kiev's new neo-Nazi leaders."

On September 4, Aide to the President of the Russian Federation Anton Kobyakov met with Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia Alexander Vulin on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.
The parties engaged in discussions about enhancing bilateral cooperation, particularly in the context of significant business events.
""The participation of the Serbian delegation in EEF-2024 is a milestone. It opens a new chapter in Russian-Serbian relations and testifies to Belgrade's desire to broaden the horizons of bilateral cooperation. We always feel the support of the Serbian people, and we value the good relations that have developed between us over the centuries. We are looking forward to seeing representatives of Serbia at the BRICS Summit and at the upcoming forums in Russia - Russian Energy Week and the Russian Tourism Forum ""Travel!"", said Anton Kobyakov, Adviser to the President of the Russian Federation and responsible secretary of the Organizing Committee for the preparation and holding of the EEF.
In relation to the upcoming St. Petersburg International Economic Forum scheduled for June 2025, the parties discussed the formation of a delegation of Serbian businessmen, the potential for arranging a ""Russia-Serbia"" business dialogue, and the establishment of an exhibition stand for the Balkan republic.
Furthermore, the potential for organizing a joint Serbian-Russian business forum in Belgrade was examined.
""Serbia is a true friend and ally of Russia. We value our relations with Russia and the Russian people as Serbia's closest friends. We are striving to maintain the momentum of contacts with Russia. We are the only country that has not imposed sanctions against Russia, contrary to the opinion and position of the West. We look forward to strengthening Russian-Serbian contacts at major international multilateral events held in Russia,"" Aleksandar Vulin emphasized.
The Eastern Economic Forum 2024 is running from September 3 to 6 in Vladivostok, hosted on the campus of the Far Eastern Federal University. This event is organized by the Roscongress Foundation.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on September 3 before a planned visit to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant, where he said the situation is ""very fragile.""
Grossi said on X that he was on his way to Zaporizhzhya to ""continue our assistance & help prevent a nuclear accident."" The Zaporzhzhya plant has been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after their country's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has frequently had its power cut by shelling or been caught in the cross-fire of nearby fighting.
In addition to meeting Zelenskiy, Grossi met with Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko; Petro Kotin, head of state nuclear power company Enerhoatom; and Oleh Korikov, acting head of Ukraine's State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate.
Grossi said they exchanged views on the IAEA's support to Ukraine's nuclear power plants ahead of his visit to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. The visit follows the IAEA chief's visit last week to the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia, which is about 40 kilometers from the part of the region that Ukrainian forces have occupied since the start of their August cross-border incursion. Moscow has accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk plant.
Grossi said after meeting Zelenskiy that he wouldn't compare the situation at the two power plants.
Ukrainian officials reported multiple civilian deaths from overnight Russian attacks in Zaporizhzhya and an attack on the country's railway infrastructure.
The number of people injured as a result of a Russian missile attack on the building of a hotel complex in Zaporizhzhya on September 2 rose to six, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported on September 3. Two more women sought medical treatment independently, and one of them was in serious condition with a concussion, the Emergency Service said.
Ukraine's General Staff said early on September 3 that around a quarter of the clashes with Russian forces over the past 24 hours had taken place in the east near the strategically significant Donetsk region town of Pokrovsk, where Russian troops have reportedly made significant gains in recent weeks.
Ukrainian Railways said on September 2 that it was continuing evacuation efforts for families from Pokrovsk, which is now only about 10 kilometers from the front line.
The state rail operator said on September 3 that an enemy drone had struck a locomotive on a Korchakivka-Sumy train but no injuries were reported. It also said overnight attacks had targeted rail infrastructure in the northeastern Sumy and the southern Dnipropetrovsk regions.
Ukrainian officials said an 8-year-old boy and his mother were killed in Russian shelling overnight in the Zaporizhzhya region.
Ukraine's military said on September 3 that it had downed 27 of 35 Russian drones overnight around the country. Antiaircraft defenses functioned in the Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolayiv, Kherson, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions, but two ballistic missiles that hit the eastern city of Poltava killed scores of people at a military training facility and nearby hospital.
The Russian Defense Ministry said early on September 3 that it was deploying more air-defense systems in the southern Belgorod region that borders central Ukraine's Kharkiv region and in the Russian region of Kursk where Kyiv launched its surprise incursion last month.
Meanwhile, Reuters quoted multiple anonymous sources on September 3 as saying Russia's Gazpromneft oil refinery suspended work at the Euro+ combined processing unit in Moscow after a fire two days earlier. The sources said the plant was expected to be back online within six days.

TEL AVIV (Sputnik) - The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied reports of an alleged complete ceasefire in the Gaza Strip for the purpose of vaccinating the population against polio, noting that limited zones will be allocated for safe vaccination for a short period.
""Reports about a general ceasefire in order to administer polio vaccines in Gaza are false. Israel will allow a humanitarian corridor only, through which vaccination personnel may pass; designated safe areas will also be established for administering the vaccines during certain hours,"" the statement says.
The Prime Minister's Office added that Israel attached great importance to preventing a polio outbreak in the Gaza Strip, including with the aim of preventing the spread of epidemics throughout the region.
Polio reemerged in Gaza after being eradicated for 25 years following Israel's bombardment of Gaza, which has damaged or destroyed every hospital in the enclave. Water treatment and desalination facilities have also been targeted and destroyed by Israeli forces, forcing Palestinians to rely on contaminated water to survive. In July, six out of seven sewage samples taken in Gaza tested positive for polio.
The first case confirmed case was a 10-month old baby who had paralysis of a leg. Polio is highly contagious and medical professionals warned it could spread outside of Gaza. They suspect thousands of Palestinians have already been exposed to the virus. Israel has been vaccinating their soldiers against polio for weeks.
Israel continued its airstrikes on Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 61 people in the Gaza strip according to local health authorities. Another 22 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since Wednesday, when Israel launched a siege of the refugee camps and towns in Jenin, Nablus, Tubas and Tulkarem.

86TSVXOCK6_LCQJKC7PXISEZOG,UN Vows To Remain Engaged In Afghanistan Despite Taliban's Latest Restrictions On Women,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/08/mil-240831-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Radio Azadi August 31, 2024
The United Nations said it will continue to engage with all parties in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, even after the hard-line rulers issued a ""distressing"" new morality law that severely bans women's activities in public.
""We have been very vocal on the decision to further make women's presence almost disappear in Afghanistan,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told a news conference in New York on August 31.
""In terms of the contacts with the de facto authorities...we will continue to engage with all stakeholders in Afghanistan, including the Taliban.""
""We have always done so following our mandate. And I would say impartially and in good faith, always upholding the norms of the UN, pushing the messages of human rights and equality. And we will continue our work as mandated by the Security Council,"" he added.
Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said on August 25 that the laws presented a ""distressing vision"" for Afghanistan's future.
The laws expand the ""already intolerable restrictions"" on the rights of women and girls -- with ""even the sound of a female voice"" in public deemed a violation of morality laws.
The Taliban has attempted to police the public appearances and behavior of millions of Afghans, especially women, since seizing power in 2021.
Enforcement of the extremist group's rules governing morality, including its strict Islamic dress code and gender segregation in society, was sporadic and uneven across the country.
But on August 21, the hard-line Islamist group formally codified into law its long set of draconian restrictions, triggering fear among Afghans of stricter enforcement.
The Law on the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice imposes severe restrictions on the appearances, behavior, and movement of women. The law also enforces constraints on men.
Taliban leaders say the laws are based on their interpretation of Shari'a law.
Several leading Afghan clerics have come out publicly to oppose the latest restrictions.
Mawlawi Abdul Sami Ghaznavi, said it was the Taliban's ""responsibility to create favorable conditions for women's education.""
On August 27, the UN Human Commission on Human Rights demanded that the ""repressive law be immediately repealed.""
""This is utterly intolerable,"" it said.
""We call on the de facto authorities to immediately repeal this legislation, which is in clear violation of Afghanistan's obligations under international human rights law.""

For Immediate Release  Office of Public Affairs
Gholam Reza Goodarzi, also known as Ron Goodarzi, 76, a dual U.S. and Iranian citizen who resides in Porter, Texas, made his initial appearance today in the Southern District of Texas following his arrest at the George Bush International Airport on Aug. 30. Goodarzi is charged by criminal complaint with smuggling parts and components used in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as other manned aircraft, from the United States to Iran.
""For years, the defendant allegedly used proxy destinations to try to smuggle UAV components and other controlled technology to Iran, even concealing controlled items in his own luggage,"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. ""The Justice Department and our law enforcement partners are committed to vigorously enforcing export controls to protect U.S. national security.""
""Smuggling aircraft parts into Iran endangers U.S. national security by potentially enhancing Iran's military capabilities, enabling them to advance their aerial combat potential, increase regional power and threaten U.S. allies and interests in the Middle East,"" said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. ""This prosecution represents my office's core commitment - in partnership with the Justice Department's National Security Division, FBI and Customs and Border Protection - to disrupt and hold accountable Goodarzi's alleged efforts to evade sanctions against Iran, a hostile nation.""
""Illegally smuggling sensitive U.S. technology to a foreign nation jeopardizes our national security and undermines the integrity of our trade laws,"" said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI's National Security Branch. ""The U.S. does not tolerate illegal smuggling of our advanced tech to our adversaries, and the FBI will work with our partners to vigorously pursue and hold accountable those who violate our laws and put our country at risk.""
According to court documents, from December 1, 2020, through July 5, Goodarzi illegally exported aircraft-related parts, in addition to oil and drilling components, to Iran. As alleged, Goodarzi purchased U.S.-origin aircraft components from U.S.-based suppliers and then exported them to Iran - typically through Dubai, UAE.
He also traveled to and from Iran multiple times per year and concealed aircraft parts and other items in his checked luggage.
Goodarzi exchanged multiple emails with suppliers and customers, acknowledging that parts could not be shipped to Iran because of sanctions.
The complaint alleges that on several occasions, authorities searched Goodarzi's luggage and found numerous aircraft parts and components hidden within articles of clothing. Some of the items had characteristics consistent with parts for the production of UAVs, as well as parts with electrical motor and generator applications.
Goodarzi does not have the required licenses to export such items to sanctioned countries, including Iran, according to the complaint.
If convicted, he faces a penalty of up to 10 years in prison for the charge of smuggling goods and a possible $250,000 maximum fine. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The FBI, with assistance from and Customs and Border Protection, is investigating the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Heather Winter for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Christopher Cook of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.
This prosecution is being coordinated through the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains, and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation states. Under the leadership of the Assistant Attorney General for National Security and the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement, the Strike Force leverages tools and authorities across the U.S. Government to enhance the criminal and administrative enforcement of export control laws.
A criminal complaint is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

8AKO1XQ3T8_MT7BKPWSQY6AXF7,Oregon Guard Hones Skills for Large-Scale Combat Operations,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-arnews01.htm,"By Maj. Wayne Clyne, Oregon National Guard Public Affairs Office September 3, 2024
SALEM, Ore. -- The Oregon Army National Guard's 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team conducted an extended annual training at Fort Johnson, Louisiana's Joint Readiness Training Center.
This intensive training rotation marked a significant shift in focus toward large-scale combat operations while preparing for upcoming peacekeeping deployments.
The 41st IBCT joined 4,900 Soldiers from 25 states and territories in July for a grueling two-week exercise to simulate the challenges of peer-to-peer warfare. This training aligns with the Army's cornerstone doctrinal publication, Field Manual 3-0, Operations. FM 3-0 provides the Army's vision for multi-domain operations and the Army's role in joint operations, emphasizing LSCO against peer threats as the most dangerous form of external threat.
A key aspect of this shift is the move from brigade-centric operations to division-level fights. During the JRTC rotation, the 41st IBCT simulated operating as part of the 40th Infantry Division, practicing the complexities of large-scale combat operations.
The 40th Infantry Division, headquartered in California, is a diverse formation that includes three infantry brigade combat teams, a combat aviation brigade, and supporting units from multiple states, including California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, and New Mexico.
This shift toward preparing for LSCO while still fulfilling peacekeeping missions represents a significant change in focus for the National Guard. As noted in ""Large-Scale Combat Operations: The Division Fight,"" edited by Dennis S. Burket: ""The Army's focus on counterinsurgency operations for the last 15 years has atrophied the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct division-level operations in large-scale combat operations against a peer threat.""
The 41st IBCT's training at JRTC addressed this concern head-on, ensuring that while the brigade can fulfill its peacekeeping obligations, it's also prepared for large-scale combat.
""We talk a lot about shoot, move and communicate,"" said Col. Peter Helzer, commander of the 41st IBCT. ""But the reality is we need to flip that completely on its head. We have to be able to communicate and move in order to effectively shoot.""
Helzer emphasized the importance of focusing on low-density military occupational specialties â the support personnel crucial for maintaining the warfighters.
""Spending our limited training time on the 'cool guy stuff' only gets you so far,"" he explained. ""It's easy to focus on squad and platoon infantry lanes and live fires, but all the low-density specialties that adequately support those operations are equally critical. We don't always exercise these or we take shortcuts. Instead, we need to invest training time to ensure that support training is the best it can be.""
Lt. Col. Christopher Markesino, commander of the 141st Brigade Support Battalion, also emphasized the importance of logistics in LSCO.
""One of the key takeaways is to never underestimate the value of sustainment rehearsals,"" Markesino said. ""If you only have 100 minutes to rehearse everything, dedicate time to maneuver, sustainment and medical rehearsals.""
The training comes at a critical time for the Oregon National Guard. Elements of the 41st IBCT are preparing for deployments to the Horn of Africa, the Multinational Force and Observers mission in the Sinai Peninsula, and Kosovo Force. Additionally, the 2nd Battalion, 218th Field Artillery Regiment has just mobilized for deployment to Iraq and Syria to support Operation Inherent Resolve.
Brig. Gen. Eric Riley, the Oregon Army National Guard land component commander, noted the shift from low-intensity conflict to high-intensity LSCO scenarios.
""Out here, we've learned to be comfortable with the uncomfortable,"" Riley said.
The lessons learned during this training, particularly the emphasis on logistics and support, will be crucial as these Soldiers deploy to maintain peace and security in some of the world's most volatile regions."
8B8DGDX437_MS0G2YRZZLZMUTD,EXPLAINED: Who are Vietnam's Montagnards and what are their grievances?,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240902-rfa01.htm,"One campaigner is fighting extradition from Thailand, saying Vietnamese authorities will kill him.
By Mike Firn for RFA 2024.09.02 -- Montagnard activist Y Quynh Bdap from Vietnam is on trial at Bangkok's Criminal Court, facing extradition back to Vietnam where he has been convicted of ""terrorism"" in connection with a deadly 2023 attack, which he denies.
Bdap is a founding member of Montagnards Stand for Justice, or MSFJ, which campaigns for the rights of the indigenous group in Vietnam. Vietnam listed it as a terrorist organization in March.
A verdict in Bdap's trial in Thailand, where he was living when the 2023 attack took place in Vietnam, is due on Sept. 30 at 1 p.m., a court was told on Monday.
Who are the Montagnards?
Montagnard is a term, meaning ""mountain dweller,"" coined by French colonialists to describe a grouping of about 30 indigenous minorities in Vietnam's Central Highlands. Many of them are Christian.
The minorities in the Central Highlands have long been wary of outside interference and have been at odds with various governments, including U.S.-backed South Vietnam before 1975, and the communist government of Vietnam afterwards.
In the 1960s, many Montagnards were part of a group called FULRO, that campaigned for autonomy for indigenous people. During the Vietnam War, Montagnards helped U.S. forces as they tried to interdict North Vietnamese forces and supplies entering South Vietnam. Analysts say Vietnam has never forgiven that.
In the United States, where many Montagnards resettled after the war, their plight is viewed sympathetically. The community in North Carolina is hailed as the biggest population of Montagnards outside Vietnam.
What are their grievances?
Land and religious freedom are at the heart of Montagnard grievances.
Beginning in the 1990s, the government encouraged the migration of ethnic Kinh Vietnamese into the Central Highlands to grow coffee, putting them at odds with the Montagnards who practiced swidden, or slash and burn, agriculture.
Since 1975, more than three million people have moved into the region. According to government statistics in 2019, Montagnards accounted for 39% of Dak Lak province's total population of 5.8 million.
Many Montagnards are Evangelical Christians, and they say that authorities try to stop them gathering to practice their faith and disrupt their church services.
On March 8, villagers in Dak Lak province found the body of preacher Y Bum Bya hanging in a cemetery. The Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ released a statement saying Bya was murdered after being beaten and threatened by police.
Frustration over religious persecution and land grabs has sometimes boiled over into violence.
In the early 2000s, violent protests against the confiscation of ancestral lands and religious controls, prompted a brutal crackdown by Vietnamese security forces that saw hundreds of Montagnards charged with national security crimes.
On June 11, 2023, dozens of Montagnards attacked the headquarters of the People's Committee and the police of Ea Tieu and Ea Ktur communes in Dak Lak province. Four police officers, two commune officials, and three civilians died in the attacks.
In January, 100 people were convicted over the attacks, with 10 jailed for life.
Representatives of the minority say they want indigenous land rights and basic human rights and they reject what they say are government attempts to link them to overseas separatists.
What does Vietnam say?
Vietnam does not use the term Montagnard, which it says implies disparagement. It uses the term Degar to refer to non-state sanctioned Protestant Montagnards in the Central Highlands.
Vietnam says it is a multi-religious state with freedom of religion where minorities can ""promote their internal resources and jointly develop the country"". It says people with ""bad intentions"" take advantage of the concept of ""indigenous people"" to spread false information and incite secession.
What does the international community say?
International human rights groups have over the years repeatedly called on Vietnam to end the repression of Montagnards, to allow independent religions organizations to act freely and release all Montagnards imprisoned for peaceful religious or political activity.
On June 14, a group of U.N. Special Rapporteurs wrote to the Vietnamese government raising their concerns about the Dak Lak terrorism trials. They said there had been an ""excessive response"", an unfair mass trial and reports of intimidation of Vietnamese refugees in Thailand seemed ""part of a larger and intensifying pattern of discriminatory and repressive surveillance, security controls, harassment and intimidation.""
Rights groups say Thailand has given Vietnamese law enforcement operatives free rein to track down and kidnap activists seeking refuge there.
In April, 2023 Vietnamese blogger Duong Van Thai was allegedly abducted by Vietnamese agents in Bangkok, later emerging at a detention center in Hanoi. In February, 2019, journalist and RFA blogger Truong Duy Nhat was abducted in Bangkok and forcibly returned to Vietnam, where he was jailed for 10 years.
Montagnards who have trekked through border jungles to neighboring Cambodia risk being sent back to Vietnam. In June last year, then-prime minister Hun Sen said that all Montagnards who had taken refuge in Cambodia had been expelled and any new arrivals would be returned to Vietnam in light of the attacks in Dak Lak.

U.S. President Joe Biden condemned a deadly Russia missile attack Tuesday on the Ukrainian city of Poltava, calling it ""deplorable.""
""This assault is a tragic reminder of Putin's ongoing and outrageous attempts to break the will of a free people,"" Biden said in a statement.
The U.S. leader also reiterated U.S. pledges to provide Ukraine with the air defenses it needs to protect itself.
Ukrainian authorities said the attack killed at least 51 people and injured nearly 300 others in one of the single deadliest strikes since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.
The attack partially destroyed a building used by the Poltava Military Institute of Communications, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
""People found themselves under the rubble. Many were saved,"" Zelenskyy said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. He said he has ordered ""a full and prompt investigation.""
Shattered bricks could be seen inside the closed gates of the institution, which was off-limits to the media, and pools of blood were visible just outside.
Hours after the missile strikes, the smell of smoke had spread through town, which is about 350 kilometers southeast of the capital of Kyiv. Roads were covered with glass shards from shattered windows.
Ukraine's Defense Ministry said the missiles hit shortly after an air-raid alert sounded, when many people were on their way to a bomb shelter. It described the attack as ""barbaric.""
The defense agency said rescue crews and medics saved 25 people, including 11 who were dug out of the rubble.
Poltava Governor Filip Pronin announced three days of mourning, starting Wednesday.
""A great tragedy for Poltava region and entire Ukraine,"" Pronin wrote on his Telegram page. ""The enemy certainly must answer for all [its] crimes against humanity.""
The strike came as Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Mongolia. There was no indication that his hosts would heed demands to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes.
Zelenskyy appealed again for Ukraine's Western partners to ensure swift delivery of military aid. He has previously chided the U.S. and European countries for being slow to make good on their pledges of help.
He also wants Ukraine's allies to ease restrictions on what Ukraine can target inside Russia with the weapons they provide. Some countries fear that hitting Russia could escalate the war.
""Ukraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage,"" Zelenskyy wrote in English on Telegram. ""Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives.""
Elsewhere, officials in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said a Russian strike on a hotel killed two people and injured two others.
Russian forces attacked areas across central and eastern Ukraine with four missiles and 35 drones, with Ukrainian air defenses shooting down 27 of the drones, Ukraine's military said.
The Ukrainian air force said air defenses shot down the drones over the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava and Sumy regions.
Chernihiv Governor Viacheslav Chaus said on Telegram that falling debris damaged several buildings on the outskirts of the city of Chernihiv and injured two people.
Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that Russia's aerial attack damaged a house and a transportation facility.
Ukraine's state railway reported a Russian drone struck a locomotive in Sumy.
Russia's defense ministry said it shot down three Ukrainian drones over the Bryansk, Kursk and Kaluga regions.
Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters."

Dear Ukrainians!
Today - Zaporizhzhia. Together with the Prime Minister of the   Netherlands. An important visit, and a very symbolic one - on the very   day the school year begins.
Just now, here in Khortytsia, we spoke with our veterans, veterans of   the war. Today, in Zaporizhzhia, we also presented our Mriia - a new   educational application. It is actually an analog of Diia for our   Ukrainian education, for all our children, for teachers, for parents.   This is an undeniably good result: in times of such war, Ukraine is   both: defending itself and developing - creating new products, providing   opportunities for our people. I thank the entire Mriia team and all our   Ukrainian teachers, everyone who works to strengthen education in   Ukraine. And we are adding guarantees to this. The Government of Ukraine   has clear instructions on the construction of shelters and the   provision of buses for schools - we must fulfill what we promised our   communities. We are also creating a program of guaranteed free meals for   children in primary school - from first to fourth grade. And also, the   Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, regional   administrations, the Ministry of Digital Transformation, communities   must ensure the full implementation of our Safe School program - which   means creating a truly reliable safe space for all students, for every   school.
This year, schools for offline learning have opened in Zaporizhzhia   and in many other cities and communities. More than two million children   will be able to study in the basic school format. Another million   children will study in a mixed format: both offline and online. All of   this depends on safety factors. On the availability of shelters in our   schools and on our overall ability to protect lives.
Today, during our negotiations with the Prime Minister of the   Netherlands, we talked about exactly that - about strengthening air   defense, about new air defense systems, and about missiles for them.   About F-16s for Ukraine. And about all the necessary weapons for our   defense against the Russian occupier. Shells for warriors, equipment.   And the protection of life throughout the country, including the   protection of our energy sector. Today we have a new aid package from   the Netherlands - thank you for that. We have also talked about the   Netherlands becoming a patron of Zaporizhzhia - this is infrastructure,   this is protection of normal life, this is humanitarian issues. This is   something that will definitely help Ukraine. And we appreciate all the   support of the people of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Schoof   personally, and all the political and public figures from the   Netherlands.
And of course, my greatest appreciation goes to all our people, to   everyone who protects our Ukraine, our Zaporizhzhia, all our cities and   communities. Everyone who fights for Ukraine, works here in our state,   helps us - thank you! I am proud of our people; I am proud of Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!"

Tehran, IRNA -- The spokesman of Al-Qassam Brigades, the military branch of Hamas, said in a message on Monday night that Zionist prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is responsible for the death of Israeli prisoners.
From Shahab Palestinian news agency, Abu Obeidah added: Only Netanyahu and the army of the Zionist occupation regime are fully responsible for the killing of Israeli prisoners due to the deliberate failure of the prisoner exchange agreement for their personal and worthless purposes, in addition to killing dozens of other prisoners with direct aerial bombardments.
He said that ""we are clearly telling everyone that after the Nusirat incident, a new instruction was issued for the Mujahideen in charge of protecting enemy prisoners regarding the way to interact with the prisoners in case the forces of the Zionist occupation army approach their place of detention"".
Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman added that Netanyahu's insistence on the release of prisoners through military pressure instead of signing the prisoner exchange agreement means that they will return to their families in coffins and their families must decide whether to hand them over dead or alive.

PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY AIR FORCE MAJ. GEN. PAT RYDER:  All right. Well, good afternoon, everyone. I have just a few things at the top, then we'll get right to your questions. First, the Department of Defense continues to monitor developments in the Middle East. On Sunday, Sept. 1, Secretary Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, regarding Israel's recovery of the remains of six hostages in Gaza murdered by Hamas, including the 23-year-old American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The secretary passed along his deepest condolences to the families of all of the slain hostages and he expressed outrage at their vicious, illegal and immoral execution at the hands of Hamas. The secretary affirmed that Hamas leaders must be held accountable for the murder of these innocent civilians. And Secretary Austin and Minister Gallant once again reaffirmed their mutual commitment to swiftly reaching a ceasefire deal to secure the release of all the remaining hostages.
A readout of the secretary's call has been posted to Defense.gov. Separately, on Sept. 1, USCENTCOM forces, partnered with Syrian Democratic Forces, captured an ISIS leader and facilitator, Khalid Ahmed al-Dandal, who was assessed as helping ISIS fighters after escape from a Raqqa detention facility in Syria.
CENTCOM issued a press release with additional details, so I'll refer you to that, but the operation highlights CENTCOM's ongoing efforts to support our SDF partners to mitigate threats of future escapes by ISIS detainees from SDF detention facilities in Syria and to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.
Turning to the Red Sea. On Sept. 2, Iranian backed Houthis attacked two crude oil tankers transiting this vital waterway. The Panama flagged and owned Greek operated motor vessel Blue Lagoon One was struck by two anti-ship ballistic missiles and the Saudi flagged owned and operated motor vessel Amjad was struck by a one-way attack uncrewed aerial system.
This of course follows the Aug. 21 attack of the Greek owned motor vessel Delta Sounion. These reckless attacks of terrorism by the Houthis continue to destabilize regional and global commerce, while threatening the lives of innocent civilian mariners, as well as maritime ecosystems.
Currently, private companies are examining salvage options in the southern Red Sea for the disabled motor vessel Delta Sounion, which is still on fire and threatens the possibility of a major environmental disaster. The U.S. will continue to work with international partners and allies to protect maritime commerce and mitigate potential impacts to the environment despite the irresponsible and careless actions of the Iranian backed Houthis.
And finally, looking ahead, Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Brown will travel to Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Thursday to host an in-person meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Sept. 6. This will be the 24th meeting of the UDCG since Secretary Austin formed the international group in April of 2022. The secretary and chairman will join ministers of defense and senior military officials from nearly 50 nations to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine and the continued close coordination by the international community to deliver to Ukraine the support it needs to defend itself.
And with that, I'll be glad to take your questions. We'll go to AP, Tara.
Q:  Thanks, Gen. Ryder. I wanted to ask about the two Marines who were assaulted in Turkey, if you could give us an update on their condition and speak in general about their reaction to the assault, not making â escalating it into something bigger and what sort of impact it might have on future shore leave or future port visits in Turkey?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. Thanks for asking the question. So first of all, the two Marines are safe. They were aided by other Marines in the area and subsequently taken to a local hospital for evaluation as a precaution but were not injured and they have subsequently returned to the USS Wasp. I can tell you that local Izmir police and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are cooperating in an investigation of the incident.
No Marines have been detained by authorities and those involved are cooperating with investigators. In terms of the reaction of the Marines, certainly, very proud of the professionalism of our service members and â and most importantly, that they're safe. This is clearly a troubling incident. We are grateful for the support of the Turkish authorities who are looking into this, and I'll leave it there.
Q:  Will it have any residual impact such as leave or the ability to go outside the gate at Incirlik?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  That's really a question for the local commanders and USEUCOM. Of course, every situation is judged based on its own merits. Force protection is always a consideration, and any commander has the authority to â to make those kinds of decisions, but again, I'd refer you to EUCOM for anything on that.
Thank you. Go to Idris.
Q:  Over the weekend, Britain suspended 30 arms export licenses to Israel, essentially because they couldn't certify that it would be used under international humanitarian law. Does the secretary believe that every weapon that the U.S. is providing to Israel is being used correctly under international humanitarian law?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks Idris. As you know, our State Department has processes to look into those kinds of questions, the same as we do for any security assistance that we provide to other nations around the world. Those processes are ongoing. As of now, we have not determined at this point that Israel has violated international humanitarian law, but those assessments, to include those of the State Department looking at allegations, are still ongoing.
Q:  Just follow up, you mentioned, I think it was the Amjad tanker. The shipping company that owns it said it was not targeted in the Red Sea, had not been hit and was continuing under its own power to its destination.
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  So my understanding it is continuing on. It still has the crew on.  As far as any additional questions on that, I'd refer you to CENTCOM.
Q:  CENTCOM's statement says it was hit?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Correct.
Q:  But they're saying they weren't hit.
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. The information I have is factually correct, as I know it. But of course, again, I'd refer you to CENTCOM for further details. Thank you. Joseph, and then we'll go to Carla.
Q:  Thanks. Last week we asked if the Israelis had informed you all ahead of their operations in the West Bank. The department was still trying to gather more information as to what was going on or what they were doing. Do you guys have any answers or information as to what they're trying to do?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Thanks, Joseph. I â I don't have any updates to provide as â as we highlighted in the readout that we put out between â in the call between Secretary Austin and Minister Gallant, Secretary did convey his condolences for the three Israeli police officers that were killed in an apparent terrorist attack in the West Bank.
Also, he expressed his concern over the rising tensions and the increased terrorist activity there. We have, of course, made very clear from a U.S. government standpoint, our policy as it relates to the West Bank and when it comes to settler violence and no expansion of â of settlements.
Q:  Just a second one, on â back to the Houthis. Has there â it's been about, I think, eight or nine months since â since the U.S. began strikes on Houthi targets and trying to deter further attacks. We're continuing to see those attacks. I mean, you mentioned two tankers that were hit. We got the Sounion potentially spilling, creating an environmental disaster.
Is there any reevaluation from the department to potentially alter the campaign or to change different types of military operations to further deter or to send a message or degrade further these capabilities of the Houthis?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks. It's a great question and I can tell you that we're constantly evaluating the situation and it goes back to what it is that we're working to do, which is to preserve freedom of navigation and to degrade and disrupt Houthis capabilities, and we're doing that. We are disrupting and degrading, and you can see this in the press releases that CENTCOM puts out in terms of degrading some of their capabilities and also taking self-defense strikes to prevent missiles from launching. That said, obviously, as evidenced by what I read out earlier, some of those missiles and some of those drones are making their way through and we're going to continue to work with the international community to protect those shipping lanes.
But the onus is on the Houthis, again, to look at the impact that they're having, not only in the short-term, but on the long-term as it relates to the environment, the economy and the â the safety of those that are transiting this important waterway. So we're going to continue to keep after it, recognizing that again the strategic objective here is freedom of navigation through this vital waterway.
Thanks. Carla.
Q:  Thanks. First a follow up with what you told Tara. You said the two Marines are safe. There had been some social media reports saying that three were assaulted. You're tracking two?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  I was tracking that two â two U.S. Marines from the 24th Maritime Expeditionary Unit.
Q:  Thank you, Pat. And then on the Russian ballistic missiles that hit the Military Institute of Communication in Poltava. I'm sorry if I'm messing that up. Does the Pentagon know where those missiles originated, and does this attack, has it shifted the thought process here at the Pentagon of potentially allowing Ukrainians to use ATACMS to hit missile sites inside Russia?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks. I don't have any information to provide in terms of the specific origin of those missiles other than again, as you highlight, these are Russian missile attacks. And again, just demonstrates the brutality, the viciousness of these assaults to include on civilian infrastructure. And as we go into the winter, Russia targeting infrastructure, energy infrastructure, that will be vital as it gets colder in Ukraine.
We have been working very diligently for a very long time now to continue to work with the international community on providing air defense capabilities for Ukraine and will continue to do that. As it relates to our long range strike policy, I don't have any announcements to make in terms of any change in policy.
Q:  OK. Thank you. And just one more is USS Georgia in the CENTCOM AOR?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  The USS Georgia is still underway. Thank you. Let me go to the phone here. Go to Wall Street Journal, Lara Seligman.
Q:  Hi, Pat, thanks for doing this. I wanted to follow up on the F-16 crash in Ukraine last week. Is the U.S. participating in any way in this investigation and will there be any changes made to the training program after this crash?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks Lara. So like â like any sovereign nation that has any type of incident, they would be the lead for conducting an investigation. And so Ukraine is leading the investigation, so I'd refer you to them to talk about any details associated with that. Broadly speaking, I will tell you, across the aviation community in general and this is a generalized statement here, you're always going to learn from various incidents or engagements that get applied back into lessons learned.
But as it pertains to this particular crash, I just don't have any details or specifics to provide at this time. Let me go to the room here, Eric.
Q:  Yes, Pat, do you have an update on the seven U.S. service members who were injured in the raid that U.S. and Iraqi forces conducted late last week?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. I do.
Q:  And what caused those injuries?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. Thanks, Eric. I don't have specifics to provide to you today in terms of the causes of the injuries. I'm tracking seven total were injured. Six have returned to duty for minor injuries, in some cases to include suspected TBI. One service member was taken to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center for follow on care, in stable condition,* and that's about all I have on that.
Q:  And just as a follow up, U.S. special operations forces took the lead in this operation, in the initial attack, which was carried out over at least two days, and they were targeting apparently a very senior ISIS leader involved in the planning of external operations in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere.
Can you identify who that leader is and how serious this operation was, given that it's pretty unusual at this point in Iraq for U.S. forces to take the â at least initially, to take a lead in a mission like this?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, I'm not going to have any other information to provide beyond what's in the press release that â that CENTCOM put out. You know, and in that, I would underscore the fact that, again, this operation targeted ISIS leaders to disrupt and degrade their ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against Iraqi civilians as well as U.S. citizens, allies and partners throughout the region and beyond.
And so, again, we'll continue to work with our partners around the world, to include the Iraqis, when it comes to protecting the homeland and addressing threats like ISIS. Thank you.
Charlie?
Q:  Thank you, General. The Ukrainian defense minister was here last week. He said that he set forth specific targets that could be hit within Russia. Zelenskyy once again today pleaded for those longer range weapons and for the permission to use them. Is that under discussion? And when might we hear anything more about it?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. Thanks, Charlie. I don't have any announcements to make in terms of any changes in policy. As I highlighted, Secretary Austin will have the chance to meet with Ukrainian â you know, our Ukrainian partners and international partners this â later this week at Ramstein, where we'll be very focused on, again, better understanding Ukraine's security assistance needs and how best to meet those.
But in terms of any changes to our policy, I'm â I'm not going to have anything to provide. Again, there has been no changes. And as it relates to potential Ukrainian operations, I'm just not going to speculate or talk about potential future ops. Thanks very much.
Yes, sir?
Q:  Thank you, General. A quick question about the latest attack that ISIS claimed in Kabul. As you may know, yesterday a suicide attack occurred in Kabul and killed some people and injured more people. So, ISIS claimed the responsibility for that. How â what is the Pentagon's position?
Last week I think you mentioned that ISIS is a threat from Afghanistan. Can we understand the scale of the threats that the Pentagon assess â a â in terms of threats that ISIS posing against the United States national interest, or the United States partners in the region, perhaps?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. Again, I â I've seen the reports about the ISIS attacks in Afghanistan. I'd have to refer you to, you know, the Taliban to talk about that.
Broadly speaking, again, as I just highlighted, as it relates to Syria, ISIS continues to pose a threat, whether it be ISIS-K or ISIS in its other manifestations. So, we will continue to work with international allies and partners to address that threat and take appropriate action. Thank you.
Ennis?
Q:  Thank you very much, General. This administration has claimed that Hamas had been largely destroyed. That's why the Israeli government can be confident in signing this ceasefire agreement. But according to the latest statements from the Israeli government, the Philadelphi corridor seems to be the sticking point. Is that also your military assessment, that the retention of that corridor is key to further success or for prevention of further terrorist attacks? Is that your assessment as well, just like the Israeli government's?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  So, I appreciate the question. And as you've seen that â you know, from the White House and others, that is a point of discussion as it relates to ongoing ceasefire negotiations. What I'm not going to do, though, is provide my personal tactical assessment of the battlefield.
I think, taking a step back, a few things here. Number one, we fully support and recognize Israel's right to defend itself and to prevent the kinds of attacks we saw on Oct. 7. And so, I'll leave it up to the Israelis to talk about how best to do that, again, recognizing the fact that we all want to see a ceasefire as quickly as possible and the hostages released and returned home. And so, I know that that will continue to be a topic of discussion within those negotiations, and I'll just leave it at that.
Let me go back to the phone here. Jeff Schogol, Task and Purpose?
Q:  Thank you. Military officials recently said the number of ISIS attacks in Iraq and Syria is on pace to double what they were last year. As far as the Defense Department is concerned, is ISIS a growing threat? And I â just clarification, did you say the Georgia has not arrived in the CENTCOM AOR yet? Thank you.
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. Thanks, Jeff. On your last question, the Georgia is still underway. Again, we'll keep you updated in terms of its location and arrival in the CENTCOM AOR.
On ISIS attacks, you know, again, it's â it's not a monolith. And so, without getting into a broader geographic discussion on all the various tenets of ISIS focused on Iraq and Syria, I think ISIS is not the threat that it was ten years ago, but certainly something that needs to be taken very, very seriously.
And as highlighted in the Central Command press release over the weekend, you have over 9,000 ISIS detainees being held in 20 SDF detainee facilities in Syria, which essentially creates a significant challenge for the international community in terms of repatriating those detainees. And so, that work continues in earnest via CENTCOM and our partners in the region as through â as well as throughout the world. Thank you.
Come back to the room. Yes, ma'am, Nat?
Q:  Thanks, Pat. I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the deep strike capabilities for Ukraine. Kyiv claims that they need this for their offensive in Kursk. What's the U.S. view on that? Do you agree or disagree with that assessment?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Well, again, I don't have any announcements to make in terms of any change in policy. The policy hasn't changed. We remain committed to supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself and to protect its sovereign territory, as well as build its ability to deter against future Russian aggression. And so, again, we'll continue to consult regularly with our Ukrainian counterparts on their security assistance needs and ensure they have what they need to defend themselves. Thank you.
Sir?
Q:  Thank you very much, General. Just two questions. In 2018, I had filed a story about these two Afghan brothers, one of them was Abdul [inaudible], that they had cheated the Department of Defense for $6 billion and the trial was going on in D.C. about it. Can you give me an update about that?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  I â I really don't have an update. I'd have to refer you to the Department of Justice for any questions on that.
Q:  OK. And my second question was about â and I asked you this last month as well, about the 13 soldiers that were killed in Afghanistan at the point of withdrawal. According to my journalism experience, I had suggested that another inquiry should be done, but that's, again, your department's decision on it.
But President Trump â former President Trump went to honor those 13 soldiers at the Arlington Cemetery. None of them â none of the current administration I saw that paid such a visit. Does that upset the Pentagon at all about the current administration and â
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes. Well, thanks for the question. So, a few things. First of all, Secretary Austin did issue a statement, of course, on the anniversary of the Abbey Gate terrorist attack.
As it relates to Arlington National Cemetery, as you'll recall, that was a private event hosted by Gold Star family members that had invited former President Trump to that event. Secretary Austin was not invited to that. But of course, he cares incredibly deeply about our Gold Star families as well as all of our soldiers, sailors, airmens â and airmen and Marines who served in Afghanistan, to include the 13 American heroes who died on that day. Thank you.
Sir, and then I'll come back to you, Charlie.
Q:  Yes. Thank you, General. Going back to Iraq, this weekend when the Iraqi prime minister received the top U.S. commander, Gen. Kevin Leahy, in Baghdad, he said that the ISIS is no longer pose a threat to the Iraqi state. Do you agree with that statement?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Look, I, you know, have provided my perspective on ISIS. I think it's something that we need to continue to keep an eye on and make sure that it does not resurge to the levels that it did back in 2014.
Look, the Iraqi security forces have done an incredible job in terms of addressing the ISIS threat, but as I highlighted, you still have these challenges in places like Syria, where 9,000, ISIS detainees and that that has to be taken seriously. So again, we'll continue to work with our Iraqi partners as well as others to address that.
Q:  And then the recent joint raid between U.S. and Iraq in Anbar, the Iraqi government and even you said that the U.S. has no combat forces in Iraq. But this time, the U.S. Special Forces in Iraq led that operation against ISIS. So has the role of the â U.S. forces' role changed in Iraq?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  No, no, it has not. And again, this was a partnered operation and as I highlighted earlier, the United States will work with partners and allies around the world. And if there is a potential threat against U.S. national security and â and partner security, we'll work together to address that threat. But no, no change.
Let me go to â I'm sorry, Charlie, let me go to Brad and then I'll come back to you.
Q:  Thank you. Just to follow up on Ukraine, can you confirm if the U.S. is preparing to send long range cruise missiles to Ukraine? There's been some reports about JASSMs, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, the last question, yes, JASSMs. Yes, you're pronouncing it correctly. I â I don't have any. I saw those press reports. I don't have anything, Brad, to provide on that. Again, no announcements to make.
Q:  Says the Air force guy.
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Charlie.
Q:  Yes. Thanks again.  We haven't discussed Iran and Israel or retaliation in a couple of weeks, yet two carrier strike groups remain. Has there been any change about the perceived threat level there?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Well, what I would tell you, Charlie, is, again, Iran had â has indicated that it intends to retaliate, so we will continue to take that threat seriously, and I'll just leave it there.
Q:  Have you seen any changes at all that would have changed in the past 10 days or so, without getting into details?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Right. I think that we need to continue to take that threat seriously and be prepared. Again. I'm not going to speculate or get into potential or hypotheticals, rather, in terms of when and if they may attack other than the fact that they've said publicly that they intend to retaliate.
And so we will continue to take that seriously. Matt.
Q:  Thanks, Pat. There are reports that that Russian strike might have come from Crimea. So just to be clear, there are no policy restrictions that would stop Ukraine from striking Russian launch sites on Crimea because the department recognizes that as Ukrainian territory? Is that correct?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  That's correct.
Q:  Thank you.
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Let me go to the phone. Heather from USNI.
Q:  Thanks. I was just wondering if there's any policy guidance on which ships that CENTCOM might mention get hit by the Houthis. They released something this past day, last night about two ships that got hit by the Houthis, but haven't mentioned other ships in the past, so I was just wondering if you can explain why these two ships were mentioned?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  Yes, thanks, Heather.  I â I'd refer you to CENTCOM for specifics. I think, again, highlighting this at the top of the briefing, again, just demonstrating the threat that the Houthis continue to pose, not only from a mariner safety standpoint, but also from an environmental and economic standpoint in the Red Sea.
Thank you. Joseph.
Q:  Quick, I wanted to ask if there's any updates; there were two civilian Iranian mariners that were rescued by the U.S. military last week. Where are they? What's their status?
MAJ. GEN. RYDER:  I'd have to refer you to CENTCOM for any questions on that. OK. Thanks very much everybody, appreciate it.

8PK6NT1UTS_RZE9BS2EBOSJC1F,Yemen: UN appeals for immediate release of staff held by de facto authorities,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-unnews03.htm,"3 September 2024 - Six United Nations personnel who've been held on ""spurious"" accusations in Yemen for three months by the Houthi de facto authorities must be released immediately, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker TÃ¼rk said on Tuesday.
Issuing the appeal in Geneva on his behalf, Chief Spokesperson for his Office OHCHR, Ravina Shamdasani, ""unequivocally"" rejected the ""false allegations"" for which one staff member appeared to have been made to confess under duress.
""These are completely made-up allegations,"" she told journalists, highlighting ""a video of our staff member that was put on social media as well which was clearly a forced confession. Our colleague looked very distressed in that video.""
Total of 17 detained
The six UN human rights staff - one woman and five men - were arrested on 6 June together with seven other UN personnel.
Two UN human rights staffers and two colleagues from other UN agencies have been detained and held ""incommunicado"" by the de facto authorities since 2021 and 2023 respectively, bringing the number of UN staff arbitrarily detained in Yemen to 17.
""Their whereabouts remain unknown and the Houthi de facto authorities have not permitted physical access to any of them, despite our repeated requests,"" Ms. Shamdasani said.
""There needs to be due process, legal representation (and) evidence needs to be presented"" in cases where staff are alleged to have broken laws, insisted the Chief Spokesperson.
""None of this has been done. These are clearly made-up, fabricated accusations and we reject them unequivocally...These are spurious.""
Ms. Shamdasani also reiterated the High Commissioner's appeal to the Houthis - who after a decade fighting internationally recognised Government forces are in control of much of Yemen, including the capital Sana'a - ""to facilitate rather than hinder UN entities and other human rights and humanitarian actors in their efforts to serve the people of Yemen, including for the promotion and protection of their human rights""."

4 Sep 2024
The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a new report today on its efforts to ensure nuclear safety and security during the conflict in Ukraine, two years after Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi crossed the frontline to establish the IAEA's presence at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) site and help prevent a nuclear accident.
The 28-page report highlights the challenges and achievements of the IAEA's activities to protect Europe's largest nuclear power plant since Director General Grossi launched the historic mission on 1 September 2022. During this time, the IAEA teams at the site have reported on incidents including shelling and drone strikes at the facility, which has also suffered repeated loss of off-site power events.
Underlining the IAEA's ""unwavering support for nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine"", today's report also provides information about the IAEA's continued presence at Ukraine's other nuclear sites, as well as details on its comprehensive programme of assistance to the country.
The situation at the ZNPP remains precarious and very fragile, Director General Grossi said in the report's foreword.
""Two years into the IAEA's continued presence at the occupied Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, our commitment to helping prevent a nuclear accident remains resolute,"" he said. ""Amid the significant challenges and risks to nuclear safety and security, we are steadfast in our mission to assess the situation and keep the international community informed.""
The report was issued as Director General Grossi travelled this week to the plant in southern Ukraine for the fifth time during the conflict. Since he last went to the ZNPP site in February, it has been hit by drone strikes, experienced loss of power lines and, last month, a fire caused significant damage to one of its two cooling towers.
Director General Grossi said ""the objective and impartial assessments of the situation provided by our teams have made a significant contribution to maintaining nuclear safety, security and safeguards"" at the ZNPP.
A few months after the establishment of the IAEA presence at the ZNPP, Director General Grossi set up similar missions at the four other nuclear facilities in Ukraine - the Khmelnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants, as well as the Chornobyl site.
The new report also summarizes developments, activities and assistance at these sites since the IAEA missions were set up there in early 2023.
""Our work at these facilities remains essential and I am immensely proud of the courageous work the teams continue to perform,"" Director General Grossi said.
In total, the IAEA has conducted 139 Support and Assistance Missions to the nuclear sites in Ukraine. In addition, the IAEA's comprehensive assistance to Ukraine has facilitated 61 deliveries of equipment to Ukraine, with a total value of over â¬10 million. The IAEA has also continued its vital safeguards verification activities across Ukraine, ensuring that there is no diversion of nuclear material for military purposes.
""As I conduct my fifth visit to the ZNPP, and my tenth to Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict, I want to reassure the international community that the IAEA, and I as Director General, will continue to do everything possible within our mandate to assist in averting a nuclear or radiological accident at any of Ukraine's nuclear facilities,"" Director General Grossi said."

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday met with leaders from multiple African countries and Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission, continuing the momentum of cooperative interactions and solidarity in the run-up to the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), taking place from Wednesday to Friday in Beijing.
On Tuesday, China jointly announced the elevation of bilateral ties to a strategic partnership with Malawi, Chad and Mauritania, respectively, while China and Nigeria announced the elevation of ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership on the same day.
Analysts said the intensive meetings between Chinese and African leaders and the upgrading of bilateral relations fully demonstrate that China-Africa relations have entered a fast development track.
Besides, closer China-Africa ties are conducive for the entire Global South, with more voices to safeguard interests, strive for more development opportunities and pool more strengths to promote fairness in the global governance, they added.
During his meeting with Kenyan President William Ruto, Xi noted that the two countries have been at the forefront of jointly advancing Belt and Road cooperation and completed a number of flagship infrastructure projects, significantly contributing to regional economic and social development and benefiting the two peoples.
The two sides should align high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with Kenya's economic blueprint, Vision 2030, and enhance cooperation in the digital economy, new energy, economy, trade, poverty alleviation and other areas, Xi said.
Ruto said Kenya welcomes China's continued efforts to increase investment in Kenya and expand practical cooperation in various fields, particularly in connectivity, new energy and youth development.
In a meeting with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno on Tuesday, Xi said China has been Chad's largest trading and investment partner for years, and China is willing to further synergize development strategies with Chad and push for new progress in bilateral relations.
Xi told Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera that China stands ready to deepen friendly cooperation with Malawi from a new starting point to promote common development and benefit their people.
Speedway for development
Song Wei, a professor at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that intensive meetings between Chinese and African leaders and the upgrading of bilateral relations fully demonstrate that China-Africa relations have entered a fast track of development.
Leaders from both sides attach great importance to the synergizing of development strategies and continuing to promote in-depth cooperation, Song said.
According to analysts, infrastructure and connectivity will continue to play a key role in future cooperation between China and Africa, thereby promoting the integration of the continent and facilitating Africa's integration into global industrial chains.
Getting on board ""the fourth Industrial Revolution"" is crucial for Africa's development. China will help Africa achieve its digital and technological transformation and development through technology transfer and technical cooperation, Song said.
During Tuesday's meeting with President Xi, leaders from African countries expressed adherence to the one-China principle and support for the three major China-proposed initiatives, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.
Global South cooperation
During the meeting with Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat on Tuesday, Xi said China considers Africa a major priority in its diplomacy, and is willing to increase political exchanges, deepen strategic mutual trust, strengthen pragmatic cooperation, share development experience and promote common development with Africa.
Noting that the AU is a flag guiding Africa's unity and self-strengthening and an important platform for international cooperation, Xi said China supports the AU in playing a bigger role in the development of China-Africa friendship.
Faki expressed gratitude for China's firm support in Africa's struggle against colonialism, imperialism and racism, as well as its valuable assistance to African countries in fields such as infrastructure, health, energy, industry and security.
He said the AU is willing to work with China to hold high the banner of Global South cooperation and practice true multilateralism. He said the African side firmly pursues the one-China policy and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core interests, noting that the three major initiatives dedicated to sharing peace and development opportunities among people around the globe are critical to promoting unity and cooperation among Global South countries and the justice of the global governance system.
China is the largest developing country, and Africa is the continent with the most developing countries. Cooperation between the two sides forms the basis of Global South development, Song said.
Through cooperation, China has injected impetus into Africa's independent development, while interaction between China and Africa will be conducive to coordinating the positions and enhance mutual support of the Global South on global strategies, hotspot issues and on global governance, Song said.
Cooperation between China and Africa will also help the Global South, especially under the Western-dominated frameworks, offer more voices to safeguard interests, strive for more development opportunities, and pool more strengths to promote fairness in global governance, experts noted."

President Gitanas NausÄda is commencing an official visit to Poland. On Wednesday, the Head of State met with Polish President Andrzej Duda to discuss the security situation in the region, bilateral defense cooperation, support for Ukraine, and the implementation of joint infrastructure projects.
During the meeting, the Head of State underlined that this official visit to Poland marks a milestone of excellent bilateral relations, productive cooperation, and genuine friendship between the two nations, and highlights the importance of cooperation between Lithuania and Poland.
President Gitanas NausÄda stressed the significance of Lithuanian-Polish security cooperation in the current geopolitical context.
""Our bilateral efforts to strengthen the protection of the external borders of the EU and NATO, joint military exercises, increased focus on the security of the SuwaÅki Corridor, and defense industry cooperation have significantly contributed to the security of our two countries, and, in turn, to the security of the region as a whole,"" the Head of State said.
Gitanas NausÄda emphasized that Lithuania and Poland's ability to speak with one voice on issues of key importance to our region ensures that the security priorities of both countries are adequately represented in the international arena.
""Together, we are striving for the effective implementation of NATO's regional plans, increasing the presence of NATO allies in the region, and urging our allies to invest more in defense. Given the current security situation, spending 2% is no longer sufficient; we must aim higher and reach 3%. Both Lithuania and Poland have already met and exceeded this target, setting a strong example for others,"" President Gitanas NausÄda underlined.
The Head of State pointed out that the unwavering support of Lithuania and Poland for Ukraine remains vital, highlighting the need to continue mobilizing allies and supporting Ukraine in its fight against the aggressor by all possible means.
""I am calling for the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine. We are ready to train Ukrainian troops at the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian brigade base. Peace talks have to be be conducted only on Ukrainian terms. No one can demand territorial or any other concessions from Ukraine to Russia,"" the President stressed.
On Thursday, the Lithuanian and Polish leaders will jointly participate in the Lithuanian-Polish Defense Forum. It is expected to attract over 70 defense industry companies from both countries. Later, President Gitanas NausÄda and President Andrzej Duda will travel together to Lublin, where they will visit the headquarters of the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian joint military unit, the Grand Hetman Kostiantyn Ostrogski Brigade, and will sign a declaration of bilateral relations at the Lublin Castle, outlining future guidelines and priorities for cooperation between the two countries.

Monday, 02 September 2024 9:42 AM
The Iranian Army has taken delivery of an optimized main battle tank after deploying advanced technology towards enhancing the vehicle's entire combat features.
Optimized M60 tanks joined the force during a ceremony on Sunday, with Commander of the Army's Ground Force Brigadier General Kioumars Heydari in attendance.
""The M60 tank is on par with the world's state-of-the-art tanks in the areas of armored protection and armored capability,"" he said, noting that the vehicles had been ""optimized in line with cutting-edge technology.""
The commander said the optimization process had enhanced the vehicle's entire 13-strong features, including reactive armor, daytime and nighttime maneuverability, optical sights that provide its operators with all-encompassing field vision, formidable cannons, and engines that had rendered the tanks into highly-maneuverable vehicles.
He, meanwhile, said the vehicles could enter the mass-production stage in the future if need be.
Heydari praised the country's Martyr Zarharan Production, Optimization, and Renovation Center, where the vehicles had undergone their enhancement process.
The facility, he said, had increased the Ground Force's moblization capacity to the level that it had now become capable of ""powerful and speedy"" transfer of its various armored units throughout military drills and on other necessary occasions.
Citing some other contributions that had been made by the center to the force, Heydari enumerated its optimization of Chieftain tanks and BMP-1 armored personnel carriers as well as its smartization of the force's artillery systems.
The commander said the Ground Force had, in line with a directive issued by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, engaged in effecting ""profound changes in the identity and quality of its [various] units.""
""The Ground Force has [thus] turned into a mobile offensive and rapid reaction force,"" he said.
Heeding Ayatollah Khamenei's directives, Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the country would not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, which are entirely meant for defensive purposes and are, therefore, never subject to negotiation.
Also on Sunday, the commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force, another branch of the Army, said the country's enemies were well aware that its combat capability had been considerably enhanced compared to the previous years.
Brigadier General Alireza Sabahifard considered the Islamic Republic's current defensive systems to be incomparable in quality to its past equipment as well as being in a ""more modern and advanced"" state than the most sophisticated equipment across the world.
He, accordingly, vowed that the force would deal with enemies' potential miscalculations with utmost decisiveness.
Relying on domestic endeavor and know-how, the Islamic Republic has made significant advances in enhancing the self-sufficiency of its Armed Forces, despite heavy sanctions imposed on the country by the United States and its allies."
8ZNV2NLNK0_WIXUFKXSPPDGUA3,Wider Europe Briefing: The Mood Is Somber On Ukraine,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240903-rferl04.htm,"By Rikard Jozwiak September 03, 2024
Over the weekend, the biggest gathering of think tanks in Central   Europe, the Globsec forum, took place in Prague. The theme was ""Taming   The Storm,"" a reference to the myriad challenges facing Europe -- from   Russia's war in Ukraine and the malign influence of China to a potential   new American president less invested in the continent and the   disruptive effects of artificial intelligence (AI).
Despite the ominous theme, this year's Globsec was actually rather uneventful, especially when compared to last year. Back then, French President Emmanuel Macron stole the show by telling   the largely Central European crowd they were right all along about   Vladimir Putin and that Paris had got its assessment of the Russian   president terribly wrong.
There were also frenetic (and ultimately failed) efforts to get the   Serbian and Kosovar leaders to dial down the tension in the region, and   European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised (and   subsequently delivered) on a 6 billion euro ($6.6 billion) growth plan   for the Western Balkans for the next three years.
Perhaps the most significant aspect of this year's Globsec was that   it didn't take place in Bratislava, the forum's home for the previous 18   years. Shortly after coming to power in the fall of 2023, the left-wing   populist Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico withdrew both political   backing and economic support for the forum, even though he was a big   proponent of the event during his previous stints in office.
That appears to be a continuation of Bratislava's concerted effort to   target various institutions and follows its taking-over of the   governance of Slovak state TV in the spring and, more recently, sacking   the heads of prominent cultural institutions around the country.
Prague provided a welcome refuge for the forum this time around --   and the Czech capital will be the host again in 2025 After that, who   knows? It looks likely the Czech Republic will have its own populist,   Andrej Babis, back in power next fall.
Even though Globsec is under the auspices of the pro-Western Czech   President Petr Pavel, I heard from more than a few people at the   three-day gathering that Warsaw is being considered as an alternative   host.
Von Der Leyen Comes Out Swinging...
With no Macron this time, nor the German chancellor or the Ukrainian   president, center stage was taken by the newly re-elected von der Leyen.   In an apparent swipe at the governments of Hungary and Slovakia, which   both have questioned the usefulness of more financial and military   support for Ukraine, she noted that ""today, some politicians inside our   union, and even in this part of Europe, are muddying the waters of our   conversation about Ukraine. They blame the war not on the invader but on   the invaded; not on Putin's lust for power but on Ukraine's thirst for   freedom. So, I want to ask them: Would you ever blame Hungarians for the   Soviet invasion of 1956? Would you ever blame Czechs for the Soviet   repression of 1968? The answer to these questions is very clear: The   Kremlin's behavior was illegal and atrocious back then. And the   Kremlin's behavior is illegal and atrocious today.""
Von der Leyen also saved some strong salvos for Hungarian Prime   Minister Viktor Orban, who, in July, embarked on a much-publicized   ""peace mission"" to Moscow and Beijing.
""We Europeans have many different histories. We speak many different   languages, but in no language is peace synonymous with surrender,"" she   said. ""In no language is sovereignty synonymous with occupation. So,   those who argue to stop support for Ukraine do not argue for peace. They   argue for appeasement and the subjugation of Ukraine.""
...And Budapest Hits Back
While most participants at Globsec tended to echo von der Leyen's   view, it was interesting to hear a different take from a representative   of the Hungarian government. In one of the tensest sessions over the   weekend, Orban's political director, Balasz Orban (no relation),   hammered home Budapest's point of view.
It would be good, Balasz Orban said, for Europe to stop ""endless wars   and bring peace."" He underlined that this was a view shared around the   world and that it was only what he called the ""transatlantic liberal   elite"" who are in opposition to the idea.
He then pointed out that Russia has gained territories, that the war   has caused millions of Ukrainian refugees to flee, that hundreds of   thousands have died on both sides, that the Ukrainian economy is in   ruins and bankrolled by the West. He then bluntly asked how long this   could continue.
It was only when he said Ukraine would soon become ""Europe's   problem,"" as even the Democrats in the United States would realize that   they couldn't finance the war for too much longer, that one of the other   panelists, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker, retorted that that would still be   better than Europe having Russia ""as your problem.""
A Cold Winter Ahead
Amid all the bullish talk at the conference of Ukraine's urgent needs   and the West needing to step up, the mood heading into the fall felt   decidedly sober.
Sure, many did sense a smidgen of optimism with Ukraine's already   weeks-long incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Experts agreed Kyiv   could benefit both from the buffer zone it offers and use the hundreds   of Russian prisoners of war as a useful bargaining chip in potential   future negotiations.
But as the Prague forum took place, there was news of the Russian   Army edging closer to the key Ukrainian hub of Pokrovsk, with the path   to Ukraine's fourth-largest city Dnipropetrovsk suddenly opening up. The   EU's ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, noted that, in the   summer, military support from the bloc is at the same level as it was in   spring 2022 -- down to a trickle -- and added that Ukrainians ""cannot   shoot commitments, but need real ammunition."" She also warned about the   possibility of a ""cold and dark winter,"" with Russia hampering around 70   percent of Ukraine's prewar energy production.
Another telling admittance was from former Dutch Defense Minister   Kajsa Ollongren, who bluntly spelled out that the Ukraine Compact, a   security framework signed by all 32 NATO allies at the Washington, D.C.,   summit in July, was ""a bit of window dressing,"" although she hastened   to add that bilateral security deals between Kyiv and various Western   capitals were still meaningful. While several European diplomats have   confessed this to me privately, it was still a sobering assessment to   hear it spoken out loud.
It went on in much the same fashion. In one session, Anders Carp, the   deputy CEO of Saab, the Swedish aerospace and defense company, gave   perhaps the most chilling comment of the weekend when he noted that   European nations must continue to give special training to Ukrainian   troops as ""many of the Ukrainian soldiers we have trained are now dead.""
Outspoken Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur asked whether ""we   want Ukraine to fight or do we want Ukraine to win,"" adding that the   West is again failing to give the country what it needs.
There are some promising signs. Last week, NATO ambassadors met with   Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and EU defense ministers met   among themselves in Brussels, to discuss the issue of lifting more   Western restrictions on Ukraine striking inside Russia.
Despite the meetings, according to EU diplomatic sources speaking on   background, there is no real movement on this yet, and Germany, Italy,   the United States, and others, remain wary. Speaking about the   restrictions, Pevkur said it was ""like asking a boxer to fight with one   hand behind the back.""
Money Issues And Political Will
Ultimately, it all comes down to money and political will in the   West. The Estonian defense minister was again blunt, noting that, apart   from the issue of cash, the arms industry needed to plan, as there are   stringent environmental assessments required for expansion and it often   takes more than 18 months to navigate the bureaucracy.
In Russia, he pointed out, there are no restrictions. ""If Putin   decides that a sausage factory should produce weapons the next day, it's   decided,"" he said.
With that in mind, it was illuminating to listen to Angus Lapsley,   who is in charge of defense planning at NATO. While the military   alliance now proudly states that a record number of 23 out of 32 allies   have reached the target of spending 2 percent or more of national gross   domestic product (GDP), Lapsley noted that spending needs to increase by   another third, or, in some cases, double. The Cold War average for NATO   was 3.5 percent of GDP, he added.
He highlighted numerous capacity gaps that the alliance needed to   fill: ammunition, spare parts, air defense, long-range strike   capabilities. He also said that even apparently straightforward measures   such as improved integrated communications and information systems were   necessary, as the militaries of various countries were sometimes unable   to even send e-mails to one another.
A Feisty Balkan Clash
One surprise was when Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Ukraine   will be a member of the EU by 2030. It wasn't clear if his comment was   made in jest, as he was speaking at a rather turbulent session. Sharing   the stage with Montenegrin President Jakov Mijatovic, Vucic scoffed at   Mijatovic's stated goal that Podgorica will be a member of the bloc by   2028.
Vucic dismissed the idea that a Western Balkan state will join the EU   this decade, saying only Kyiv has a chance. The two Balkan leaders then   had a testy exchange over whether the Montenegrin language was in fact   Serbian, and Vucic slammed Podgorica for recognizing Kosovo's   independence in 2008.
Vucic continued in similar combative fashion, dismissing the notion   that Belgrade was a Kremlin Trojan horse trying to enter the EU and   spelling out that he hadn't been in touch with Russian President   Vladimir Putin in over two years (although though people in his   entourage had).
The Serbian president said that ""the interests of the EU are from   time to time different to our interests,"" adding that the main   impediment to Belgrade's continued EU integration was its relations with   Kosovo, rather than with Russia.
The EU-sponsored dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, which has   been going on since 2011, has not seen much progress over the last few   years. Judging from the mood in Prague this weekend, he said, it was   hard to believe that will change.
The EU's Foreign Affairs Council last week was moved from Budapest to   Brussels, following outrage over Orban's trip to Moscow in July. But   the bloc's General Affairs Council, which brings together member states'   Europe ministers, will take place in the Hungarian capital on September   3.
Some countries, notably the Baltic trio and Finland, have already   said they won't send ministers to the event, so we'll see if others   follow suit.

Shahroud, IRNA -- Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that his government is prepared to provide unwavering support for the struggles of all oppressed nations worldwide, particularly the Palestinian resistance against the occupying Zionist regime.
The president made the remarks in a powerful message that was delivered during the ninth edition of the International Conference of Mujahideen in Exile, held at Damghan University in Semnan Province on Tuesday.
""From the beginning of my tenure in government, I have declared my steadfast support for the Palestinian people and the oppressed around the world, highlighting my commitment to uphold their rights in all arenas,"" he emphasized.
Pezeshkian reflected on the nearly half-century legacy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has consistently championed justice and the advocacy of rights globally.
He assured that, under the leadership of Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei , this mission will be pursued with strength and wisdom by his administration just as it was the previous governments.
The president also praised the late Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian as a distinguished diplomat and a true embodiment of resistance diplomacy.
Amirabdollahian tragically died in a helicopter crash in May, alongside then-President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials.

China plans to further align its Belt and Road Initiative with the long-term development agendas of African countries, aiming to boost infrastructure connectivity and trade cooperation across the continent, Chinese officials said on Monday.
Ahead of the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which will be held from Wednesday to Friday in Beijing, officials emphasized that the alignment is expected to inject new momentum into Africa's socioeconomic development.
The summit will focus on expanding partnerships in emerging sectors such as green development and the digital economy.
Fifty-two African countries and the African Union have signed cooperation memorandums with China under the BRI framework, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
Xu Jianping, director-general of the NDRC's Department of Regional Opening-up, said China aims to establish new cooperation plans with more African nations during the summit.
""We are looking to deepen the alignment between the BRI and the African Union's Agenda 2063, while also ensuring synchronization with the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,"" Xu said. ""China will work closely with African nations to enhance infrastructure cooperation and implement new initiatives that align with their economic and social development needs.""
However, funding infrastructure projects in Africa remains a significant challenge.
The African Development Bank estimates that between $130 billion and $170 billion is needed annually for infrastructure development, with a financing gap of $68 billion to $108 billion.
Despite these challenges, Chinese companies have played a substantial role in advancing infrastructure development across Africa. They have built or refurbished over 10,000 kilometers of railways, nearly 100,000 km of roads, about 1,000 bridges, close to 100 ports, 66,000 km of power transmission lines and 150,000 km of backbone communication networks, Xu said.
Beyond physical infrastructure, China is also focused on deepening institutional connectivity with African nations in areas such as trade and investment. This includes emerging sectors such as green development and the digital economy, Xu said.
As of June, China had given trade advantages to 27 of Africa's least-developed countries by imposing zero tariffs on 98 percent of their products. Bilateral agreements promoting and safeguarding investments have been signed with 34 African nations, and 21 countries on the continent have entered into agreements to prevent double taxation, according to the NDRC.
With these improvements in physical and institutional connectivity, China-Africa trade reached a record $282.1 billion last year. And by the end of last year, China's direct investment in Africa had surpassed $40 billion, according to NDRC data.
Bai Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said Chinese investment is crucial for promoting industrial diversification and driving economic growth in Africa.
""By encouraging a mix of enterprises to operate within these African nations, China is helping to transform African economies, reduce reliance on traditional sectors and support the emergence of new economic drivers essential for long-term prosperity,"" Bai said."

03 September 2024  From Maj. George McArthur
POHANG, Republic of Korea -- The Republic of Korea and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are conducting Exercise Ssang Yong 24 from August 26 to September 7 in the Pohang area of Gyeongsangbuk-Do, South Korea, to strengthen the ROK-U.S. Alliance's combat readiness and improve interoperability.
Ssang Yong, held regularly since 2012, aims to enhance combined defensive posture on the Korean Peninsula. This year, the exercise includes more than 13,000 personnel from the ROK and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, as well as the U.K. Commando Force which is participating for a second consecutive year. The exercise also involves the ROK Army Aviation Command, ROK Air Force Operations Command, and the ROK Drone Operations Command.
The primary focus of this year's exercise is to enhance the capability to conduct a combined-joint forcible entry operation, in which coalition forces would swiftly neutralize key enemy facilities to terminate a hypothetical conflict scenario. The ROK-U.S. Navy and Marine Corps conducted joint amphibious operations, followed by land-based operations to rehearse eliminating enemy forces.
Notably, this year's exercise includes the first deployment of a combined ROK-U.S. battle staff, which commands amphibious operations from the Dokdo-class landing transport helicopter ship ROKS Marado (LPH-6112). This combined battle staff is assessing command and control capabilities and is developing lessons learned for future operations.
The exercise features large-scale joint and combined forces, including a division-sized landing force, the ROKS Marado and Dokdo (LPH-6111), the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer (LHD-4), amphibious assault carrier USS America (LHA-6), more than 20 naval vessels, 30 aircraft such as the ROK Marine Corps' MUH-1 ""Marineon"" helicopters, U.S. F-35B Lightning II fighter aircraft, and ROK Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters, as well as 40 amphibious assault vehicles, including the Korea Assault Amphibious Vehicle.
Significantly, Ssang Yong 24 is the first time the U.S. Marine Corps' next-generation Amphibious Combat Vehicle is employed in an exercise on the Korean Peninsula, conducting joint amphibious operations with the ROK Marine Corps. Furthermore, the ROK Marine Corps' MUH-1 helicopters have undergone deck-landing qualifications on U.S. vessels for the first time.
The exercise's decisive-action amphibious landing event took place on September 2 along the coastal area of Songra-myeon, Pohang. This phase included simultaneous amphibious and airborne simulated assaults:  â¢ Reconnaissance units from the ROK Drone Operations Command provided real-time intelligence, while reconnaissance forces from the ROK and U.S. Marines, and UK Royal Marines, infiltrated the objective area via sea and air to conduct surveillance and guide precision strike rehearsals.
â¢ Close air support provided by U.S. F-35B Lightning II fighter aircraft and AH-1Z Viper helicopters launched from land and sea to neutralize enemy targets, setting conditions for the amphibious assault.  â¢ Amphibious forces including Marines storming the beaches in ROK Assault Amphibious Vehicles and U.S. Amphibious Combat Vehicles to establish a beachhead, followed by the deployment of armored vehicles via U.S. and ROK Navy landing craft including Landing Craft, Air Cushion hovercraft and tank landing ships.  â¢ Airborne forces completed a tactical airdrop from ROK Air Force C-130 transport aircraft, while the U.S. Marine Corps' MV-22 Osprey, ROK Marine Corps' MUH-1, ROK Army CH-47 Chinooks, and ROK Navy UH-60 helicopters rehearsed air assaults maneuvers.  â¢ Following the successful amphibious assault, the ROK Marine Corps' logistics units established a division-level Combat Service Support Area on the beach to sustain land operations.  â¢ The landing forces then transitioned to land-based operations, including simulated CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear)-response elimination operations with combat casualty care exercises to further refine their combined training objectives.  ROK Marine Corps Lt. Col. Cho Hyun-Chul, who participated in the exercise as battalion commander of the landing forces, stated: ""This exercise reaffirms the strong alliance between the ROK and U.S. Marine Corps and further strengthens our combined defense posture. Going forward, the ROK and U.S. Marine Corps will firmly retaliate against any provocation from the enemy.""  U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Gabriel Tiggs, executive officer of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, said: ""Rehearsing this kind of combined joint forcible entry training with an amphibious landing, then follow-on operations, is very important because of how complex they are. The defense of the Korean Peninsula depends on our ROK-U.S. forces to continuously work together, shoulder-to-shoulder, including this Ssang Yong and into the future."""
9BX0M9MWCJ_N3MMY0551M5A1N2,US voices impatience with Taliban over morality law targeting Afghan women,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240904-voa04.htm,"By Ayaz Gul September 04, 2024
An American diplomat has condemned the Taliban's new morality law in Afghanistan, warning that it ""aims to complete the erasure of women from public life.""
Rina Amiri, the United States special envoy for Afghan women, girls, and human rights, posted on social media late Tuesday that she raised concerns about the law during her recent meetings with counterparts in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
""My message was clear: Our support for the Afghan people remains steadfast, but patience with the Taliban is running out,"" Amiri wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The way to legitimacy domestically & internationally is respecting the rights of the Afghan people.""
The U.S. warning comes days after the Taliban's supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, enacted the contentious decree that orders Afghan women not to speak aloud in public and cover their bodies and faces entirely when outdoors.
The 114-page, 35-article law also outlines various actions and specific conduct that the Taliban government, called the Islamic Emirate, considers mandatory or prohibited for Afghan men and women in line with its strict interpretation of Islam.
The legal document empowers the Ministry for Promoting Virtue and Preventing Vice, which the Taliban revived after coming back to power in August 2021, to enforce it strictly.
Enforcers are empowered to discipline offenders, and penalties may include anything from a verbal warning to fines to imprisonment. The law requires them to prevent ""evils"" such as adultery, extramarital sex, lesbianism, taking pictures of living objects and befriending non-Muslims.
Official Taliban media quoted Akhundzada this week as ordering authorities to ""rigorously enforce"" the new vice and virtue decree across Afghanistan ""to bring the people closer to the Islamic system.""
The law was enacted amid extensive restrictions on Afghan women's education and employment opportunities.
Since regaining power three years ago, the Taliban have prohibited girls ages 12 and older from continuing their education beyond the sixth grade and restricted women from seeking employment, except in certain sectors such as health.
Afghan females are not allowed to visit parks and other public places, and a male guardian must accompany them on road trips or air travel.
The United Nations promptly responded to the new law last month, condemning it as a ""distressing vision"" for the impoverished country's future and urging de facto authorities to reverse it.
The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, has dismissed U.N.-led foreign criticism as offensive.
Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, asserted that ""non-Muslims should first educate themselves about Islamic laws and respect Islamic values"" before expressing concerns or rejecting the law. ""We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised without understanding it,"" he said."

Amid Israel's genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more   than 40,800 Palestinians so far, the majority of them children,   resistance groups in Palestine and across the region continue their   operations against the Tel Aviv regime and its Western backers.
The major operations carried out by the Palestinian and regional resistance groups on Monday, September 3, are as follows:
Al-Qassam Brigades' operations on September 3:
Al-Quds Brigades' operations on September 3:
Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades' operations on September 3:

Question: So far, reports are coming in only from Reuters, but often such media leaks are eventually confirmed. The United States allegedly intends to supply missiles with a range of 300â900 kilometres for F-16 fighters. How could you comment on this?
Sergey Lavrov: I am tired of commenting, and nothing surprises me anymore. The Americans have already passed the ""threshold"" they set themselves. They are being egged on to it. Vladimir Zelensky can see this, and he is taking advantage of the situation.
However, they should understand that one should not joke about our ""red lines."" They know their location very well.
So far, the obsessive power struggle (when Democrats want to prove themselves ""tougher"" than the Republicans or vice versa) is leading towards an escalation. I am convinced that there are reasonable people exercising certain sway in the United States. I hope that the interests of the United States will be taken into account.
I would like to note a statement by National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby who said that one should be very careful about expanding support for Ukraine, so as not to start World War III because one would feel sorry for Europe. In effect, their genetic code tells them that no one will dare touch them. This destroys all principles on which Soviet-US agreements on strategic stability hinged; these agreements were later reaffirmed and developed with the Russian Federation. For some reason, their feeling of mutual deterrence is becoming eroded, and this is dangerous.
Question: What are they counting on then? They will supply weapons all the time. Certainly, they should realise that it is impossible to defeat Russia.
Sergey Lavrov: You should ask them.
I do not know what they are counting on. They believe that this ""tough"" stand on Russia is another argument for obtaining extra votes in the context of the logic of American exceptionalism. Such logic implies that they can do what they want, and no one will dare to offend them. This is what we are seeing today. However, no one, including me, knows what's on their mind.
You should go to New York City, or tell your colleagues to ask these questions."

Events and Speeches  The 37th Government  03.09.2024
Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, at the GPO in Jerusalem :
""Citizens of Israel, we are in the midst of an existential war against Iran's axis of evil. The first condition for victory in this existential war is unity among us. We need to stand united as one against a brutal enemy who wants to destroy all of us, without exception - left and right, religious and secular, Jew and non-Jew.
We discovered this not only on October 7, but all throughout the war. But we especially discovered again it in the terrible massacre, the cold-blooded execution of six of our hostages: Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Sasha Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sergeant Ori Danino, may G-d avenge them.
In the last 24 hours, I have spoken by telephone with several of their families. During the conversations, I looked at the photos of these pure souls and my heart, the heart of the nation, was shattered. You see the light shining from their faces. You see the hope. You see the nobility. You hear the stories of their wonderful lives. And all this light is suddenly extinguished. All the purity is brutally cut down by monsters.
I told the families and I reiterate this evening: I request your forgiveness that we did not succeed in bringing them back alive. We were close, but we did not succeed.
I also reiterate this evening: Israel will not overlook this massacre. Hamas will pay a very heavy price.
In the war against the axis of evil, in this specific war against Hamas and in the north, we have set four objectives: Eliminating Hamas, returning all of the hostages, ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel, and returning our residents securely to their homes on the northern border. Three of these goals pass through one place: The Philadelphi Corridor. This is Hamas's lifeline and armament line.
I would like to take several minutes to explain the significance of the Philadelphi Corridor, what it is, what it means for Israel's security, its meaning and its importance in ensuring that we will not have more and more October 7's, like Hamas has promised.
First of all, I would like to show you what we had in the years up until we left there (slide 1; click here for Hebrew slides): This is the State of Israel. This is Egypt. You see the Gaza Strip. The distance to Tel Aviv is not great; neither is the distance to Be'er Sheva. Of course, the Western Negev is meters away. But we had an international border, which ran from the sea to Eilat. This was the international border of the State of Israel. When you see this enlarged (slide 2), you see that all of these borders, the maritime border is under our control. The entire land border is under our control. Ashkelon, Sderot, the kibbutzim, Kerem Shalom, and at the bottom is the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah crossing; all of them are under our control.
Here is what happened when we left Gaza (slide 3): What happened is that the borders remained in our possession. They tried to break through the maritime border with all kinds of craft, for example the Marmara. We blocked that. The land border is ours, nothing gets in. But the moment we left the Philadelphi Corridor, in effect the Philadelphi Corridor is the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, and the moment we left there, we did not have any barrier to the massive infiltration of weapons, war materiel, machinery to manufacture rockets, and machines for excavating tunnels - all under the aegis of Iran, directed by Iran and financed by Iran. All the things that you see here came in. Gaza became a massive threat to the State of Israel because there was no barrier here (on the Philadelphi Corridor). This is what happened.
Therefore, the question may be asked: If it was so bad, why didn't you occupy it? The answer is that we were constantly trying to attack, of course. After this happened, right after the Disengagement, this arming went on energetically under the Morsi regime, but it went on afterwards, from the Mubarak regime as well through other regimes. This arming went on constantly and we fought it in a series of wars. I led three of them, three operations: Pillar of Defense, Protective Edge and Guardian of the Walls. We fought this and we eliminated thousands of terrorists, and senior commanders, including Hamas chief-of-staff Jabari. But there was no national or international legitimacy to go in, to conquer Gaza, to recapture the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing. There was neither national nor international agreement.
I am not just talking about the importance of the Philadelphi Corridor now, I said it 20 years ago. Sharon declared the Disengagement at the end of 2003. Several months later, on 26 March 2004, I described my minimal demands. I said that my first condition is control over all of the crossings into and out of the Gaza Strip - on land, sea and air. The Philadelphi Corridor that separates between the Gaza Strip and Egypt will not be evacuated. If Israel gives up control, I said, Gaza will become a terrorist enclave. When I resigned from the Government, when it became clear that they were going to uproot communities and carry out the Disengagement, I gave Prime Minister Sharon a letter of resignation and I told him that at minimum, I demanded that we be responsible for safeguarding the Philadephi Corridor.
This is not new. It was clear that if we did not have this corridor, there would be arming here, that a monster would be created. The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi Corridor. It is for this reason that Hamas is insisting that we not be there and it is for this reason that I insist that we will be there.
Our presence in the Philadelphi Corridor is, first of all, a diplomatic and strategic issue. We must determine the fact that we are there. I am told: 'What is going on, we will soon leave? You can leave for 42 days and return afterwards.' And I say that we have been in this situation before. We were in it when we left Lebanon. With the first rocket, the first missile, 'We will go in and conquer the place and we will have great international support for it.' Thousands of missiles have been fired from there and there was no international support for it. In the Strip, now that we have done this, they said 'What's the problem? With the first rocket, we will go in. The first rocket that is fired above ground or smuggled underground and we will go in.' Twenty years passed and we did not go in.
Whoever says we can go in and it won't be a problem, there's quite a problem. It is not easy to do such a thing. It is not a question of military tactics as it is a question of the great diplomatic pressure that the entire world will use on us. If we leave - we will not go back.
It was very difficult for us to overcome the international pressure, which I withstood, in order to go into Rafah. See what it has cost us. There was considerable pressure on us. They brought us to the ICC a day or two before the decision. They knew that we were going to approve the decision. We have been subjected to an embargo that is spreading. We paid with the lives of our soldiers. But this is nothing compared to what will be directed against us if we leave. Everyone understands the importance of this but do not support us; they want us to finish the war. This, in effect, is what everyone wants - for us to finish the war.
This corridor is different from all other corridors and places. It is central and determines our entire future. Its importance for us is immense. But the world wants an end to the war. The last thing it wants is for us to go in there and we will be under great pressure in the Security Council. On other issues, I do not want to go into detail or give ideas to others. I already know what will be. Why should we go into this trap? We are told that it is possible. I say that this will not bring us the hostages, on the contrary.
When we entered the Philadelphi Corridor we felt a change. For many long months, after the first deal, Hamas did not budge. It insisted 'You must first declare an end to the war.' 'You must commit to leaving the Gaza Strip' - in effect 'You must allow us to control Gaza.' And of course, this did not lead to a deal or the release of even a single hostage. But the first crack came when we entered Rafah, took control of the Philadelphi Corridor, and took control of the Rafah Crossing - Hamas's lifeline. Then suddenly, they started to talk differently. They backtracked a bit afterwards when they thought that Iran or Hezbollah would come to save them. Now they are hoping that international and domestic pressure will come to save them.
But the fact is that the first effective change ahead of a deal has been made possible precisely from taking control of the Philadelphi Corridor. Its evacuation - you leave, you don't return.
I was quoted that we are not leaving for 42 days because we are going to be there for 42 years - I did not say that. I saw that I was quoted on one of the channels - it is incorrect. But I know that if we leave, it could be that we will not return for 42 years, because we left there and did not go back for 20 years.
After we have sacrificed, fought, captured and grabbed them by the throat and this is what can also give us the hostages. By the way, this is also preventing the hostages from being smuggled underground. They could take them and smuggle them during these 42 days, to Sinai, it is only a few meters away. They cross the fence and disappear. They could reappear in Iran or Yemen - no way.
After we have received all of this, we will not give it up, and will not put ourselves into a terrible trap. It is not a question of military tactics - it is a diplomatic and strategic question. Just as there were security people who said 'There is no problem; it is possible to disengage and leave the Gaza Strip' and 'There is no problem; it is possible to leave Lebanon and we can go back immediately'. I think that after October 7, we have learned to be slightly more cautious with our assessments and to understand all of the components in the picture here.
Unfortunately, we are committed with our very souls, and I am committed with mine, to achieve a deal and advance a deal - unfortunately, we have not seen a similar response on the part of Hamas. We agreed to the framework that President Biden submitted on May 31st. We agreed to what they called 'the final bridging proposal' on August 16th. We agreed to all this. Hamas refused the first. Hamas refused the second. Its representative Al-Hiya said yesterday 'Retreat from the entire Strip, an end to the war, leave us in control.' This is their position. I said that they have moved a little but the moment they think that there is any weakness on our part, or some pressure that will break us, they backtrack. Therefore, we are not leaving.
The Philadelphi Corridor is of cardinal importance both in bringing the hostages and ensuring that Hamas will be crushed and that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to us.
Therefore, we have made it clear that this is our position. However, among us voices are beginning to be heard, from inside the Security Cabinet, Government ministers have said 'There is no problem; it is possible to leave.' Even though we have already decided not to. Therefore, I needed to submit this to the Security Cabinet formally, and determine this, and make it clear that there are things we will not compromise on.
I want to make it clear: I am flexible where I can be flexible. I am not insistent where I can be flexible, and I am not flexible where I must be insistent. On this we must all be insistent, otherwise we will receive all of this disaster again.
The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi Corridor - we need to hold it. Therefore, after we approved the Security Cabinet decision, I was simply astounded to hear from among us that we could leave again, but when was this said? After they massacred us and murdered six of our hostages in cold blood? What message does this send to Hamas? Murder hostages - and receive concessions.
That is perfectly legitimate in discussions. Every minister must speak his mind. Whoever is in these discussions a little, and is in them a little too much, I encourage everyone to speak their minds and I do not block anyone - on the contrary. But as soon as a decision is made, it is binding on everyone in the Security Cabinet. It is not do-it-yourself. As soon as a decision is made, it binds everyone.
The message that we will change a vital strategic decision, the idea that we will alter decisions under pressure of a massacre of our hostages, is a terrible message. It is an incentive for terrorism and additional murders; therefore, it will not happen.
It simply will not happen. Of course, Hamas thinks that it will happen, as long as they see the rifts among us. By the way, it is not seeing anything new. It has been using this tactic for an entire year. First of all, this is what we want to occur, The IDF stays here and blocks in order to get us out, not just from there but from the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas has been using this tactic to divide us, to weaken us and in the end, to defeat us.
How does it do this? (Slide 5). Here is a page of instructions that was found by our soldiers in a tunnel for senior Hamas commanders. By the way, the media said that this is Sinwar but I cannot commit to that. I can commit that it was senior Hamas commanders. Here is the original document in Arabic and here is the translation: Increase the distribution of photos and videos of the hostages due to the psychological pressure that they create. Do everything to increase the psychological pressure on Gallant. Continue with the line that Netanyahu is responsible for what happened. Strike at the Israeli narrative that the ground operation serves the return of the hostages. This is Hamas's message sheet. This is Hamas's strategy. It wants to divide us; it is counting on internal rifts.
It thinks that most of the nation will follow this - it is mistaken. I said during the debate over refusal to serve, that on the day of need, we will all line up together. I thought that debate was terrible. It created among our enemies the expectation that we were weak and divided, and that we would be defeated - but on the day the order was given, all of us fought.
Now it is creating the same thing, the same delusion, that we will be defeated on cardinal things that are important to ensuring our future and our existence, that it is possible to sow discord and strife among us and defeat us. I will not give in to this pressure; I have withstood greater pressure. Neither will our people give in to this pressure because most of the public understands exactly what I have said. It is not important what can be seen from bunkers or on TV screens - I say to Sinwar: Forget it. This will not happen.
We need to stand united on our existential interest. We need to act together so that the other side will understand, like it understood about an end to the war; it will also understand here that we will not give in on what is essential.
By the way, we do give in on things that are not essential. I have given great room for flexibility throughout the year and also now. But on existential things, we stand together. As soon as Hamas understands this - there will be a deal. The moment that it understands this - we will ensure both our existence and our future.
Together we will stand, together we will fight, and - with G-d's help - together we will win."""

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese  The Hon Anthony Albanese MP  Prime Minister of Australia
The Hon Richard Marles MP  Deputy Prime Minister  Minister for Defence
The Hon Pat Conroy MP  Minister for International Development and the Pacific  Minister for Defence Industry and Capability Delivery
The   Albanese Government is today announcing a new Jobs for Subs program for   200 young workers required to make Submarine Rotational Force - West   (SRF-W) a success.
The Nuclear-Powered Submarine Graduate,   Apprenticeship and Traineeship initiative is a Government-funded   recruitment and upskilling program for graduates, apprentices and   trainees within ASC Pty Ltd.
This initiative from the Albanese   Government will allow the ASC Pty Ltd to recruit around 200 additional   entry-level personnel over the next two years across high priority   disciplines and trades essential to the nuclear-powered submarine   enterprise, building the workforce we need in the west to sustain and   maintain Australia's future nuclear-powered submarines.
These   roles, predominantly in Western Australia, span fabrication and   machining, engineering and project management, and supply chain and   operations qualifications.
As Australia's sovereign submarine   partner for sustainment of our nuclear-powered submarines, ASC Pty Ltd   plays a critical role in developing the required skills, workforce,   knowledge and capability. This initiative seeks to enhance the ability   to attract entry-level personnel to critical skills and career pathways,   retain valued personnel at entry-levels and grow the workforce   available across the Defence industry.
Already, the Albanese   Government has committed to invest up to $8 billion in infrastructure to   enable SFR-W from 2027 and to operate Australia's own Virginia class   conventionally armed, nuclearâpowered submarines from the early 2030s.
Across   Australia, the nuclear-powered submarine program is expected to create   around 20,000 highly skilled jobs for Australians for decades to come,   including supporting around 3,000 jobs in the west alone.
Over the   last two weeks, ASC Pty Ltd has been developing Australia's sovereign   sustainment workforce, in support of the Submarine Tendered Maintenance   Period (SMTP) currently underway at HMAS Stirling.
The STMP is an   important milestone in the pathway by which Australia will acquire a   nuclear-powered submarine capability and is the first time Australian   personnel have directly participated in the maintenance of a   nuclear-powered submarine in Australia.
During the STMP, Royal   Australian Navy personnel have been directly participating in   maintenance work on USS Hawaii (SSN 776), a Virginia class submarine, at   HMAS Stirling.
In addition, workers from ASC Pty Ltd are   providing essential support services to USS Hawaii, and are observing   maintenance activities to continue their learning.
During this STMP, no active radiological work is being conducted and no low level radiological material will leave the US ships.
Today's   announcement builds on the more than 4,000 additional Commonwealth   supported university places the Albanese Government announced and the   work we are doing with the states and territories to grow the skilled   workforces we need.
The Albanese Government is investing in the   workforce we need to deliver Australia's nuclear-powered submarines and a   future made in Australia.
""It   is an honour to visit HMAS Stirling and see the finest of Australia's   workforce becoming stronger through the strength of the AUKUS   partnership.
""We are announcing a new graduate, apprenticeship and   traineeship program to train an additional 200 West Australians to work   on Submarine Rotational Force- West program.
""We want to keep   Australians safe. That's why WA will play a key role in building AUKUS.   This will help promote peace and deterrence in the region and support   local jobs.""
""Today's   announcement is another important step in growing the workforce to be   equipped with the skills and training we need to acquire Australia's   nuclear-powered submarines.
""We welcome the crews of USS Hawaii   and USS Emory S. Land to Western Australia, for this milestone. We   welcome our US friends to our shores, and welcome home the Australians   that have been embedded with them.
""We are seeing during this   visit the first Australian personnel participating in the maintenance of   a US nuclear-powered submarine at HMAS Stirling, the home of Australian   submarines.""
""This   is a further boost to the development of ASC's sustainment workforce   and follows the first cohort of workers departing for training at Pearl   Harbour Naval Shipyard in July.
""Australian industry is integral   not only to Australia's nuclear-powered submarine program, but also to   supporting the future building, sustainment and maintenance of the   submarines of our AUKUS partners.
""We are seeing real progress   being made to develop the workforce of thousands of highly-skilled   scientists, engineers, project managers, operators, technicians,   welders, construction workers, electricians, metal fitters and builders   that will be needed to support this nation-building endeavour."""

By RFA Staff 2024.08.31 -- China and the Philippines traded accusations of ramming each other's vessels on Saturday at a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, marking an apparent escalation in an already tense situation in the area.
Jay Tarriela, spokesperson for the Philippine National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea - part of South China Sea over which the Philippines claims jurisdiction - said that a Chinese coast guard vessel ""deliberately rammed and collided"" three times with a Philippine coast guard ship ""despite no provocation"" from the Philippine side.
The Philippine vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, has been on deployment at Sabina Shoal, known in the Philippines as Escoda Shoal, since April to monitor what the Philippines fears is China's plan to reclaim land at the shoal.
Tarriela told a press briefing in Manila that the incident was the fifth case of harassment by China of Philippine ships operating in the area in August. He said there were no reports of any injuries to Philippine personnel.
A Chinese coast guard spokesperson accused the Philippines of provocation at the shoal, which both sides claim but which lies entirely within the Philippine exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, where the Philippines holds rights to explore for natural resources.
The Chinese coast guard ship 5205 ""lawfully issued verbal warnings and conducted monitoring and control measures"" against the Philippine ship which ""continued its provocations at China's Xianbin Jiao,"" Chinese coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said, referring to the shoal by its Chinese name.
At around midday, the Philippine ship ""deliberately rammed into the Chinese ship 5205 in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision for which the Philippines bears full responsibility,"" Liu said.
Sabina Shoal has in recent days become the latest flashpoint between the Philippines, a close U.S. ally, and China in the South China Sea, raising concerns about conflict between the neighbors.
The U.S. has spoken in support of Manila, with Ambassador MaryKay Carlson saying in a statement that Washington ""condemns the multiple dangerous violations of international law"" by China, including Saturday's incident.
""We stand with the Philippines in upholding international law,"" she added.
Less than a week ago, Philippine officials said another ship - the BRP Datu Sanday - ""encountered aggressive and dangerous maneuvers from eight Chinese maritime forces"" while attempting to deliver diesel, food and medical supplies to Filipino fishermen operating near the shoal.
China has repeatedly accused the Philippines of ""illegally grounding"" the BRP Teresa Magbanua in order to ""forcibly occupy"" the shoal. China on Friday released an ecological report to back its claim to the feature that officials said is a Chinese island.

9M3V76IXIB_K1EN6GYGYVOUZNN,At Least 51 Killed In Russian Missile Strike In Central Ukraine,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240903-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service September 03, 2024
At least 51 people were killed and 219 were injured on September 3 in one of Russia's deadliest attacks in a single strike since its all-out invasion of Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the country's Defense Ministry said two missiles struck a building of the Military Communications Institute in a morning attack on the city of Poltava in central Ukraine.
They said two missiles hit the facility just after an air-raid alert and people didn't have time to evacuate to a bomb shelter.
""One of the buildings of the Communications Institute was partially destroyed. People found themselves under the rubble. Many were saved,"" Zelenskiy said.
Poltava regional Governor Filip Pronin said on Ukrainian television that as many as 15 people may still be under the rubble, adding that search teams were continuing to work at the scene.
The Prosecutor-General's Office announced that it launched an investigation as it released the new death toll of 51 late on September 3.
""At the moment rescuers, an investigative and operational group, and other services are working on the site, and the demolition of the debris is ongoing. The number of victims is being clarified,"" the Prosecutor-General's Office said on Telegram.
Zelenskiy said earlier that he ordered a ""full and prompt investigation"" into what happened. He also said he was ""grateful to everyone who, from the first minutes after being hit, helps people who save lives.""
Zelenskiy and Pronin described the site as an ""educational"" facility, and the identities of the victims were not immediately disclosed.
The attack is believed to be the deadliest single strike since May 2022, when Zelenskiy said 87 soldiers were killed at a military training center in the northern Cherniv region.
Ukraine's defense readiness came under scrutiny after the strike on Poltava, and some observers questioned why a large number of people were left vulnerable to a single attack.
""A crowd of people at this facility in this number is absolutely unacceptable,"" said Yuriy Butosov, a Ukrainian activist and journalist. ""We have a large number of military installations where there are significant numbers of people. These people in many cases that I have observed spread out so as so that they cannot be targeted by a single blow at the same time,"" he told Current Time.
Vladislav Seleznev, a Ukrainian military analyst and former spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian military, said Ukraine can blame the Kremlin for the strike on Poltava, but there must also be a clear understanding of Kyiv's responsibility.
""The conversation we need to have is first and foremost about responsibility of officials who did not do anything that could have saved lives lost today during the Russian [air] strike,"" Seleznev said. ""Why do children in Kharkiv attend classes underground or in a metro while [people at] the training center in Poltava did not have such an option?""
He also said the strike shows that Ukraine lacks monitoring systems needed to detect reconnaissance drones.
""Russia is not even trying to hide the fact that they were guiding their Iskander [missiles] toward the training center using a reconnaissance drone. If we had a sufficient amount of such monitoring and eventually strike systems, this kind of tragedy could have been prevented,"" he said.
In addition, Ukraine must realize the danger faced by all regions close to the front line. ""The enemy is using ballistic [missiles] and the time [between their launch and] strike amounts to mere minutes.""
Zelenskiy again urged Ukraine's supporters to step up the supply of air-defense systems and long-range missiles that can ""defend against Russian terror."" he said. ""Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lives lost.""
Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said emergency responders had saved many people and pulled some from the rubble. He said the impact site was near a residential area and shock waves from the blasts knocked out windows and damaged the facades of high-rise buildings.
After dozens of people reportedly turned up to donate blood, a message distributed via local media urged Ukrainians to avoid queuing up at blood-donation centers.
Mariana Bezugla, deputy head of the Ukrainian parliament's National Security, Defense, and Intelligence Committee, appeared to suggest some sort of gathering had been targeted.
Alluding to a deadly Russian attack on a group of Ukrainian soldiers in the southern Zaporizhzhya region in November, Bezugla said the incident ""did not teach [us] anything.""
""We have the repetition and repetition of tragedies. Where is the limit?"" she wrote on X.
The Ukrainian military confirmed the deaths of at least 19 soldiers from the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and nine others in that attack.
The incident sparked fierce criticism when it emerged that the soldiers had been gathered for an award ceremony.
Russia did not immediately comment on the Poltava attack.

Tehran, IRNA -- The Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, said their fighters have detonated six explosive devices targeting Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank over the past 72 hours.
The Israeli military is now in its seventh day of massive raids across the occupied West Bank, an operation that has killed dozens of Palestinians and sparked heavy fighting with Palestinian resistance groups.
The Al-Quds Brigades reported 14 separate clashes with Israeli soldiers in various cities in the West Bank. They said the Tulkarm Battalion engaged in seven armed confrontations with the occupying forces, detonating four explosives along the routes of Israeli military vehicles.
The Tulkarm Battalion also inflicted casualties on Israeli troops during these clashes, asserting that several soldiers were killed or wounded.
Additionally, the Nablus Battalion of the Al-Quds Brigades engaged in four battles against Israeli forces, during which they also detonated an explosive device targeting Israeli military vehicles.

MANILA -- Several envoys from Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania condemned the repeated ramming of a Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel against a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship over the weekend.
In a statement, European Union (EU) spokesperson Nabila Massrali said the CCG's ""dangerous actions"" against ""lawful Philippine maritime operations"" violate international law.
""The incident is the latest of several such actions during the past months, which endanger the safety of life at sea, and violate the right to freedom of navigation and overflight to which all nations are entitled,"" Massrali said.
She said the United Nations (UN) Charter, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other relevant international norms relating to safety of life at sea, and the Arbitration Award of 2016, ""should be upheld and respected at all times.""
""The EU condemns all unlawful, escalatory and coercive actions that undermine these principles of international law and threaten peace and stability in the region,"" she said, citing the prohibition on the use of force or coercion, and the right to freedom of navigation and overflight.
The EU called for de-escalation of tensions and committed to supporting its partners ""to exercise their legitimate rights, in the region and beyond.""
EU Ambassador to the Philippines Luc VÃ©ron said he was ""deeply concerned with the repetition of incidents"" in a post on X.
""The EU reiterates its call for observance of freedom of navigation and maritime safety in the South China Sea, in accordance with international law,"" VÃ©ron said.
German Ambassador to the Philippines Andreas Pfaffernoschke supported the EU's stance.
""Germany fully subscribes to [VÃ©ron's] statement,"" Pfaffernoschke said over X.
Canadian Ambassador to the Philippines David Hartman also condemned the actions of the CCG and said the altercation was the ""7th serious incident"" in August alone.
""Canada calls on the People's Republic of China to cease its repeated and dangerous obstruction of Philippine vessels and aircraft which undermines peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Hartman said in a post on X.
Meanwhile, Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Endo Kazuya expressed concern over the repeated incidents as a stakeholder in the South China Sea.
""Japan opposes any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. Japan stands together with the Philippines by upholding rule of law at sea,"" Kazuya said in a post on X.
Ambassador of the Republic of Korea Lee Sang-hwa shared Kazuya's concerns on the recurring incidents ""that have escalated tension and jeopardized the safety of the Philippine vessels and its personnel on board.""
""The Embassy reiterates its support for peace, stability, safety, and rules-based order in these waters as well as the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS,"" Lee said in a post on Facebook.
In a statement, the New Zealand Embassy in Manila said the ramming of the CCG vessel of a Philippine ship was ""profoundly troubling and fits a recent pattern of dangerous and destabilizing actions in the region.""
""New Zealand calls for de-escalation and compliance with international law, in particular UNCLOS,"" the embassy said in a post on X.
Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Hae Kyong Yu backed the Philippines' concerns about ""China's destabilizing behaviour at Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea.""
""Repeatedly ramming vessels is unacceptable and dangerous. All countries must comply with international law. The 2016 Arbitral Award is binding on its parties,"" Yu said in a post on X.
Last Aug. 31, a CCG vessel repeatedly rammed the PCG's biggest ship BRP Teresa Magbanua. while in transit to Escoda Shoal in the WPS which is about 75 nautical miles from Palawan.
It sustained damage in its bridge wing and freeboard but no injuries to the crew were reported.
Irresponsible, reckless
A think tank also branded the CCG's acts against the PCG ship BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) dangerous, irresponsible, and reckless.
""It not only caused significant damage to our vessel, but gravely endangered the lives of those onboard. This kind of behavior has no place in our rules-based order,"" Stratbase ADR Institute president Victor Andres Manhit said in a statement Monday.
He added that China's claim that it ""exercises indisputable sovereignty"" in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) is false and baseless.
""It is an act of desperation because the matter has been, in fact, settled. Chinese behavior, including repeated incursions of its vessels into Philippine territory, unprovoked aggression, and the propagation of disinformation, are clear violations of international law,"" Manhit stressed.
He urged China to behave responsibly and adhere to its obligations under international law, including the 2016 Arbitral Award, in both the maritime space and airspace.
""It is the responsibility of all nations to ensure the peace, security, and stability of the Indo-Pacific,"" Manhit said. (with Priam Nepomuceno/PNA)"
9U3Y1ENTJP_12FH04XW1O8VHIY,Kazakhstan To Spend Over $32 Million On Controversial Referendum About Nuclear Power Station,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/kazakh/2024/kazakh-240903-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Kazakh Service September 03, 2024
The chairwoman of Kazakhstan's Central Commission on Referendums (ORK), Sabila Mustafina, said on September 3 that 15.5 billion tenges (more than $32 million) has been requested for a nationwide referendum on the construction of a nuclear power station in the Central Asian country next month.
The announcement came a day after President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev announced the referendum and signed a decree setting October 6 as the date of the vote.
According to Mustafina, 71 percent of the requested sum would cover compensation for the work of more than 70,000 ORK members, while 29 percent would be used for communication activities, bulletins, and advertisements.
""The government will decide on the allocation of the mentioned sum for the referendum, after our estimations are approved by the Finance Ministry, the National Economy Ministry, and the Justice Ministry,"" Mustafina said.
Mustafina's deputy Konstantin Petrov said more than 12 million Kazakh citizens are eligible to vote at more than 10,000 voting sites across the country and 78 stations will be set up in different countries for Kazakh citizens residing abroad.
Only one question will be asked in the referendum: ""Do you agree that Kazakhstan needs to construct a nuclear power station?""
Many in Kazakhstan expect that the answer will be ""yes,"" considering the country's tightly controlled political environment.
But the push to build a nuclear power plant has been met by significant opposition despite apparent efforts to silence dissent on the issue. In recent weeks, several activists known for their stance against the nuclear power station's construction have been prevented from attending public debates on the matter.
Nuclear-power-related projects have been a controversial issue in Kazakhstan, where the environment was severely impacted by operations at the Soviet-era Semipalatinsk nuclear test site from 1949 to 1991 and the Baikonur spaceport, which is still being operated by Moscow.
Hours before his decree was made public on September 2, President Toqaev reiterated his support for the plan to build a nuclear power station.
There was no official information about the site of the future nuclear station, but a public debate was held last year in the village of Ulken on the shore of the Lake Balkhash in the southeastern region of Almaty about the possibility of constructing a nuclear power station there.
The idea to build a nuclear power station in Kazakhstan has been circulating in the country for years, leading to questions regarding what countries would be involved in the project.
Kazakh officials have tried to avoid answering the question, saying the decision would be made after a referendum.
Shortly before launching its ongoing invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia proposed its Rosatom nuclear agency to be Kazakhstan's major partner in the project.
Kazakh Internet users mostly rejected the idea of Rosatom's involvement, citing the legacy of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster and Russia's gaining control over the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine as examples of Russia's attitude toward nuclear safety.

A05QMB3X14_SLCE7G9PVPVN61F,Chinese experts criticize Philippines for endangering ships and violating humanitarian principles after Philippine vessel deliberately collides with CCG ship at Xianbin Jiao,Global Times,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/08/mil-240831-globaltimes02.htm,"Global Times
By Zhang Yuying Published: Aug 31, 2024 05:03 PM Updated: Aug 31, 2024 09:42 PM
At 08:02 on Saturday, the Philippine ship 9701 weighed anchor and continued its provocations at China's Xianbin Jiao (also known as Xianbin Reef) in the South China Sea. In response, the Chinese coast guard ship 5205 lawfully issued verbal warnings and conducted monitoring and control measures, according to the China Coast Guard (CCG) on Saturday.
At 12:06, the Philippine ship deliberately rammed into the Chinese ship 5205 in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision for which the Philippines bears full responsibility, CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
China once again urges the Philippines to face reality, abandon illusions, and immediately withdraw their illegal ship, as this is the only correct path forward. The Philippines should not misinterpret the situation, provoke conflicts, or escalate tensions, otherwise, the consequences will be solely borne by the Philippine side, the spokesperson warned.
The CCG reiterated China's indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao, or Nansha Islands, including Xianbin Jiao, and their adjacent waters. China will take necessary measures to resolutely thwart any provocative acts of infringement and firmly defend the country's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, the spokesperson said.
Since mid-April, the Philippine Coast Guard ship 9701, also known as BRP Teresa Magbanua, has been illegally and harmfully anchored in the lagoon of the Xianbin Jiao.
The Philippines' long-term anchoring at Xianbin Jiao constitutes illegal occupation, which does not change the legal status of the occupied territory, according to Zhang Qiyue, a research fellow at Shanghai Institute for International Studies.
The Philippines has seriously infringed on China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights, violating the basic principles of the United Nations Charter for the peaceful resolution of international disputes, and gone against the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which promotes peaceful use of the seas, Zhang stressed, noting that this action has caused serious damage to international legal norms and the rule of law.
In response to the illegal intrusion of Philippine vessel 9701 into Xianbin Jiao, China has shown a high degree of restraint by refraining from taking forceful measures against it, and only implementing necessary control measures to prevent the vessel from staying long-term, said Chen Xidi, a research fellow at China Institute for Marine Affairs, noting that China has been actively communicating with the Philippine side throughout this situation.
This fully demonstrates China's sincerity in adhering to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, not expanding and peacefully resolving disputes, Chen said. ""In sharp contrast, the Philippines continues provocations by deliberately ramming into the Chinese ship. The Philippines is the one undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea, and violating humanitarian principles,"" Chen noted.
In fact, the Philippines is not concerned about the safety of its ships, aircraft, and personnel at Xianbin Jiao, nor does it care about the ""freedom"" and ""stability"" of the South China Sea, Chen noted. ""The only thing the Philippines cares about is whether its actions in the South China Sea are aggressive and attention-grabbing enough, and whether it can win the 'favor' and 'support' of certain countries outside the region,"" Chen said.
Experts urged the Philippine side not to harbor any illusions about the illegal occupation of Xianbin Jiao, nor to repeatedly test China's bottom line. Otherwise, it will only waste time and be of no benefit to the resolution of the dispute.
""The only way to solve the dispute is for the Philippine side to withdraw its coast guard ship and other vessels as soon as possible, and restore peace and stability in the South China Sea,"" Zhang said.
On Friday, China released an on-site investigative report regarding the ecological system of the coral reefs in the South China Sea's Xianbin Jiao, revealing the coral reef ecosystem in Xianbin Jiao is generally in good health, in response to allegations made by the Philippines this year, which groundlessly accused China of reclaiming an artificial reef around Xianbin Jiao that led to widespread coral bleaching."
A86FT8DRTB_UKI7MKXUS8TSLW8,The Rise Of The Baloch Liberation Army In Pakistan,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/pakistan/2024/pakistan-240901-rferl01.htm,"By Abubakar Siddique September 01, 2024
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has waged an over 20-year insurgency against the Pakistani state, carrying out mostly small-scale attacks against government forces.
But that changed last week when the separatist militant group claimed responsibility for major coordinated attacks across the vast and impoverished southwestern province of Balochistan, killing over 70 people.
The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran and is home to Pakistan's Baluch ethnic minority.
Experts say the attacks highlight the growing strength of the BLA, which has boosted its recruitment and gained access to modern weapons. The U.S.-designated terrorist group has also adopted more lethal tactics like suicide bombings in recent years.
""These attacks were unprecedented and mark a new escalation in the tensions in Balochistan,"" said Kiyya Baloch, a Pakistani journalist and commentator who tracks militancy in the region. ""It shows the BLA's determination to showcase its growing strength.""
Demonstrating Dominance
In an operation that began late on August 25, BLA fighters bombed a railway bridge linking the province to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway.
In the deadliest attack, BLA fighters stopped a bus and shot dead 23 of its passengers, many of whom were from Punjab, Pakistan's most populous and prosperous province.
The coordinated attacks coincided with the anniversary of the death of Baloch nationalist leader Akbar Bugti, who was killed by Pakistan's security forces in 2006.
Aziz Baloch, an independent security expert in Balochistan, said the BLA is keen ""to demonstrate that it can demoralize the [Pakistani] Army"" and establish itself as the ""dominant militant group"" in the province.
Balochistan has been the scene of a low-level insurgency and a brutal army crackdown for decades.
The BLA and other separatist Baluch groups seek independence from Pakistan, which they blame for exploiting the vast natural resources in Balochistan and committing grave human rights abuses in the region.
The BLA is considered the largest armed group operating in Balochistan. Experts believe the BLA has several thousand members.
Researchers have documented a sharp increase in the number of attacks carried out by Baluch groups so far this year.
Better Guns, Deadlier Tactics
Experts say the BLA has become a more organized and increasingly potent fighting force.
Pakistani militant groups, including the BLA, are believed to have obtained American weapons and military equipment. When U.S. and international forces pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021, they left behind billions of dollars' worth of military gear and weapons that were then seized by the Taliban after it captured power.
""Its acquisition of modern weapons has enhanced BLA's combat capabilities,"" said Baloch, the journalist and commentator.
Baloch added that the BLA, a secular group, has also adopted more lethal tactics used by Islamist militant groups like the Afghan Taliban and the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban.
They include the use of suicide bombings, improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, and so-called complex attacks involving multiple attackers and vehicle-borne IEDs.
The Majeed Brigade, the BLA's suicide squad, is believed to have carried out most of the group's complex attacks.
In 2022, a 31-year-old mother became the first woman to carry out a suicide bombing for the BLA. The move was considered a ""paradigm shift"" by some observers.
Exploiting Local Anger
Experts say local factors have also strengthened the BLA.
Baloch, the security expert in Balochistan, said the BLA has been successful in recruiting Baluch youth. Around 65 percent of Balochistan's population of 15 million are under the age of 30.
""They have a lot of manpower and have been attracting female [recruits], too,"" he said.
Baloch, the journalist and commentator, said poverty, high unemployment, alleged abuses by the authorities, and political suppression have made Balochistan a ""fertile ground for the BLA to attract and recruit more youth.""
Many BLA leaders and fighters are former trained professionals and university students.
Observers say Pakistan has resorted to brute force to crush successive Baluch insurgencies and ignored the long-standing grievances of the Baluch ethnic minority.
""The BLA is a manifestation of the state's failure to manage and govern Balochistan,"" said Baloch, the security expert.
Abdul Malik Baloch, a politician and former chief minister of Balochistan, said many Baluch are becoming increasingly disillusioned with what they call Islamabad's political meddling in the province.
Baloch said rigged elections in Balochistan aimed at empowering pro-Islamabad figures have disenchanted those who believe in ""peaceful politics.""
""Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud,"" he said. ""They feel we are wasting their time.""
Abdul Malik Baloch, who leads the secular National Party, was among several prominent Baluch leaders who lost their seats in parliamentary elections in February. The lawmaker remains a member of the provincial assembly.
Opposition figures accused Pakistan's powerful military, which has an oversized role in the domestic and foreign affairs of the country, of rigging the vote.
""Disappointment is pushing people into the arms of the insurgency,"" said Baloch, the former chief minister.

For Immediate Release  Office of Public Affairs
Influence   Operation Relied on Influencers, AI-Generated Content, Paid Social Media   Advertisements, and Social Media Accounts to Drive Internet Traffic to   Cybersquatted and Other Domains
Note: View the affidavit here.
The Justice Department today announced the ongoing seizure of 32   internet domains used in Russian government-directed foreign malign   influence campaigns colloquially referred to as ""Doppelganger,"" in   violation of U.S. money laundering and criminal trademark laws. As   alleged in an unsealed affidavit, the Russian companies Social Design   Agency (SDA), Structura National Technology (Structura), and ANO Dialog,   operating under the direction and control of the Russian Presidential   Administration, and in particular First Deputy Chief of Staff of the   Presidential Executive Office Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, used these   domains, among others, to covertly spread Russian government propaganda   with the aim of reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering   pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters in U.S. and   foreign elections, including the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election.
In conjunction with the domain seizures, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the designation of   10 individuals and two entities as part of a coordinated response to   Russia's malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential   election. This announcement follows the designation of actors involved   in Doppelganger announced by the Treasury Department in March.
""The Justice Department is seizing 32 internet domains that the   Russian government and Russian government-sponsored actors have used to   engage in a covert campaign to interfere in and influence the outcome of   our country's elections,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ""As   alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin's inner circle,   including Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies   to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a   campaign to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. An internal   planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the   campaign is to secure Russia's preferred outcome in the election. The   sites we are seizing today were filled with Russian government   propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international   support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and   influence voters in the United States and other countries. Our actions   today make clear that the Justice Department will be aggressive in   countering and disrupting attempts by the Russian government, or any   other malign actor, to interfere in our elections and undermine our   democracy.""
""The Department's seizure of 32 internet domains secretly deployed to   spread foreign malign influence demonstrates once again that Russia   remains a predominant foreign threat to our elections,"" said Deputy   Attorney General Lisa Monaco. ""At Putin's direction, Russian companies   SDA, Structura, and ANO Dialog used cybersquatting, fabricated   influencers, and fake profiles to covertly promote AI-generated false   narratives on social media. Those narratives targeted specific American   demographics and regions in a calculated effort to subvert our election.   Our republic depends on elections that are free from foreign   interference, and we will not rest in our efforts to expose foreign   malign influence operations and protect our democracy, without fear or   favor.""
""Today's announcement exposes the scope of the Russian government's   influence operations and their reliance on cutting-edge AI to sow   disinformation,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. ""Companies   operating at the direction of the Russian government created websites to   trick Americans into unwittingly consuming Russian propaganda.  By   seizing these websites, the FBI is making clear to the world what they   are, Russian attempts to interfere in our elections and influence our   society.  The FBI will continue to work with our partners to expose and   shutdown these covert influence campaigns.""
""This seizure illustrates vividly what the U.S. government and   private sector partners have warned for months: the Russian government   and its proxies are aggressively accelerating the Kremlin's covert   efforts to seed false stories and amplify disinformation directed at the   American public,"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of   the Justice Department's National Security Division. ""Today's   announcement reveals Russia is willing to impersonate our free and open   press in its egregious schemes. This is our third disruption of Russian   foreign malign influence operations in two months, and the Justice   Department remains relentless in protecting Americans from such   unacceptable conduct. To Russia, and any other government seeking to   stoke discord in our society: know that we will spare no effort and use   every available tool to disrupt and expose this malign activity and   defend our democratic institutions.""
""Protecting our democratic processes from foreign malign influence is   paramount to ensure enduring public trust,"" said U.S. Attorney   Jacqueline C. Romero for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. ""As   America's adversaries continue to spew propaganda and disinformation   towards the American electorate, we'll use every tool at our disposal to   expose and dismantle their insidious foreign influence campaigns.""
The propaganda did not identify, and in fact purposefully obfuscated,   the Russian government or its agents as the source of the content. The   perpetrators extensively utilized ""cybersquatted"" domains, a method of   registering a domain intended to mimic another person or company's   website (e.g., registering washingtonpost.pm to mimic washingtonpost.com),   to publish Russian government messaging falsely presented as content   from legitimate news media organizations. In other instances, the   perpetrators sought to create their own unique media brands to promote   Doppelganger content (e.g., Recent Reliable News). Among the   methods Doppelganger used to drive viewership to the cybersquatted and   unique media domains was the deployment of ""influencers"" worldwide, paid   social media advertisements (in some cases created using artificial   intelligence tools), and the creation of social media profiles posing as   U.S. (or other non-Russian) citizens to post comments on social media   platforms with links to the cybersquatted domains, all of which   attempted to trick viewers into believing they were being directed to a   legitimate news media outlet's website.
Overview
The affidavit describes the perpetrators' own internal strategy   meeting notes, project proposals, and other records obtained during the   course of the investigation. Several notable propaganda project   proposals directed against the United States included:
Doppelganger's foreign malign influence efforts were not directed   solely against audiences in the United States. Other targets of the   perpetrators' propaganda included Germany, Mexico, and Israel, among   others. Doppelganger's influence campaigns sought to influence the   citizenry of those countries to support Russian government objectives,   including by undermining the United States' relationship with those   countries.
Doppelganger's use of the U.S.-based domain names at the direction   and control of, and for the benefit of, sanctioned persons, including   Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, SDA, and Structura, violates the   International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). As a result, the   accompanying payments for Doppelganger's online infrastructure violate   federal money laundering laws. In addition, Doppelganger's publication   of content on cybersquatted domains with names and content that mimic   legitimate media outlets violates federal criminal trademark laws   because those domains feature trademarks registered on the Principal   Register maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
The FBI Philadelphia Field Office is investigating the case.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,   the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control   Section and National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case,   with valuable assistance from the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and   Intellectual Property Section.

On October 7, Hersh Goldberg-Polinâan American citizenâwas taken hostage by Hamas terrorists. He was just 23 years old, attending a music festival with friends. We now know he was murdered by Hamas. His body was recovered today in the tunnels under Rafah, along with five other hostages.
Doug and my prayers are with Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin, Hersh's parents, and with everyone who knew and loved Hersh. When I met with Jon and Rachel earlier this year, I told them: You are not alone. That remains true as they mourn this terrible loss. Americans and people around the world will pray for Jon, Rachel, and their family and send them love and strength. As is said in the Jewish tradition, may Hersh's memory be a blessing.
Hamas is an evil terrorist organization. With these murders, Hamas has even more American blood on its hands. I strongly condemn Hamas' continued brutality, and so must the entire world. From its massacre of 1,200 people to sexual violence, taking of hostages, and these murders, Hamas' depravity is evident and horrifying. The threat Hamas poses to the people of Israelâand American citizens in Israelâmust be eliminated and Hamas cannot control Gaza. The Palestinian people too have suffered under Hamas' rule for nearly two decades.
As Vice President, I have no higher priority than the safety of American citizens, wherever they are in the world. President Biden and I will never waver in our commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza.

Sunday, 01 September 2024 9:57 AM
Israeli forces have destroyed more than half of the streets and essential infrastructure in the occupied northern West Bank city of Jenin during their ongoing offensive, leaving residents in dire conditions, according to the local municipality in Jenin.
Bashir Matahen, Director of Public Relations and Media at the Jenin Municipality, told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA on Saturday that Israeli troops have completely demolished more than 70% of the city's streets to a depth of nearly one to 1.5 meters.
The demolition of roads, Matahen said, has destroyed water and sewage networks, as well as communication and electricity outages in many districts.
He added that water supplies have been cut off for 80% of Jenin and the entire refugee camp due to the destruction of networks and that the technical teams have been unable to reach these networks to redirect them to other areas.
""The municipality teams are unable to access the damaged network areas despite several attempts... They were subjected to gunfire from the occupying (Israeli) forces,"" Matahen noted.
He also pointed out that the Israeli forces ""have burned parts of the central vegetable market in the city, and initial estimates indicate extensive damage.""
""Israeli actions have also led to the destruction of hundreds of houses and vehicles.""
Jenin Government Hospital halts dialysis services amid Israeli aggression
Moreover, the Jenin Government Hospital announced on Sunday the suspension of its dialysis services due to ongoing disruptions in essential supplies caused by the Israeli military offensive in the city.
In a press statement, the hospital explained that it had to take the decision because of a prolonged power outage.
Israeli forces have damaged the electricity supply line to the medical facility, and the backup generators have been running continuously for the past four days.
This came a day after the Israeli military blocked water trucks from reaching the hospital.
According to the Palestinian news agency WAFA, Israeli forces stopped water tankers from the Jenin Civil Defense from reaching the medical center.
Dargham Zakarneh, Director of the Jenin Civil Defense Center, said Israeli soldiers stationed at Jenin Government Hospital's gate blocked the water delivery.
He highlighted that the hospital's kidney dialysis department requires a daily 100 cubic meters of water to operate.
On Wednesday, the Israeli army launched its largest military offensive since 2002 in the cities of Tulkarm and Jenin, as well as in the al-Far'a refugee camp near Tubas, killing 22 Palestinians, according to Palestinian figures.
Since Israel unleashed a war on the besieged Gaza Strip in early October 2023, casualties have been rising in the West Bank as a result of intensified near-daily Israeli raids into villages and cities in the occupied territories.
According to Palestinian health officials, at least 675 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war on Gaza.
At least 40,691 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have also been killed in the Israeli genocidal war against the Gaza Strip during the past 11 months."

The actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk border area have had disastrous consequences for Kiev. Instead of succeeding in breaking through towards the town of Kurchatov, Ukrainian troops have faced a serious crisis in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).
The Russian Defense Ministry has confirmed that fighting in the Kursk region continues. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are attempting to advance towards the settlements of Borki, Maryevka, Kamyshevka, Cherkasskoye Porechnoye, Olgovka, Korenevo, and Martynovka, but the attacks are being repelled.
In particular, on September 1, servicemen of Russia's 810th Marine Brigade destroyed a column of Ukrainian equipment.
At the same time, Kiev's Western sponsors remain skeptical of the Ukrainia operation, which involves several brigades in the region.
""If they are not rotated, these troops will not be able to fill gaps, serve as a reserve, or counter a Russian offensive inside Ukraine. In other words, it weakens an already shaky front,"" a Western media outlet notes. The outlet emphasizes that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are becoming much more exhausted by the operation.
This also affects other parts of the front.
""The situation is catastrophic, the Russian army is advancing faster than in the summer of 2022, and the Ukrainian military is preparing to defend the Dnepr,"" this is how German journalist Julian Roepcke, who recently praised the successes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, assesses the situation.
The reason for the change of mood is the difficult situation for Kiev on several fronts at the same time. The lion's share of attention is now focused on Krasnoarmeysk (Pokrovsk). According to Russia's Defense Ministry, Russian troops have approached a Ukrainian defensive line of four settlements: Dmitrov (Mirnograd), Grodovka, Novogrodovka, and Selidovo. Connected by an extensive network of roads and surrounded by piles of rubble and high-rise buildings, they could long serve as a reliable defense for the district center.
However, there are reports from the Ukrainian side that Russian troops managed to liberate Novogrodovka after just a few days last week. According to Verkhovna Rada lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla, there were fortifications there, but there were no units to defend them.
""The trenches in front of Novogrodovka were empty. There was practically no Ukrainian Army in the town, which once had a population of 20,000: the 31st Brigade was taken away, the brigadier was removed and a criminal case was opened against him,"" she said indignantly.
In particular, the Russian Army has opened up the possibility of an offensive on Selidovo, which is necessary to balance the flanks. Moreover, according to Bezuhla, the Russians have already entered the settlement. But Kiev's problems do not end there.
Russian forces are approaching the Ukrainian defensive bulge towards Nevelskoye from the north, and other Russian units are moving south towards Alexandropol in parallel. Ukrainian troops are actually in a semi-envelope. This is the last area that Ukrainian forces have been attacking Donetsk from since 2014.
Krasnoarmeysk (Pokrovsk), which is less than 10 kilometers from the Russian troops, is one of the most important cities for the Ukrainian forces in the DPR. Its liberation would have a number of consequences: it is, in fact, an exit to the Dnepropetrovsk region; the Krasnoarmeysk-Konstantinovka-Chasov Yar Highway, which supplies the grouping near Chasov Yar, would be cut off. The situation on this part of the front would become extremely difficult for Kiev.
The Ukrainian Armed Forces are facing more and more problems, and any of them could turn into a disaster. The Russian offensive is speeding up, and the main question is whether Kiev has any reserves left to stabilize the situation. The outcome of the whole confrontation may depend on this.

BEIJING, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and Nigerian President Bola Tinubu held talks on Tuesday and announced the elevation of China-Nigeria ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership.
Tinubu is in Beijing for the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and a state visit.
China is further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization, which will bring more opportunities for the development of China-Nigeria relations, Xi said.
The two sides should work together to realize their respective modernization with high-quality cooperation and push China-Nigeria relations for new and greater development, he said.
Xi noted that the two countries should enhance strategic mutual trust, view and develop bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, and firmly support each other on issues of their respective core interests and major concerns.
Xi called for promoting the interconnected and integrated development of infrastructure, energy and mineral resources with industries, and fostering cooperation for new growth in areas such as the digital economy and new energy.
China supports Nigeria in fighting terrorism, maintaining regional stability and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs, Xi said, underscoring the country's willingness to strengthen multilateral coordination with Nigeria to safeguard the interests of developing countries.
Tinubu highlighted the significance of deepening economic cooperation and developing a comprehensive strategic partnership with China, and said Nigeria hopes to become China's largest trade and investment partner in Africa.
Nigeria welcomes more Chinese enterprises to make investments and expand mutually beneficial cooperation in agriculture, manufacturing, mineral resources, energy and infrastructure in a bid to help Nigeria and West Africa achieve modernization and effectively get rid of poverty, he said, adding that Nigeria is willing to provide sound security conditions for this purpose.
After the talks, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents in areas including Belt and Road cooperation, the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, economic development, the application of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, peanut exports to China, and news media.
The two sides released a joint statement on establishing the comprehensive strategic partnership and building a high-level China-Nigeria community with a shared future.
Prior to the talks, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Tinubu at the Great Hall of the People."

Tehran, IRNA -- Palestinian resistance fighters based in the occupied West Bank are using rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) for the first time during their battles with Israeli occupation forces.
Palestinian news agencies, citing Israeli media, reported on Saturday that these weapons are being used by resistance fighters in Jenin, a city in the northern West Bank that has been the scene of fierce clashes in recent days.
Jenin has been a flashpoint area for months now. However, tensions have been escalating since Wednesday (August 28) when Israeli forces launched a large-scale military operation that has also targeted other parts of the West Bank, including the city of Nablus.
Nearly two dozen Palestinians have been killed since then, most of them in Jenin.
Israeli media have described the ongoing operation in the West Bank as the biggest by the regime in the occupied Palestinian territories over the past 22 years.
In the meantime, the Central Command of the Israel Occupation Forces, which is responsible for the units and brigades located in the West Bank, Al-Quds, the Sharon, Gush Dan and the Shephelah, has warned that the situation in the West Bank is about to explode.
The Central Command has also warned that the expansion of the conflict in the West Bank would impose extra burden on Israeli forces.
The warning comes as the Israeli regime is continuing its war in the besieged Gaza Strip where nearly 40,700 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war in early October 2023.

3. 9. 2024  Ministry of Defence
Dr Damir ÄrnÄec, State Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, participated in a plenary discussion titled ""NATO Beyond 75: An Alliance Fit for the Future"" at the Bled Strategic Forum on 3 September. On the occasion NATO's 75th anniversary, which has had several enlargements whilst successfully exercising deterrence, the panellists focused on current security challenges and the way forward.
In addition to Dr Damir ÄrnÄec, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, Alexandre Escorcia from the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, Angus Lapsley from NATO, Italian academic Valerio de Luca, MevlÃ¼t ÃavuÅoÄlu, Head of the Turkish Delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and Philip Reeker and Robin Quinville from the US Wilson Centre, took part in the debate on what kind of alliance is appropriate for the future. Participants exchanged thoughts on the future of the transatlantic security architecture after the Washington Summit and NATO's priorities for Europe's long-term security, including NATO's role in responding to immediate threats to European security, building long-term capabilities, as well as the impact of developments in other parts of the world on the Alliance and Europe.
When asked about the construction of a European pillar within NATO and the level of defence spending by the Member States, State Secretary at the Ministry of Defence Dr Damir ÄrnÄec said that in Slovenia we perceive NATO as a guarantee of security and, like the European Union, a success story. NATO and the EU, he said, are two sides of the same coin. Shortly before NATO's 75th anniversary, Slovenia celebrated 20 years of membership in the Alliance, which we voted for in a referendum. Dr ÄrnÄec believes that support for NATO among the Slovenian public remains at the level of two decades ago, and that we have been actively contributing to security in the Western Balkans and in operations and missions around the world throughout this time. He stressed that NATO's presence in Kosovo remains a key guarantee of stability. However, Slovenian policy has so far failed to deliver on its own commitment to reach 2% of gross domestic product for defence. He pointed out that in the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia adopted this year, we have set a target of achieving this goal by 2030, and we are committed to doing so with all seriousness. Not because others tell us to, but because we are aware of the importance of security for society as a whole and because we want to be active in ensuring security in the international community
Regarding capacity building, Dr ÄrnÄec said that every war throughout history has been different, but the war in Ukraine has clearly demonstrated the importance of increasing defence capabilities and the capacity of the defence industry. He also stressed the importance of public awareness and support for security investments as a cornerstone of the functioning of society. On the issue of strengthening the European pillar of the Alliance, Dr ÄrnÄec said that NATO must work towards unity and cooperation with the EU, which should continue the plans and work it has started in the area of strengthening defence preparedness.
The 19th International Conference of the Bled Strategic Forum, which concluded yesterday under the title ""A World of Parallel Realities"", brought together a total of 32 debates with more than 180 speakers from 48 different countries, including more than 15 Presidents of states, Government and Ministers, as well as many high-level representatives of international organisations and civil society, decision-makers, academics and business leaders."

By Taejun Kang for RFA 2024.09.02 -- U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump defended his relationship with North Korea by saying that ""getting along"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a ""good thing.""
Trump's remarks came after his Democratic rival Kamala Harris vowed not to ""cozy up to"" dictators like Kim.
""I got along with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. Remember I walked over ... the first person to ever walk over from this country,"" Trump said, during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, apparently referring to his visit to the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom in June 2019, where he briefly crossed the Military Demarcation Line into the North.
Trump spearheaded an unprecedented diplomatic push on North Korea when he was president in an effort to get it to abandon its nuclear and missile programs.
He met Kim three times but the effort brought no tangible progress and North Korea has been relentlessly building up its nuclear arsenal and developing the missiles with which to carry the bombs ever since.
""We also looked at his nuclear capability. It's very substantial ... You know, getting along is a good thing. It's not a bad thing,"" Trump added.
In her nomination acceptance speech in Chicago in August, Harris took aim at Trump who has long boasted about his personal ties with Kim, saying that she will not ""cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.""
""They know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself,"" she said at that time.
The two candidates' remarks suggest their different visions for diplomacy toward North Korea, although there is an absence of references to the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in the policy platforms of both the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties as they prepare for November's presidential election.
But U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said last week he reaffirmed a U.S. commitment to the ""complete"" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in talks with top Chinese officials.

AOEQGTASV5_Y56CC1MUQJO80FL,Thousands more children protected on day 2 of Gaza polio campaign,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240902-unnews01.htm,"By Daniel Johnson and Alpha Diallo  2 September 2024 - The UN-led mass polio vaccination campaign entered its second day in central Gaza on Monday with pauses in fighting holding sufficiently for thousands more children to receive their dose, in addition to the 87,000 who received their first round on Sunday, UN agencies said.
""There were 87,000 vaccinated on the first day out of 156,000 that we are hoping to reach in the Middle Area,"" said Louise Wateridge, Senior Communications Officer for UNWRA, the largest UN agency in the Gaza Strip. ""It's very promising that already, we have heard interest from parents who have come from Khan Younis, who have come from the southern area, and are asking our staff there and asking our teams, 'When is the vaccination going to be available for us? When can we take our children?'""
Ms. Wateridge emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire for the inoculation campaign to be successful, along with the release of all hostages taken during Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on 7 October. ""What these children need most is a ceasefire now,"" UNRWA said on X.
Speaking on day two of the vaccination drive, Ms. Wateridge reported seeing ""hundreds of children"" at a health centre in Deir Al-Balah and more at an UNWRA school in the central city. ""The school reported that 3,000 children were vaccinated yesterday alone, so you know we're seeing very good numbers and [need] to keep the momentum going,""
On Sunday, vaccination teams operated at UNRWA health centres, mobile medical points, and tents, with similar arrangements in place for Monday. ""We are doing everything possible to ensure that all children under the age of 10 are vaccinated. Temporary pauses in the conflict are essential for delivering these vaccines,"" UNRWA added on X. ""Beyond the pause, these children need a vaccine that has already been delayed for too long.""
Too dangerous to move
The initial three-day campaign in Gaza's Middle Area to protect around 640,000 Palestinian youngsters from the highly infectious disease comes after health authorities detected the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years. To offer maximum protection, children will need to receive two doses of the vaccine at a four-week interval. More than 1.2 million vaccine doses have been delivered to Gaza, with an additional 400,000 doses expected soon.
UN agencies UNRWA, the UN World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Palestinian health authorities aim to achieve at least 90 per cent vaccination coverage in each round of the campaign to curb the current outbreak and prevent the international spread of polio.
Amid outbreaks of hepatitis, diarrhoea and other preventable diseases linked to 10 months of heavy Israeli bombardment and clashes with Hamas militants, UN agencies underscored the need to for all warring sides to maintain the agreed eight-hour pause in hostilities. ""One of the biggest challenges is actually safely distributing the vaccinations because we have some areas in these so-called [humanitarian] pause zones between 6am and 2pm, there needs to be no fighting,"" UNRWA's Ms. Wateridge told UN News. ""We are still struggling to get access to facilities and access to families and children in those areas. It's far too dangerous for them to travel, to move; there is ongoing fighting.""
Ms. Wateridge reported ""a lot of strikes"" on Monday morning and through the night on Sunday. ""So the fighting has not stopped by any means. There are some pauses throughout the day, but it's not guaranteed. We don't have guaranteed safety to people, and we really need that to reach all the children to get that 90 per cent success rate.""
Best vaccine is peace: Tedros
Last week, Israeli authorities agreed to a series of three-day ""humanitarian pauses"" in central, southern, and northern Gaza, allowing the vaccination campaign to proceed. The UN health agency WHO welcomed these pauses but reiterated that ultimately, ""the only solution"" to safeguard the health of Gaza's children was a ceasefire. ""The best vaccine for these children is peace,"", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The vaccination drive faces significant challenges, including ongoing fighting, devastated roads, and hospital closures caused by the conflict. According to the WHO, insecurity, damaged infrastructure, and population movements make it unlikely that three days in each area will be sufficient for adequate coverage. ""It has been agreed that the vaccination period will be extended by a day if necessary,"" the WHO noted, stressing that vaccination teams must be protected and allowed to conduct their work safely.
The campaign comes amid a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the conflict between Israel and Hamas, coupled with Israel's blockade of the enclave, has led to acute shortages of food, drinking water, and medical supplies. The worsening situation has raised fears of further disease outbreaks, not limited to polio. ""Today, children in Gaza are receiving the vaccines they so desperately need,"" said WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on X. ""Ultimately, the best vaccine for these children is peace.""
Latest UN data indicates that approximately 90 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been displaced within the besieged territory, with hundreds of thousands crowded into overcrowded tent camps. Some enjoyed rare respite from intense fighting that has devastated much of the Gaza Strip.
""The one thing I noticed yesterday was, you know, going an hour without hearing a bomb,"" UNRWA's Ms. Wateridge said. ""Going an hour without hearing a strike...it was noticeable that there was a calmer and quieter day yesterday because it has been so relentless for the last few weeks and also so many evacuation orders; 16 evacuation orders in August alone. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people and families and being forced to flee."""

Sunday, 01 September 2024 7:18 PM
Russia has decided to shift its nuclear doctrine in response to the West's ""escalation course"" in the Ukraine conflict.
Russian TASS state news agency cited Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying on Sunday that Moscow had decided to revise its nuclear doctrine to reach a new balance in line with the escalation course adopted by the West.
""The work is at an advanced stage, and there is a clear intent to make corrections"", Ryabkov was cited as saying by TASS.
Ryabkov pointed out that Russia's decision on the matter is ""connected with the escalation course of our Western adversaries"" in connection with their proxy war using Ukrainian forces against Russian troops.
He did not specify what the new changes in mind for Russia's new nuclear doctrine would include. Ryabkov's comments came after in the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) members, they reaffirmed their commitment to stepping up their military aid to Ukraine.
The NATO meeting was arranged at Kiev's request last week. NATO countries' ambassadors met with Ukrainian officials.
NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg emphasized in an official statement from the meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, ""We must continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment and munitions it needs to defend itself against Russia's invasion. This is vital for Ukraine's ability to stay in the fight.""
In response to Kiev's insistence on using warplanes, weapons and ammunition provided to the former Soviet Republic by the West to strike targets deep inside Russia, several NATO member states agreed to lift the restrictions placed on Kiev in using the long-range military hardware supplied by Western allies, especially the missiles.
Meantime, the present nuclear doctrine for Russia, which was approved in 2020 by President Vladimir Putin, specifies that Russian forces may use nuclear weapons in response to an enemy nuclear attack, or a conventional attack that threatened Russia's sovereignty.
Russia, which sees the West's full out support for Kiev as a proxy war by the Western countries against the Russian nation, has repeatedly warned of Moscow's intention to make changes and upgrade its nuclear deterrence forces to balance the new status quo.
Ryabkov's comments were the most categorical statement on Russia's plan to proceed with a new nuclear doctrine to date.
Russia's message to the US-led NATO bloc has been clear till now: ""Refrain from providing excessive military aid to Ukraine, lest you risk provoking a confrontation with Russia that could rapidly turn into a nuclear conflict.""
Moscow launched its special military operation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, planning to liberate the Donbas region where the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk had been living under regular attacks staged by the forces loyal to the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev.
In the past two-and-a-half years since Russia's launched its campaign, the US-led NATO Western allies have provided Kiev with a huge and steady flow of weapons and ammo, pouring fuel on the fire in Ukraine and turning the conflict into a full-fledged war between the two neighboring countries, leaving heavy casualties on both sides."

Moscow, IRNA -- The Russian Foreign Minister said that Moscow and Tehran will complete the work on the preparation of the comprehensive cooperation agreement in the very near future.
""In the very near future we will conclude a new interstate comprehensive partnership agreement between Russia and Iran. And this will be a symbolic step in our relations with the new Iranian leadership,"" the Russian media Tass  quoted Sergei Lavrov as saying.
Moscow has no doubt that the statements of the new Iranian president and the new foreign minister about the continuity in relations with Russia ""reflect the sincere intention and attitude of the new Iranian leadership"", he added.
""I believe that the figures characterizing the growth of trade turnover and the volume of investments speak for themselves. These figures are constantly increasing, so we have a bright future,"" he stated.
Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali had earlier told IRNA that over the last two and a half years, a lot of efforts were made to finalize this agreement and many visits were made between Iranian and Russian officials.
Now ""we are waiting for both sides"" to complete the protocol issues and in the next step, foreign ministers should sign it, he added.
The fact that the agreement will be signed by the presidents of Iran and the Russian Federation in Kazan and on the sidelines of the BRICS summit depends on the completion of the protocol processes, he noted.

Tehran, IRNA -- The Zionist regime's warplanes have bombed several residential areas of southern Lebanon, media sources reported on Wednesday morning.
According to IRNA, quoting Al-Manar website, the Israeli attacks targeted the Al-Khayam neighborhood, Kfar Shoba, Aita Sha'ab and the forest area between Yatr and Zabqin.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the attacks which came hours after Lebanon's Hezbollah resistance movement announced launching fresh attacks on four Zionist bases in the occupied territories.
Since the onset of Israel's genocidal war on Gaza, Hezbollah and the Zionist regime are engaged in exchange of fire almost on a daily basis.
Hezbollah largely targets military bases and equipment such as tanks, personnel carriers and armored vehicles as well as espionage installation of the Zionist regime. A large number of Zionist soldiers have been killed or injured in such operations since October last year.
The Israeli military on the other hand hit residential areas of southern Lebanon that results in civilian casualties.

Tehran, IRNA -- Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, says no agreement is possible for a ceasefire in Gaza without the Israeli regime's withdrawal from Philadelphi, Netzarim, and Rafah corridors.
The Zionist regime aims to set the whole region on fire, al-Hayya told Al Jazeera on Monday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deems Philadelphi corridor more important than Israeli captives, he said.
The corridor is his top priority as he considers the captives worthless, the high-ranking Hamas official added.
Netanyahu has rejected any proposals on the daily exchange of captives, al-Hayya asserted.
We had accepted the proposal put forward by US President Joe Biden, however, Netanyahu set fresh conditions and accused Hamas of paying no attention to the negotiations under the new conditions, the Hamas official further said.
His comments come as diplomatic efforts, ongoing over the past months, have failed to lead to a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of around 100 captives still held in the Palestinian territory.
Netanyahu is also facing mounting criticism from Israeli officials and the public over his refusal to accept a truce deal. He has recently set a new condition for a deal, saying that Israel should maintain its control of Philadelphi corridor, which is a 14-kilometer area along Gaza-Egypt border.

Events and Speeches  The 37th Government  04.09.2024
Yesterday, I visited in Ashkelon the family of one of the hostages murdered in cold blood. A day earlier, I spoke to several of the families of these murdered hostages. It tears your heart out. I said to them that I'm sorry. I apologized that we, we didn't get them out. We worked so hard to get them. We were close. But we didn't. And they changed the torment of families worried about their loved ones to families grieving for their fallen beloved. That sentiment I know because I belong to that family. But it's a horror.
We also lost brave policemen and brave soldiers who were fighting in the Gaza front and I embraced their families as well. All our people do.  On October 7th, we experienced the worst savagery in this century. On October 7th, we experienced the worst savagery meted on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. These Savages massacred our people. 1,200 civilians. They beheaded our men. They raped our women and then murdered them. They burnt babies alive. They took 255 of our people hostages to their underground dungeons. That's a horror that the world saw and responded to initially.
It's important that we remember it. But we were given a reminder. A terrible reminder. Last week, when these savages murdered six of our hostages in cold blood. They riddled them with bullets. Then they shot each of them in the head. Some of them several times.
And these are the savages, these are the terrorists that Iran implanted next to our border as elsewhere. And we're committed to defeating them, to extirpating this evil from our midst. I want to talk to you today about some of the things that we must do to achieve that goal, including the questions of the Philadelphi Corridor.
But before I do that, I want to give your readers and viewers some context because often you see maps of Israel. You think it's a Goliath.
Well, I'd like to give you first an overview of where Israel is.
This is the Middle East, and this is the entire Arab world, and this is Israel. It's one of the world's tiniest countries. I give it the, you know, the thumb test. This is a big one, so you need a bigger thumb. But it's a tiny country. It's one of the tiniest countries on the planet. It's, I think one tenth of one percent of the territory of the Arab world, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's two tenths of one percent.
It goes from the river. The river is right here. That's the Jordan River. To the sea, the Mediterranean Sea. So, when Hamas is talking about liberating Palestine from the river to the sea, basically, what they're saying is destroying Israel.  And the entire width of this, it's probably around the width of the Washington Beltway, it's all together in its widest point is about 50 miles. Right here. Tiny.   And here's Gaza there. This is the red thing that you see here. That's Gaza. Now I want to zoom in. When I zoom in, remember how tiny this is. Remember the distances here.
Now, take a look. Here it is enlarged. This is Israel. This is the Mediterranean Sea. The Jordan River is right here.
This is Egypt and the Sinai desert. Now, look at Gaza. Where is Gaza? Gaza is implanted in this tiny country 30 miles from Tel Aviv, 40 miles from our capital Jerusalem, 30 miles from Beer-Sheva. These are three of Israel's largest cities. Gaza is within spitting distance to them.   Israel, up to the disengagement agreement of 2005, Israel controlled this border under an agreement with Egypt after the Camp David Peace Accords. We controlled this part, which is called the Philadelphi Corridor, I'll talk about that in a minute, right down to Eilat in the Red Sea. This was our border. And while there was, umm, I would say a minimal amount of terrorism, that wasn't, we didn't really face a big problem.
Let's zoom in on that a bit more. Here's Gaza Strip enlarged. Again, this is the situation in Gaza before the disengagement of 2005. And the Gaza Strip is firmly under Israeli control. We control the maritime border. You can't smuggle in weapons. They tried but we stopped it. You control the land border. And you control this border between the Sinai desert, Egypt and Gaza. The Gaza Strip, it's controlled. This is the Philadelphi Corridor. This is the Rafah Crossing. Controlled by the IDF.
Now look at the distances from Gaza. It's four miles to another city in Israel called Ashkelon, where I visited that bereaved family yesterday. It's a population of 170,000 people. They are four miles away. But some of our communities like kibbutz Be'eri, which was one of the hardest hit, is one mile away from Gaza. Kfar Aza is less than one mile away. It's literally walking distance. Okay.   And so, as long as we controlled this, these communities, sometimes they were harassed by this rocket or that rocket but it was marginal. We controlled the security situation. But something happened in 2005. Israel unilaterally disengaged from Gaza. It just went out. It took out everything. It took out the army. It stripped, uprooted communities, took out 10,000 people.   The army left the Philadelphi Corridor. Here's what happened.   This is Gaza after the disengagement. And Hamas now has a weapon smuggling operation nurtured by Iran, financed by Iran, supplied by Iran, delivered by Iran.
And here's what happened. That Philadelphi Corridor became completely porous. The other borders controlled by us. But once this was perforated, even though the policy of Egypt was to prevent it, you know, it didn't necessarily work, it didn't, it didn't succeed. And this border once we left our side of the Philadelphi Corridor, rockets went in, missiles went in, drones went in, ammo went in, weapons manufacturing equipment came in, tunnel drilling equipment came in.   Once we got out, once we left the Philadelphi Corridor, Iran could carry out its plan to turn Gaza into a base, a terrorist enclave that would endanger not only the communities around it but would endanger Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Beer-Sheva, the entire country of Israel. It became a huge terrorist base because we left that Corridor.
So, we vowed, or I would say, all this, you have to understand that the centrality, the centrality of the Philadelphi Corridor to the arming of Gaza, to the arming of Hamas and this all led to the October 7th massacre, which Hamas has vowed, proudly vowed to do again and again and again.
We vowed that they won't be able to do it. So we said, as far as Gaza is concerned, three war goals: The first war goal was to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages. And the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.
And all three of those goals, all three of them go through Israel's control of the Philadelphi Corridor. And it's obvious why. You want to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities - You can't let Hamas rearm. It's obvious. So you have to control the corridor. You can't let them have...by the way, it's not only to prevent them from terrorizing us, attacking us, it's also to prevent Hamas or any other terrorist organization from terrorizing the people of Gaza.
Gaza cannot have a future if Gaza remains porous and you can enable rearmament of terrorists through the Philadelphi Corridor.
The second thing is to release the hostages. First of all, you can't prevent, if you leave this Corridor, you can't prevent Hamas from, not only, not smuggling weapons in, you can't prevent them from not smuggling terrorists, hostages out. It's walking distance, nothing. They can easily smuggle hostages out here to the Sinai desert in Egypt, they disappear. It's crossing distance. The distance is nothing, it's meters, meters away.   They cross the, the barrier above ground. They don't even have to go underground. They disappear in the Sinai and then they end up in Iran or in Yemen. They're gone forever.
And you need something to squeeze them, to prevent them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages. So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi Corridor. And the third reason, the third goal of ensuring that we prevent Gaza from being again a threat to Israel. It's clear. Gaza must be demilitarized. And it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control and is not a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment.
I think that's clear to most Israelis, to all Israelis. But a question has arisen: that may be the case, but why don't you leave Gaza for 42 days, you could come back. Well, aside from what I said that they could smuggle the terrorists out... I want to show you what they've got under Gaza. I didn't show you that. So I want to show you that.
This is what they have under the Philadelphi Corridor. Just so you understand the supply lines we're talking about. This is one of the tunnels there. Look at the engineering, look at the investment here, look at what they've got. We've got dozens of such tunnels, dozens of such tunnels, underneath the Philadelphi Corridor. To give you an impression of the size of these things: This is a soldier. This is a tunnel. You could drive a truck through this. Indeed, you could. Here's a truck, or it's a Humvee. This is a huge, huge problem.
Now, you're just going to walk away? It's obvious we have to control it, right? I think, once you see this, you understand that? But then the next question is, okay, you leave and you come back. That's what they tell us. Okay. We'll have complete international legitimacy to come back. Sorry, we've gone down that route. We were down that route when we left Lebanon, and people said you can leave Lebanon and you can come back. The first time they fire a rocket you can come back, the world will support you. It didn't. And we've been out of Lebanon for 24 years.   They said the same thing when we left Gaza in the disengagement. They said, you can leave, and the first rocket... I remember, Prime Minister Sharon said this to me. The first rocket above ground or below ground, we'll be able to go back in. It's been 20 years and we haven't gone back in. Because you all know and understand that the international community, including friendly countries, under enormous domestic pressure because of the propaganda that's leveled against Israel and against them, there'll be enormous, international pressure not to come back. What is their message? End the war. End the war. And so, when we want to come back and resume, we'll pay an exorbitant price in many fields, including in the lives of our men.
To come back? It's not a just a military question. It's a military, political, strategic question. And we make that decision. We're not going to leave. 42 days? We're there. I don't want to leave in order to come back in, when I know that we didn't come back in. And it's not going to take another 24 years to come back in. And God knows what price we'll have? How many more massacres? How many more kidnappings? How many more hostages? How many more rapes? It's not going to happen.
So, people said, yeah, but if you stay, this will kill the deal. And I say, such a deal will kill us. And there won't be a deal that way. This is a false narrative. I'm willing to make a deal. I made one already, one that brought back 150 hostages, 117 alive. And I'm committed to return the remaining 101. I'll do everything I can to get them in.
But leaving Philadelphi does not advance the release of the hostages, because the deal cannot be advanced. They'll give you a minor part if they give anything, and keep the rest. Go and argue... You know when they started giving us hostages? When we went into Philadelphi. When we went into Rafah. When we controlled the Rafah Crossing. That's when they felt the pressure. As long as they didn't feel the pressure, they wouldn't do it. The first batch, the first deal that we got, was a result of our invasion, the military pressure we put in. They gave us the hostages. After that, they thought, well, you know, we'll have the international pressure turn on Israel so we won't have to do, we won't have to make any concessions. But after Rafah, their tune changed, and they began to change. If we leave Rafah, if we leave the Philadelphi Corridor, there won't be any pressure. We won't get the hostages.
I said I'm willing to make a deal. The real obstacle to making a deal is not Israel and it's not me. It Hamas. It's Sinwar. On April 27th, I put forward a proposal by Israel, which Secretary Blinken called extremely generous. On May 31st, having met Blinken again, I said, we agreed to the US-backed proposal, and Hamas refused. On August 16th, the US brought forth what they called the final bridging proposal. Again, we accepted, Hamas refused. On August 19th, Secretary Blinken said, Israel accepted the US proposal, now Hamas has to do the same. On August 28thâthat's a week agoâthe deputy CIA director said Israel showed seriousness in the negotiations, now Hamas must make the deal. This was last week. So, I ask you, what has changed. What has changed in this week? What's changed is that they murdered six of our hostages in cold blood.
Now, the world will seriously demand that Israel make concessions after this massacre? What message does this send to Hamas? I'll tell you what the message is. Murder more hostages, you'll get more concessions. That's not only illogical, it's not only immoral, it's downright insane. So, it's not going to happen. We have red lines before the murder. They haven't changed. We'll hold to them. But we also had flexibility. And I'll tell you one thing, Hamas will pay for this. That you can be assured. We'll make sure that we extract that price from them. But we are firm on our red lines, including the Philadelphi Corridor, for the reasons I described here. I'm flexible where I can be. I'm firm when I have to be.
I think there is a possibility of getting this deal if we stick to this strategy. I said before, we got 150 hostages out because we combined a firm stance with military pressure. And I said that Hamas after that relied on international pressure, but it had weakened. And then we went into Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor, so it got strengthened, and they were beginning to balk. A condition that they said they'd never accept, a red line, is that we must commit to getting out of Gaza and enabling Hamas basically to take over Gaza again. End the war, get out, let them retake Gaza. That's obviously something we couldn't do.
They said there'll never be a deal. Well, they started caving in there after we took the Philadelphi Corridor. And then they started backing off. You know why they waited? Why they started backing off? Because they waited for Iran to start a general war with Israel. That didn't happen. So then they waited for Hezbollah to start a general war with Israel. That didn't happen either. So now they resort to the final tactic. They're going to sow discord and create international pressure, again using the hostages, even after the murder. And this is something that's not new because they started this a year ago.
You should see this. I mean, this is their tactic. This is Hamas orders for psychological warfare, found in Hamas underground command post on January 29th, that's right after the beginning of the war, 2024. And this is the original document in Arabic. Our soldiers found it.
And here's what it says: Push photos and videos of hostages. Put it out in the media, because that creates enormous psychological pressure. Who's not affected by it? Any human being seeing these souls, these girls, these people, young people from those dungeons, you're affected by. Second: Increase psychological pressure on defense minister. Third: Continue blaming Netanyahu. And fourth: Claim ground operation will not release hostages.
That's Hamas', it's not only their talking points, it's their strategy. And their idea is this will sow internal discord and increase international pressure on Israel. That's what they hope to achieve. And they hope, they think this will happen. Well, it won't happen. I can tell you why it won't happen. I'll tell you why they'll fail. Because overwhelmingly the people of Israel are united. They understand everything that I said here. Overwhelmingly. You should know that. It's important. And the second thing is, we're committed to achieving our goalsâall three goals: Destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities, releasing all our hostages, and ensuring that Gaza does not become a threat to Israel anymore. And all these require standing firm on the things that will ensure the achievement of these goals. And with God help, and with our people's will, and with the courage of our soldiers, we will achieve all goals""."
B62O32J4IB_LZQEXAWYEI5JDB1,"Russian Air Strikes Kill At Least 7 In Ukraine, As Poltava Disaster Scrutinized",_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240904-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service September 04, 2024
A Russian drone and missile attack killed seven people in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, one day after a strike on a military facility killed more than 50 people in the eastern city of Poltava in one of the worst air strikes of the war, leaving residents in shock over the loss of life and scale of destruction.
The missile and drone attacks on Lviv, Kyiv, and other cities began shortly after midnight and continued into the predawn hours on September 4. Among the seven dead were four members of one family in Lviv. A man identified by Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoviy as Yaroslav Bazylevych was left as the only survivor in his family after his wife and three daughters were killed.
A photo shared on social media showed all five posing together with one of the daughters holding a bouquet of sunflowers.
""His wife Yevhenia and their three daughters -- Yaryna, 21, Daryna, 18, and Emilia, 7 -- were killed in their own home"" Sadoviy said. ""I don't know what words to say to support Yaroslav -- the father. Today we are all with you.""
According to authorities and eyewitnesses, there were two heavy strikes that destroyed or damaged residential buildings, cultural monuments, and educational institutions in Lviv.
Ukrainian officials also warned of emergency power outages due to the attack. In a statement on Telegram, the ministry did not detail the damage at six energy facilities but said there were ongoing risks to energy supplies as the government reduced output at a southern nuclear power plant.
The barrage followed one of the deadliest attacks in a single strike when at least 53 people were killed and 271 injured by Russian ballistic missiles at a military facility in the city of Poltava in central Ukraine, according to the State Emergency Service.
More than 60 of the people injured were in serious condition, the regional military administration said. Regional Governor Philip Pronin declared a three-day mourning period starting September 4.
The director of the Energy Research Center, Oleksandr Kharchenko, said a power unit at the South Ukraine (Pivdennoukrayinsk) nuclear power plant had added two more periodic shutdowns on September 4.
He said that ""high-voltage networks are being restored"" by state operator Enerhoatom but warned against exceedingly optimistic predictions for continuing repairs.
The further concerns about energy supplies come as a UN nuclear team led by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi is visiting the Russian-occupied Ukrainian nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhya to ""continue our assistance & help prevent a nuclear accident.""
Grossi met with senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv on September 3 before saying he was setting out for Zaporizhzhya, which is near an area of near-constant shelling.
Russian forces have waged an intense bombardment campaign on Ukrainian power infrastructure throughout the 36-month-old invasion but particularly over the past six months.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said that Ukraine was already seeing Moscow's response to Kyiv's attacks in an apparent reference to Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region, which began a month ago, and frequent shelling and drone attacks on Russia's Belgorod region.
Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on September 4 that three people had been killed by shelling in the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka .
The September 3 attack by Russia on Poltava sparked fresh pleas by Kyiv for Western partners to allow long-range strikes into Russia and a strong condemnation of Russia's ""deplorable attack"" by U.S. President Joe Biden.
In Kryviy Rih, local politician Oleksandr Vilkul said five people were hurt but none seriously when a rocket hit a civilian infrastructure facility in the center of the city. He said at least 10 high-rise buildings including a hotel were damaged.
Ukrainian officials also said objects in the Black Sea were targeted by Russian fire including Snake Island, a strategically located piece of land that Ukrainian forces retook in the initial days of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are grappling with fallout from the dual Russian strike on the Military Communications Institute in the city of Poltava.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Prosecutor-General's Office announced separately that investigations were being launched into the circumstances of the incident.
Criticism emerged soon after the blast as reports suggested that cadets were gathered in large numbers for an outdoor graduation or other ceremony, providing an opportunity for Russia's military to target them.
The attack is believed to be the deadliest single attack since May 2022, when Zelenskiy said 87 soldiers were killed at a military training center in the northern Chernihiv region.
Vladyslav Seleznev, a Ukrainian military analyst and former spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian military, said the Kremlin was to blame but there must also be a clear understanding of Kyiv's responsibility.
Zelenskiy again urged Ukraine's supporters to step up the supply of air-defense systems and long-range missiles that can ""defend against Russian terror,"" he said. ""Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lives lost.""
U.S. President Biden called the Russian missile attack on the Poltava facility ""deplorable"" and pledged more military aid to Kyiv.
""I condemn this deplorable attack in the strongest possible terms,"" Biden said, adding that further aid to Ukraine would include ""providing the air defense systems and capabilities they need to protect their country.""

2 September 2024
With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on the Middle East.
On taking office, in July, I told this House...
...that this government's priority in the region would be to advance the cause of peace.
This continues to be our mission, on every front.
In Israel, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in the Red Sea, and of course in Gaza, where we need an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians, the immediate release of all hostages, and more aid getting into Gaza.
Over the summer, we were faced with the prospect of full-scale war breaking out between Lebanese Hizballah and Israel.
On each of the three visits I have made to the region...
...including alongside my Right Honourable Friend the Defence Secretary,...
...and my most recent joint visit with the French Foreign Minister...
...I have urged Lebanese Hizballah, the Lebanese government, and Israel to engage with the US-led discussions to resolve their disagreements diplomatically...
...and to reach a peaceful solution through the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701.
As we continue to work with our allies and partners to push for a diplomatic solution...
...we nonetheless stand ready for the worst-case scenario...
...including the potential evacuation of British nationals.
And our message to those still in Lebanon remains clear: leave now.
Mr Speaker, our common goal of peace in the Middle East...
...will never be lasting until there is safety, security, and sovereignty for both Israel and a Palestinian state.
We must all keep at the forefront of our minds...
...the pain, anguish, and horror this conflict has caused for so many ordinary civilians.
The victims of the October the seventh atrocity...
...the hostages -
...and all those still enduring unimaginable suffering,...
...whether they are hoping to see their loved ones again,...
...or mourning their loss,...
...as the tragic events of this weekend illustrate,...
...as the bodies of six murdered hostages were recovered.
The Israeli people...
...still living under rocket fire not only from Hamas...
...but from other hostile actors...
... explicitly dedicated to Israel's annihilation,...
...fighting an enemy in Hamas whose appalling tactics endanger countless civilian lives.
And the innocent Palestinians, tens of thousands killed in the fighting -
...their numbers growing by the day,...
...including distressing numbers of women and children,...
...many mothers so malnourished they cannot produce milk for their babies,...
...families struggling to keep their children alive,...
...disease and famine looming ever larger.
Heroic humanitarians putting their lives on the line to help others,...
...like the brave aid workers I met from United Nations agencies,...
...and from the Palestine Red Crescent Society warehouse I visited alongside France's Foreign Minister last month.
Indeed, last Thursday, the UK led a session at the UN Security Council,...
...encouraging a continued global focus on the protection of civilians in Gaza, including the need for action on polio.
And now, deeply worrying escalation in the West Bank as well as in Gaza...
...with many communities facing rising settler violence...
...amid an ongoing occupation.
And so many on either side of this terrible conflict...
...convinced that the world does not grasp the reality of Israel's predicament or the depth of Palestinian suffering.
Throughout my life, I have been a friend of Israel...
...a liberal, progressive Zionist,...
...who believes in Israel as a democratic state and homeland for the Jewish people...
...which has both the right to exist and defend itself...
...but I believe also that Israel will only exist in safety and security...
...if there is a two-state solution that guarantees the rights of all Israel's Israeli citizens and of their Palestinian neighbours...
...who have their own inalienable right to self-determination and security.
Mr Speaker, as concern at the horrifying scenes in Gaza has risen...
...many in this House...
...as well as esteemed lawyers and international organisations...
...have raised British arms export licensing to Israel.
After raising my own concerns from opposition,...
...on taking office, I immediately sought an up-to-date the review.
And on my first appearance as Foreign Secretary in this House...
...I committed to sharing the review's conclusions.
We have rigorously followed every stage of the process which the previous Conservative government established.
Let me first be clear on this Review's scope.
This Government is not an international court.
We have not - and could not - arbitrate on whether or not Israel has breached international humanitarian law.
This is a forward-looking evaluation, not a determination of innocence or guilt.
And it does not prejudge any future determinations by the competent courts.
But facing a conflict such as this, it is this Government's legal duty to review export licences.
Criterion 2C of the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria states...
...that the Government will ""not issue export licences if there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law"".
It is with regret that I inform the House today,...
...the assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain UK arms exports to Israel...
...there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.
I have informed my Right Honourable Friend, the Business and Trade Secretary.
And he is therefore today announcing the suspension of around 30, from a total of approximately 350 to Israel, as required under the Export Controls Act.
These include equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza,...
...such as important components which go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items which facilitate ground targeting.
And For transparency, this government is publishing a summary of our assessment.
Today, I want to underline four points about these decisions.
First, Israel's actions in Gaza continue to lead to immense loss of civilian life, widespread destruction to civilian infrastructure, and immense suffering.
In many cases, it has not been possible to reach a determinative conclusion on allegations regarding Israel's conduct of hostilities,...
...in part, because there is insufficient information either from Israel,...
...or other reliable sources to verify such claims.
Nevertheless, it is the assessment of His Majesty's Government,...
...that Israel could reasonably do much more to ensure lifesaving food and medical supplies reach civilians in Gaza -
in light of the appalling humanitarian situation.
And this government is also deeply concerned by credible claims of mistreatment of detainees...
...which the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot investigate after being denied access to places of detention.
Both my predecessor and all our major allies have repeatedly and forcefully raised these concerns with the Israeli government.
Regrettably, they have not been addressed satisfactorily.
Second, there can be no doubt that Hamas pays not the slightest heed to international humanitarian law...
...and endangers civilians by embedding itself in the tightly concentrated civilian population and in civilian infrastructure.
There is no equivalence between Hamas terrorists and Israel's democratic government - or indeed, Iran and their partners and proxies.
But to licence arms exports to Israel, we must assess their compliance with international humanitarian law,...
...notwithstanding the abhorrence of their opponents' tactics and ideology.
Third, this is not a blanket ban. This is not an arms embargo.
It targets around 30 approximately of 350 licenses to Israel in total for items which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza.
The rest will continue.
Neither will the action we are taking have a material impact on Israel's security.
This suspension only covers items which might be used in the current conflict.
There are a number of export licences which we have assessed are not for military use in the current conflict and therefore do not require suspension.
These include items that are not being used by the Israel Defence Forces in the current conflict, such as trainee aircraft or other naval equipment.
These also include export licences for civilian use - covering a range of products such as food-testing chemicals, telecoms, and data equipment.
Nor will it prejudge the international collaboration, global F-35 programme that supplies aircraft for more than twenty countries -
and that is crucial to wider peace and security.
Indeed, the effects of suspending all licences for the F-35 programme would undermine the global F35 supply chain that is vital for the security of the UK, our allies, and NATO.
Therefore, the Business and Trade Secretary has exempted these licences from his decision.
Fourth, the Government will keep our position under review.
Commitment to comply with international humanitarian law is not the only criterion in making export licensing decisions.
We will continue to work with our allies to improve the situation.
And foreign policy of course involves tough choices.
But I will always seek to take such decisions in line with our principles -
and I will keep this the House updated, in line with my previous commitment.
Mr Speaker, we do not take this decision lightly, but we note that on previous occasions Ministers from all sides of this House...
...Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat...
...chose not to licence exports to Israel.
In 1982, Margaret Thatcher imposed an arms embargo and oil embargo on Israel as they fought in Lebanon.
Conflicts in Gaza prompted Gordon Brown to suspend five licences in 2009 ...
...and Vince Cable chose not to issue new licences while conducting a review in 2014.
Like them, this government takes seriously its role in applying export licensing law...
...reflecting the published criteria and the specific circumstances.
But let me leave this House in no doubt.
The UK continues to support Israel's right to self-defence in accordance with international law.
In April, British fighter jets intercepted Iranian missiles aimed at Israel, preventing significant loss of civilian life.
We supported robust action against the Iranian backed Houthis in Yemen, who have attacked Israel directly as well as Israeli-linked shipping.
And Iran should be in no doubt of our commitment to challenge their reckless and destabilizing activity, in the region and across the world.
We will continue to work hand-in-glove with our international partners,...
...to stand up to Iranian aggression and malign activity -
wherever it is find and whenever we see it.
We continue to hold Iran to account - including though extensive use of sanctions.
And today, we are doing so again.
We are announcing new sanctions on four IRGC-Quds Force targets who have a role in supporting Iranian proxy actions in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.
Through the UK's dedicated Iran sanctions regime...
we have sanctioned over 400 Iranian individuals and entities.
And through our work with partners, we are exposing and containing Iran's destabilizing weapons development,...
...where soon, we will be introducing further regulations -
to bolster existing bans on the export of goods and technology significant to Iran's production of drones and missiles.
So let me be clear -
we will continue to work with Israel and our partners to tackle the threat from Iran across the region.
This government will continue to stand for Israel's security.
And we will always do so in a manner consistent with our obligations to domestic and international law.
Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House."

CAIRO (Sputnik) - Hamas holds Israel responsible for the deaths of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, Izzat al-Risheq, a member of the Palestinian movement's political bureau, said on Sunday.
""The one who bears responsibility for the deaths of the hostages held by the resistance is the occupation [Israel], which insists on continuing the war of genocide,"" al-Risheq said in a statement.
The Israeli military has released the names of six hostages whose bodies were found in the Rafah area of ââthe Gaza Strip. They include Russian citizen Alexander Lobanov and US citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin. They were captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack.
The Hamas official argued that hostages were dying in the enclave due to Israeli bombings. He urged US President Joe Biden to stop supporting Israel with money and weapons and pressure it into ceasing attacks on Gaza.
On October 7, 2023, Israel was subjected to an unprecedented rocket attack from the Gaza Strip, followed by an incursion. Hamas fighters opened fire on military and civilian targets, and captured more than 250 hostages. Israel estimates that 1,200 people were killed.

MANILA -- President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Saturday maintained his stance to pursue ""peaceful"" resolution of disputes in the contested waters, including the West Philippine Sea (WPS), despite China's latest aggression in Escoda Shoal.
""As directed by the President, the Philippines will fully utilize and continue to pursue diplomatic channels and mechanisms under the rules-based international order and pursue the peaceful resolution of disputes,"" the National Maritime Council (NMC) said in a statement.
The NMC, nevertheless, assured the public that the Philippines ""will not succumb to acts of harassment and aggressive behavior.""
It said the Philippines would continue upholding its sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the WPS.
""China's latest actions are uncalled for as the Philippine vessel was engaged in a peaceful and lawful patrol within its own maritime jurisdiction,"" the NMC said.
In a press briefing, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5205 ""deliberately"" rammed PCG vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) thrice in the vicinity of Escoda Shoal.
The CCG vessel's aggressive maneuver endangered lives and caused significant damage to BRP Teresa Magbanua while conducting routine patrols within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.
The NMC asserted that the presence of BRP Teresa Magbanua in Escoda Shoal, which lies just 75 nautical miles from the Philippine baselines, is ""legal and is in accordance with international law, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Arbitral Award.""
The NMC called on the CCG to ""exercise restraint and prioritize the safety of vessels at sea and aircraft within our airspace"".
""The Philippines will continue its sovereign operations in its maritime zones. The BRP Teresa Magbanua will remain and maintain its operations in the West Philippine Sea,"" it said, adding that the Philippines would continue carrying out its routine maritime activities, protecting its territory and maritime zones, and defending its waters against environmental degradation and other illegal activities.
Stronger measure
House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez backed the commitment to peace but urged stronger measures to protect the country and its sovereignty.
""The Philippines remains committed to dialogue and a peaceful resolution, but we also stand ready to safeguard our sovereignty. We call for respect, and we are determined to meet any challenges that may arise,"" he said in a news release.
It is about time that stronger measures must be considered, he said.
""We should enhance our presence in the [WPS], reinforce our alliances, and ensure that our capabilities are sufficient to protect our sovereign rights,"" he added.
He also urged all Filipinos to stand for the country, its future and sovereignty.
At the same time, Romualdez appealed to the international community to hold China accountable for its actions, urging the Department of Foreign Affairs to escalate the issue to the highest levels of global diplomacy. (With a report from Zaldy De Layola/PNA)"

PRAGUE -- About three weeks after Ukraine's military launched a surprise incursion into Russia's western Kursk region, the operation remains ""an important element of the war,"" said leading Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky in an interview with Current Time.
The operation on Russian territory, after years of fighting almost exclusively in Ukraine, has proven a morale boost for Ukraine and has struck a blow at Russian President Vladimir Putin's domestic support, Khodorkovsky said on the sidelines of the Globsec international security conference in Prague on September 1.
""The assistance that the [Russian] state is providing to people who have been caught up in it is clearly inadequate,"" Khodorkovsky said, saying most of Russian society doesn't view the incursion as a military action but rather as a sort of ""natural disaster.""
""Putin's 10,000 rubles [$110] is just spitting in people's faces. And that is how the public perceives it.""
This reaction makes it even more politically risky than before for the Russian government to institute a new mobilization of troops for the war against Ukraine, Khodorkovsky argued.
""Deciding to turn the war into a national effort,"" he said, ""is a decision [Putin] is afraid to make.""
Putin's government has used the media to prevent the onset of ""war fatigue"" by convincing the broad public that ""there is no war.""
""As soon as he creates the feeling that there is a war, the clock will start ticking,"" Khodorkovsky added. ""How much time is left on the clock, given that the special military operation has already been going on for a while, we just don't know.""
For Ukraine, the incursion is part of Kyiv's effort to convince its Western partners there is no sense in establishing ""red lines"" regarding offensive operations against Russia.
""It is clear that the bureaucracies in all countries -- particularly the United States -- are very cowardly,"" Khodorkovsky argued. ""They need to prove that red lines don't exist or at least that they are not located here. This step has made [Western] bureaucracies very angry, although they haven't shown it yet. But like it or not, they have been shown that any red lines are not where these bureaucracies imagine them to be. That makes [the incursion] very important.""
Khodorkovsky, 61, was once Russia's richest man. He was arrested in 2003, ostensibly on fraud charges that supporters say were trumped up to punish him for his political activity and to facilitate the takeover of his business assets by figures close to Putin. In 2005, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. However, Putin pardoned him in December 2013 and expelled him from the country.
Since then, based in London, Khodorkovsky has funded a number of Russian opposition initiatives. In May 2022, the Russian government designated him a ""foreign agent.""
In April 2023, Khodorkovsky was one of a large group of prominent exiled Russian oppositionists who signed a Declaration of Russia's Democratic Forces that proclaimed the Putin government ""illegitimate and criminal"" and demanded that Russian troops withdraw ""from all occupied territories"" in Ukraine.

* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Han Zheng, our Chinese colleagues and friends,
I am delighted to welcome all of you to Vladivostok.
I have very good memories of our recent joint work in Harbin, and I would like to thank you for your wholehearted approach to the instructions you received from the President of China on accompanying our delegation and for your active involvement in that cooperative effort.
In October 2024, we will mark 75 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. That event had a profound impact on our bilateral relations and on development of modern China and our interstate ties.
As per our agreement, we hope to see President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping at the upcoming BRICS summit. I propose holding a bilateral meeting during that event.
Thanks to our joint efforts, relations between China and Russia have reached an unprecedented level. We attach great importance to interregional cooperation. I hope that during our meeting today and our work at the Eastern Economic Forum tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to explore and identify new areas for cooperation.
We are grateful to the President of the People's Republic of China for sending such a substantial delegation to this forum. I would like to thank you for leading this delegation and for taking part in our joint work.
Welcome.
Vice President of the People's Republic of China Han Zheng (retranslated): Mr President, thank you very much for finding the time to meet with me.
I am happy to have the opportunity to come to Vladivostok for the 9th Eastern Economic Forum at your invitation. First of all, I would like to convey best regards and good wishes from President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping.
This year we will mark 75 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. The Chinese-Russian comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction continue to grow stronger in the new age under your and President Xi Jinping's strategic guidance.
You have held two meetings with President Xi Jinping this year, and you have reached a number of vital agreements on the parameters of the further development of our bilateral relations in the new historical period, 75 years after the establishment of our diplomatic relations. China is ready to work comprehensively and diligently with our Russian partners to implement the important agreements reached by our leaders and to contribute to the continued improvement of our cooperation.
This time, I have come to Vladivostok for the Eastern Economic Forum at your invitation and on instructions from President Xi Jinping. Over the past years, your personal initiative and efforts have helped turn the Eastern Economic Forum into a key economic platform where all parties in the Asia-Pacific region can find consensus solutions and discuss cooperation. We highly appreciate the role and prestige of this platform. I wish you success in hosting the forum tomorrow.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.
Another aspect I would like to bring to your attention is that in addition to focusing on the economic and industrial development of the Far East, we also strive to establish significant centres of humanitarian and cultural cooperation here.
We are establishing subsidiaries of Russia's leading world-class museums, theatres and musical venues here. I know that some performers who are popular with Chinese audiences have visited China many times, and have recently been on another tour. I hope that Vladivostok will also become a prominent hub for cultural exchanges and attract tourists from Russia, from all over the world and especially from China, which is our friend.
If you have 30 minutes, I invite you to see what we are building here, and you will learn more about additional opportunities in the cultural and humanitarian sphere.
Han Zheng (retranslated): Mr President, I fully agree with you on the importance of strengthening cultural and humanitarian cooperation between our two countries.
I believe that the development of Chinese-Russian relations and our diverse cooperation would not be possible without the guiding role of our leaders.
Despite the challenges and risks we currently face, cooperation between our countries continues to develop steadily in all areas under the strategic guidance of our leaders. This is particularly evident in the trade and economic sphere, which you devote great attention to. We have accomplished our objective earlier than planned, with bilateral trade volumes reaching $200 billion.
From 2018 to early 2023, while I was working at the State Council, I co-chaired, on instructions from President Xi Jinping, the Chinese section of the China-Russia intergovernmental commission on investment, trade and energy cooperation. This is why I have a good understanding of our cooperation.

The U.S. on Tuesday strongly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal to halt nearly 11 months of fighting in Gaza and free the remaining hostages the militants are holding.
""There are dozens of hostages still remaining in Gaza, still waiting for a deal that will bring them home. It is time to finalize that deal,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters after Israeli forces found six hostages over the weekend that Hamas had shot to death in a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
""The people of Israel cannot afford to wait any longer. The Palestinian people, who are also suffering the terrible effects of this war, cannot afford to wait any longer. The world cannot afford to wait any longer,"" Miller said.
He said that the United States will work ""over the coming days"" with mediators Egypt and Qatar ""to push for a final agreement.""
One key point of contention in the negotiations has been Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain at the border between Gaza and Egypt.
But Miller said the U.S. is opposed ""to the long-term presence"" of Israeli troops in Gaza.
The State Department spokesman said that reaching a cease-fire and release of the 100 or so remaining hostages ""will require both sides to show flexibility. It will require that both sides look for reasons to get to yes rather than reasons to say no.""
The U.S. plea for an end to the fighting came after Israel's military said it had killed a Hamas militant who participated in the October assault on Israel and was seen in a widely viewed video drinking soda in front of two kids who were wounded in a grenade attack that killed their father.
The Israel Defense Forces identified the militant as Ahmed Fozi Wadia and said he paraglided into the Netiv HaAsara community during the October 7 attack.
Wadia was among eight militants killed in a Saturday airstrike in Gaza City, the Israeli military said.
Netanyahu's office said it will win its war against Hamas with or without arms from Britain, a day after the British government announced it would suspend some arms exports to Israel due to concerns about their use in Gaza.
""Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain's misguided decision will only embolden Hamas,"" Netanyahu's office said.
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said there was a ""clear risk"" that some of the weapons could be used to ""commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.""
British Defense Secretary John Healey told Times Radio on Tuesday that the suspension of 30 of 350 arms export licenses to Israel ""will not have a material impact on Israel's security.""
Netanyahu is also facing pressure at home after several days of protests calling on him to agree to a cease-fire with Hamas, especially after the six hostages were found shot to death.
White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters, ""Clearly what happened over the weekend underscores how important it is to get this [cease-fire] done as quickly as possible.""
Miller at the State Department said, ""There are no winners [in Gaza] in that pain for Israelis, for Palestinians, for the region, has gone on for far too long. It's time to reach a cease-fire that brings the hostages home, that alleviates the suffering of the Palestinian people, and it ultimately brings an end to this war, and that's exactly what we will continue to push to reach.""
Among the sticking points in negotiations is Netanyahu's push for Israel to retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. Israel claims Hamas uses tunnels along the corridor to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt and Hamas deny the claims.
Netanyahu has refused to agree to a cease-fire deal calling for an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza that would lead to a permanent halt to the fighting â for fear that Hamas could rearm itself and endanger Israel's long-term security.
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out negotiations by issuing new demands, including that Israel remain in control of the Philadelphi Corridor and a second corridor running across Gaza.
Hamas has held to the broad agreements of a three-phase plan put forth by the U.S. administration of President Joe Biden in July: Hamas would release all hostages in return for an end to the war, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners.
Biden on Monday rebuked Netanyahu for his handling of the hostage situation and cease-fire negotiations.
As he arrived Monday back at the White House after a vacation, Biden was asked whether he thought the Israeli leader was doing enough to free the 100 or so remaining hostages, a third of whom Israel believes are dead. Biden responded simply, ""No.""
Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages during the October 7 terror attack on southern Israel. The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.
Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., the U.K. and other Western countries.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has submitted his resignation as part of a major government reshuffle two-and-a-half years into the ruinous Ukraine-Russia war.
Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said on Wednesday that the legislative body ""received a letter of resignation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba,"" and the parliament would vote on the resignation request at the next plenary meeting.
Kuleba stepped down from his position following an announcement last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that a cabinet reshuffle was imminent as he tries to strengthen the government amid a protracted conflict between Kiev and Moscow.
The 43-year-old has held the post since 2020 and has since February 2022, when the war broke out, traveled across the world to advocate for Western support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.
On Tuesday, several ministers handed their resignations, including the ministers of justice, strategic industries and environmental protection.
Davyd Arakhamiia, a leader of Zelensky's party in the parliament, said more than half of the current cabinet would undergo changes and the new appointments would be announced on Thursday.
Kuleba's resignation followed an overnight Russian attack on the western city of Lviv, which killed at least seven people and injured 35 as a child and a medical worker were among the dead, with others being in critical condition.
The attack took place a day after two ballistic missiles blasted a military academy and nearby hospital in Poltava, Ukraine's second-largest city, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 200 others in one of the deadliest Russian strikes since the war began.
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a report that its units had engaged in 193 battles with Russian army on Tuesday amid tense situation in Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in the Donetsk region.
'Extremely painful' response
Russia's foreign ministry warned the West and Ukraine on Wednesday that Moscow would give an immediate and extremely painful response in the event of long-range strikes on Russian territory by Ukraine.
Ukrainian forces crashed through Russia's western border into the Kursk region in August in a surprise offensive.
Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, said the response would be ""extremely painful.""
Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that over the past 24 hours, its units repelled multiple Ukrainian offensives and launched counterattacks in the directions of Kharkiv, Avdiivka and Donetsk, causing severe losses to Ukrainian military personnel and equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery pieces.
Russia's air defense units were also reported to have downed one MiG-29 fighter jet and 37 drones on the same day.
In addition, the ministry claimed to have killed and wounded about 400 Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed 12 armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other weaponry in western Russia's Kursk Oblast.
Moscow launched its special military operation on February 24, 2022, aiming to liberate the Donbas region where the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk were suffering from regular attacks on them by Ukrainian forces.
Since the war started, the Western countries' support for Ukraine in fighting a proxy war against Russia has led to the delivery of hundreds of shipments of military equipment, including all kinds of weapons and munitions, to the former Soviet republic.
The Western countries even supplied long-range missiles, tanks and warplanes to Ukraine despite initial resistance, turning the conflict into a full-fledged war."

The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees says 70 percent of UNRWA schools have been 'destroyed or damaged' since the Israeli regime launched its savage war across the besieged strip.
Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA wrote in a post on X on Monday that those schools that still stand are being used as shelters for displaced families.
""They cannot be used for learning. With no ceasefire, children are likely to fall prey to exploitation, including child labor and recruitment into armed groups,"" Lazzarini noted.
""The longer children stay out of school, the higher the risk of a lost generation,"" Philippe Lazzarini says.
He also stated that children across the region are starting their new school term at UNRWA facilities, but not in Gaza.
Over 600,000 children in the Gaza Strip are deeply traumatized and living in rubble amid a devastating Israeli offensive, the UN agency chief said.
Elsewhere in the post, he noted that a ceasefire is ""a win for all"", including ""respite"" for civilians, the release of Israeli captives in Gaza, and the increased flow of basic supplies, including learning materials.
In the most recent aggression, the Israeli regime killed about a dozen Palestinians in an airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City as school carnage in the war-wracked territory continues apace.
The attack struck the Safad school in the Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City on Sunday.
More than 100 citizens were killed and dozens more injured on August 10 after the Israeli occupation forces bombed the al-Tabi'in school in the al-Daraj neighborhood in Gaza City, sheltering over 6,000 displaced people.
Since the beginning of Israel's genocidal war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, the regime has systematically attacked civic infrastructure, including schools housing displaced people, hospitals, and places of worship, often claiming without evidence they are linked to Hamas resistance movement, in order to evade international criticism.
No end in sight to the genocide in Gaza as more Palestinians fall victim to Israel's attacks across the besieged territory.
Israel's relentless air and artillery strikes continue to pound Gaza eleven months into the regime's genocide, killing more women and children.
The Israeli regime's attacks killed at least 47 Palestinians and injured 94 others within the last 24 hours.
The Israeli aggression, which began last October, has claimed the lives of at least 40,738 Palestinians and injured over 94,000 others so far.
Concomitantly with the war, the regime has been enforcing a near-total siege on the coastal territory, which has reduced the flow of foodstuffs, medicine, electricity, and water into the Palestinian territory into a trickle."

Tehran, IRNA -- Israel is hit by a general strike that has shut down businesses as public anger boils against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for what Israelis see as deliberate efforts to torpedo a Gaza truce deal with Hamas and prevent the release of captives held in the Palestinian territory.
According to media reports, the strike that began on Monday, has shut down universities, ministries, and shops across the Israeli-occupied territories. Schools were opened partially, while some teachers, municipal employees, transit workers and others walked off the job. Israel's main international airport suspended flights as well.
The strike was called by Israel's largest labor union Histadrut on Sunday when massive protests hit the occupied territories over Netanyahu's failure to release the captives.
The protests erupted in different cities including Tel Aviv, Haifa and occupied Al-Quds. In Tel Aviv alone, 300,000 people were estimated to attend, with some blocking a major highway. Police used water cannons to disperse the crowd. Arrests were also made in Haifa.
The demonstrations took place after the Israeli military said that it had located and recovered the bodies of six captives in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday.
The protesters urged Netanyahu to urgently accept a deal with the Palestinian Hamas Resistance Movement for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining captives.
The Sunday demonstrations were among the biggest rallies in Israel in the past months since Hamas captured some 250 people, including Israelis and non-Israelis, during its October 7 Al-Aqsa Storm Operation on southern Israeli-occupied territories.
Dozens of captives have already been released, while around 100 remain in Gaza.
Israelis blame Netanyahu for the prolonged captivity of their loved ones, as he insists on his demand for keeping the regime's control of Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer area along the border between Gaza and Egypt. Netanyahu is accused of blocking a ceasefire-captive deal by setting as a condition Israel's maintaining control of the Philadelphi corridor for any such deal.
On Sunday, Senior Hamas Official Khalil al-Hayya said that no ceasefire agreement is possible without the Israeli regime's withdrawal from Philadelphi, Netzarim, and Rafah corridors.
Hamas has also said that the six Israeli captives had been killed in Israeli attacks, and that some of them were due to be exchanged if a deal had been reached.

China will continue to observe the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith which guide our policy toward Africa. We will continue to pursue the greater good and shared interests in our cooperation with Africa, expand institutional opening up to Africa and deepen cooperation on industrial and supply chains so as to bring the Chinese and African economies together, connect our development efforts and share our achievements together.
AFP: The New Zealand Intelligence Service describes China as a complex intelligence concern and its operations in New Zealand as complex and deceptive. How does China respond to these allegations by New Zealand?
Mao Ning: China always develops relations with other countries based on such principles as mutual respect and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs. We never interfere in any country's domestic affairs. We hope that New Zealand will view China in a rational and objective light, and create favorable conditions for the sound and steady growth of China-New Zealand relations.
Global Times: It's reported that Chairman of the US House ""Select Committee on the CCP"" John Moolenaar and several Representatives visited Japan recently. They claimed that the visit was to express support for the US-Japan alliance and discuss ways the US and Japan can work together to combat the ""Chinese Communist Party's rising military, economic, and ideological aggression."" And they urged the Japanese government to continue its work to push back on the ""CCP's malign economic agenda."" What is China's comment?
Mao Ning: The committee you mentioned has no credibility to speak of. Driven by a political agenda, the committee has long vilified China and the Communist Party of China. Relevant politicians' remarks are steeped in Cold War mentality and ideological bias, and meant to peddle the ""China threat"" narrative and encourage bloc confrontation. China firmly rejects this.
China has all along believed that cooperation between countries should be conducive to regional peace, stability and prosperity, and not target or even harm any third party's interests. Ganging up to form exclusive groupings is not what our world needs and will not gain support. China calls on US politicians to view China's development objectively and rationally, stop creating bloc confrontation, stop inciting a new Cold War, and refrain from fanning up tensions in the region.
The Paper: It is learned that the first Seminar on Capacity Building of Artificial Intelligence has opened in Shanghai. Can you share with us more information on this seminar?
Mao Ning: The rapid development and wide application of AI has made it an important driver of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. As a major country in the field of AI, China attaches great importance to the development and application of AI, especially on strengthening the capacity building of the vast developing world. China is actively committed to helping fellow developing countries benefit from AI, and ensuring that countries of the Global South have the opportunity to be sufficiently involved in global AI governance. Against this backdrop, China submitted a draft resolution during this year's UN General Assembly entitled ""Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-building of Artificial Intelligence"", which was adopted by consensus and co-sponsored by 143 countries.
As a follow-up action of this resolution, China, together with the UN, is holding the Seminar on Capacity Building of Artificial Intelligence in Shanghai from September 3 to 6. Representatives from nearly 40 countries are participating in the seminar. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres attended the opening ceremony. This seminar will help representatives from the Global South to gain a deep understanding of current progress and trends in AI development through expert lectures, exchanges, visits and surveys, thus bridging the AI divide. China will continue to provide the world with such public goods, take concrete steps to support developing countries in achieving development and use AI to benefit the entire humanity.
CCTV: On August 13, Israeli national security minister Ben Gvir led over 2,000 Jews into the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and said that Jews should be permitted to pray at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound (known to Jews as Temple Mount). The Israeli Prime Minister's Office later issued a statement indicating that there has been no change in Israel's policy of not allowing Jews to pray on the Temple Mount. Palestine and the League of Arab States condemned the act. What is your comment?
Mao Ning: With Gaza still mired in conflict and regional tensions running high, any new dispute concerning the issue of the holy sites of Jerusalem would simply fuel the flames. China is opposed to that and stands for respecting and maintaining the status quo of the holy sites in Jerusalem which stems from history. We urge parties, particularly Israel, to stay cool-headed and exercise restraint, avoid any provocation that might fuel antagonism, and prevent further escalation of tensions.
RIA Novosti: It's reported by Bloomberg that TÃ¼rkiye has formally asked to join the BRICS group, according to people familiar with the matter. What's the Foreign Ministry's comments?
Mao Ning: BRICS is an important platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries. China stands ready to work with other BRICS members to uphold the BRICS spirit of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation and support more like-minded partners to join BRICS cooperation."

Taipei, Sept. 1 (CNA) Taiwan's National Security Council (NSC) secretary-general highlighted the correlation between Europe's prosperity and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region in a public address he gave in the Czech Republic on Saturday.
""Your future is our future, and our future is your future,"" Joseph Wu (å³éç®) said at an international forum organized by the Slovakia-based non-governmental organization (NGO), GLOBSEC, in Prague.
Wu said that in the face of China's all-out warfare, ""Taiwan's understanding of the Chinese Communist regime, as well as Taiwan's experience in tackling Chinese malign influence, is of great value to all.""
Taiwan's lone effort, however, is not enough as Europe holds the key ""to building integrated deterrence against the PRC,"" he continued.
Many European countries have already carried out measures to improve investment or merger screenings involving China, passed laws on securing critical minerals for strategic sectors, and taken steps to expose China's industrial spies capable of intellectual property theft and reverse engineering, according to Wu.
The European Union also developed anti-economic coercion instruments as a countermeasure to PRC economic coercion, he added.
In contrast to the People's Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan has been a reliable and like-minded partner to Europe, Wu argued, adding that Taiwan also received ""unanimous support from the European Parliament last December for a resolution on deepening EU-Taiwan bilateral trade and investment relations.""
Taiwan is committed to enhancing cooperation with European countries in areas such as supply chain resilience, countering economic coercion, and economic security, the NSC official said.
In closing his address, Wu highlighted the fact that the Indo-Pacific is a ""consequential region for the world's future. And this is a consequential moment for us all.""
""While war is neither imminent nor inevitable, democratic unity and tenacity are closely monitored by the revisionist and adventurist PRC.
""European countries must put a price tag on aggression against Taiwan. Only a prosperous Taiwan can ensure a prosperous Indo-Pacific, and only a prosperous Indo-Pacific can ensure a prosperous Europe,"" he underscored.
""Ladies and gentlemen, your future is our future. And our future is your future,"" he concluded.
Wu's address was made during the ongoing 19th edition of the GLOBSEC Forum, being held from Aug. 30 to Sept. 1 in Prague, Czechia.
This marks the second time Wu has spoken publicly at the annual forum. The last time was in 2021 as then-foreign minister of Taiwan.
According to the event organizers, the GLOBSEC Forum aims to underscore Central and Eastern Europe's growing significance in upholding global stability. This year, more than 1,500 participants, including leaders from government, business, academia and NGOs, from over 70 countries attended the event.

The Royal Australian Air Force has sent combat aircraft to India in support of a multinational exercise for the first time.
Exercise Tarang Shakti 24 is being held at Air Force Station Jodhpur from 30 August to 13 September 2024.
The Royal Australian Air Force has sent three EA-18G Growler aircraft from No 6 Squadron, and up to 120 personnel.
This is the first time India has conducted Exercise Tarang Shakti, with 11 participating nations and 18 observer nations attending.
Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Stephen Chappell said Australia's participation in Exercise Tarang Shakti demonstrated a commitment to supporting regional partners and fostering international cooperation to address shared security challenges.
""India is a top-tier security partner for Australia, and through the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Australia and India, the Government is continuing to prioritise practical and tangible cooperation that directly contributes to Indo-Pacific stability,"" Air Marshal Chappell said.
""Participation in international exercises such as Tarang Shakti 24, showcases our advanced capabilities that ensure rapid response and adaptability to emerging threats and security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.
""Exercise Tarang Shakti 24 will provide our aviators with the opportunity to develop interoperability with foreign militaries, develop a mutual understanding of tactical operations, and foster international relations.""
Australia and India have enjoyed increased air defence cooperation in recent years, including hosting Indian Air Force Flankers at Exercise Pitch Black in 2018, 2022, and 2024.
Air Force also conducts a number of training and engagement activities with Indian Navy P-8I Neptune surveillance aircraft.
Australia will continue to support India's key role in the region by increasing the depth and complexity of our defence cooperation."

Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk, commander of Ukraine's air force, has been fired by President Volodymyr Zelensky after an F-16 fighter jet crashed during a bombardment of Russian territory.
Zelensky dismissed Oleshchuk on Friday four days after the incident. Media reports said the dismissal is probably related to the F-16 crash in which the pilot, Lt. Col. Oleksiy Mes, died.
""We need to protect people. Protect personnel. Take care of all our soldiers,"" Zelensky said in a public address minutes after the order was published on the presidential website.
Zelensky insisted that Kiev needed to strengthen the command level of its armed forces.
The Ukrainian Air Force has come under US experts' scrutiny in an investigation to determine the cause of the fatal crash of the newly acquired US-made warplane donated by NATO-member European countries.
Zelensky had announced just earlier this month that Kiev's forces had finally received the F-16 fighter jets he had begged for the former Soviet republic.
On August 4, Zelensky said the US-led Western countries had provided Kiev forces with two F-16 fighter jets.
The Ukrainian leaders spent more than two years of intense lobbying with Western countries to get the American-made jets.
""F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it,"" Zelensky said in a video, claiming that the Ukrainian pilots had received enough training and ""have already started using them.""
Zelensky said the West was initially opposed to supplying Kiev with the US-made F-16 fighter jets.
US-led Western countries have promised to provide Kiev with 80 F-16 jets to fight in the West's proxy war against Russia.
Also, Zelensky seems to be seeking to make vast changes in the country's armed forces' top tier command level.
Earlier this year, Zelensky removed the top military commander Valery Zaluzhny in what seemed to be a major shake-up of the military leadership outlining war strategy in the third year of the conflict with Russia.
Since Russia launched its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in February 2022, the US-led Western countries have been flooding Kiev with all kinds of weapons and ammunition in an attempt to strengthen the Ukrainian forces against Russian troops.
Despite the West's all-out military and intelligence support to Kiev, Russia has been able to maintain its absolute military superiority over Ukraine on all fronts."

Botswana, Africa's longest democracy, will hold its general election on October 30, President Mokgweetsi Masisi announced Tuesday. Masisi will seek a second and final term after his ruling party endorsed his candidacy over the weekend.
In a public address, Masisi said Botswana will continue with its long-standing principle of holding regular elections. Masisi's ruling Botswana Democratic Party has been in power since independence from Britain in 1966.
""The constitution of the Republic of Botswana mandates that we, as a nation, hold general elections every five years,"" Masisi said. ""This is not just a legal obligation but a fundamental principle that underpins our democracy, a commitment we have honored, and we will continue to honor in the future.""
The president urged voters to turn out in large numbers after previous elections in 2019 experienced voter apathy and low turnout.
Out of a target of 80% set by the country's electoral body, the Independent Electoral Commission registered only 63% of the eligible voters.
Masisi declared October 30 and 31 as public holidays to encourage citizens to vote.
Masisi is seeking a second term, which would be his final one, if he is reelected. The president is allowed two terms in office, according to the constitution
The BDP's main threat is from a coalition of parties, the Umbrella for Democratic Change, or UDC, and the Botswana Congress Party, which has broken away from the opposition alliance.
UDC spokesperson Moeti Mohwasa said they expected the announcement of the election date to come earlier.
""We welcome the date. However, it is regrettable that such an announcement is made at such short notice,"" Mohwasa said. ""We would have liked a situation whereby the date of elections is announced well in advance, but what we are happy with is that after so much suffering under the BDP rule, this will come to an end on October 30.""
Mohwasa said the election should be free and fair after his party alleged rigging in the previous poll, claims that were dismissed in court. The ruling party also denied the allegations.
Leonard Sesa, a political analyst at the University of Botswana, said it was right for the president to make the election date public as concerns over a delay were mounting.
""We were going to get worried if it was going to be postponed,"" Sesa said. ""Remember, we are talking about a beacon of shining democracy in Africa. Small things matter when gauging democracy. So, issuing a writ to say October 30, we are on the right track.""
Sesa said political parties are not yet ready for the election as they are still battling to field candidates in all constituencies.
""There was a delay for political parties to conduct their intra-party primary elections, within the political parties themselves, and people were worried,"" he said. ""There are some constituencies that all the political parties including the ruling party, have not posted anyone to stand.""
In the previous election, the BDP secured a comfortable victory, where its share of the popular vote increased from 47% in 2014 to 53% five years later."

By Zhao Yusha Published: Aug 31, 2024 12:36 AM
A tour bus filled with travelers passed by a bustling construction site in a suburb of Tanzania's Zanzibar, adorned with posters of Chinese companies and where Chinese engineers were busy at work. One American tourist couldn't help but wonder: why are there so many Chinese in the local area?
That is the question that is also befuddling officials in Washington. As China and Africa have fostered closer partnership in many fields and China's engagement in this continent becomes deeper and wider, some Western countries have started to not only smear their cooperation, but also called for competition to be stepped up with China in Africa. Such hyping and calling for competition have intensified just ahead of the 2024 Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).
The key distinction between China and the US in their engagement with Africa is that Beijing has taken a reciprocal and more empathetic approach, allowing it to better understand the needs of the continent and tailor its collaboration accordingly. This stands in contrast to the traditional carrot-and-stick approach used by some Western countries to coerce African nations into serving their own interests, according to experts.
This year's FOCAC will be held in Beijing from September 4 to 6, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying announced last month.
The theme of the summit is ""Joining Hands to Advance Modernization and Build a High-Level China-Africa Community with a Shared Future,"" Hua said, adding that leaders of FOCAC's African members will attend the summit at the invitation of the forum.
The upcoming FOCAC summit marks another grand reunion of the China-Africa big family post-COVID pandemic, and has been hailed by Chinese and African experts as a milestone opportunity to chart the course for enhanced cooperation in the future.
Ahead of the highly-anticipated gathering, some foreign media have launched another wave of campaign hyping China's cooperation with Africa, with reports on issues ranging from sensationalizing Chinese loans to China's green product exports to the continent.
The National Interest, an American magazine, published an article saying that China is winning the Global South as a provider of a large amount of public goods for developing countries, including African ones.
In recent years, US officials have also called for Washington to prioritize efforts to match China's influence among the Global South. Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last month, Ben Cardin, a Democratic senator and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the US needs to offer the Global South an alternative to China.
Closer cooperation
A new Gallup report released in April this year shows median approval ratings for the US in Africa slipped from 59 percent in 2022 to 56 percent in 2023. Of the four global powers surveyed, the US was the only one not to see its image improve across Africa in 2023. Meanwhile, China's approval in the region rose six percentage points, from 52 percent in 2022 to 58 percent in 2023, two points ahead of the US.
There are vast differences in the quality of the engagement with the West, spearheaded by the US and the engagement with China, Mwangi Wachira, a former economist with the World Bank and an advisor for the Kenyan government, told the Global Times.
The Chinese engagement shows thoughtfulness. It gives us say in what we are doing, in contrast to the Western institutions, Wachira noted.
""You [China] can put yourself in my shoes...You can look at things from my perspective. Not always true from the Western side,"" said Wachira.
China's cooperation with Africa differs from the US' in its essence. While China offers equal and mutually beneficial partnerships that contribute to the development of these nations, the US often employs a carrot-and-stick approach to coerce for support in its own interests, and treats these countries as tools in a geopolitical competition, said Song Wei, a professor from the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University.
Experts said geopolitical struggles are not what African countries want, and if the US really cares, it can find vast potential for cooperating with China on this continent, not competition, said Song.
Apart from trade, African scholars also praised China for its assistance in building infrastructure in Africa, Chinese companies' contribution to local development and how China's development model can present valuable insights that can guide African countries and other Global South economies in shaping a more prosperous and inclusive future.
The cooperation between Africa and China and that of Africa and the West differ mainly in how African preferences are addressed, Endalkachew Sime, PhD student at Peking University, ex-state minister of planning and development of Ethiopia and ex-secretary general of the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and Sectoral Associations, told the Global Times.
""For specific projects, particularly in infrastructure, African countries find that their needs and priorities are better met through Chinese cooperation. It's not just about financing; it's also about training and capacity building,"" said Sime.
Take the companies as an example. Once Chinese companies establish operations in Africa, they hire local people, offer training skills and raise local people to the management level, said Wachira."
CPU0HFCIMJ_Z8SRG6RPSREM47M,"Gaza: Disease and war stalk children, despite vaccine success",_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240904-unnews02.htm,"By Daniel Johnson  4 September 2024 - In Gaza, despite the success of the mass polio vaccination campaign so far, UN humanitarians warned on Wednesday that the very children they are trying to protect have been blighted by disease and heavily traumatized by ongoing fighting.
It's been nearly 11 months since war erupted in the enclave following Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel. Today more than nine in 10 people have been forcibly displaced by the fighting, leaving them vulnerable to hunger, malnutrition and sickness.
""So far, we've been able to vaccinate 187,000 children and as we've been tent to tent and shelter to shelter,"" said Louise Wateridge from the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA.
""The reality is that these vaccinations are happening in the middle of a war zone, while many other diseases, such as hepatitis A, are spreading,"" the UNRWA spokesperson explained.
""Most of the children I've seen are covered in skin diseases and rashes, so while we're doing everything we can to vaccinate for one disease, the inhumane conditions that are causing and spreading these diseases continues.""
Health hazards
The UNRWA spokesperson described the scene at one health centre where sewage had flooded the surrounding streets, forcing children to avoid the health hazard in order to receive their polio vaccinations.
""People who need everything - in addition to the polio vaccinations, medical supplies, hygiene products and clean water are absolutely critical to stop the spread of disease,"" Ms. Wateridge insisted.
""What people need most is a ceasefire and they need it now.""
Wednesday marks the final day for vaccinations in the Gaza's Middle Area which humanitarians say has been a resounding success.
In addition to UNRWA, the operation is a joint UN effort with the UN World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), partner NGOs and volunteers.
Despite the ever-present danger of strikes, families have brought their children to health centres and schools for the first of two vaccinations, a legacy of the enclave's extremely strong support for vaccinations pre-war.
For those unable to move easily, aid teams have gone to find vulnerable families and children to ensure that all those under 10 receive their dose.
""It's been very positive to see children coming out, showing us their little finger with coloured marker pen to proudly display that they've received this vaccine,"" said Ms. Wateridge.
No rest for health teams
After working four days straight on the vaccination campaign in the Middle Area, some 2,200 health workers will move to southern Gaza to resume their work on Thursday morning.
Once this is done, efforts will turn to the north, before the whole process starts up again in four weeks, to give the second vaccine to boost protection levels.
The vaccine teams are able to do work with some level of security, thanks to the agreed humanitarian pauses with the Israeli military and Hamas fighters from 8am to 2pm - although the violence has not stopped by any means.
""The pauses are welcomed, but the bombing and the strikes have not stopped...our teams left to vaccinate, surrounded by the sound of strikes,"" the UNWRA officer explained.
""While I cannot determine the locations of the strikes I can hear around me in the middle area, hearing them is unnerving for children and families as well as health care workers distributing the polio vaccines.""
Child tragedy
In a related development in Geneva, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child heard Israeli representatives condemn Hamas for the ""tragic"" toll the war has taken on children.
Israeli ambassador to Geneva, Daniel Meron, told the panel of independent rights experts in a scheduled country review on Tuesday that Hamas was ""embedded within the civilian population"", with tunnel shafts located ""in children's bedrooms in Gaza"" and under schools, serving as ""weapons arsenals and launch sites for rockets"".
""There have been weapons found under cribs. There have been weapons found inside teddy bears, in maternity wards, in hospitals,"" he told the committee, which reports to the Human Rights Council and whose members are not UN staff."
CQF85FMCKV_3PQ6F66OM0UMC39,Dispute over border telecom plan further strains China-North Korea ties,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2024/dprk-240831-voa01.htm,"By Christy Lee August 31, 2024
A new sign of discord has emerged in the ties between North Korea and China over Beijing's plan to install telecommunication facilities near its border, which analysts say could be a way for China to exert its influence over its southern neighbor.
Pyongyang has apparently objected to China's plan to install the facilities, which could broadcast FM radio signals into North Korea.
Pyongyang sent an email complaining about the plan to the U.N. telecoms agency, the International Telecommunication Union, or ITU, saying Beijing failed to consult it about the plan in advance, which constitutes an ""infringement"" of an ITU guideline, Kyodo News reported this week.
The complaint was sent after the U.N. agency, which facilitates global communication connectivity, disclosed information in June about China's plan to set up 191 telecom facilities capable of broadcasting FM signals, including 17 stations near the North Korean border, according to Kyodo.
Pyongyang said those 17 stations, including the ones in the border city of Dandong, could cause ""serious interference.""
A spokesperson for ITU told VOA Korean that ""ITU cannot confirm whether or not it received such a complaint"" as ""such objections may contain sensitive or confidential information not intended for the general public and may hamper bilateral consultations.""
The spokesperson said China and North Korea have ""no formal obligation to get agreement from each other before registering FM stations with ITU or bringing them into service.
""Therefore, operation of FM stations in these countries without prior coordination does not represent an infringement of ITU's Radio Regulations,"" but ""such coordination is very much desirable and recommended to avoid interference.""
Patricia Kim, a fellow specializing in Chinese foreign policy at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said, ""It's quite notable that Pyongyang chose to publicly lodge a complaint with an international organization rather than to resolve this dispute with Beijing privately.""
""This is not how allies typically handle disputes, and the incident suggests that Beijing and Pyongyang are not on favorable or intimate terms at the moment,"" she said.
Lui Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Wednesday that China and North Korea ""have always maintained friendly relations"" and the ""relevant issue can be properly resolved through dialogue and communication.""
Growing signs of strain
Some signs of trouble have begun to show in the relationship between Pyongyang and Beijing since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un forged a close bond with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September 2023 when the two met in Russia.
Putin reciprocated Kim's visit by taking a trip to Pyongyang in June when the two signed a mutual defense treaty and vowed to deepen their military cooperation.
A few days after Putin's Pyongyang visit, North Korea switched its state TV broadcast transmission from a Chinese satellite to a Russian one, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.
In July, China demanded that North Korea take back all its workers in China after their visas expired, while Pyongyang wanted to repatriate them gradually over time, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
North Korean workers are thought to have remained in China despite U.N. sanctions that required them to be sent back by December 2019.
Analysts say China may have decided to put telecom facilities at the border to transmit information to North Koreans as a way to exert its influence in the country and to offset its strained ties with the regime.
Beijing ""could have made the decision not to put anything near the North Korean border, but they didn't do that,"" said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.
""China wants to dominate East Asia,"" and spreading Chinese propaganda and perspectives to promote its lifestyle and get people to buy from Chinese markets is ""a key part of China's plans for dominance in the region,"" he said.
China has been North Korea's largest trading partner. In 2023, North Korea conducted more than 98% of its foreign trade with China. But the trade between the two has been falling this year, dropping 6% in May from April, according to Chinese customs trade data released in May and reviewed by VOA Korean.
A report by the Korean Institute for International Economic Policy in Seoul forecasts that ""North Korea's exports are unlikely to increase significantly"" in 2024 ""as North Korea-Russia military cooperation is expected to continue.""
Military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow has branched into economic cooperation. On Wednesday, talks were held in Pyongyang between industry and trade representatives of North Korea and Russia on ""further developing the economic cooperation,"" according to state-run KCNA.
Fear of outside information
Even if Beijing does not intend to convey information directly to North Koreans, the regime might have objected to Chinese telecom stations because they provide an ""additional path through which information will be able to reach the country from the outside,"" said Martyn Williams, a senior fellow for the Stimson Center's Korea Program.
""Some of the new stations will be receivable inside North Korea, and it could be for this reason that North Korea has complained,"" Williams said.
North Korea is known to take tight control of information coming from the outside world, prohibiting media content that is not sanctioned by the government.
The regime cracks down harshly on people who receive outside information, especially South Korean drama and music, by sending them to prison with the penalty of months of hard labor or sometimes even death.
Michael Swaine, senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said despite North Korea's attempt to control information entering the country, the complaint about the Chinese telecom stations shows that ""Pyongyang does not control its broadcast space.""

The EDSCG serves as a key annual forum for the Alliance to discuss and coordinate on security strategy and policy issues affecting the Korean Peninsula and broader Indo-Pacific. The fifth EDSCG built on the progress of the previous years' meetings and carried forward the significant Alliance efforts to strengthen extended deterrence since the April 2023 announcement of the Washington Declaration.
In the meeting, participants shared assessments on the DPRK's dangerous and irresponsible behavior, including its ongoing missile launches and continued pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Both sides also shared concerns on the DPRK's recent reckless and dangerous behaviors along the DMZ that raise the risk of inadvertent escalation on the Peninsula.  Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula consistent with UNSC resolutions. The two sides committed to further enhance coordination to address DPRK sanctions evasion, including malicious cyber activities, and bolster deterrence against DPRK nuclear attacks, as well as non-nuclear WMD attacks, which pose a threat of high consequence, strategic-level attacks to the Alliance.  The United States reiterated its strong support for President Yoon's aim to open a path for serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK, and the goals of the ROK's Audacious Initiative. Both sides reaffirmed that they remain open to dialogue without preconditions.
The ROK and the United States condemned the military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including arms transfers, which are in direct violation of UNSC resolutions, and identified measures to address the challenge posed by increased DPRK-Russia security cooperation.  Both sides resolved to closely monitor what Russia provides to the DPRK and urged Russia and the DPRK to abide by the relevant UNSC resolutions.
The ROK and the United States recognized the deepening interconnectedness between the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic and discussed the implications for deterrence and U.S. nuclear posture. The two sides considered the impact of non-nuclear threats to the Alliance, including emerging technologies, and committed to leverage Alliance technology advantages to enhance the Alliance's deterrence and defense posture. They pledged to continue to utilize the diplomatic, informational, military, and economic tools available to the Alliance to strengthen deterrence and reinforce the U.S. security commitment to the ROK.  To that end, both sides committed to cooperating with likeminded partners to counter foreign misinformation on extended deterrence.  Both sides welcomed the significant advances made by the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) in its first year, including the completion and signing of the NCG Guidelines.  In the context of a deteriorating security environment, the principals conducted a scenario-based discussion, for the first time at the EDSCG, to strengthen policy planning and coordination.
Acknowledging mounting regional threats, the ROK and the United States committed to continue close cooperation to ensure that ROK and U.S. strategies and postures enhance peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.  The United States reiterated its ironclad commitment to draw on the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear, to support extended deterrence for the ROK.  Both sides reaffirmed that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the ROK will be met with a swift, overwhelming, and decisive response, and the United States reiterated that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the United States or its allies is unacceptable and will result in the end of that regime.
The co-chairs met with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell in the State Department Treaty Room, where they applauded the EDSCG as an enduring Alliance forum to strengthen extended deterrence through cooperation between both countries' diplomatic and defense establishments.  Following the meeting, the principals visited the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center and praised the rich history of the Alliance at a press conference, where they commended the continued progress of the EDSCG. The next high-level EDSCG meeting will be held in 2025.

RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AFNS) -- Two U.S. Air Force F-35 Lightning II aircraft assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing, Royal Air Force Lakenheath, United Kingdom, executed a historic, austere landing on a pre-designated highway in Finland Sept. 4, during exercise BAANA 2024.
The austere landing demonstrates advancements in the NATO alliance's ability to perform operations under the U.S. Air Force's agile combat employment concept and promotes closer integration among allied forces.
""The successful first-ever landing of our fifth-generation F-35 on a highway in Europe is a testament to the growing relationship and close interoperability we have with our Finnish allies,"" said Gen. James Hecker, commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa. ""The opportunity to learn from our Finnish counterparts improves our ability to rapidly deploy and employ airpower from unconventional locations and reflects the collective readiness and the agility of our forces.""
Since Finland's accession to NATO in 2023, it has provided U.S. Airmen with significant opportunities to learn from Finnish counterparts. Among the most recent activities, the Finnish Air Force was among nine national air forces to participate in the 1v1 air superiority exercise held in June at Ramstein. During that event, fighter aircraft and pilots from the nine nations participated in a series of aerial combat simulations."

Indonesia hosted a gathering of African leaders in Bali this week in a bid to grow economic and trade ties. But many African countries were not represented, with leaders opting to attend a separate forum in China.
The Indonesia-Africa Forum was seen as an opportunity for Southeast Asia's largest country to boost trade ties with Africa and seek out new export markets, but the three-day forum struggled to attract a large showing of African countries.
Even so, the Indonesian forum wasn't a wasted effort, with important discussions and outcomes, said Christophe Dorigne-Thomson, a foreign affairs academic based in Jakarta.
""But symbolically, for sure, the choice was made for China,"" he said.
Delegates from 29 nations made their way to the resort island of Bali for the summit, well short of the 47 African countries that were represented at the inaugural forum in 2018.
Despite the smaller turnout, Indonesia hopes to have sealed $3.5 billion in business deals from the summit. That would be nearly six times the amount generated in agreements during the first forum six years ago.
Dewi Fortuna Anwar, senior researcher at Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Agency, tracked the deals at the summit.
""There seem to be some concrete ... letters of intent, like Indonesia's aircraft industry signing deals with several countries and the oil companies also signing deals,"" Anwar said.
While some leaders skipped Bali for Beijing, there remains a strong sense of cooperation between Indonesia and the African continent.
Their ties date back to 1955 when the first Asian-Africa conference was held in the Indonesian city of Bandung.
Elina Noor, senior fellow in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Indonesia can use this history to its advantage.
""Jakarta can boast history and a legacy of relationship that stretches back to the Bandung conference. Indonesia has really sought to leverage on that historical relationship,"" Noor said.
At the forum in Bali, business was a key focus, but politics were also at play.
President Joko Widodo has looked to enhance Indonesia's standing on the international stage, promoting his country as a voice of the Global South. He is also keeping his country's options open as U.S.-China tensions simmer, said Dorigne-Thomson.
""It's a way for Indonesia to find a new way and not be stuck in that kind of geopolitical tension,"" he said. ""Africa is, for them ... a new way to serve their interests."""
CXBT1GLMYP_G2IPV6PDBMLY4ZN,Montenegrin President Says EU Shares Early Outlook On Membership,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/08/mil-240831-rferl06.htm,"By Andy Heil August 31, 2024
PRAGUE -- Montenegrin President Jakov Milatovic predicted on August 31 that his Balkan nation of under a million people will join the European Union within the next five years.
He also told the audience at the Globsec security conference in the Czech capital that he had spoken with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen the previous day and suggested she agrees.
Von der Leyen addressed the same forum in Prague on August 30.
""Now I truly believe, and I think that she also believes, that Montenegro can and will become [an EU] member state during her mandate,"" Milatovic said.
Von der Leyen was recently approved for a second five-year stint as president of the EU's executive arm, which should keep her in the post into the latter half of 2029.
She has not publicly commented on any discussions this week with Milatovic.
Speaking on a separate panel on August 31, the EU special representative for the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak, said Montenegro's goal of accession in 2028 was ""realistic.""
Montenegro has been an EU candidate country since 2010 and has long been regarded as a front-runner for the first wave of bloc expansion since Croatia joined in 2013.
Momentum waned for years over enlargement despite Balkan enthusiasm as the bloc grappled with its own internal problems, but it has publicly increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began early in 2022.
Milatovic, 37, a former finance minister elected president in early 2023, suggested at a panel discussion beside Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic that ""size matters"" in terms of the bloc's ability to absorb new members and Montenegro is the smallest of the Western Balkan aspirants.
But, describing himself as an ""optimist"" and Vucic a ""pessimist"" on EU enlargement, he also said Montenegro had been using the euro and aligning its foreign and security policies with the European Union for decades and been a NATO member since 2017.
Montenegro is the region's only EU aspirant to have opened all of its negotiating chapters with the European Union, Milatovic said, although he acknowledged it had closed just three.
But Milatovic added that his country had passed key barometers on rule of law and ""there is a hope that by the end of the year we will be ble to close a few new chapters.""

The Australian Government is deeply concerned by a series of dangerous and aggressive actions by China against the Philippines, including on 19, 25 and 31 August near Sabina Shoal.
This included the repeated and intentional ramming of Philippine vessels, causing structural damage, and the use of water cannons.
Australia shares the Philippines' condemnation of this destabilising and unacceptable conduct. It poses serious risks of harm to crew, and undermines recent commitments to de-escalate tensions in the South China Sea.
The Australian Government urges China to cease these actions, resolve disputes peacefully and adhere to international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and conventions on the prevention of collisions at sea.
Australia calls for restraint and reiterates that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties."

Tehran, IRNA -- Israeli media has admitted that the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah's drones have worried the occupying regime's security apparatus.
The Zionist regime's Channel 12 reported that the threat of drones on Israel's northern front has intensified, and Hezbollah drones left several dead and wounded and caused a lot of damage to Israel's infrastructure.
According to the report, Hezbollah is sending several drones into the occupied territories every day, with Israel's air defense not being able to intercept them due to the high power of these drones.
This report was released at the same time that Hezbollah targeted the Zionist settlements and bases in the north of occupied Palestine.
This news channel also reported that the Zionist regime's air defense intercepted and destroyed some of the missiles fired from Lebanon towards the West Al-Jaleel in the north of occupied Palestine.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday, marking his first visits to both Caribbean nations as the top U.S. diplomat.
Blinken's visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti, with additional humanitarian assistance anticipated as the country grapples with gang violence. His trip to Santo Domingo follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader's second term in mid-August.
A senior State Department official told reporters on Wednesday that the United States is prioritizing efforts with its international partners to set up a structure that ensures ""a reliable source of financing and staffing"" for a security mission in Haiti.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly considering the possibility of transitioning a largely U.S.-funded multinational security force into a traditional United Nations peacekeeping operation.
""A formal PKO (peacekeeping operation) is one of the ways that we could accomplish that, but we're looking at multiple ways to do that,"" said Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.
With about a month left in the mandate of the U.N.-ratified, Kenya-led Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti, progress has been limited, and many pledges remain unfulfilled.
""The one-year anniversary of the mission is October 2, and we're going to work to ensure that it's poised for success and renewal of its mandate in whatever form that takes,"" Nichols told VOA on Wednesday.
Multinational security support
Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to an unbearable living situation for the Haitian people.
In October 2022, Haiti requested the deployment of an international force to assist the Haitian National Police in combating heavily armed gangs and facilitating humanitarian aid. In October 2023, the United Nations Security Council authorized the MSS.
The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti. The estimated first-year cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S. has already provided $309 million â $200 million toward the MSS mission base and $109 million in financial support.
During a visit to Haiti in July, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced an additional $60 million in humanitarian assistance for the Haitian people, along with providing armored vehicles for the national police.
While in Haiti, Blinken will review the progress made toward improving security and encourage efforts to appoint the provisional electoral council so Haiti can move toward elections, according to the State Department.
Blinken will hold talks with Edgard Leblanc Fils, president of Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council, and Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille. Blinken also will meet with MSS head Godfrey Otunge and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police.
At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under the control of the Haitian authorities, with violence spreading to other parts of the country.
In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence grips the Caribbean nation. The United Nations reports that at least 578,000 people have been displaced due to violence, including murders, kidnappings and rapes.
The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half of the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity.
Gangs, some aligned with political elites, accumulated their control over territory and illicit markets during the tenure of the deeply unpopular former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who took office after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Henry resigned in April 2024 following the formation of a Transitional Presidential Council.
The Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region.
""In the Dominican Republic, we will reinforce our shared priorities such as promoting democratic governance, supporting free and fair elections in the region, and fighting corruption,"" Nichols told reporters.
On August 16, President Luis Abinader was inaugurated for a second four-year term. He has vowed to boost security by training more police over the next four years. His administration has barred migrants from neighboring Haiti.
""We certainly hope to see more normal relations between the Dominican Republic and Haiti,"" Nichols said. ""The countries are inexorably linked, and we certainly will have those conversations with leaders on both sides of the border.""
The U.S. and the Dominican Republic signed a historic Open Skies agreement on August 2. Once in effect, the agreement will expand opportunities for airlines, travel companies and people-to-people exchanges. More than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year.
The Dominican Republic is a crucial partner for the U.S. in hemispheric affairs, due to its position as the second-largest economy in the Caribbean, after Cuba, and the third-largest country by population, behind Cuba and Haiti. The U.S. is its primary trading partner.
Additionally, the Dominican Republic is home to Pueblo Viejo, one of the world's largest gold mines, and serves as a major global supplier of ferronickel.
The United States said it will continue robust collaboration with the Dominican Republic to advance inclusive economic growth, bolster democratic institutions, uphold human rights, and enhance governance and security.
The Dominican Republic and the United States, along with five Central American countries, are parties to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA-DR. This agreement enhances economic opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing barriers to services and promoting transparency.
The U.S. Agency for International Development is investing more than $9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican Republic's existing justice system and to reduce crime and violence."

The Ministry of Health in Gaza says it aims to vaccinate 600,000 children in the Strip, but acknowledges that this will be difficult due to the difficulty of accessing areas such as Rafah (south of the Strip), Al-Maghazi and Al-Bureij (central governorate), and others.
The Israeli army confirmed that six hostages had been killed as Israeli troops closed in on the tunnel where they were being held.  The bodies of six hostages captured by Hamas militants on October 7 had been retrieved from a tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, the Israeli military said on 01 September 2024. All the victims have been named. According to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Hersh Goldberg-Polin, aged 23, Eden Yerushalmi, 24, Ori Danino, 25, Alex Lubnov, 32, Carmel Gat, 40, and Almog Sarusi, 25 were killed by Hamas a short time before the military found them. Some of them were supposed to be released if a new exchange deal was reached with the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ).
The Israeli Health Ministry said that autopsies conducted on the bodies of the six hostages found in Gaza and then transferred to Israel showed that they were killed ""at very close range."" ""The six hostages were killed by Hamas terrorists who shot them at very close range,"" spokeswoman Shira Solomon said in a statement. She added that they ""apparently died between 48 and 72 hours before the autopsy, that is, between Thursday and Friday morning. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported on Sunday, quoting informed sources, that the autopsies of the bodies of the six hostages who were recovered from Gaza proved that they were all killed by bullets to the head.
The Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) held Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for the lives of the prisoners killed in Gaza on Sunday , after the occupation army announced the recovery of the bodies of 6 detainees after they were found inside a tunnel in the Strip. Hamas said in a statement that it holds Netanyahu fully responsible for the lives of the prisoners killed by Israeli bombing, stressing that US President Joe Biden ""should, if he cares about their lives, stop his support for the enemy.""
According to activist Mohammed Hassani, a ceasefire and complete withdrawal is the way to bring them back alive. He wrote, The way to free the prisoners is through a ceasefire, withdrawal, and lifting the siege. He continued the tweet, explaining his idea, As for military action, you will not bring them back except as lifeless bodies.  While tweeter Ahmed Al-Husseinawi believes that Israel has certain intentions behind the negotiations and military operations, he said, Their goal from the deal is to return their prisoners, and then exterminate most of the residents of Gaza after that, because there is nothing to fear after the hostages leave Gaza. For his part, activist Mohammed Master held the occupation responsible for killing the prisoners and wrote, ""This is the result of the Zionist enemy's crimes. If they had agreed to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners instead of bombing Gaza, they would have returned to their families like everyone else.""
Netanyahu remained silent for hours. Faced with unprecedented criticism from the opposition camp headed by Yair Lapid, the head of the ""National Camp"", Benny Gantz, and even from sources in the Likud party, he was forced to issue a video in which he apologized to the families of the kidnapped for not returning them to the country while they were alive. Public anger and resentment against Netanyahu and his government escalated with the revelation of the Israeli armys initial assessment, which states that the six kidnapped individuals were killed 24 to 48 hours before Israeli forces found them inside a tunnel in Rafah, about a kilometer from where the kidnapped Kayed Farhan al-Qadi was found.
Amid these developments and the revelation of information about the army's initial assessment, which revealed the military failure and failure to search for the prisoners and return them alive, calls were raised by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak for civil disobedience, paralyzing the economy, and a strike by the local government, in addition to expanding the scope of protests to include all parts of the country.
The news of the recovery brought calls for a massive demonstration from the Hostage Families Forum, which has criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to agree a hostage-for-peace deal with Hamas that had been under negotiation several months. It has demanded a complete halt of the country and the immediate implementation of a deal to release the hostages.
The Federation of Trade Unions in Israel [Histadrut] announced  a comprehensive economic strike in Israel tomorrow, Monday, in response to a call from the Forum of Families of Prisoners and Detainees in the Gaza Strip, to pressure Netanyahu's government. ""I will not tolerate abandoning the Israeli prisoners held in Gaza,"" said Histadrut (Israel's trade union federation) chairman Arnon Bar-David in a statement issued by his spokesman, in an attempt to pressure Benjamin Netanyahu and his government into concluding a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas.
In a related context, the Israel Business Forum, which includes 200 leading businessmen, decided to hold an emergency meeting this evening to support the protests. The forum confirmed, in a statement, its support for the demonstrations of the families of prisoners held in Gaza, calling on the public to ""not remain silent"" in the face of what it described as ""the daily loss of life and the abandonment of prisoners and leaving them to their fate,"" noting that they could be saved according to the security services' estimates.
The family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, the 23-year-old American-Israeli who was taken hostage from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, has announced his death. With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh, the family said in a statement posted to the Bring Hersh Home Instagram account on Sunday morning. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time. Rachel Goldberg and her husband addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, holding the convention center in rapt silence and gaining the attention of 20 million TV viewers as they called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and she buckled in pain as she addressed Hersh directly.
President Joe Biden acknowledged Goldberg-Polins death in a statement, saying, I am devastated and outraged. He revealed that Goldberg-Polin and other murdered hostages had been found in a tunnel below the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Praising Goldberg-Polins parents as relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages, Biden said, I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express. I know all Americans tonight will have them in their prayers, just as Jill and I will. I have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and am heartbroken by the news of his death.
US Vice President Kamala Harris stressed that the Goldberg family ""will not be alone in grieving this terrible loss."" ""Hamas is a terrorist organization based on evil,"" she said. ""With these killings, Hamas has more American blood on its hands."" Harris said: ""The threat posed by Hamas must be eliminated and it cannot control Gaza,""adding that ""the Palestinian people have also suffered under Hamas rule for nearly two decades.""
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum blamed Netanyahu and said it would mount protests. Netanyahu abandoned the hostages! the forum, the largest of several bodies representing the 107 or so hostages believed to be remaining in the Gaza Strip, said on X, in Hebrew. That is now a fact. Starting tomorrow, this country will quake. We call on the public to get ready. We are bringing the country to a stop! The abandonment is done!
Israeli news anchor and author Amnon Levy was even more critical of Netanyahu, saying in an article on the Yedioth Ahronoth website, The truth must be told: the gun that fired the shots belonged to Hamas, but the one who made the killing possible was Netanyahu, who preferred other goals to the lives of the kidnapped. ""Netanyahu left the kidnapped to die. After all, they were still alive until last week, according to the assessment of the IDF spokesman. They remained in the death tunnels for almost a year, and managed to survive the terror, hunger, and fear, until death came to them, due to Netanyahu's procrastination and evasion,"" he added.
Political affairs analyst at the Walla website, Tal Shilo, who directed harsh criticism at Netanyahu and his management of the prisoner exchange deal negotiations file, and his insistence on fighting and promoting that military pressure is the only guarantee and sufficiency to return the kidnapped Israelis while they are alive. Under the title The opposite, Netanyahu, the opposite: Military pressure does not bring back the kidnapped, but kills them, Shilo wrote an article in which she reviewed the repercussions of the cabinet vote to keep Israeli forces on the Philadelphi corridor, saying that in the last 48 hours and up until the news of the bodies being recovered, we finally became certain that Netanyahu simply does not want a swap deal and sacrificed the kidnapped to save his government. She believes that finding the bodies of the six kidnapped soldiers inside a tunnel reflects another fact, which is that ""Netanyahu does not intend to withdraw from Gaza in the next decade, and is preparing for a permanent Israeli military presence in the Strip.""
An Israeli security cabinet meeting about the hostage-release and Gaza ceasefire deal erupted on 29 August 2024 and turned into an unprecedented shouting match between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. At the cabinet meeting Gallant presented the case for moving forward toward a deal as soon as possible, Israeli officials said. The officials said the defense minister said the deal is not merely about the release of the hostages, but it is also a ""strategic juncture"" for Israel.
Gallant accused Netanyahu of forcing the maps of the IDF deployment along the Egypt-Gaza border on the IDF, despite the fact that the military's position is it can mitigate the risks of withdrawing forces from the area in order to reach a hostage deal. Netanyahu got mad, banged his hand on the table, accused Gallant of lying and announced he was bringing the maps to a cabinet vote on the spot, according to the prime minister's aides.
Gallant responded with a sharp attack of his own. ""As the prime minister you are authorized to bring to a vote any decision you want  including executing the hostages,"" the defense minister told Netanyahu. ""We have to choose between Philadelphi and the hostages. We can't have both. If we vote, we might find out that either the hostages will die or we will have to backtrack to release them,"" Gallant said. In the vote that followed, Gallant found himself isolated. Netanyahu and seven other ministers voted in favor of maintaining full military control over the Philadelphi corridor. Gallant was the only one who voted against the resolution, officials said.
Palestinian factions announced in successive statements that their fighters were engaged in violent clashes in a number of areas in the West Bank, especially in the city of Jenin. The WAFA news agency said that the Israeli forces ""shot two young men after opening fire on their vehicle at the entrance to the town, and prevented the Red Crescent crew from providing them with first aid, which led to their martyrdom. They were Abdullah Nasser Hammou and the child Muhammad Mahmoud Hammou, who was in the fifth grade from the town of Yamoun."" ""The two martyrs were distributing bread to citizens besieged on the outskirts of Jenin before they were assassinated,"" she said.
The Israeli army evacuated homes in Jenin camp in preparation for expanding the invasion. Witnesses said the army blew up a house near the club in Jenin camp, and also booby-trapped the Al-Ansar mosque in the camp in preparation for blowing it up. ""Our fighters are engaged in fierce clashes with enemy forces in the axis of Al-Ansar Mosque, and are showering infantry forces with heavy direct fire,"" the Al-Quds Brigades (Jenin Battalion) said in a statement. The Al-Quds Brigades (Tubas Battalion) also announced that its fighters ""carried out 5 operations to detonate explosive devices against enemy soldiers and vehicles."" The Al-Quds Brigades (Tulkarm Battalion) confirmed that its fighters ""entrapped a group of enemy foot soldiers in a tight ambush... and shot down a Zionist soldier in a sniper operation during the clashes.""
Hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza flared up when the Palestinian militant group conducted a surprise incursion into southern Israel ten months ago, killing around 1,100 people and taking more than 200 others hostage. Some were later released through prisoner swaps or rescued by the Israeli army. By the end of August 2024, the massive Israeli military response claimed nearly 40,700 lives, while 94,060 people have been wounded, according to Palestinian health officials.
Talks to bring about a truce and secure the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners have been conducted for months with mediation from Qatar, the US, and Egypt. Last month, Hamas rejected a renewed US proposal for a hostage release and ceasefire deal, accusing Netanyahu of sabotaging negotiations, and blaming Washington for supporting him. Israel said it could not accept Hamas demand to end the war in Gaza as a condition for a deal.	According to Israel, 251 Israelis and foreign nationals were taken during the 7 October raid, and 103 are still being held in Gaza.

Minister of Defence Jana ÄernochovÃ¡ held a meeting with her Swedish counterpart Minister PÃ¥l Jonson at the Defence Ministry. The Ministers signed a Joint Declaration on enhancement of defence cooperation between the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden. Both the declaration and the meeting agenda included participation of the Czech defence industry on the production on CV90 infantry fighting vehicles, further support for Ukraine and the future of the JAS-39 Gripen aircraft in the Czech Air Force.
The declaration defines key areas of cooperation, confirms its strategic significance and follows on the Memorandum of Understanding concluded between the Czech Republic and Sweden in 2002. ""The signature of the Joint Declaration both confirms the strategic level of our partnership and also sends a clear signal of our intention to further enhance it,"" said Minister ÄernochovÃ¡. ""Sweden's accession to NATO also unlocks new possibilities of cooperation. We need to perceive it not only through the optics of Russian aggression against Ukraine but also in the long-term perspective. We shall focus on strengthening the interoperability of our units which would together defend NATO's Eastern Flank, added the Minister ÄernochovÃ¡.
Regarding the support to Ukraine, Sweden is one of the countries that joined the Czech ammunition initiative designed to provide Ukraine with critically needed ammunition. ""I very much appreciate Czech Republic's leading role in supporting Ukraine. I believe the Czech ammunition initiative can serve as a role model for our future aid to countries under attack,"" said Swedish Defence Minister PÃ¥l Jonson. Sweden also provided Ukraine with military materiel and is among one of its largest supporters from the perspective of volume of aid donated.
The discussion also included the acquisition of 246 CV90 infantry fighting vehicles. Minister Jonson appreciated the Czech Republic's decision to purchase the vehicles. Czech industries, which will participate in their production for the Czech Armed Forces, can later be included in production of the vehicles for other European countries. According to Minister ÄernochovÃ¡, the participation of the Czech industry in the production of CV90 is key.
During the meeting, the Ministers also discussed continuation of the lease of JAS-39 Gripen aircraft for the Czech Air Force until the Czech Republic acquires the 5th generation F-35 aircraft. The current Gripen lease contract ends in 2027. The Ministry of Defence has received an offer from Sweden to extend the lease beyond 2027, but is not entirely satisfied with it.
""I cannot choose a specific example. Given that the negotiations are still ongoing, it would be neither correct nor tactical to publish details. That being said, we want to focus on the concept of the agreement as such and I believe I can mention that we also need a more detailed breakdown of the support and modernisation costs. The JAS-39 Gripen aircraft are nearing the last decade of their life cycle, maintenance costs are increasing and a costly modernisation is necessary. We answer to our tax payers and I want to be one hundred percent sure that the conditions for the Czech Republic are justifiable before the Government, as well as before the opposition and the Czech citizens,"" said Minister ÄernochovÃ¡ and added that she and her Swedish counterpart concurred that there is will to come to an agreement."
E4MYHOVPCG_H97VN8MWWKKRDNX,Israeli airstrikes kill dozens in Gaza as polio vaccination campaign begins,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/08/mil-240831-voa01.htm,"By VOA News August 31, 2024
Israeli airstrikes Saturday killed at least 42 people in central and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, the enclave's civil defense agency said, as fierce fighting continues ahead of a massive polio vaccination campaign.
The United Nations is preparing to inoculate about 640,000 children in Gaza against polio. The campaign is contingent on daily 8-hour breaks in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas that are to start Sunday, but one vaccination event began Saturday.
""There must be a cease-fire so that the teams can reach everyone targeted by this campaign,"" said Gaza's deputy health minister, Dr. Yousef Abu Al-Rish. He implored the international community to push for an end to the violence.
Later Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement saying, ""Israel will allow a humanitarian corridor only"" and ""areas will be established that will be safe for administering the vaccines for a few hours.""
Nearly three-quarters of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war that began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in an October 7 attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 107 hostages, including 42 the military says are dead.
Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 40,600 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Gaza health officials have said women and children make up the bulk of the dead; Israel has said most of the dead are combatants.
Violence in West Bank
In the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military announced Saturday that two Palestinians were killed overnight while allegedly preparing bombings. Their deaths came on the fourth day of a major Israeli military operation aimed at stopping attacks by Iranian-backed militant groups.
Since the operation began Wednesday, at least 23 Palestinians, including fighters and civilians, have been killed, the Israeli military said Saturday.
Israel has said its West Bank operation is to protect Israeli civilians from attack by Iranian-backed militant groups, including near settlements largely seen as illegal by the international community.
Hamas praised a recent operation in the southern West Bank as ""heroic."" Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, called the operation a ""coordinated attack.""
Israel's operations have focused on Jenin and its refugee camps, which are known for their resistance against Israeli forces.
On Saturday morning, an Agence France-Presse photographer in Jenin reported ongoing clashes. He said the streets were mostly empty except for armored vehicles, including one blocking the path leading to the government hospital.
Airstrike in southern Gaza
In southern Gaza, the group American Near East Refugee Aid, also known as Anera, said that an Israeli airstrike killed four Palestinians on Friday in the lead vehicle of a convoy delivering food and fuel to a hospital.
Anera said the convoy was following a ""coordinated and cleared transport plan"" with unarmed security guards. Israeli authorities said the vehicle was carrying weapons. Despite the attack, the convoy delivered aid to the Emirati-run hospital in Rafah.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, warned that attacks on aid workers are severely limiting aid delivery in Gaza.
OCHA underscored that the attacks endanger aid workers and impede efforts to assist more than 2 million people in need.

As delivered
03 September 2024
NEW YORK, 3 September 2024 -- ""Excellencies, distinguished delegates, colleagues, welcome to the second annual session of the UNICEF Executive Board for 2024.
""We have a busy session ahead of us, with critical issues to discuss, and important decisions to take. Thank you in advance for your engagement, and your contributions over the coming days.
""Thank you also to the President of the Board, and to the Bureau, for your leadership and guidance during this session, and throughout the year.
""Excellencies, we are coming together just days before the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and the Summit of the Future, two key opportunities for us to push children's rights to the top of the global agenda.
""It is imperative that we redouble our efforts. Because despite the tremendous progress we have made over the past two decades, millions of children around the world are still denied their rights to survive and thrive. Until we change this, by ensuring that the rights of all children are protected and upheld , we will not realize the promise of the global goals enshrined in the SDGs, and the Pact for the Future. We cannot fail in our mission to create a safer and more sustainable world for future generations.
""We can do it, but it is a long road ahead of us.
""Today, millions of children affected by conflict and other emergencies are being denied their fundamental rights, their rights to protection and shelter , to quality medical care and education , to nutritious food , and to living with their families in peace and safety.
""Nearly one year on from the brutal attack on Israel, and the start of the devastating war in Gaza, the situation for children in the region almost defies description. Israeli children have been killed and held hostage, and thousands have been displaced from their homes.
""In Gaza, more than 40,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, up to 60 per cent of whom are women and children. All of Gaza's nearly 1.1 million children need humanitarian assistance to survive, and most are now displaced inside an area smaller than 50 square kilometers. Hunger and acute malnutrition are widespread, and thousands of children have suffered grave rights violations.
""At the same time, the collapse of essential water, sanitation and health services has led to disease outbreaks. This includes an outbreak of polio that was first detected in July. We have already seen three suspected cases of paralytic polio in children, and we are deeply concerned that without urgent action, there could be widespread transmission of the disease throughout the Gaza Strip and beyond.
""WHO and UNICEF call on parties to the conflict to implement humanitarian pauses in Gaza so that we can continue the polio vaccination campaigns started over the weekend. Working with partners like UNRWA, we are hoping to reach 640,000 children under age 10 with two doses of oral polio vaccine. The immunizations have begun, but without sustained and predictable humanitarian pauses, the campaign will not succeed.
""After nearly a year of devastation in Gaza, this war must come to an end. Parties to the conflict must immediately agree to a durable ceasefire, facilitate the safe and immediate release of all remaining hostages, and adhere to their obligations under international law to protect children, and the infrastructure they rely on.
""At the same time, the armed conflict in Sudan rages on, ravaging the country's civilian population. Conflict, massive displacement and constraints on humanitarian access have resulted in devastating food insecurity, malnutrition and grave rights violations.
""In August, famine was declared in a camp sheltering hundreds of thousands of displaced people in the North Darfur Region. This marked the Famine Review Committee's first determination of famine anywhere in more than 7 years, and only the third time a famine determination has been made since the monitoring system was created 20 years ago.
""Given the horrific conditions across much of Sudan, we are concerned that without urgent action, famine could easily take hold in other parts of the country.
""The conflict is robbing Sudan's children of their right to protection from harm. Last year saw the highest number of verified grave rights violations against Sudanese children in more than a decade. Darfur, in particular, is one of the most dangerous places for children anywhere in the world. In 2023, the Darfur region accounted for more than 60 per cent of all verified grave rights violations that took place across the country, nearly three quarters of which involved the killing or maiming of children. Rates of gender-based and sexual violence against women and girls have also increased significantly.
""Here, I must reiterate that in terms of the number of children impacted, the humanitarian consequences of the war in Sudan are the most distressing we have seen in the past twenty years.
""If UNICEF and our partners do not get safe humanitarian access to reach all those in need, in both Government and RSF-controlled areas, including through cross-border operations, a devastating crisis will get even worse - with implications for the broader region.
""In June, I visited Port Sudan and saw firsthand how children, especially girls, are impacted every day by a conflict that has left more than half of the country's 24 million children in urgent need of assistance.
""I urge you to continue to advocate on behalf of the children of Sudan, to focus global attention on this crisis, to help us secure both humanitarian access on the ground, and funding, to end grave rights violations , and to push the parties to the conflict and those with influence over them to reach a ceasefire.
""Excellencies, the humanitarian community often speaks of so-called 'forgotten' emergencies. We may not see these crises on social media or major news broadcasts, but they are very real for the children and families living through them.
""In Myanmar, for example, an estimated 3.3 million people - nearly 40 per cent of whom are children - have been displaced by violence. This includes intensifying conflict in Rakhine State where UNICEF has received alarming reports that civilians, particularly children and families, are being targeted or caught in the crossfire, resulting in deaths and severe injuries.
""Or in Haiti, where the number of children internally displaced by violence has increased by an estimated 60 per cent since March - the equivalent of one child every minute.
""These children are at increased risk of violence, sexual assault, exploitation and abuse, and family separation. And many are facing disrupted access to services, including health care, clean water and sanitation.
""In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nearly 15 million children affected by conflict need humanitarian assistance and protection. We are working hard to contain a surging outbreak of a new, deadlier variant of the mpox virus. Since the start of the year, approximately 9,000 children have contracted the disease, almost 500 of whom have died.
""UNICEF has acted quickly, declaring a Level 3 emergency response, and coordinating with WHO and the Africa CDC.
""We are focusing on the countries with ongoing circulation of mpox, while also ensuring we are prepared to respond in other affected countries. The objectives of our response are to interrupt transmission, prevent morbidity and mortality, and limit the secondary impacts of the outbreak - especially for children.
""In each of the contexts, insecurity and conflict are preventing us from reaching children and families in need, costing innocent lives in the process.
""I would like to pause here to emphasize the unprecedented dangers faced by humanitarian workers in these settings, who are coming under attack at record levels. Since October last year, 250 aid workers have been killed in Gaza alone. While so far in 2024, 187 humanitarians have been killed globally.
""This is unconscionable.
""Parties to conflict have both a moral and a legal obligation to ensure that humanitarian partners can safely reach all those in need. We must redouble our advocacy efforts with the parties, as well as with those who have influence over them, to meet their obligations under humanitarian law.
""Despite the complexities of working on the ground in these crises, UNICEF and our partners stay, and we deliver. Every day we are reaching thousands of children and families with essential services and supplies, including safe water and sanitation, protection and psychosocial support, health and nutrition, medical supplies and vaccines, and education.
""And we continue to invest in early warning systems, anticipatory action, and preparedness measures so that we can respond quickly and effectively to emerging crises.
""Excellencies, here I wish to point out that approximately two-thirds of UNICEF's resources are directed towards our operations in humanitarian and fragile contexts. This is to be expected given the unprecedented levels of humanitarian need we see around the world today, and it underscores the importance of sustaining support for our humanitarian action.
""But core resources - one of UNICEF's most critical revenue streams - have been stagnating. Further reductions in core funding would reduce our capacity in both our humanitarian action and development work, including for critical oversight functions.
""Let me pause here to acknowledge the importance of UNICEF's partnerships in sustaining our work for children. This includes our National Committees, unique within the UN system, who play a critical role in advocacy, and fundraising. National Committee revenue makes up more than half of UNICEF's flexible income, and it is vital to our operations.
""I hope we can count on you to help increase funding for UNICEF, particularly for core resources, and quality thematic funding.
""This past July, I visited the Pacific region where I met with children and young people facing a range of challenges, including the very real and present threat of climate change. I look forward to discussing this topic with you during the Special Focus Session on climate change later this week.
""Excellencies, as you know, the ongoing threats to children's rights go beyond conflicts and the climate crisis. They include discrimination, increasing levels of poverty, and hostility to the concept of children as a distinct group of rights holders.
""Many countries struggle to provide essential services like healthcare and education for children. Despite significant progress made across a range of child wellbeing indicators over the last twenty years, millions of children are still being left behind.
""This November will mark 35 years since the 1989 adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. By ratifying this international legal framework, world leaders acknowledged that all children have inalienable rights. And they promised that governments would protect and uphold those rights, a promise which too often falls short.
""Each of us plays a critical role in ensuring that the rights of every child are realized. UNICEF and our partners in the child rights community, governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector must be stronger advocates for the fulfillment, and protection of children's rights.
""This means supporting the alignment of national legal frameworks with the CRC, and other international standards, and putting those standards into practice. It also means reaffirming children's status as distinct, independent rights holders, and ensuring accountability for violations of children's rights wherever they occur.
""And it means seizing key opportunities over the remainder of the year to advance the child rights agenda. These include the General Assembly, and Summit of the Future later this month, as well as COP-29 in November.
""At both the General Assembly, and the Summit of the Future, we will reiterate UNICEF's call to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Given that we are currently on track to meet just 15 per cent of the SDGs by 2030, it is imperative that world leaders heed this call to action.
""I hope you will join us in advocating for cost-effective, evidence-based policy solutions that can be implemented across countries regardless of income. These are solutions that can effectively tackle the root causes of inequality, generating benefits for children's overall wellbeing. We know that when we invest in systems that lift up children, communities flourish, and economies thrive.
""More specifically, we will continue to urge governments to increase investment and action in critical thematic areas, which include, ensuring nutrition in the early years to improve survival, growth and development, increasing global immunization coverage, improving access to quality education, and services for adolescent girls to boost life-long economic prospects, expanding climate mitigation and adaptation measures, and strengthening child benefits, and social protection to reduce poverty.
""Excellencies, as part of our efforts to accelerate progress on the SDGs, and to advance the child rights agenda, UNICEF has been developing our Africa strategy. The strategy - which we will present later this week - aims to work with African governments to seize the opportunity of demographic change across the continent.
""Almost 250 million children will join Africa's child population over the next 25 years, and by the year 2100, there will be more children in Africa than anywhere else in the world.
""In line with the SDGs and UNICEF's Strategic Plan, the Africa strategy features several key areas for action: accelerating human capital development, enhancing resilience, climate action and humanitarian action, and renewing commitments to the African Charter on the Rights, and Welfare of the Child.
""The African Union has set bold goals for its children, and young people in its development plans, including the Agenda for Children 2040, and Agenda 2063. We must match these plans with action, investment, and partnership. UNICEF stands ready to deliver.
""We will have an opportunity to engage further on the Africa strategy during our discussions on Wednesday.
""Excellencies, before closing, I would like to say a few words on UN Development System Reform, which UNICEF fully supports.
""As we look to our Strategic Plan cycle, we believe the forthcoming Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review will be critical, especially to ensuring alignment of UN activities with national priorities, and SDG targets.
""UNICEF is recommending that the QCPR incorporate several key additions. These include specific language on child rights mainstreaming, a child-centric approach to digital equality, expanding the framework of PSEA to encompass general safeguarding measures from all forms of harm, addressing the complexities of working across the humanitarian-development nexus, and full support for the new Funding Compact 2.0.
""Excellencies, colleagues, friends, it is sobering to consider how much the world has changed since we met at this time last year, the war in Gaza, famine in Sudan, advancements in artificial intelligence, wildfires, storms and warming seas, disease outbreaks, and groundbreaking vaccines. All of this continues to have profound implications for the world's children, and more changes are sure to come before the year is out.
""UNICEF's mission is to be there for all children during these challenging times, and to ensure that their rights are protected and upheld. Thank you for being our steadfast partners in this mission, and for working hand-in-hand with us until the mission is complete - for every child.
""Thank you, and I wish us all a productive session.""

E5L39AYWUY_6T7UMCX6I7551KU,Britain defends Israeli weapons export ban as Europe mulls sanctions,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/israel/2024/09/israel-240904-voa01.htm,"By Henry Ridgwell September 04, 2024
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended his government's decision to suspend some arms shipments to Israel Wednesday, saying the move was necessary to comply with international law.
""We absolutely recognize and support Israel's right to self-defense and have taken action in support of that right of self-defense. ... But in relation to licenses, this isn't an Israel issue. It's the framework for all licenses that have to be kept under review,"" he said.
""We either comply with international law or we don't. We only have strength in our arguments because we comply with international law,"" Starmer told lawmakers in Parliament.
Israel has strongly criticized the move and said it would only serve to strengthen Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel invaded the Palestinian territory after Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people and took 253 hostages in a cross-border terror attack on October 7.
Britain on Monday suspended around 30 of the 350 licenses for weapons exports to Israel after a legal review. Foreign Secretary David Lammy made the announcement in parliament on Monday.
""The assessment I have received leaves me unable to conclude anything other than that for certain U.K. arms exports to Israel, there does exist a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law,"" Lammy told lawmakers, adding that the export bans include ""equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza, such as important components which go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items which facilitate ground targeting.""
The British move will have little impact on the Israel Defense Forces' operations, said Middle East analyst Yossi Mekelberg of the London-based policy institute Chatham House. ""Most of Israel's weapons and ammunition come actually from the United States and Germany. It amounts to nearly 99% of the arms supplied to Israel.""
But the symbolism of Britain's move is significant, Mekelberg said.
""Suspension sends a clear message that you can be a friend of Israel, you can support Israel â including Labour [the ruling party] â supportive of Israel, especially after October 7, and rightly so. But at the same time to disagree fundamentally with the way Israel conducts the war and how it uses weapons,"" he said.
""I think we can start seeing a change [in Britain's approach], and I think what some of us wonder is if it will go as far as recognizing a Palestinian statehood. This probably would be the biggest step forward,"" Mekelberg said.
Andreas Krieg, a fellow of the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies at Kings College London, said the political impact of the export ban would outweigh the practical implications.
""The U.K. might not be the strongest hard power in the Middle East, but it has significant soft power and influence. It shows that for the very first time that a very close partner and ally of Israel doesn't trust the Israeli government, when they're saying that they are complying with the laws of armed conflict,"" Krieg told VOA.
""The fact that the U.K. is now saying that there are potential doubts is casting bigger doubts over Israel's campaign and the complicity of other countries as well, including Germany and the United States, in aiding and supporting Israel's campaign, particularly in Gaza, but also potentially in the West Bank,"" he said.
""Other European countries might want to now revisit their arms export licenses and to what extent their weapons are being used in what could be seen as an illegal war, a partially illegal war in Gaza,"" Krieg said.
Washington paused the export of large 1-ton bombs to Israel in May over concerns that they could be used in a ground invasion of the city of Rafah but has continued to supply billions of dollars' worth of other weapons.
Germany, which supplies about 39% of Israel's arms imports, has not said it plans to suspend any arms shipments.
Israel strongly denies breaking international law in Gaza and claims it targets only Hamas militants, whom it accuses of hiding in schools, hospitals and mosques and using human shields.
Critics accuse the Israel Defense Forces of conducting indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and targeting basic infrastructure. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli operation began, most of them women and children. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes.
The Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants. The U.S., the U.K. and other Western countries designate Hamas as a terror group.
Writing on the social media platform X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized Britain's move to ban some arms exports.
""Days after Hamas executed six Israeli hostages, the UK government suspended thirty arms licenses to Israel. This shameful decision will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that savagely murdered 1,200 people on October 7, including 14 British citizens.""
""Hamas is still holding over 100 hostages, including 5 British citizens. Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain's misguided decision will only embolden Hamas. Israel is pursuing a just war with just means, taking unprecedented measures to keep civilians out of harm's way and comporting fully with international law,"" Netanyahu wrote on Tuesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets of Tel Aviv to protest Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza and the failure to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
""I think there's a growing divide between the Israeli public and Israeli national interest, and the Netanyahu government. So, siding or moving against the Netanyahu government is now seen less and less so as moving against Israel as a whole, or the Israeli public,"" said analyst Andreas Krieg.
Meanwhile the European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell last week proposed sanctioning two unnamed Israeli government ministers, accusing them of having a ""colonial agenda"" in the occupied West Bank. Israel is conducting an ongoing raid against militants in the territory, focused on refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarem. Israeli settlers are accused of forcibly seizing Palestinian land in the West Bank with the support of the IDF, which Israel denies.
""We are ... witnessing a formal radicalization on the part of some members of the Israeli far-right for whom Gaza has always been a minor issue compared with the West Bank and Jerusalem. Maybe, they don't care about the settlements in Gaza, since any return to calm would make it more difficult to pursue the colonial agenda they have for the West Bank, the expansion of the colonies,"" Borrell told reporters in Brussels on August 29.
Any decision on sanctioning Israeli ministers would require unanimity among EU member states. Borrell said that threshold had not been met."
E6KYDREU3D_7GIXTXNYF8SNDA2,Gaza: UN humanitarians ahead of polio vaccination target,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-unnews01.htm,"3 September 2024 - The UN World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that 161,030 children under 10 have been vaccinated in central Gaza during the first two days of the UN-led mass vaccination campaign, surpassing the initial target of 156,000. The figure amounts to around a quarter of the total population they aim to reach - some 640,000 children.
""We think that we will need another day tomorrow to actually wrap-up the central zone completely,"" said Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT).
Speaking from Gaza, he explained that day three of the campaign was continuing during the eight-hour daily pauses agreed by the Israeli military and Hamas fighters.
Each ""humanitarian pause"" is meant to last from 06:00 until 15:00 local time, with the possibility of adding an extra day if required.
Further rounds
The WHO medic explained that vaccination teams will shift to the larger southern zone on Thursday for another three days and most likely a fourth, before they turn to the northern zone. ""Four weeks later the process will be repeated for the second round of vaccination,"" he added.
Reaching the northern part of the Strip remains a concern, as the WHO has tried to get missions to the north over the last two weeks to provide hospitals with essential medical supplies.
""From the eight or nine missions we planned, only three or four could go,"" he said. An Emergency Medical Team (EMT) was deployed to the Indonesian Hospital and a paediatric doctor to Kamal Adwan Hospital in addition to medications and other supplies.
The journey back to base involved a seven-hour wait for authorization to proceed to the holding point, with an additional 2.5 hours for screening at the checkpoint. Nearly 11 months into the war, the deconfliction process is still not effective, Dr. Peeperkorn maintained.
90 per cent rate
According to the UN health agency, at least 90 per cent of Palestinian children need to be vaccinated for the campaign to be effective and to prevent the circulation of polio within Gaza and globally.
The Gaza Strip had a high level of vaccination coverage across the population before the conflict began in October 2023. Due the impact of the war, routine immunization coverage dropped from 99 per cent in 2022 to less than 90 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases to children, including polio.
Asked about whether it might be possible to assess other deeply worrying health issues such as malnutrition among children while the vaccination teams are working, Dr. Peeperkorn said that there was no spare capacity to do so.
""It's a very intense campaign. You want to do it as quickly as possible over as least number of days as possible. With all the complexities now in Gaza, we decided we cannot add anything in this campaign. If we see that more activities are possible in the second round, four weeks from now, we will definitely do that.""
The polio vaccination campaign comes amid the massive destruction of Gaza's healthcare infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems, and after health officials detected the first case of polio in Gaza in 25 years, in a 10-month-old baby in a refugee camp. The virus can cause paralysis and even death in young children.
Relentless danger
While UN humanitarian agencies welcomed the humanitarian pauses in specific areas to allow the large-scale polio vaccination campaign, they emphasized the urgent need for the immediate release of all remaining hostages and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. ""Once these children have been vaccinated, they will go back to areas that in the coming week, we imagine, will be bombed again,"" warned James Elder, spokesperson for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF).
""There is nothing in that, that should be accepted as normal,"" he continued. ""And I think that everyone now accepts that the talks on ceasefires are just talks for us to continually think that there's hope there.
""After 10 months, we might be a little bit naive. So, something has to give, and that again, has to fall on those leaders needing to represent their people."""

August 31, 2024- Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada
Today, Global Affairs Canada issued the following statement:
""Two years have passed since the UN Office of the High Commissioner   for Human Rights released a landmark assessment, detailing grave human   rights violations in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. The   assessment describes serious human rights violations that have been   committed in Xinjiang, and notes that the extent of arbitrary and   discriminatory detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities   may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against   humanity.
""After the assessment was released, Canada called on the Chinese   government to uphold its international human rights obligations and   respond to the grave concerns and assessment recommendations.
""Two years later, China has not taken meaningful steps to address   these concerns despite ongoing calls from Canada, other governments, UN   experts, human rights organizations, victims' groups and the global   Uyghur diaspora.     ""Reports continue to point to systemic human   rights violations by Chinese authorities. Uyghurs are forced into labour   in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China. Religious practice, particularly   Islam, is limited, with mosques being the first to be massively   targeted.    ""UN experts have also expressed concerns that   children are being forced into state-run residential schools in Xinjiang   and other parts of China. Instead of addressing these concerns with   transparency, China denied the findings and blocked discussion at the UN   Human Rights Council.
""Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs MÃ©lanie Joly has raised   Canada's concerns with Wang Yi, China's Director of the Office of the   Central Commission for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs,   and Canada's Ambassador to the People's Republic of China Jennifer May   also raised them with local officials during her recent visit to   Xinjiang.
""Canada calls on China to address the concerns raised in the UN   assessment and to implement its recommendations without delay. This   includes allowing UN independent experts access to Xinjiang and to other   regions of China to assess conditions.
""Canada will continue to work with its international partners to   address the situation in Xinjiang and to ensure the Chinese government   is held accountable for its actions."""

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
""To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]
The UK Ministry of Defence  reported that as the school year begins across Russia, the Russian state is introducing and funding a new military training module. The module is part of a new programme called Foundations of Security and Defence of the Motherland for 15 to 18 year olds. The course has 11 modules, requiring 68 teaching hours. The course will cover a range of topics including combined arms combat and small arms familiarisation. It is aimed at ""forming values, acquiring knowledge and skills that ensure readiness to fulfil the constitutional duty to protect the State.""
The programme seeks to create and will likely result in a more militarised and security focused society. The new youth strategy which was approved by the government in August 2024 aims at raising the prestige of military service, instilling patriotism, and civic duty responsibility, but primarily prepare pre-conscription age teenagers mentally and physically for military service.
There is additionally an increase in the number of summer camps for children which engage in various military activities. The strategy notes that in the last 30 years youth values had shifted from collectivism to individualism and from statism to cosmopolitanism. It claims that the ideological expansionism of Russia's geopolitical competitors had led to the weakening of traditional values and growth of individualism. The new strategy aims to reverse that process, with the militarization of youth as an integral part of that process.
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Defense Forces of Ukraine continue to withhold the pressure of the Russian occupation troops.

Tehran, IRNA -- A Palestinian fighter ran over an Israeli guard in the settlement of Karmei Tzur with a car, then entered the settlement and shot at some Zionists, Israeli news outlets reported on Saturday.
According to the Palestinian Sama news agency, the Israeli media reported that the shooting operation was carried out after a car bomb exploded at the entrance to the settlement.
The reports also said that two Israelis were wounded in this retaliatory operation.
The regime's army has also declared that the operation has not come to an end and that the assault is still underway around this settlement.
Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the regime's troops fired at the fighter who carried out the operation.
Media reports show that the regime's army has dispatched a large number of its forces to this incident area.
Yedioth Ahronoth also reported that there may be a connection between the operations in Karmei Tzur and Gush Etzion, where two people were injured.
Hamas issued a statement on Saturday, labeling the ""double operation"" conducted in the early morning as ""heroic,"" which led to the martyrdom of two Palestinians following explosions at a gas station in Gush Etzion and within the unauthorized Israeli settlement of Karmei Tzur located south of Beit Lahm town in the occupied territory.

Israeli forces delay people's access to care by obstructing access to health facilities, blocking traffic and targeting ambulances in the West Bank city of Jenin, amid the regime's deadly assault on the city that has entered its fifth day, says Doctors Without Borders.
The international organization, known by its French initials MSF, said in a statement on social media platform X that the regime's brutal assault on Jenin is ""alarming.""
The charity said that ""in the MSF-supported Khalil Suleiman Hospital, which has been surrounded by Israeli Forces since the start of the incursion, electricity and water supplies are compromised.""
""The medical team has been forced to halt dialysis operations, key for the treatment of kidney failure.""
""Israel must adhere to its obligations as an occupying power in the West Bank, including access to medical care. Hospitals, ambulances and the medical humanitarian mission must be respected and protected,"" MSF said.
On Saturday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli troops fired at one of its ambulances in Jenin, despite its entry was coordinated ahead of time.
Israel's invasion of the West Bank, the largest seen in the city in decades, has killed at least 24 people since Wednesday.
The UN human rights office, (OHCHR) has warned that the regime's hostilities in the West Bank risked further enflaming an ""already explosive situation,"" in the territory."

Monday, 02 September 2024 6:55 PM
The British government has announced its decision to partially ban arms exports to the Israeli regime, amid criticisms of the UK's indirect involvement in the Gaza genocide.
UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told parliament on Monday that the partial ban would suspend 30 out of 350 arms export licenses for arms manufacturers supplying military equipment to the Israeli regime.
Lammy -- who had been tasked by the UK government to prepare an assessment on the chances of the Israeli regime violating international laws in its continued onslaught on Gaza -- told lawmakers that there is a ""clear risk"" that the banned weapons and ammunition provided by British weapons companies could be used to kill innocent Palestinians in a serious breach of international humanitarian law.
He said the government's ban had included weaponry ""which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza"" against helpless Palestinian people, mostly women and children, trapped under Israeli fire in the besieged Gaza Strip.
However, he also pointed out that UK weapons manufacturers, which made the parts for warplanes that were vital for the Israeli jet fighters bombing Gaza on an almost daily basis, were not listed in the ban.
The suspension comes after months of pro-Palestinian protests in London and other cities demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and also a halt in British arms sales to Israel.
Since the start of Israel's genocidal war on Gaza, the UK, and to a much larger extent the US, has been supplying all kinds of arms and munitions to the Israeli regime.
Media reports have revealed many of the weapons and ammunition shipments of arms manufacturers' goods to the Israeli regime are done quietly, without formal notification of governments, or the public knowing about it.
The unofficial deliveries include thousands of rockets, missiles, a variety of bombs, rifles, munitions, and other weapons, and equipment.
London also claims that the UK sales exports of military equipment and goods to the Israeli regime are ""relatively small"" compared to the US.
According to the UK government, British arms sales to Tel Aviv amounted to Â£42mn ($53mn) only in 2022.
However, the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licenses to Israel worth Â£574mn ($727mn), in total. Much of those are for components used in US-made warplanes that end up in Israel.
Meanwhile, the British government is coming under mounting pressure to suspend arms sales exports to Tel Aviv.
Tens of thousands of Britons have taken to Britain's streets on multiple occasions in a nationwide rally against arming Israel.
The previous UK prime minister claimed London abides by a ""very careful export licensing regime"" and said Israel must ""act in accordance with international humanitarian law"". However, a senior member of the government has informed British media that a full arms and ammunition embargo of the Israeli regime is ""not going to happen"" in the UK, not now, not ever; neither by Whigs nor by Tories.
The death toll of Palestinians in Gaza in the relentless Israeli strikes since early October has reached 40,786, with at least 94,224 more injured, according to health officials."

Wednesday, 04 September 2024 6:06 AM
Fighters from the Iraqi anti-terror resistance groups have launched a drone strike against a strategic target in the northern part of the 1948 Israeli-occupied territories in response to the Tel Aviv regime's devastating war on Gaza.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of anti-terror fighters, in a statement published on its Telegram channel on Wednesday morning, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Port of Haifa, stressing that the strike was carried out with a squadron of kamikaze drones.
It said the drone strike was carried out in continuation of the struggle against the occupying Israeli regime, in support of Palestinians in Gaza, and in retaliation for the massacres that the usurping Zionist entity is perpetrating against women, children, and elderly people in the besieged territory.
The group noted that it will continue to target and destroy important installations across the occupied lands.
This comes after the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for a drone strike against a ""vital target"" in the same port on Sunday.
The coalition announced in a statement at the time that the strike had come ""in support of our people in Gaza, and in response to the massacres committed by the usurping entity against Palestinian civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.""
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has been launching attacks on Israeli targets ever since the occupying regime started the genocidal war on Gaza in early October.
It has been also hitting American military bases in Iraq and neighboring Syria in retaliation for Washington's support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza.
Israel has been waging an atrocious onslaught against the Gaza Strip, targeting hospitals, residences, and houses of worship after Palestinian resistance movements launched a surprise attack, dubbed Operation al-Aqsa Storm, on October 7 last year.
At least 40,819 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children, and another 94,291 individuals have sustained injuries in Gaza so far. More than 1.7 million people have been internally displaced during the war as well."

Sunday, 01 September 2024 10:58 PM
Hundreds of thousands of protesters have flooded the streets of Tel Aviv and the occupied city of al-Quds to demand a deal to secure the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza.
On Sunday night, the protesters set off flares on major roads and blocked a main highway in Tel Aviv while chanting slogans.
They called on the regime's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to reach a cease-fire deal with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas after the Israeli military found the bodies of six captives held in the besieged Palestinian territory.
The demonstration was the biggest anti-Netanyahu protest since the onset of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza.
Israeli troops clashed with protesters, using violent force to disperse them. A large number of protesters were also arrested.
In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of captives held in Gaza, said the death of the six hostages was the direct result of Netanyahu's failure to secure a deal to halt the fighting and bring their loved ones home.
""They were all murdered in the last few days, after surviving (for) almost 11 months,"" the forum said.
Israel's largest trade union has called a general strike on Monday to further pressure the regime's cabinet for a prisoner swap deal.
The strike is expected to disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, healthcare and Israel's main airport.
In a statement released on Sunday, Arnon Bar-David, the head of Israel's Histadrut union ordered a ""complete strike"" in support of captives.
He called on all workers to join the strike and said main Ben Gurion airport would be closed from Monday morning.
This would be the first general strike since Israel launched its campaign of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip in early October last year.
A general strike last year during Netanyahu's controversial judicial overhaul helped lead to a temporary delay in the plan.
More than 100 Israeli and foreign captives are still in Gaza. Around a third of them, however, are known to have died in the regime's strikes, with the fate of others still unknown.
Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military announced it had recovered the bodies of six captives from a tunnel in Gaza, sparking anger among Israelis against Netanyahu's regime.
Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for failing to bring them back alive in a deal with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas to end the aggression.
Negotiations over such a deal have dragged on for several months.
Netanyahu has taken a tough line in Gaza ceasefire negotiations and repeatedly said that military pressure is needed to bring home the captives.
The US-Israeli genocide in Gaza continues with no end in sight as the regime presses ahead with its air and artillery strikes across the besieged strip.
The Israeli aggression against Gaza began last October.
Since then, nearly 40,700 people have been killed and over 94,000 others injured.
Hunger, malnutrition and lack of medical supplies are also taking a heavy toll on Gaza."

Sydney, Aug. 31 (CNA) A communique issued by the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) that mentioned support for Taiwan has been taken down and later republished on Saturday with the country's name no longer mentioned, due to pressure from China.
In response, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) condemned China for its ""irrational behavior"" which undermines regional peace and stability, while calling on like-minded countries to keep close tabs on Beijing's actions and safeguard the harmonious and stable development of Pacific island countries.
MOFA added that the communique will not affect Taiwan's status in PIF or its right of future participation, and thanked Taiwan's diplomatic allies and like-minded countries' support for the country's continued participation in PIF.
The 18-member PIF, an inter-governmental organization, held its 53rd summit this year from Aug. 26-30 in Tonga. Despite being a nonmember, Taiwan has been an active participant of the annual event under the status of ""development partner"" since 1993.
Nonmembers including China, the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union also participate in the annual forum and other PIF events as ""dialogue partners.""
When the forum wrapped up on Friday, the PIF posted a joint communique on its website which contained a line reaffirming the decades-long arrangements regarding Taiwan.
""Leaders at the forum reaffirmed the 1992 Leaders decision on relations with Taiwan/Republic of China,"" the PIF was quoted as saying under paragraph 66 of the communique.
On Friday evening, the communique was taken down from the PIF website.
It was republished online the next day, but with paragraph 66 about Taiwan no longer included.
According to a Nikkei Asia report on Friday, its reporters had witnessed a ""visibly angry"" Qian Bo (é¢æ³¢), China's special envoy for the Pacific, confront the PIF Secretary General Baron Waqa and tell him that the statement about Taiwan in the communique was ""unacceptable.""
Qian then spoke with Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Peter Shanel Agovaka, and later turned his attention to reporters outside the venue, the report said.
""Taiwan is part of China. Taiwan is not a dialogue partner of PIF, so China has the representation on behalf of the whole China, including Taiwan and the mainland,"" Qian was quoted as saying in the report.
Nikkei Asia also reported that Qian said the reference on Taiwan ""must be a mistake,"" as 15 of the 18 PIF members ""have categorically stated they abide by the 'One-China' principle.""
""This is a surprising mistake made by someone, I'm not sure, but it must be corrected,"" he added.
The PIF members currently include three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies -- Palau, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu.
The PIF's altered communique came after a report in The Australian newspaper earlier this week claimed that the Solomon Islands would table a motion at this year's summit to strip Taiwan of its ""development partner"" status.
According to an anonymous source cited by the Australian, the Solomon Islands received explicit instructions from Beijing to block Taiwan's attendance at next year's summit of PIF countries, which will be held in the Solomon Islands' capital Honiara.

Tehran, IRNA -- The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) has reported a new attack on a vessel off the coast of Yemen.
In a statement on Monday, UKMTO announced that two unidentified projectiles hit a merchant vessel, 70 nautical miles northwest of Yemen's port of Saleef.
A third explosion occurred nearby, but no casualties were reported.
Separately, an investigation is underway for an incident 58 nautical miles west of Hodeidah.
There have been no comments from Yemen to the latest reports as of yet.
Yemenis have declared their open support for Palestinians' resistance against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched its devastating war on Gaza on October 7 after Operation Al-Aqsa Storm by Hamas resistance movement against the occupying entity.
In a show of that support, Yemeni Armed Forces have been attacking Israel-linked vessels in the high seas since mid-November, saying that they won't stop their attacks until unrelenting Israeli ground and aerial offensives in Gaza come to an end. Since the start of the war, more than 40,700 Palestinians have been killed and over 94,000 others injured in Gaza.

The EU condemns the dangerous actions by Chinese Coast Guard vessels against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea on August 31. The incident is the latest of several such actions during the past months, which endanger the safety of life at sea, and violate the right to freedom of navigation and overflight to which all nations are entitled under international law.
The EU insists that the UN Charter, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other relevant international norms relating to the safety of life at sea, as well as the Arbitration Award of 2016, should be upheld and respected at all times. This includes, in particular, the prohibition on the use of force or coercion, and the right to freedom of navigation and overflight.
The EU condemns all unlawful, escalatory and coercive actions that undermine these principles of international law and threaten peace and stability in the region.
The European Union calls for de-escalation of tensions, and remains committed to supporting its partners seeking to exercise their legitimate rights, in the region and beyond."

Monday, 02 September 2024 1:41 AM
The military wing of the Hamas resistance movement has released a video message addressing the families of the Israeli captives in Gaza.
The Al-Qassam Brigades said on Sunday the regime's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not care about the fate of the captives.
The video was released after the bodies of six Israeli captives were found in Gaza.
The Al-Qassam Brigades said the six captives were alive before the regime's latest strikes and were supposed to be released in the first phase of a prisoner swap deal.
The group added that Israeli forces have already killed many prisoners ""deliberately"" and recovered their bodies.
The Al-Qassam then cited a press statement by Netanyahu regarding the captives in which he said he would choose the control of a southern Gaza corridor to return the captives.
The video also included pictures of the six captives whose bodies were recovered.
The Al-Qassam told their families that Netanyahu had chosen the control of Philadelphia Corridor over the liberation of the captives.
Hamas blames Israel and US for deaths
Earlier in the day, Hamas blamed Israel and the United States as the main culprits for the death of six Israeli captives.
The movement said the responsibility for the death of the Israeli captives lies with the occupying regime, which continues its genocide in Gaza and evades a ceasefire agreement.
Hamas also held the US responsible for supporting Israel and being an accomplice in the war.
The resistance movement urged the US president to stop providing financial and military support to the Zionist regime and pressure it to stop the war.
Hamas added that some of the six captives had already been approved to be released in the event of a truce deal.
Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military announced it had recovered the bodies of six captives from a tunnel in Gaza, sparking anger among Israelis against Netanyahu's regime.
Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for failing to bring them back alive in a deal with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas to end the aggression.
Negotiations over such a deal have dragged on for several months.
Netanyahu has taken a tough line in Gaza ceasefire negotiations and repeatedly said that military pressure is needed to bring home the captives."

Rights advocates say Chinese authorities' recent detention of dissident artist Gao Zhen and prominent citizen journalist Zhang Zhan are the latest sign of an escalating crackdown on dissent in China.
Gao, a prominent artist known for creating provocative sculptures of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong, was detained by Chinese police on August 26 for ""slandering Chinese heroes and martyrs."" More than 30 police raided his studio and confiscated several pieces of artwork related to Mao and the Cultural Revolution, a tumultuous period that China's founding leader launched in the 1960s and lasted until 1976.
Mao launched the movement to reassert ideological control with attacks on intellectuals and so-called counterrevolutionaries, which scholars estimate led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people.
His brother and main artistic collaborator Gao Qiang told VOA Tuesday that Gao's wife received a notification from northern Hebei province's Sanhe public security bureau on August 27. The notification said Gao had been detained under the charge of insulting and slandering Chinese heroes and martyrs, a law passed in 2018 that carries a maximum sentence of three years.
""The police mainly targeted artworks critiquing the Cultural Revolution, but these works were created more than 10 years ago, which predate the law that came into effect in 2021,"" Gao Qiang said in a written response.
Gao said his brother returned to China to visit family with his wife and son in June, but before his departure, he and other friends urged him to consider the potential security risks of returning to China.
""He also thought he could run into some trouble, but he still decided to go back to China in the end,"" he said.
Since the 1990s and into the early 2000s, the Gao brothers have been known for expressing grief toward Mao and his time in power. While Chinese police had shut down their exhibitions and confiscated some of their sensitive artworks in the past, they hadn't run into major problems before.
The two brothers obtained permanent residence in the United States in 2011, and Gao Zhen moved to New York with his family in 2022. Unlike the earlier phase of their career, the Gao brothers' recent works have been less politically sensitive and less critical of China's leadership.
Gao Qiang said that while the motivation for his brother's arrest remains unclear, he believes the incident shows the space for free expression has further shrunk in China.
""He is nearly 70 years old and is naturally prone to melancholy, so I'm very concerned about his physical and mental health in detention,"" he told VOA, adding that the lawyer mentioned his brother had complained about persistent back pain.
Gao's wife and children were also banned from leaving China when they tried to fly back to New York from Beijing on Tuesday. Gao's son is an American citizen, and his family members are seeking help from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
Several prominent Chinese writers and artists, including Ma Jian, have written an open letter, urging the Chinese authorities to release him and set his family free.
Meanwhile, Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was released in May after serving a four-year sentence for covering the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020, has reportedly been detained by Chinese authorities at the Pudong Detention Center in Shanghai, according to Chinese news site Weiquanwang and supporters with knowledge of the arrest.
Zhang went to Gansu Province to meet the mother of a recently detained activist but was arrested by police when she returned to her hometown Shaanxi. It remains unclear whether she has been put in administrative detention, which usually lasts 15 days, or criminal detention, which carries a much longer sentence.
Zhang's latest detention has renewed concerns about her physical well-being. During her four-year prison sentence, Zhang staged a months-long hunger strike that caused her weight to drop to under 40 kilograms at one point.
Since her release in May, Zhang has been speaking up for other detained Chinese activists while criticizing some policies implemented by the Chinese government on Western social media platforms such as X and YouTube, which is banned in China.
Zhang wrote on the Chinese social media platform WeChat in June that local authorities in Shanghai had threatened to re-arrest her if she ""crossed the red line"" and said in a YouTube video in July that she possibly had been followed.
Some analysts say other dissidents' experiences suggest that Chinese authorities tend to impose harsher prison sentences on them if they were arrested for a second time. They worry Zhang could face a similar fate.
""If Chinese activists continue to stand up for freedom after their releases, the Chinese government definitely won't tolerate that,"" Yaqiu Wang, research director for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House, told VOA by phone, adding that she has an ""ominous"" feeling about Zhang's situation.
In her view, the arrests of Gao and Zhang represent an escalation in the Chinese government's repression against dissidents. ""Gao was merely visiting China, and the works used as evidence against him were created more than a decade ago,"" she said.
""This symbolizes a step further in terms of Beijing's crackdown on dissident community, and I remain extremely worried about the fate of other Chinese dissidents,"" Wang said.
Some human rights advocates say the detention of prominent dissidents fits Beijing's usual practice of increasing pressure on the dissident community when they face serious domestic challenges.
""The arrests are part of the larger trend of Beijing adopting more forceful measures to control civil society and this situation will indeed increase the risks that Chinese activists face,"" Zhou Fengsuo, a former Tiananmen student leader and executive director of New York-based organization Human Rights in China, told VOA by phone.
VOA reached out to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and Pudong Detention Center for comments. In a previous response to VOA, the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., said China is ""a country ruled by law and liberty is protected and respected"" in the country."

Speaking at a joint press conference with President el-Sisi of Egypt, President ErdoÄan said: ""TÃ¼rkiye and Egypt have a common stance on the Palestinian issue. The termination of the genocide that has been going on for 11 months, the immediate establishment of a permanent ceasefire, and the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid continue to be our priorities.""
President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of   Egypt held a joint press conference following their meeting at the   Presidential Complex.
President ErdoÄan said: ""I would like to express the joy I take in   welcoming President of Egypt, Mr. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in our country.   On behalf of myself and my nation, I once again say 'welcome' in your   presence. During our visit to Cairo back in February, Mr. President   welcomed us in a very warm manner. My visit to Cairo marked a new   turning point in our relations. Since that day, we have maintained our   dialogue and cooperation at a maximum level. We have always maintained   close consultations on issues concerning our region. With the return   visit of my treasured brother, we are now further advancing our already   improving relations in all areas.""
""WE HAVE A SHARED HISTORY OF CENTURIES AND BONDS OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIP WITH EGYPT""
Stressing that TÃ¼rkiye and Egypt have a shared history of centuries   and bonds of close friendship, President ErdoÄan stated: ""Next year, we   will mark the centenary of the establishment of our diplomatic   relations. We are two ancient countries that served as the cradle of   civilizations that shaped the history of humanity. We constantly   strengthen the bridge and multidimensional ties between our countries   through joint efforts. We are pleased to see the fruits of our   efforts.""
President ErdoÄan continued: ""During our talks with Mr. el-Sisi in   Cairo, we had taken a decision to restructure our High-Level Strategic   Cooperation Council. Today, we held the first meeting of this mechanism.   With the joint declaration, we have reaffirmed our will to advance our   cooperation in all areas, including industry, trade, defense,   healthcare, environment and energy. Trade and economy constitute the   strongest aspects of our cooperation.""
Noting that TÃ¼rkiye has been among Egypt's top five trade partners   over the past decade, President ErdoÄan said: ""We are decisively making   progress toward our goal of boosting our trade volume to $15 billion   within the next five years. Our businesspeople make significant   contributions to Egypt's economy with the investments worth nearly $3   billion. We encourage our entrepreneurs to further increase their   investments and also invite Egyptian investors to TÃ¼rkiye.""
""TÃRKÄ°YE'S AND EGYPT'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO REGIONAL PEACE ARE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE""
TÃ¼rkiye is willing to expand its cooperation with Egypt in energy,   particularly natural gas and nuclear energy, stressed President ErdoÄan.   ""The brotherly Egyptian people take great interest in the Turkish   culture and language. We continue our efforts to further strengthen our   cultural and social ties. I believe the positive momentum in our   relations will also be reflected in tourism.""
Describing TÃ¼rkiye's and Egypt's contributions to regional peace as   vital, President ErdoÄan said: ""During our meeting, we have agreed on   holding consultations on a regular basis for the settlement of regional   issues, first and foremost Gaza. The latest situation in Palestine was   the epicenter of our meeting. TÃ¼rkiye and Egypt have a common stance on   the Palestinian issue. The termination of the genocide that has been   going on for 11 months, the immediate establishment of a permanent   ceasefire, and the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid continue to be our   priorities.""
""ISRAEL AND ITS BACKERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY INNOCENT PERSON WHO DIES FROM HUNGER, THIRST, OR LACK OF MEDICINE""
""To date, 32 percent of the total aid dispatched to Gaze have   originated from TÃ¼rkiye. I offer my gratitude to the Egyptian   authorities, particularly the Egyptian Red Crescent, who cooperate with   the Turkish Red Crescent and AFAD for the delivery of aid,"" President   ErdoÄan stated.
Pointing out that by blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid to   those in need, Israel is adding to the crimes it commits, President   ErdoÄan said: ""Having been unable to break the resistance by dropping   thousands of tons of bombs, the Israeli administration is now trying to   the break the resistance by condemning the Palestinian people to hunger   and thirst. Israel and its backers are responsible for every innocent   person who dies from hunger, thirst, or lack of medicine.""
Drawing attention to Egypt's mediating role in the negotiations for   the cessation of the conflicts, President ErdoÄan said: ""As you know,   Egypt has been mediating the negotiations along with Qatar and the U.S.   We, for our part, have been supporting this process through our Foreign   Ministry and National Intelligence Organization (MÄ°T). Israel's stance   remains both uncompromising and obstructive. By martyring an   interlocutor for negotiation, Israel has demonstrated its mentality. I   want to make it clear that we reject Netanyahu's allegations against   Egypt. Regarding these issues, we have done and continue to do whatever   we can to step up the pressure on Israel. ""
""SOME COUNTRIES BECOME AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE CRIMES BY SUPPORTING ISRAEL UNCONDITIONALLY""
""We already submitted our official application to intervene in the   genocide case the Republic of South Africa lodged with the International   Court of Justice. We continue our intensive endeavors in order for   Israeli authorities that perpetrate crimes in Gaza to be held   accountable at international courts. As I have previously stated, the   rightful place for the killers of 41,000 innocent individuals is not the   parliamentary podium, but the courtrooms where they will be tried for   their crimes,"" President ErdoÄan underscored.
Urging the international community to fulfill its responsibilities in   the face of Israel's brutalities in Gaza, President ErdoÄan said: ""Some   countries unfortunately become an accomplice in the crimes by   supporting Israel unconditionally. No deterrent steps are being taken to   stop the Netanyahu government's massacre policies, which put the   region, and even the entire world, at risk. All must understand the   unacceptability of this scene, which wounds the consciences. Preventing   Israel from dragging our region into further tension will only be   possible by abandoning ambivalent policies. I hereby reiterate our call   to immediately back down from the mistake and get positioned on the   right side of history.""
Noting that regional issues including the Eastern Mediterranean,   Syria, Libya, Sudan and the Horn of Africa were also on the agenda   during today's talks in Ankara, President ErdoÄan added: "" We are   determined to strengthen our consultations with Egypt, with which we   hold similar approaches and goals on a wide range of issues. We will   inshallah be in closer cooperation in the period ahead. We will enhance   our multifaceted relations in a win-win manner. Before ending my   remarks, I wish today's talks and agreements to be auspicious. I thank   Mr. President and his distinguished delegation for their visit."""

The UN World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed that ""peace"" is the best solution to save Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip, as a polio vaccination campaign is underway in the war-torn territory amid daily eight-hour pauses in Israeli strikes.
""Children in Gaza are receiving much-needed polio vaccines today. Ultimately, the best vaccine for these children is peace,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on social media platform X on Sunday.
His remarks came as the vaccination campaign began after Israel agreed to eight-hour pauses in its strikes on designated sites in Gaza to allow health workers to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children against polio.
According to Rik Peeperkorn, WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, the so-called ""humanitarian pauses"" began on Sunday in central Gaza and would last for three days.
That will be followed by another similar pause in southern Gaza and then another in northern Gaza.
The campaign aims to vaccinate 640,000 children under 10, Peeperkorn told reporters via video conference on Thursday.
Thursday's announcement came after a 10-month-old baby was partia llyparalyzed by a mutated strain of the virus that vaccinated people shed in their waste.
Abdel-Rahman Abu El-Jedian, who was born just before Israel's war on Gaza erupted on October 7, was one of hundreds of thousands of children who missed vaccinations because of the war.
UNRWA: Ceasefire needed now
On Monday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said 87,000 Gazan children had received the first dose of a polio vaccine as the inoculation drive continues for the second day.
""Efforts are ongoing to provide children with this key vaccine, but what they need most is a ceasefire now,"" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said in a post on X.
According to WHO, at least 90% of children in Gaza should be vaccinated to stop the transmission of polio.
The agreement reached between the UN health agency and Israel on limited pauses came as the polio outbreak in Gaza threatens Israelis, too.
Unvaccinated Israeli ultra-Orthodox
Foreign Policy, however, said in a report that Thursday's announcement is ""insufficient"" to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, ""because parents will be required to bring their children to those sites while combat elsewhere in Gaza rages; most parents simply won't risk it.""
""That fighting also makes impossible the kind of active outreach by healthcare workers among Gaza's displaced population needed to obtain the near-universal vaccination required to stop the outbreak.""
Referring to Gaza's polio outbreak as ""a barometer of the catastrophic public health conditions created by the Israeli military"", the report said what many Israelis don't realize is that the systematic Israeli assaults on health care and public health infrastructure in Gaza have ""now come back to haunt them.""
According to the report, at least 175,000 vulnerable Israeli children, the offspring of the ultra-Orthodox are ""at risk of contracting the disease.""
The report stressed that the only way to protect the unvaccinated ultra-Orthodox, who are ""notorious for their opposition to vaccinations"" is to control polio in Gaza.
""The Israeli government now has an incentive to agree to the prolonged humanitarian pauses needed for a successful vaccination campaign,"" Foreign Policy said, noting that Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs their (ultra-Orthodox) support to remain in power.
Israel launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.
The regime's bloody onslaught on Gaza has so far killed at least 40,786 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 94,224 others. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their citizens and citizens of Russia will be brought to justice, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Sputnik on Tuesday.
""Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their henchmen, will be brought to justice and will be punished as they deserve to be,"" Zakharova said.
Kiev wants to withdraw its citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), but keep criminal prosecution of foreign citizens, Maria Zakharova said.
""In fact, they want to withdraw their citizens from the jurisdiction of even this court, which is as loyal to them as possible, but at the same time reserve the right to criminal prosecution in The Hague of citizens of other countries on charges made up by Kiev itself,"" Zakharova said.
Kiev's words on the ratification of the Rome Statute with conditions shows its true attitude to international humanitarian law, the diplomat added.
""Such a step cannot be regarded otherwise than as an undisguised intention to give their military carte blanche to commit serious war crimes,"" Zakharova added.
Neither Ukraine nor the International Criminal Court have anything to do with law and justice, Zakharova said.
""The reputation of both the Kiev regime and the ICC is well known. Neither of them are independent and have anything to do with law or justice,"" Zakharova said.
On August 24, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law to ratify the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the ICC. Ukraine will not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction over its citizens for seven years after the adoption of the draft law.

BEIJING, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday lauded the ""stellar example"" of China-Africa relations as China rolled out the red carpet for African leaders and other guests attending a grand summit expected to further elevate ties.
Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, held a welcome banquet at the Great Hall of the People for the guests who are in Beijing to attend the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), the largest diplomatic event hosted by China in years.
The summit, drawing the attendance of over 50 African leaders and the UN secretary-general, runs from Sept. 4 to 6.
Addressing the banquet, Xi said he has been to Africa 10 times.
The China-Africa community with a shared future sets a stellar example for building a community with a shared future for humanity, he said.
The China-Africa community with a shared future is deeply rooted in the traditional friendship between the two sides, Xi said, adding that the friendship remains robust and is growing stronger through generations no matter how the world changes.
""We have together built roads, railways, schools, hospitals, industrial parks, and special economic zones. These projects have changed the lives and destiny of many people,"" Xi said, noting that the China-Africa community with a shared future thrives on the strength of win-win cooperation.
Noting that the China-Africa community with a shared future grows in step with the times, Xi said the two sides have maintained close cooperation and coordination on major international and regional issues, and together have made the voice of the Global South stronger.
He expressed confidence that as long as the 2.8-billion-strong Chinese and African people are united, ""we will accomplish new and even greater feats together on the way toward modernization, spearhead the modernization drive of the Global South, and make greater contributions to a community with a shared future for mankind.""
President Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal, co-chair of FOCAC, expressed gratitude for the hospitality of the Chinese people on behalf of the African leaders.
Both Africa and China stand for a more equal, orderly, mutually beneficial and inclusive world, he said.
Faye said that China, under President Xi's leadership, has not only achieved its own rapid development but also made important contributions to promoting world peace and growth.
The African side, Faye said, is ready to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with China, deepen the Africa-China comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, and better safeguard their common interests.
Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi, all members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, attended the event.
After the banquet, an artistic performance titled ""Joining hands for a brighter future"" was staged for the guests."

Monday, 02 September 2024 6:59 AM
Israeli military forces have once again stormed cities and towns in the West Bank as part of their stepped-up raids on Palestinian neighborhoods across the occupied territory, sparking confrontation with local residents.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, citing eyewitnesses and local authorities, reported that Israeli troops raided At-Tira village, located 8.3 kilometers (5.2 miles) southwest of Ramallah,  as well as the cites of Ramallah and al-Bireh besides the nearby towns of Burqa and Silwad late on Sunday.
The agency reported clashes in Deir Jarir, located northeast of Ramallah, as Israeli soldiers forced their way into the town.
Israeli forces also stormed the city of Nablus and the town of Odala, where they clashed with Palestinians and fired live rounds and rubber-coated bullets to disperse the protesting crowd.
The raids come as Israeli forces continue a deadly and destructive siege on the Jenin refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.
Two Palestinian youths killed by Israeli forces near Jenin
Meanwhile, two young Palestinian men were shot dead by Israeli soldiers during a raid on Kafr Dan village, located 8 kilometers (4.9 miles) northwest of Jenin.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said that it transferred the dead bodies to a nearby hospital.
According to WAFA, Israeli forces shot the two young men after opening fire on their vehicle at the entrance to Kafr Dan, prevented Palestinian paramedics from providing them with first aid and left them bleeding to death.
Earlier in the day, a young Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces' fire in the city of al-Khalil, according to security sources.
The sources said Israeli forces surrounded a house in the southern West Bank city, and targeted it with a barrage of live bullets and a missile, killing a youth inside.
Israeli soldiers also took away the body of the young man whose identity remains unknown.
Since Israel unleashed a war on the besieged Gaza Strip in early October 2023, casualties have been rising in the West Bank as a result of intensified near-daily Israeli raids into villages and cities in the occupied territories.
According to Palestinian health officials, at least 679 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war on Gaza.
At least 40,738 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have also been killed in the Israeli genocidal war against the Gaza Strip during the past 11 months."

The Israeli regime has ramped up its aggression on the occupied West Bank by conducting violent raids on several areas in Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm, at a time that the illegal entity is engaged in a genocidal war on Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Palestinian media said a Palestinian young man was injured at dawn on Wednesday by live bullets and three others were detained during the occupation forces' storming of Nablus.
The official Wafa news agency cited sources in the Palestine Red Crescent as reporting that an 18-year-old  young man was injured by Israeli bullets in the foot after the occupation forces stormed two refugee camps east of the city.
Local sources said the Israeli forces raided the Balata and Askar al-Qadeem refugee camps, which led to the outbreak of confrontations during which the occupation forces fired live bullets, gas and sound bombs, and injured an unspecified number people.
The sources added that Israeli forces stormed several neighborhoods in the city, including Rafidia, and deployed their snipers on the rooftops of some residential buildings.
Two young men were detained in Rafidia after the forces raided and searched their homes.
According to other local sources, the occupation forces stormed the village of Qasra, south of Nablus, at dawn and raided al-Ain area and several homes before detaining a youth.
In the northern West Bank city of Jenin and its refugee camp, the Israeli occupation forces continued for the 8th consecutive day their military aggression by demolishing and bulldozing Palestinian homes and infrastructure, Palestine's Safa News Agency said.
The forces carried out bombing operations inside the camp's neighborhoods and burned tarpaulins, which led to a number of citizens' homes catching fire and burning in al-Swalmeh neighborhood.
The Palestine Red Crescent reported that eight citizens suffocated as a result of the fire caused by the occupation in the camp.
The occupation bulldozers also continued to destroy the infrastructure and the citizens' property in the camp, causing extensive damage and destruction.
The Israeli forces raided Palestinian homes in Balawneh neighborhood, searched them and subjected their residents to interrogation.
In the city of Tulkarm, the regime's bulldozers closed roads and streets leading to the Tulkarm refugee camp and the Martyr Thabet Hospital, destroying vegetable stalls and citizens' property and uprooting trees.
Faisal Salama, head of the Popular Committee of Tulkarm camp, described the refugee camp as a disaster area due to repeated acts of aggression, and the tight siege after the occupation forces destroyed the infrastructure and electricity, water, and sewage networks, homes and facilities, in addition to the humanitarian and psychological situation of patients, children, women, and the elderly.
Salama called for international protection for the residents of the camp, and for immediate action to stop Israel's aggression, war of extermination, systematic displacement and organized terrorism.
The Israeli forces also detained four people from the towns of Bal'a, east of Tulkarm, and Kafr Jamal, south of the city, after raiding their homes, searching them and vandalizing their property.
The number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of the aggression at dawn on Wednesday has risen to 34, including 19 in Jenin, 8 in Tulkarm, 4 in Tubas, and 3 in al-Khalil, bringing to 685 the death toll in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023.
The heightened tensions in the occupied West Bank come as the Israeli regime has since October last year been conducting a barbaric onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip, claiming the lives of more than 40,000 people, most of them women and children."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The construction of a military base in Lithuania for the possible deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers is seen as a provocative act due to the increase in NATO's military capabilities near Russia's borders, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Sputnik.
Earlier in August, media reported that Lithuania had begun construction of a military base, with 4,000 Bundeswehr soldiers to be stationed there by the end of 2027.
""We consistently emphasize that the increase in activity and military potential of NATO and its member states near the Russian borders is provocative in nature,"" the ministry said, adding that ""this also applies to the planned deployment of a Bundeswehr brigade on Lithuanian territory, for which military bases are being built.""

The Czech Ministry of Defence hosted a meeting between the Defence Minister Jana ÄernochovÃ¡ and her Italian counterpart Minister Guido Crosetto. The topics they discussed included the support of Ukraine, NATO's defence and deterrence following the Washington Summit, security situation in Africa and in the Middle East, Czech-Italian defence industrial cooperation, the F-35 project and cooperation on war graves.
Defence Minister ÄernochovÃ¡ highly valued the Italian assistance to Ukraine that is facing a Russian aggression, and mentioned in this regard the Czech ammunition initiative and the use of proceeds from immobilised Russian assets for the country under attack. The Ministers also debated the recent NATO Summit in Washington, D.C.
""The Summit sent out a clear signal that our defence is strong. But it is also clear that we need to do much more. Likewise, NATO needs to adopt a new strategy on Russia which has already waged a war against the West by attacking in the cyberspace and sponsoring terrorist and arson attacks in our countries. In the south, Russia is igniting threats in Africa and in the Middle East,"" said Minister ÄernochovÃ¡. She added that Russia turned Africa into a geopolitical battlefield and was undermining Europe's strategic interests there.
From the perspective of defence industrial cooperation between the Czech Republic and Italy, the acquisition of the F-35 fifth generation fighter aircraft will mark an important milestone. As a matter of fact, half of the total of 24 fighters to be acquired will go through the Final Assembly and Check-Out facility in Cameri, Italy. Once the fighters are operated by the Czech Air Force, the FACO will also be where possible upgrades, modifications, retrofits and maintenance of airframes and some other component of F-35 fighters will take place as part of the Global Support Solution. According to Minister ÄernochovÃ¡, the Czech Republic is also ready to discuss cooperation with Italian industries, including Leonardo, which plays a key role in the European defence industry.
There is also an untapped potential for developing bilateral cooperation in the care for war graves, for instance as concerns the restoration of the war graves of Austro-Hungarian soldiers who originated from the present territory of the Czech Republic and died in the territory of Italy. During World War I, several dozen thousand Czechs served in the ranks of Austro-Hungarian Army there, and the Czech Republic stands ready to participate, including financially, in keeping up the graves of those who died in Italy."

Parliamentary Assembly  Strasbourg  4 September 2024
In a statement, Parliamentary Assembly President Theodoros Rousopoulos has reacted to recent missile strikes in Ukraine, and again urged the speedy creation of a special tribunal to try Russia's political and military leadership for the crime of aggression.
""In recent days and nights, indiscriminate Russian attacks on   manifestly civilian targets in Ukraine have intensified, with horrible   missile strikes on Poltava, Kryvyi Rig, Sumy, Lviv and other cities.   Educational institutions, hospitals, residential buildings and historic   monuments have been targeted and destroyed, and dozens of innocent   people, among whom are many women and children, have been killed. Human   tragedies continue and intensify. These actions are not just appalling   but are clear war crimes that add to an already extremely long list of   atrocities committed by the Russian Federation in and against Ukraine.
I wish to strongly voice my solidarity with the victims, their   friends and families, and with the entire Ukrainian people who   resiliently and bravely continue to fight the aggressor. I will not stop   repeating that we must never accept this war as normality. We must stay   focused and motivated on doing everything within our power to bring   peace to Ukraine. However not just any peace at any cost, but a peace   based on justice and respect for the rule of law. A peace that restores   the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine, a peace   that fully addresses the consequences of the Russian aggression. A peace   that delivers justice to all the victims.
Tomorrow, the Ministers of Justice of the Council of Europe member   states will gather in Vilnius in Lithuania to discuss the issue of   accountability for international crimes committed in Ukraine. I strongly   urge them to step up efforts aimed at the creation of a special   tribunal for the crime of aggression, to hold to account the leadership   of the Russian Federation for what has been rightly called the 'crime of   crimes': starting a war, which brings unspeakable suffering and misery   to soldiers and civilians alike.
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has been crystal   clear on this subject. A special tribunal, created by an agreement   between the Council of Europe and Ukraine and supported by an enlarged   partial agreement open to non-member states and other international   organisations, is now the best and most feasible option, in terms of   legal basis and political legitimacy, for trying Russia's political and   military leadership for the crime of aggression. The Assembly invites   and urges the Core Group to maintain the momentum towards the speedy   establishment of such a tribunal, and we do hope that the conference in   Vilnius tomorrow will give a strong impetus to the Committee of   Ministers to move quickly on setting up the necessary legal framework   for this key body.
This is our duty and responsibility. Ukraine needs our support and our help now. We stand with Ukraine!"""

The final investigation by the Iranian Armed Forces into the helicopter crash that claimed the lives of President Ebrahim Raeisi and his companions in May says the incident was caused by weather conditions that included thick fog.
The helicopter carrying 63-year-old Rarisi, former foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and six others came down on May 19 on a fog-shrouded mountainside in northwestern Iran. Their bodies were found the following day after a massive search operation.
The report, published by the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces on Sunday, ruled out sabotage or tampering as the reason behind the tragic incident, saying the ""complex climatic and atmospheric conditions of the region in the spring was the main cause of the crash.""
It added that ""the sudden emergence of a thick mass of dense and rising fog"" caused the helicopter to crash into the mountainside.
According to the report, all documents related to the helicopter's repairs and maintenance since its purchase and use before the incident were thoroughly reviewed by military and civilian experts, who announced that all the measures had been conducted under standard regulations.
It noted that experts also examined the helicopter's flight path and confirmed that it adhered to its predetermined route and had no deviation during the flight.
Experts have also recovered the pilot's iPad which proved the correctness of information on the helicopter's flight path throughout the flight, the report said.
It added that Iran's Defense Ministry's experts precisely examined the remaining parts and systems from the crashed helicopterâincluding engines, power transmission systems, fuel systems, and electronic equipmentâ and found no defects that could have caused the crash.
It explained that the reports of Iran's Meteorological Organization from the day before and the day of the accident have been examined by experts.
The report further said a forensic committee conducted toxicological and pathological tests on the remains of the victims and found no suspicious case.
The investigation also ruled out the possibility of any act of sabotage of the crashed copter's parts and systems. It also rejected that the helicopter may have been targeted by offensive and defensive systems, cyber-attacks, or magnetic fields and lasers."

On the morning of September 3, 2024, President Xi Jinping met with Chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC)âMoussa Faki Mahamat, who is in China for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperationâ(FOCAC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
Xi Jinping pointed out that the African Union (AU)âis a banner for Africa to seek strength through unity and an important platform for conducting international cooperation.âIn recent years, China and the AU have continued to deepen political mutual trust and maintained close coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs.âXi Jinping said that he isâglad to see that the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aided by China for the AU,âhas been established and put into operation, contributing to Africa'sâhealth cause as well asâAfrican people's health and well-being.âChina supports the AU in playing a greaterârole in the cause of China-Africa friendship, and is ready to take this FOCAC Summit as an opportunity to push for more outcomes ofâChina-AU cooperation in various fields and promoteâthe building of a China-Africa community with a shared future to a new level.
Xi Jinping stressed that the current transformations of the world unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace.âThe Global South, including China and Africa, is growing stronger, injecting stability and positive energy into world peace and development.âAfrica is an important pole in the world and an important priority in China's diplomacy.âChina is readyâto enhanceâpolitical exchanges with Africa, deepen strategic mutual trust, strengthen practical cooperation, share development experience and promote common development.âXi Jinping called on the two sides toâstrengthenâsolidarity and coordination, firmly support each other, advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and jointly safeguard international fairness and justice and the common interests of developing countries.
Moussa Faki Mahamatâsaid that during his eight years as AUCâChairperson, he has witnessed the rapidâgrowthâof AU-China relations.âHeâthanked the Chinese side, especially President Xi Jinping,âfor his outstanding leadership in promoting the development of the Africa-China partnership and the FOCAC institutional development.âFor more than half a century, China has been firmly supporting Africa's struggle against colonialism, imperialism and racial discrimination, providing valuable assistance to African countries in various fields such as infrastructure, health, energy, industryâandâsecurity, and taking the lead in supporting the AU's accession to the G20, which the African side highly appreciatesâand sincerely thanks.âFor this reason, the African side firmly pursues the one-China policy and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core interests.âThe Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative and otherâseries ofâmajor initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are committed to helpingâpeople of all countries share peace and development opportunities, which is crucial to strengthening solidarity and cooperation among countries in the Global South and making the global governance system fairer and more equitable.âThe African side expects China to continueâplayingâa key leading role and make greater contributions to helping Africa achieve modernization and world peace and development.

The European Union has expressed concern regarding NATO member Turkey's ongoing bid to join the BRICS organization, saying that as an EU membership candidate, Ankara had to ""respect"" the EU's ""values"" and foreign policy preferences, despite its being free to join the alliances of its choosing.
EU spokesman Peter Stano made the remarks at a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday after Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party confirmed that Ankara had formally applied for BRICS' membership.
Stano said Turkey had the right to choose which international alliances to join.
The country, however, was still a candidate for EU membership, he added, saying that the bloc expected such candidates to share its values and fully align their foreign policies with it.
Ankara has been in negotiations to join the EU since 2005. Progress in the talks has essentially been frozen, though, due to political roadblocks created by certain EU members faulting, what they call, the country's democratic shortcomings.
Ankara sees the reasons hindering its EU accession as obstacles unrelated to its suitability for membership.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly warned that his country could part ways with the European Union in reaction to the bloc's long-drawn-out failure to honor its pledge to accept Ankara as a member.
The country's BRICS aspirations also come amid rifts with fellow members of the United States-led Western military alliance of NATO, which have disagreed its retaining close relations with Russia after the launch of Moscow's ongoing military operation in Ukraine.
If admitted, Turkey would become the first NATO member in BRICS, which is seen as a geopolitical counterweight to Western power and influence.
Observers say that the frictions have prompted Turkey to seek to foster better relations with the East, including through joining BRICS that would translate into enhanced ties with Russia and China.
Attending a BRICS summit in June, Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan touted the body as ""an organization that increases the diversity of approaches, identities, and politics in the global economic system.""
Also on Tuesday, Yuri Ushakov, assistant to Russian President Vladmir Putin, said Erdogan had accepted Russian authorities' invitation to participate in the upcoming summit of BRICS that is to be held in the western Russian city of Kazan in October.
BRICS features Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Egypt.
The bloc, which is often seen as an alternative to the Western economic and political hegemony, comprises almost 46 percent of the global population, 36 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP), and 25 percent of the global trade measured in terms of exports."

""Over the last few weeks, we've seen intensifying attacks affecting civilians and public infrastructure"", WHO Ukraine said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
Since the weekend, parts of Ukraine including the eastern city of Kharkiv, the Sumy and Donetsk regions and Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia areas, have suffered deadly strikes.
WHO Ukraine said the  ""cruel attack"" in Lviv ""claimed the lives of at least 7 people, including children, and injured 47 others"", while a health facility was also affected.
Separately, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) posted on X that ""indiscriminate attacks impacting children and their schools have marred the start of the new school year.""
Strikes in central Ukraine
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that Kryvyi Rih, in the centre of the country, was also affected by strikes on Wednesday. Dozens of civilians were injured, including children, and six schools were damaged, according to local authorities.
""Immediately after the attacks, aid workers started providing medical and psychological support to affected people,"" the agency said.
Humanitarians organized meals and drinks for affected residents and rescuers. They also delivered and distributed materials to cover the damage, and people also received legal aid and registered for cash assistance.
Humanitarian Coordinator's visit
The latest attacks came a day after a missile strike on a military academy and nearby hospital in the central city of Poltava left at least 50 people dead and more than 270 injured - among the deadliest single attacks since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.
The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Matthias Schmale, was in Poltava on Wednesday where he witnessed the impact.
Speaking in a video posted on X, he said that ""massive"" attacks have been occurring across Ukraine since Friday.
""These attacks have resulted in destruction of civilian infrastructure, including a lot of educational institutions and health institutions, and that is utterly despicable that civilian infrastructure is destroyed,"" he said.
Respect international humanitarian law
He also pointed to the human toll, as civilians have been killed and seriously injured, expressing shock and outrage.
""No one should die.  No one should be injured,"" he said.  ""And I repeat the calls the UN has made many times to respect international humanitarian law and to do whatever it takes to keep civilians safe and to protect critical civilian infrastructure.""
Mr. Schmale also mentioned that his thoughts were with the families of those killed in the Poltava attack on Tuesday.
""Young people going to the institution here were killed,"" he said, adding that it was ""utterly deplorable that young lives are taken far too early from this planet"", before expressing solidarity with affected families across the country.
Concern for displaced people
The UN refugee agency UNHCR called on Wednesday for an immediate end to atacks on civilians in Ukraine.
Spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh recalled that the war has produced over six million refugees in Europe alone to date, while an estimated 3.6 million people back home are internally displaced.
""For us at UNHCR, the focus on responding to these attacks has been providing immediate support that could be around shelter, around support, with evacuations, documentation, psychological support, helping families that have been separated, and so on,"" he said.
Mr. Saltmarsh added that aside from the increase in attacks, UNHCR's top concern now is the coming winter months, warning that ""the needs are going to rise, certainly in terms of providing  fuel, energy, shelter, warm clothing and so on.""
Nuclear safety efforts continue
Meanwhile, a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) highlights its efforts to ensure nuclear safety and security amid the ongoing conflict  in Ukraine.
The report outlines challenges and achievements to protect the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), and help prevent a nuclear accident, since launching a mission there in September 2022.
Located in southern Ukraine, Zaporizhzhya is Europe's largest nuclear power plant and is on the frontline of the conflict. It has been under Russian control since the early days of the full-scale invasion.
Precarious and very fragile
IAEA teams stationed there have reported on incidents including shelling and drone strikes at the facility, which has also suffered repeated loss of off-site power events.
Writing in the report's forward, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi noted that the situation at the Zaporizhzhya plant remains precarious and very fragile.
""Two years into the IAEA's continued presence at the occupied Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, our commitment to helping prevent a nuclear accident remains resolute,"" he said.
""Amid the significant challenges and risks to nuclear safety and security, we are steadfast in our mission to assess the situation and keep the international community informed.""
Supporting nuclear safety
The report was issued as Mr. Grossi travelled to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, his fifth time during the conflict. Since he last went in February, it has been hit by drone strikes and experienced loss of power lines, while a fire last month caused significant damage to one of the two cooling towers.
He said that ""the objective and impartial assessments of the situation provided by our teams have made a significant contribution to maintaining nuclear safety, security and safeguards"" at the plant.
The IAEA has experts stationed at Ukraine's four other nuclear sites, and the report also summarizes developments, activities and assistance at these locations since missions were set up there in early 2023.
Reassuring the international community
In total, the IAEA has conducted 139 Support and Assistance Missions to the nuclear sites in Ukraine. Additionally, its comprehensive assistance to Ukraine has facilitated 61 deliveries of equipment to the country, with a total value of over â¬10 million.
The agency has also continued its vital safeguards verification activities across Ukraine, ensuring that there is no diversion of nuclear material for military purposes.
""As I conduct my fifth visit to the ZNPP, and my tenth to Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict, I want to reassure the international community that the IAEA, and I as Director General, will continue to do everything possible within our mandate to assist in averting a nuclear or radiological accident at any of Ukraine's nuclear facilities,"" Mr. Grossi said."

ANKARA (Sputnik) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss steps towards the Gaza settlement during their meeting on September 4, Turkiye's Milliyet newspaper reported on Monday, citing sources.
Sisi will visit Turkiye on Wednesday to meet with Erdogan, an Egyptian source familiar with the matter told Sputnik in late August. The meeting comes amid the process of normalization of bilateral relations.
During the upcoming meeting, three key issues are expected to be discussed, Milliyet reported. First and foremost, the presidents will address steps towards the Gaza ceasefire and work on the provision of humanitarian aid.
Another important issue on the agenda will reportedly be the expansion of cooperation, including boosting bilateral trade from $10 billion to $15 billion. Among the planned defense deals will be an agreement to supply Egypt with unmanned aerial vehicles, the newspaper added.
Sisi and Erdogan are also reportedly expected to address regional issues such as the Eastern Mediterranean and Libya.
In February, Erdogan arrived in Cairo for the first time in 12 years as part of mutual efforts to normalize relations between Egypt and Turkiye.
In July 2023, Ankara and Cairo appointed ambassadors to each other's capitals for the first time in 10 years. The agreement to upgrade diplomatic ties was reached by Erdogan and Sisi in May of that year.

There has been no official explanation of what caused one of the U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets recently delivered to Ukraine to crash Monday during a massive Russian missile-and-drone attack, killing the pilot. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine announced Thursday that a special commission had been set up to investigate the crash.
Still, the incident sparked recriminations between a member of Ukraine's parliament, Mariana Bezuhla, and the commander of Ukraine's Air Force, Lieutenant General Mykola Oleshchuk, with Bezuhla claiming the F-16 was brought down by friendly fire and denouncing a ""culture of lies in the Air Force command.""
In response, Oleshchuk called her ""a tool to discredit"" Ukraine's military leadership.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy weighed in Friday, when he removed Oleshchuk as air force commander.
""I have decided to replace the commander of the Air Forces. ... I am eternally grateful to all our military pilots,"" he said in his evening address without providing a reason for his decision.
Zelenskyy announced on August 4 that the first of 80 F-16s promised by Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway had arrived in Ukraine. While he didn't say how many had been delivered, The Wall Street Journal on Thursday cited an unnamed U.S. official as saying that six F-16s had arrived and that Ukraine had six pilots trained to fly them.
In announcing the investigation into the F-16 crash, Ukraine's general staff said that F-16s ""were used together with units of the anti-aircraft missile forces"" to repulse the large-scale August 26 Russian drone-and-missile attack, which ""demonstrated their high efficiency, and four enemy cruise missiles were shot down by airborne weapons."" It added that ""[w]hile approaching the next target... the jet crashed, the pilot died.""
For its part, Ukraine's air force said Thursday that the dead pilot, Colonel Alexei ""Moonfish"" Mes, ""had destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV [drone] while repelling a massive Russian combined air-and-missile strike,"" adding that he ""saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles ... at the cost of his own life.""
The Journal and CNN had initially reported, citing Ukrainian Air Force sources, that the F-16 likely crashed because of ""pilot error,"" but retracted the ""pilot error"" theory in subsequent updates.
In her Thursday Facebook post, Bezuhla wrote that Mes' F-16 ""was shot down by a Patriot anti-aircraft missile system due to discoordination between units. ... The incident occurred during one of the most powerful Russian air attacks on August 26. War is war, such episodes are possible.""
She continued: ""But the culture of lies in the Air Force command ... as in other higher military headquarters, leads to the fact that the management system of military decisions does not improve on the basis of truthful, consistently collected analytics, but worsens and even collapses. ... And none of the generals were punished. [Lieutenant] General Oleshchuk remains in office.""
Responding to Bezuhla, Oleshchuk insisted the official investigation would determine what brought down the F-16, adding in a Telegram post: ""Information about such incidents cannot be immediately released into the public space and cannot be detailed for the media. [THERE IS A] WAR IN THE COUNTRY! But it doesn't matter to the people who chose Maryana Bezuhla as a tool to discredit the top military leadership. ... Maryana, the time will come when you will apologize to the entire army for what you have done, I hope in court!
""Once again, you not only poured dirt on me personally and on the Air Force, you discredited the manufacturers of American weapons â the main ally of Ukraine â the USA! You have again become the main newsmaker of enemy propaganda and are breaking all records on Russian television! All of Russia applauds you!""
Zelenskyy's order removing Oleshchuk as Air Force chief came a day later.
A Ukrainian Air Force official, on the condition of anonymity, told VOA's Ukrainian Service that ""various versions are being considered, including the 'friendly fire' of their air defense systems, a technical malfunction and pilot error. But the exact reasons will be known only after the investigation is completed.""
Mes traveled with fellow pilot, Andrii ""Juice"" Pilshchykov, a college classmate and lifelong friend, to Washington, D.C., in 2022, where they met with U.S. lawmakers to try to persuade Western allies to allow the transfer of F-16s to Ukraine.
Pilshchykov died in a training accident in August 2023, a year before the death of his fellow pilot.
Adam Kinzinger, a former U.S. congressman from Illinois and retired U.S. Air National Guard lieutenant colonel, shared his recollections of meeting the two Ukrainian pilots on Capitol Hill.
""I feel like you could have taken Juice or Moonfish, put them in an American squadron, and they would blend in immediately, because of the personality, the commitment, the dedication. They were obviously fantastic fighter pilots,"" Kinzinger told VOA.
He added, ""Ukraine would not have F-16s today if it wasn't for their tireless advocacy. And you know, like we say, when anybody falls in war, you die twice. You could die when you actually die, and then when you're forgotten. And I think Moonfish and Juice will never be forgotten."""

VLADIVOSTOK (Sputnik) - Russia is aware of Malaysia's interest in joining BRICS and supports this interest, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
""We are aware of our Malaysian friends' interest in joining this organization. We, as with many other countries, support this interest and will discuss this issue with our BRICS colleagues,"" Peskov told reporters at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).
BRICS consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
The potential of relations between Russia and Malaysia has not been fully utilized, this still needs to be done, Peskov said.
""Today, Russian-Malaysian negotiations with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim are planned. Malaysia is our rather important trade and economic partner. The potential of bilateral relations is difficult to overestimate, and it is obvious that it is far from being fully utilized. This still needs to be done,"" Peskov told reporters on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum.
Pressure from ill-wishers and threats of sanctions are reducing the number of foreign participants in the Eastern Economic Forum, but the situation will change for the better over the years, Peskov said.
""For well-known reasons we do not see many foreign guests here. This is understandable. Unprecedented pressure from ill-wishers, the threat of primary and secondary sanctions, the very pressure that we have talked about with the use of other methods, of course, is reducing the number of foreign participants, but this is not forever. Over the years, the situation will change and change for the better,"" Peskov told reporters.
The leaders of unfriendly countries will not be invited to the parade in Moscow to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Nazism, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
""We will not invite the heads of unfriendly countries,"" Peskov told journalists on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum when asked whether the Kremlin will invite the leaders of unfriendly countries to the parade in Moscow to mark the 80th WWII Victory anniversary.
No decisions have been made yet on Russian President Vladimir Putin's participation in the G20 summit in Brazil, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
""No decisions have been made yet on this matter, Russia continues to work within the G20. Our sherpa continues to work actively with his colleagues. We are defending our interests there, but the president has not made any decisions yet,"" Peskov told reporters.
The degree of US involvement in the conflict around Ukraine is constantly increasing, there are no prerequisites for this process to stop, Dmitry Peskov said.
""We see a trend that the level of US involvement in the conflict around Ukraine is constantly increasing. And there are no grounds to assume that it will hit some limit and not go any further,"" Peskov told journalists.
He said Moscow takes into account the fact that Ukraine will strike deep into Russian territory with US long-range weapons.
Peskov added that the West's refusal to engage in dialogue, its attack on Russia's security interests and provocation of the Ukraine conflict continuation will be taken into account in Russia's renewed nuclear doctrine.
The possible resignation of Dmytro Kuleba from the post of Ukraine's foreign minister will not affect the prospects of the negotiation process, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
""No, it will not affect it in any way. This has nothing to do with the prospects of the negotiation process,"" Peskov said.
Earlier, media reported, citing sources, that there were plans to dismiss Kuleba, and his current deputy Andrii Sybiha could be appointed to replace him. Journalists asked Peskov whether this would affect the prospects of the negotiation process.
The US policy towards Russia is unlikely to change after the elections, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
""What will happen, you can try to guess as much as you like. Obviously, it is unlikely that anything can change. But some nuances may be introduced depending on the configuration of the next administration,"" Peskov said at the Eastern Economic Forum.
The United States plays a destructive role in Europe from the viewpoint of security, Dmitry Peskov added.
Russia continues its contacts with Israel on the issue of freeing hostages in the Gaza Strip, Peskov said.
""We continue our contacts with the Israeli side,"" Peskov told reporters when asked whether Israel had asked Russia for help in freeing the hostages who are still in the Gaza Strip.
The Kremlin expresses support to journalist Dimitri Simes, Peskov said.
""We can only... express words of support to those who are subjected to such pressure, including Dimitri Simes,"" Peskov said.
In August, FBI agents conducted searches in the homes of former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter and journalist Dimitri Simes. However, prosecutors have not revealed any criminal charges against the two men.
Moscow sees the Global majority's great interest in Russia, and intends to develop relations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
""We are indeed seeing great interest in our country from the global majority, and we ourselves are showing interest. And we will implement these plans,"" Peskov told reporters on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum.

GRC3H7DJL0_RUT2Y6ZNN9FSFDS,Venezuela: UN rights office describes pervasive 'climate of fear',_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-unnews04.htm,"3 September 2024 - The UN human rights office, OHCHR, reiterated deep concerns on Tuesday over the continuing ""climate of fear"" in Venezuela, after an arrest warrant was issued for the opposition's presidential candidate in the country's recent election.
""It is a climate of fear in the country at the moment. We are urging the government to ensure that all steps are taken in line with international human rights law with transparency and that steps are taken to resolve this dispute peacefully,"" OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told journalists in Geneva.
The alert is just the latest of many warnings from the UN, top independent rights experts and independent investigators appointed by the Human Rights Council over the violent repression of dissenting voices in the South American country.
""People are being detained for expressing their right to political participation, for their freedom of expression, for freedom of assembly,"" Ms. Shamdasani said, a day after the authorities called for the detention of Edmundo Gonzalez.
His campaign proved unsuccessful against President Nicolas Maduro who was announced the winner of the July election, a result contested by opposition supporters who have questioned the absence of voting numbers to back up the victory from official electoral authorities.
Polling result query
According to news reports, Mr. Gonzalez's arrest followed publication by his camp of granular polling data indicating that he had won the election easily. He stands accused of numerous crimes including falsifying documents.
Although the UN human rights office does not have a presence in Venezuela, Ms. Shamdasani noted that OHCHR still has had ""contact"" and ""engagement"" with the authorities in Caracas, amid street protests and online criticism following the election result, which returned Mr. Maduro to power.
""We still put our concerns to them; we are continuing to urge...all parties to resolve all electoral disputes by peaceful means and there needs to be a climate where there is a full protection of the human rights of all individuals regardless of their political affiliation,"" Ms. Shamdasani insisted.
State-sponsored violence
According to the Human Rights Council-appointed Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela, the election protests were met with ""fierce repression by the State, as directed by its highest authorities, inducing a climate of widespread fear. The Mission has recorded 23 deaths, the vast majority caused by gunfire, between 28 July and 8 August in the context of the protests. In 18 of these cases, the victims were men under the age of 30.""
Echoing those concerns last month, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker TÃ¼rk, noted that more 2,400 people have been arrested in Venezuela since 29 July, following the Presidential elections.
""It is especially troubling that so many people are being detained, accused or charged either with incitement to hatred or under counterterrorism legislation. Criminal law must never be used to limit unduly the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association,"" the High Commissioner said."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has censured Israel's targeting a US humanitarian aid convoy in Gaza, saying it was a war crime.
Hamas urged Washington to stop concealing Israeli regime's crimes, the Palestinian Information Center released on Saturday.
""Despite the relief organization's confirmation that the 4 martyrs who were killed in the occupation's bombing of the convoy were workers of the company transporting aid, the IOF [Israeli occupying force] insists on falsely claiming that they were armed, a false claim that it always uses to justify its blatant crimes against relief workers and humanitarian organizations,"" the report says.
Then, it termed such a move as a ""repeated war crime.""
Hamas calls on the international community and the United Nations (UN) to condemn the brutal crime committed deliberately against the Palestinian people and the aid bodies and impose severe punishment for preventing the regime from continuing its crimes in Gaza.
Despite a resolution approved about two months ago by the UN Security Council in support of ceasefire in Gaza, the prime minister of the Israeli regime Benjamin Netanyahu insists on continuation of war.
Since the start of war in Gaza last October, over 40,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the enclave.

Fort Shafter, Hawaii -- The Agile Combat Employment Summit brings together Army and Air Force leaders to discuss strategies and best practices for achieving ACE objectives, fostering greater interoperability and integration among the U.S. Army and Air Force units in the Indo-Pacific region on Sept. 3, 2024.
U.S. Army Pacific Commanding General Gen. Charles A. Flynn and U.S. Air Force Pacific Commanding General of Pacific Air Forces Gen. Kevin B. Schneider, co-hosted the summit.
The ACE conference brought together key military leaders and experts to discuss strategies and best practices for achieving ACE objectives, fostering greater interoperability and integration among the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force units in the Indo-Pacific region.
The event began with opening remarks from Flynn thanking those in attendance.
""I Just want to say that I am thankful for the opportunity to discuss warfighting and potential collaborations between our services,"" said Flynn ""It would be irresponsible not to seize the opportunities that can address our strategic challenges.""
ACE is a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing the U.S. military's joint force ability to rapidly deploy and integrate forces across various domains. This approach focuses on increasing operational flexibility and resilience, enabling forces to respond swiftly to emerging threats and dynamic environments.
By delving into essential warfighting functions such as sustainment, protection, command and control (C2), and fires, the summit aims to enhance the long-range capabilities of the Multi-Domain Task Force.
""I believe it's about closer alignment and understanding of the myriad problems we face and how we solve them. It's about integrating our capabilities by understanding what each of us brings to the fight,"" said Schneider.
U.S. Army Pacific Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. James B. Bartholomees shared his insight on the ACE concept through his experience.
""The ACE Concept is the United States Air Force concept for Agile Combat Employment, which is the employment of their aircraft in a dispersed fashion to maintain survivability in order to prepare for future operations,"" said Bartholomees. ""The reason why we came together with Pacific Air Forces is so that we can combine the best elements of multi -domain operations and ACE of air and land forces to achieve combined effects.""
The theater Army derives its mission requirements from the joint force, ensuring a cohesive and unified approach to defense in the Indo-Pacific Region. One of the pivotal contributors to this synergy is the Air Force, which spearheads the ACE concept.
With the ACE concept, the summit will set the stage, focusing on how the Air Force and Army are refining new standards for how operational capabilities are being employed in the Pacific theater and how the Army is poised to support and enhance these efforts, ensuring joint-force capabilities remain effective and adaptable.
Schneider emphasized how land and air components capabilities can be used together to help create a synergy when combined properly.
""We have complementary capabilities, and I believe this conference went a long way in helping us identify those capabilities,"" said Schneider. This enables us to continue teaming up and combining our strengths as a joint force.""
The efforts and collaborative ideas here ensure that joint forces are better prepared, more resilient, and capable of responding swiftly to any threats, strengthening security in the region.
The event wrapped up with the Army and Air Force coming together to draft a memorandum of understanding. This key document sets the stage for ongoing collaboration in planning for ACE, MDO, and ensuring these strategies are seamlessly integrated into operational plans fulfilling the Army and Air Force roles in the Pacific Theater.
""There are three steps we will take as a result of this summit. First, we will work on merging our operational concepts of ACE and MDO. Second, we have decided to identify exercises in the region to rehearse the mechanics of air and land power converging to support joint power,"" said Flynn. ""Third, we agree to hold this summit every six months to learn, grow, succeed, develop, and create synergy between air and land domain capabilities to support air, cyber, space, and maritime operations within the joint force."""
H09PPT3UK6_1OYMZS7F586GBOU,US sending Pentagon rep to China's top security forum this month,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/09/china-240904-voa01.htm,"By Carla Babb September 04, 2024
The United States is planning to send Michael Chase, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, to China's top annual security forum this month, two U.S. defense officials have confirmed to VOA.
One of the officials, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the forum, called Chase's upcoming attendance ""consistent participation from the U.S.""
Chase is more senior than the U.S. representative at last year's Xiangshan Forum, but his rank is on par with historical norms for Pentagon representatives who attend the annual meeting. The Pentagon did not send a representative from 2020-2022 due to the pandemic.
""This engagement is meant to be more of the same"" to keep the lines of military communication open and ensure that China has a clear understanding of the United States' position on global security issues, the defense official told VOA.
The forum comes on the heels of a face-to-face meeting in Singapore between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, in late May.
Austin spoke with Dong for the first time in April, marking the first dialogue between the two countries' defense chiefs in nearly 17 months. The top U.S. military officer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown, spoke with his Chinese military counterpart in December.
""Of course talks can make a difference. Having those mil-to-mil communications, those senior channels open, actually allows for the avoidance of a miscalculation,"" Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters earlier this year.
Chinese state media reports say that more than 90 countries and international organizations plan to send delegations to Beijing for the September 12-14 forum.
Reuters was first to report the decision.
Beijing has asserted its desire to control access to the South China Sea and bring democratically ruled Taiwan under its control, by force if necessary. President Joe Biden has said U.S. troops would defend the island from attack.
China's defense ministry has said the Taiwan issue is the ""core of China's core interests.""
Tensions have risen sharply between China and U.S. ally the Philippines in the South China Sea, with China's coast guard using water cannons to threaten Filipino fishing ships. China has also used collision and ramming tactics, undersea barriers and a military-grade laser to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions.
Last year, Austin and his Philippine counterpart established the U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Defense Guidelines, which reaffirmed that an armed attack in the Pacific - including anywhere in the South China Sea - on either of their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces, would invoke mutual defense commitments outlined in the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty."

Tehran, IRNA -- A senior former Israeli security official, who recently resigned from the war cabinet of the Zionist regime, says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could not achieve any of his intended goals from more than 10 months of war on the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu decided not to accept the offer of a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas due to political and party issues, Gadi Eisenkot who resigned together with Benny Gantz, the former minister of military affairs said on Tuesday night.
Netanyahu deprives the military affairs minister and the security apparatus of legitimacy, Eisenkot clarified further and said ""Netanyahu's recent speech on the Gaza ceasefire bother me"".
Several Israeli officials, including Gantz have repeatedly said that Netanyahu is an obstacle in the prisoner exchange agreement with the Hamas movement and that he is not fit to rule.
Eisenkot also said that he believes Netanyahu cannot return the Israeli captives alive, because he is busy with his political survival.
Meanwhile, the media of the Zionist regime revealed on Tuesday night that since the beginning of the war, some 10,400 soldiers have been injured.
The media could not mention the number of military deaths but the Zionist army admitted on August 19 that it lost 689 soldiers, a figure both Israeli and foreign media outlets suspect, arguing the death toll could be much higher.
The war in the Gaza Strip has entered its 11th month, while several Zionist media have pointed to the severe censorship of the Israeli army in announcing its casualties. They say the move taken due to the high number of casualties among Zionist soldiers and the fear of further internal reactions.
The Zionist media revealed earlier that the statistics of the wounded announced by the army differed greatly from the statistics provided by the hospitals.
Channel 12 previously reported that the army had asked hospital authorities not to publish any casualty figures without coordination.

The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has issued a stark warning to the Israeli regime regarding the ongoing genocide in Gaza, saying the lives of captives held in the besieged territory are in danger unless the regime reverses its course.
In a video message directed at Israeli settlers, Hamas stated that the continuation of military aggression would jeopardize the safety of Israeli captives.
Hamas said if the attacks on Gaza ceases, the captives will be returned safely to their homes in the occupied territories, and if the aggression persists, the fate of these individuals would remain uncertain.
The video message noted, ""Every day that Netanyahu continues to rule may mean a new coffin.""
Hamas took a large group of Zionist settlers and soldiers captive in its October 7 Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, which caught the regime off-guard.
The movement initially offered to release the captives in exchange for the release of a large number of Palestinians held by Israel.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a tough line in the Gaza ceasefire talks, and repeatedly said military pressure is needed to bring home the captives.
According to Israeli media, he has feuded with the regime's high-profile officials who say a deal should be struck urgently.
Dozens of the captives have so far been killed in the indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza.
During its operation, Hamas took 251 Israelis captive, 97 of whom now remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 33 confirmed dead by the Israeli military.
Earlier this week, the military found the bodies of six captives in a tunnel in the southern city of Rafah. Hamas said they were killed in Israeli airstrikes.
The death of the six captives ignited fury among Israelis who have for months denounced Netanyahu's policy of torpedoing a deal with Hamas in favor of his political interests.
On Sunday and Monday, thousands of Israelis staged the largest anti-regime demonstration since October 7, 2023, when Israel unleashed its genocidal campaign in Gaza. They took to the streets in the occupied lands and joined a general strike to call for an immediate ceasefire deal.
Israeli media reported clashes during the protests outside Netanyahu's residence in the occupied al-Quds and the headquarters of his Likud party in Tel Aviv. Dozens of people were arrested."

Vladimir Putin toured the corvette Rezky and viewed information stands about the development of the naval base.
The Rezky is the fourth ship in a series of Project 20380 multipurpose patrol corvettes built at the Amur Shipyard for the Pacific Fleet. It went on duty in September 2023.
The Pacific Fleet's Primorye Flotilla of All-Arms Forces was established in 1979 and is the largest group within the Russian Navy.
Commander of the Pacific Fleet Viktor Liina, Commander of the Primorye Flotilla Alexei Sysuyev and commander of the corvette Rezky Yevgeny Kovalev provided explanations of the processes to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
Before visiting the base, Vladimir Putin travelled by boat to the site in Promezhutochnaya Bay where a new shipyard is to be built by 2031. The President assigned the implementation of the project to VTB Bank and the United Shipbuilding Corporation. The future shipyard will mostly build commercial vessels such as bulkers, tankers, container carriers and LNG carriers. The site's proximity to the city of Vladivostok ensures a readily available workforce. Other advantages include road, railway and engineering infrastructure, potential access to gas supply and a possibility to increase energy capacity.
The President was accompanied by First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov, Primorye Territory Governor Oleg Kozhemyako, President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board Andrei Kostin, and Director General of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Andrei Puchkov."

Bern, 04.09.2024 -- On 4 September, the Federal Council decided to extend indefinitely the humanitarian exemption to the sanctions regime against Syria. The exemption was introduced for a limited period following the earthquake that hit the country in February 2023.
In light of the grave humanitarian crisis in Syria following the earthquake of 6 February 2023, the European Union (EU) introduced a temporary humanitarian exemption to its sanctions regime against Syria on 23 February 2023. The exemption for international organisations and certain categories of humanitarian actors was subsequently extended twice. On 27 May 2024, the EU extended the exemption for a further year.
The Federal Council decided on 10 March 2023 to include the EU's temporary humanitarian exemption in the ordinance on measures against Syria, initially for a period of six months and since extended twice. The exemption means that the targeted financial sanctions do not apply to activities that are necessary for the humanitarian work of international organisations and some categories of humanitarian actors. With today's decision, the Federal Council is extending the duration of the exemption indefinitely, bringing the humanitarian actors involved a degree of predictability.
The Federal Council first adopted sanctions against Syria on 18 May 2011, thus aligning Switzerland with the sanctions regime adopted by the EU against Syria on 9 May 2011. It has subsequently amended the ordinance several times to reflect the EU's decisions."

Lavrov said the two countries ""will conclude a new interstate comprehensive partnership agreement.""
He made the remarks during a meeting with students and faculty of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) on Monday.
Lavrov said the conclusion of the agreement will be a ""symbolic step"" in Tehran-Moscow relations following the inauguration of the new Iranian administration in late July.
The top Russian diplomat expressed confidence that the statements of Iran's new president and foreign minister about the continuity in mutual relations ""reflect the sincere intention and attitude"" of the new administration in Iran.
Lavrov said Iran and Russia are developing ties rapidly and have already implemented ""a large number of bilateral projects"".
""I believe that the figures characterizing the growth of trade turnover and the volume of investments speak for themselves. These figures are constantly increasing, so we have a bright future.""
Iran and Russia have signed a 10-year cooperation deal that was lengthened to 20 years through two five-year extensions. The major deal is expected to elevate relations between the two allies to a new level.
The two sides have sought to develop bilateral strategic cooperation, which may determine their relations for the next 20 years.
Back in June, Lavrov said Russia and Iran have reached full agreement on the text of a major cooperation deal that is expected to promote relations, adding that the two sides have yet to put their final signatures on the state treaty."

The Israeli occupation forces have killed two young Palestinian men and shot a child in a violent raid on the West Bank city of Jenin and its refugee camp as the regime's onslaught drags on in the northern area for the past consecutive days.
Israeli soldiers killed Mohammad Amin Talal Abdullah, 19, and Amjad Mustafa Ibrahim Saleh, 23, in the Jenin refugee camp on Saturday afternoon, according to a statement by the Palestinian Health Ministry.
The spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS), Ahmad Jibril, said earlier in the day that the occupation forces had prevented paramedics from evacuating the bodies of the two slain men from the camp.
Local media also reported that the Israeli soldiers had confiscated the bodies of the two young Palestinians and taken them to an unknown location.
The Israeli forces had shot a child in the head with live ammunition in Jenin and the child was later transported to the hospital for treatment, PRCS said.
Reports indicate that Israeli forces have launched a large offensive across the northern occupied West Bank over the past few days, attacking three cities - Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas - from land and air and killing more than 20 Palestinians.
The Israeli occupation forces have maintained a tight siege on Jenin city and its camp, sending in additional reinforcements, including bulldozers and front-end loaders.
Media sources said the forces detained several citizens in the al-Damj neighborhood of the Jenin refugee camp, using them as human shields, amid the intense fire of live ammunition.
Sources added that the al-Damj neighborhood has been subjected to a total siege and bulldozers have destroyed roads and vital infrastructure.
In the eastern neighborhood of the city, Israeli forces conducted a large-scale search campaign, invading and searching many citizens' homes, while bulldozers continued to destroy roads and parts of citizens' homes.
Bashir Matahin, the director of public relations and media in Jenin Municipality, was quoted by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA as saying that the occupation forces have destroyed 70% of the city's streets.
Matahin added that the bulldozers destroyed water and sewage networks, in addition to communication and electricity networks.
He also said that occupation forces burned several commercial stalls at the central vegetable market in the city, causing severe damage.
On Saturday evening, the Israeli soldiers injured an unspecified number of Palestinians in a violent raid and armed settlers also attacked cars near the city of al-Khalil (Hebron) in southern West Bank.
Media sources said several Israeli military jeeps invaded the al-Arroub refugee camp north of al-Khalil and fired rubber-coated steel bullets, gas bombs, and concussion grenades, causing scores of Palestinians to suffer the effects of tear gas inhalation.
In Halhoul town north of al-Khalil, a group of Israeli settlers from the Karmie Tzur illegal colony attacked many cars and caused damage.
Elsewhere in the occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers on Saturday night shot a Palestinian teenager with a live round in the back in the Askar refugee camp, east of Nablus.
The PRCS reported that its crews dealt with a 17-year-old who was shot in the back, with the medics treating the wounded before transferring him to a hospital in Nablus.
The teenager was shot after many Israeli military vehicles, accompanied by an armored bulldozer, invaded the refugee camp and destroyed infrastructure, leading to protests.
The latest fatalities brought the tally of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in the Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas governorates since the dawn of Wednesday to 22.
The heightened tensions in the occupied West Bank come as the Israeli regime has since October last year been conducting a barbaric onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip, claiming the lives of more than 40,000 people, most of them women and children."

Tehran, IRNA -- Some news outlets reported late on Friday that the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has targeted the Zionist regime's bases and settlements in northern occupied Palestine through tens of missiles.
The alarm was sounded continuously from eight sites in northern Israel in order to warn the settlers against the missiles, according to Al Jazeera.
Also, Israel's Channel 12 reported that the regime has intercepted some of the fired missiles from Lebanon to Western Galilee in northern occupied Palestine and annihilated them.
Further, an Al Jazeera correspondent reported a huge explosion near a trade center in northern Bethlehem.
Is seems that Hezbollah targeted the northern occupied Palestine under the retaliatory measures as the Israeli regime had attacked the Lebanese southern areas hours before.
From the start of the war in Gaza last October, resistance groups in Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and Yemen have been carrying out anti-Israel operations in support of the Palestinian people and in order to reduce pressure on the Resistance in Gaza.
Since the time, over 40,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza.

I5JLMV0WHW_GY9SELR5O90VEJD,Emad,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/emad.htm,"Emad ballistic missile is the Iranian liquid-fuel long-ranged ballistic missile equipped with a guided warhead by installing balks on the Emad warhead. The Emad ballistic missile can carry a 750 kg payload at a range of 1700 km. Once Emad's reentry vehicle enters the atmosphere, they can start to maneuver and alter their trajectory. This is done to increase precision and to perform random evasive maneuvering.
A September 2024 report shared exclusively with The Associated Press suggests one of the advanced missiles Tehran would use in any future attack against Israel is far less accurate than previously thought. Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies examined the Iranian strike on the Nevatim Air Base some 65 kilometers south of Jerusalem in the Negev Desert. Assuming Iran targeted Israeli F-35I fighter jet hangars, the James Martin analysts measured the distance between the hangars and the impact zones of the missiles. That gave an average of about 1.2 kilometers for the circular error probable. Thats far worse than a 500-meter error circle first estimated by experts for the Emad. Iran separately advertised the Emad to potential international buyers as having a 50-meter circle.
Emad is variant of Imad and has the exact same meaning and pronunciation. Either Emad or Imad, both are correct and acceptable. Emad is a direct Quranic name for boys that means pillars. It is usually short for Emad ad-Deen, which means pillars of the religion, i.e. a person who is a strong supporter of Islam. The word Emad is mentioned in the Quran in 89:7: ""Iram, the civilization that had pillars, the like of which were not created in any other city."" (Quran 89:7-8)
This missile is the first long-range missile of the Islamic Republic of Iran with the ability to guide and control until the moment it hits the target; which is able to hit the desired targets with high precision and destroy them completely. All the stages of design and construction of Emad ballistic missile have been done by scientists and specialists of Aerospace Industries Organization of the Ministry of Defense.
In response to the Israeli attack on Iran's consulate building in Syria on April 1, the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) fired dozens of missiles and drones on Israeli targets on 13 April 2024. Irans anti-Israel operation was conducted by Shahed 131/136 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Kheibar Shekan ballistic missiles, Emad ballistic missiles, and Paveh cruise missiles. Five to ten minutes before the surviving drones and cruise missiles were to reach their intended targets in the occupied territories, Iran launched the main weapons of the True Promise operation. The ballistic missiles were not launched simultaneously on purpose to reduce the shock effect on Israel's missile defenses. Surviving drones and cruise missiles put additional stress on the radars and sensors, creating completely different targets at lower altitudes.
Descending from space like meteors, Ghadr and Emad would have first faced Israel's Arrow-3 missile interceptors, as well as U.S. SM-3. Those older Iranian missiles mainly defend themselves with inflatable decoys in space. The expensive and advanced American AN/TPY-2 could have helped Israel's missile defenses to identify which objects were warheads, which empty spent boosters, and which were decoys. In the chaos of ballistic missiles re-entry vehicle housing the warhead, spent booster stages, and submunitions released by Ghadr, Emad missiles would also have released their decoys to survive against Arrow-3 and SM-3.
Emad would rely on a short atmospheric flight time, enabled by a steep dive trajectory, plus random evasive maneuvering. Arrow-2, Patriot and David-Sling are the systems that tried to intercept the maneuvering Emads re-entry vehicles. Emad missiles were also fast and glowing objects descending and impacting at 6-7 times the speed of sound. The slow glowing objects seemed to be the submunitions of Ghadr and the slow objects in flame were likely the separated empty booster stages.
Imad is a single-stage liquid fuel missile with a detachable warhead, which was developed based on the Qadr missile. The Emad missile can carry a maximum of 500 kg of high-explosive materials. The presence of a detachable warhead that can be guided by four control blocks or canards has brought high accuracy to the Emad missile. This missile has the ability to launch from fixed and mobile platforms, and its nose is equipped with control and guidance systems and sensors. The length of this missile is 15 and a half meters and the diameter of its body is about 1 meter and 25 centimeters. The Emad missile has a weight of more than 17,000 kg, and the weight of its warhead is estimated at only 750 kg.
Irans Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan said 11 October 2015 the Islamic Republic successfully test-fired a new long-range ballistic missile, dubbed Emad. Speaking to reporters , Dehqan said the surface-to-surface missile has been completely designed and manufactured by experts of Irans Aerospace Industries Organization affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Defense. Emad is Irans first long-range missile with guidance and control systems which can hit targets and completely destroy them with high precision, the Iranian minister added. The Emad surface-to-surface missile was completely designed and manufactured by experts of Irans Aerospace Industries Organization affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Defense.
The Iranian defense minister said Emad would be mass produced and delivered to missile units of the Iranian Armed Forces soon to significantly enhance their tactical and operational power. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly said that its military might poses no threat to other countries, reiterating that its defense doctrine is merely based on deterrence.
The Iranian defense chief said that the JPCOA has not banned Iran from boosting its defense capabilities. He also stated that Defense Ministry pursues a strategy based on developing and increasing the missile capabilities of the Iranian Armed Forces and enhancing the Islamic Republics deterrent power. We do not ask for permission from anybody to increase our defense might and missile capability and are decisively following up our defense plans, particularly in the missile sector, Dehqan said, emphasizing that the manufacturing of Emad is an apparent example of such a strategy.
Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Hossein Dehqan said  16 December 2015 the recently test-fired precision-guided long-range Emad missile is a conventional armament. We consider defense as our inalienable and recognized right and will continue to design, manufacture and put into operation any necessary conventional weapons and equipment in order to defend the country, Dehqan said on Wednesday. Dehqan's remarks came a day after a panel of UN experts said in a confidential report that Irans firing of the long-range ballistic missile in October violated a UN Security Council resolution, alleging that the missile is capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
On the basis of its analysis and findings the Panel concludes that Emad launch is a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1929, the panel said. But Dehqan said, ""Our aim of carrying out this test was that we wanted to tell the world that the Islamic Republic of Iran acts based on its national interests and no power anywhere in the world can decide for our nation and country and [Iran] will not accept any restriction on this issue.
The Iranian defense minister said that despite certain restrictions stipulated in the UN Security Council Resolution 2231 under the terms of a July nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers Tehran will keep boosting its defense capabilities. Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia  plus Germany finalized the text of the agreement dubbed the JCPOA in the Austrian capital Vienna on July 14. On July 20, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2231, which bars Iran from developing missiles ""designed to carry nuclear warheads.""
At that time, some Lebanese media attributed the name of Iran's most accurate long-range missile to the martyrdom of Emad Mughniyeh. Emad was the first missile built and unveiled in October 2014 after the nuclear agreement, which attracted the attention of domestic and foreign experts and media and had many reactions at the international level. ""Kalam Elium"" news site, presenting a report in this regard, announced that this missile test was ""successful"" and was able to target the desired targets with high accuracy. The precision in the construction of this missile and its indigenous nature without the participation of any foreign country attracted the attention of the world's media.
The ""Naba"" news agency also wrote in the headline of the published report about the Emad missile that ""Tehran added the Emad to its ballistic missile stockpile."" ""Emad"" is able to destroy targets from a long distance. At the end of its report on the Emad missile test, the Saudi Al-Hiyah base wrote that Iran's action could be a threat to the Arab countries of the region. In its report on the missile capability of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Al-Laft news website wrote: Iran's long-range missiles have been envisioned for 10 years and have successfully passed their tests. It takes ten minutes to reach the occupied territories.
The Zionist newspaper Ha'aretz reflected the news of the successful test launch of the long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile Emad. According to this newspaper, the range of this missile and its accuracy are not known, but it is said that it can be controlled until the moment it hits the target. CNN, while publishing the news of the successful test of the Emad missile, said that this long-range ballistic missile was designed and built by Iranian experts, which, according to Iran's defense minister, can be controlled until the moment it hits the target.
Referring to the news of the unveiling of the Emad missile, the French news agency wrote that this missile was tested while some Iranian officials had announced months ago that the Islamic Republic's recent nuclear agreement with world powers may impose restrictions on the country's missile program. Iran has announced that its missiles will never carry nuclear warheads, because Tehran has no plans to produce nuclear weapons, but Iranian military officials have emphasized the development of the country's missile program.
One of the prominent experts of the Zionist regime's missile defense announced: Iranians have the ability to install warheads on ballistic missiles and can greatly increase the accuracy of their missiles and have a missile with a range of 2000 km with the ability to attack accurately. They have found that they easily paralyze the enemies of this country.
Members of Parliament praise the Ministry of Defense for the successful test of the ""Imad"" missile.  After the successful test of the Emad ballistic missile, 220 members of the Islamic Council expressed their appreciation and support for the successful test of the missile.  The successful test of the Emad long-range missile had a wide coverage in the international media. While acknowledging Iran's missile capability and continuing its Iran-phobic policies, the Western and especially the American media claimed: The test of this missile has violated the nuclear agreement between Iran and the 5+1 group!
In the exercise of the Great Prophet (PBUH) 17, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force once again practiced combined drone and missile operations, and in this exercise, a 200 x 180 meter replica of the Zionist regime's nuclear power plant known as Dimona was targeted by suicide missiles and drones. The Defense Group of Tasnim News Agency - the series of drills of the Prophet (PBUH) has alwaysbeen a reminder of the news of some of the most important defense achievements of the country; From the Huot missile torpedo in 1384 to the acquisition of maneuvering warheads for ballistic missiles in 1400, this was the news that was announced by the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force in the last stage of the exercise,
Until 2014 and the unveiling of the Emad missile, the warhead of Iranian long-range missiles only reached the accuracy obtained from the missile's navigation and guidance systems, and after being separated from the missile body, they could no longer correct the path and increase the accuracy. Of course, in the short-range and short-range tactical missile category, the Fateh missile family had the ability to guide to the end of the path. With the operationalization of the Emad missile, whose detachable warhead had a guidance and control system until the end of the path, Iranian long-range missiles entered the proud path of increasing accuracy to the point of pinpoint accuracy, which was praised several times by the Supreme Leader of the Revolution and the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. This capability was then extended to the Qadr, Qiyam and Khorramshahr family missiles, and even the Shahab 2 missiles did not benefit from this development.
The development of ballistic warheads with the ability to maneuver in the final phase causes the enemy's system to have difficulty in predicting the path by leaving the warhead out of the conventional ballistic trajectory and moving on paths that do not have a clear order, thus making it possible to counter The enemy's missile defense shield is reduced to almost zero, and the problem that happened to the Patriot in 1991 is systematically created this time.
The warhead of the Qadr F missile is similar to the detachable part of the warhead of Qiyam and Sajil missiles. The new warhead has more height and volume in the lower conical part, which can be the location of a propellant. For comparison, the simple guided type of three-cone warheads with control wings is related to the Qiyam guided missile. Despite the difference in dimensions, the new warhead (picture 2) is designed to be compatible with existing missiles, as a result of which all Qadr, Sajil and Qiyam missiles can be used effectively against targets protected by missile defense systems such as Patriot, Arrow, Thaad and Aegis are helping to start a new war.
The design and construction of such a warhead, from various aspects, including the design of the dynamic path and its calculations, the resistance of the structure against the strong inertial forces caused by the rapid change of direction, the construction of guidance and control systems with a very high response speed that responds to a projectile with a hypersonic speed (more than five times the speed of sound or above Mach 5) and of course hitting the intended target precisely at the final point is much more difficult than guided warheads, but the country's missile scientists have overcome these problems only 6 years after the unveiling of Emad. They have taken a very important step towards increasing the effectiveness of the country's missile power in the desired military equations of Islamic Iran.
Maneuverable ballistic warheads are only one step away from warheads or hypersonic gliding vehicle (HGV: Hypersonic Gliding Vehicle) warheads, which are currently considered the cutting edge of missile technology in the warheads sector. This type of projectile is different from maneuvering warheads only in its design and flight path, and its speed varies from Mach 5 to 20 depending on the design and opinion of the manufacturer. HGV projectiles, instead of gaining height like ballistic projectiles, travel at a much lower height with the possibility of changing the direction of the target frequently, and as a result, the early warning radars of the enemy's defense have problems in identifying them, and the probability of surprising the enemy's missile defense system is much higher.

Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi has expressed confidence that Moldovan authorities and society can ensure smooth and democratic elections despite fears of Russian meddling when voters go to the polls in three months to pick a president and weigh in on EU aspirations.
Senior Moldovan officials have repeatedly accused Moscow of hybrid and other attempts to undermine the pro-Western government in Chisinau -- including through covert operations and influence campaigns -- since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in early 2022.
Reform-minded President Maia Sandu is running for reelection on October 20 in a vote that will coincide with a referendum asking Moldovans if they want the pursuit of EU membership enshrined in the constitution.
""We are confident...like in previous elections, when we've had challenges, but we've always had democratic elections,"" Popsoi told RFE/RL at the Globsec security conference in Prague on August 31, after acknowledging the perceived risk from Russian and pro-Russian elements.
""And democratic standards for elections are sacrosanct in Moldova,"" he added.
The United States, in particular, has warned of alleged Russian plans to use disinformation to interfere in the October voting to derail Moldova's significant progress on reforms.
Moldova lies between Ukraine and Romania and has been riven for decades by a pro-Russian breakaway leadership in its Transdniester region, where Russia maintains hundreds of troops at a former Soviet weapons depot.
""We are working with our electorate, campaigning, explaining, the risks and the threats that Moldova faces in a democratic environment, in a competitive democratic space, which unfortunately the pro-Russian candidates would not be able to enjoy in Russia,"" Popsoi said.
Moldovan authorities initially banned a party founded by fugitive businessman Ihan Shor, a 37-year-old entrepreneur convicted in Moldova of masterminding the theft in 2014 of around $1 billion in banking assets who has since resettled in Russia.
But critics have also suggested that pro-Russian parties are trying to unseat Sandu and her allies but also use the threat of unrest to destabilize the vote.
""Of course there might be attempts, but as long as there is a democratic election, our citizens have learned through many iterations to accept the outcomes of elections,"" Popsoi said. ""You may not like it, but it's a democratic election.""
U.S. officials have said the election will be ""historic and pivotal"" for the country of around 3 million people.
""We are optimistic that our citizens, by and large the majority, know to make the difference between right and wrong,"" Popsoi said. ""And those that may be full victims to certain instrumentalizations by the Kremlin will not be large enough to cause any significant troubles.""

IIEQUES3XW_9ZCIFKO4A4O6CFY,Foreign Ministry statement on the terrorist attack against Belgorod by the Ukrainian Nazis,_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/08/ukraine-240831-russia-mfa01.htm,"31 August 2024 13:10  1600-31-08-2024
Zelensky's neo-Nazi junta continues to terrorise civilians in Russia. On the evening of August 30, its fighters perpetrated yet another crime by using Vampire, a Czech-made multiple rocket launcher, to shell Belgorod and its suburbs with cluster munitions. This barbaric strike left five civilians dead and 46 wounded, including seven minors. One child is in a critical condition and has already undergone surgery. Two adult patients are on their way to Moscow for medical treatment. Residential buildings and other civilian sites have been damaged in the attack.
The Foreign Ministry sincerely mourns the victims and wishes the wounded a speedy recovery.
Russia's Investigative Committee launched a criminal investigation into the attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces against Belgorod and the Belgorodsky District as per Article 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (terrorist attack). It is gathering information regarding the circumstances of the attack. All those who plotted and carried out this and other crimes perpetrated by the Kiev junta will face inevitable punishment under the law.
There is no doubt that this terrorist attack was designed to sow fear among people and was carefully planned well in advance. Once again, the Kiev clique demonstrated its Nazi essence - just like eight decades ago, during the Nazi invasion, today's followers of the Nazis and Bandera continue killing innocent people.
Just as back then, the supposedly civilised and enlightened West world, which in reality supports the Nazis, turns a blind eye to their bloody atrocities while also delivering lethal weapons to the cynical killers it nurtured. NATO-made missiles brought all this suffering, fires and destruction to the Belgorod Region. The name of these missiles, Vampire, is quite telling. The Ukrainian Nazis and their Western masters, the bloodsuckers of the 21st century, must recall the lessons of history and seriously consider about the disrepute and infamy the European fascists and their Banderite accomplices had to face at the end of their life's journey in May 1945.
Once again, we call on the responsible governments and the relevant international structures to firmly condemn this outrageous terrorist attack and to distance themselves in public from the Kiev regime and its Western curators who commit these crimes. Staying silent in the face of this rampant manifestations of barbarism by the Ukrainian Nazis and their puppeteers and accomplices representing the so-called civilised democracies will be akin to assisting them in their bloody acts.
All this senseless and cruel shelling targeting residential neighbourhoods in Donbass, the Belgorod, Kursk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, Crimea and other Russian regions, as well as the merciless killings of civilians - all this testifies to  the agony of the criminal Zelensky regime. It has been mired in terrorist, illegal, corrupt and cynical practices. All it seeks in its impotent rage is to kill as many Russians as possible.
However, no matter how hard it tries, its efforts will be vain and doomed to fail. People living in these Russian regions have demonstrated their courage and resilience by staying calm and reserved, while the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are ready to promptly respond to any crime by the Ukrainian militants.
The special military operation will carry on until it reaches all its objectives, including de-Nazification and demilitarisation of Ukraine."

Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler has expressed satisfaction with the process of rapprochement and restoration of diplomatic relations with Syria, stating that a quick normalization of mutual ties is in the interest of both neighboring countries.
On Saturday, Guler recalled Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's statement about his willingness to meet with his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad, noting that Damascus has accepted Ankara's initiative positively.
He also described as ""quite positive"" the recent statements by the Syrian leader that rapprochement with Turkey requires mutual respect for sovereignty and a true commitment to addressing the root causes of tensions in bilateral relations between Damascus and Ankara.
""I don't think there is an insurmountable problem between us. Once we resolve our issues, we can continue our normal activities as neighboring countries. Resolution of the conflict will be in the interest of both sides,"" Guler stated.
Addressing the People's Assembly, Syria's legislative authority, on August 25, Assad said, ""For any normalization of relations to occur, Turkey must reverse the policies that have led to the current situation, including the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Syrian territory and the cessation of support for terrorist groups.""
Assad emphasized that such issues are not mere conditions but fundamental requirements for successful diplomacy.
The Syrian leader also called for a formal agreement between Damascus and Ankara, which would outline the principles for future negotiations and ensure that all steps are aligned with international law and the sovereignty of both countries.
The normalization of relations between Ankara and Damascus commenced on December 28, 2022, marked by a meeting in Moscow involving the defense ministers of Russia, Syria, and Turkey. The gathering represented the most significant dialogue between the two nations since the onset of the Syrian conflict.
Since 2016, Turkey has undertaken three significant ground operations targeting militants in northern Syria who are supported by the United States.
The Turkish government asserts that the US-backed Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militants have connections to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militant group.
Syria considers the Turkish presence on its soil to be illegal, saying it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty against the occupying forces.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tied rapprochement with Turkey to Ankara's ending occupation of the northern parts of the Arab country and its support for militant groups wreaking havoc and fighting against the Damascus government."
IK88KORT2K_2UHL4OX3CEP2U2I,Ossetian Wife Of Notorious Tajik Islamic State Recruiter Gets 11 Years In Prison,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2024/09/sec-240904-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Tajik Service September 04, 2024
A court in Russia in early August sentenced Madina Bondarenko, the Ossetian wife of a notorious recruiter for the Islamic State (IS) extremist group in Tajikistan, to 11 years in prison on a charge of being a member of a terrorist group, one of her relatives told RFE/RL on September 3.
Bondarenko, who was accused by Russia of cooperating with and belonging to IS, was extradited from Tajikistan in May 2023.
She is the wife of Parviz Saidrahmonov (aka Abu Dovud), who was sentenced to 21 years in prison in November on terrorism charges in Dushanbe.
Bondarenko's relative said she rejected the charge, saying that her husband tricked her when he brought her to Syria via Turkey several years ago as she was unaware that their final destination would be Syria. However, the court took into account Saidrahmonov's testimony to Russian investigators in which he said his wife went to Syria voluntarily, knowing that the couple planned to join IS there.
The couple and their children were extradited to Tajikistan from Turkey in 2022.
Saidrahmonov was accused of recruiting more than 200 people to fight in Syria and Iraq and was alleged to be behind multiple terrorist activities in Tajikistan, Russia, and Sweden.
He was sentenced on charges of organizing a terrorist group, extremism, and recruiting mercenaries to fight in a foreign country. Saidrahmonov was a migrant worker in Russia when he left in 2014 for Iraq and Syria, where he joined the ranks of IS.
Swedish investigators say Saidrahmonov was an accomplice of Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek man who was convicted of murder and terrorism for driving a hijacked truck down a busy pedestrian street in Stockholm on April 7, 2017, killing five people and injuring 14 others.
Akilov, a rejected asylum seeker in Sweden before the attack who was in contact with alleged IS militants from Tajikistan, was sentenced to life in prison in June 2018.
Saidrahmonov was later captured by Syrian authorities and in mid-2020 disappeared from a prison in the Syrian town of Afrin when Tajikistan was working on his extradition to Dushanbe.
Tajik authorities, who took Saidrahmonov into custody in September 2022, consider him to be ""one of the most dangerous recruiters of Islamic State.""
Dushanbe estimates that about 2,000 Tajik citizens joined IS in Iraq and Syria in 2013-15. Hundreds of them were killed in clashes in the Middle East. Some of those who returned to Tajikistan were either sentenced to lengthy prison terms or received amnesty.

Tehran, IRNA -- Israelis have packed streets across the occupied territories to demand a truce deal for the release of captives still held in Gaza, while planning a general strike to increase pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept an agreement with Hamas.
Protests erupted on Sunday night in different cities including Tel Aviv, Haifa and occupied Al-Quds.
In Tel Aviv alone, 300,000 people were estimated to attend, with some blocking a major highway. Police used water cannons to disperse the crowd. Arrests were also made in Haifa.
The demonstrations took place after the Israeli military said that it had located and recovered the bodies of six captives in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday.
The protesters urged Netanyahu to urgently accept a deal with the Palestinian Hamas Resistance Movement for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining captives.
The Sunday demonstrations were among the biggest rallies in Israel in the past months since Hamas captured some 250 people, including Israelis and non-Israelis, during its October 7 Al-Aqsa Storm Operation on southern Israeli-occupied territories.
Dozens of captives have already been released, while around 100 remain in Gaza.
Israelis blame Netanyahu for the prolonged captivity of their loved ones, as he insists on his demand for keeping the regime's control of Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer area along Gaza-Egypt border. Netanyahu is accused of blocking a ceasefire-captive deal by setting Israel's maintaining control of the Philadelphi corridor as a condition for any such deal.
Israel's largest labor union has called for a general strike beginning on Monday to increase pressure on Netanyahu, saying that the entire Israeli economy will shut down. Opposition leader Yair Lapid is said to be among those calling for the strike action.
Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official has said that the six captives had been killed by Israeli fire and bombing.

Tuesday, 03 September 2024 4:20 PM
An independent UN expert has warned that Israel's ""genocidal violence"" in Gaza risks spreading to the occupied West Bank and other parts of Palestine.
In a statement released on Tuesday, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories, said Israel's recent intensification of military assaults in the West Bank marked ""a dangerous escalation.""
""Israel's genocidal violence risks leaking out of Gaza and into the occupied Palestinian territory as a whole,"" she said.
""The writing is on the wall, and we cannot continue to ignore it. There is mounting evidence that no Palestinian is safe under Israel's unfettered control.""
Systematic aerial and ground attacks on Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem and Tubas governorates, particularly targeting refugee camps, have intensified in the past few months.
On August 28, Israeli forces launched a full-scale military onslaught against these areas that have already killed dozens of Palestinians.
The increasing violence in the West Bank coincides with unprecedented levels of displacement, depopulation and land confiscation carried out by Israeli soldiers in collaboration with settlers in the occupied region.
""Apartheid Israel is targeting Gaza and the West Bank simultaneously, as part of an overall process of elimination, replacement and territorial expansion"" Albanese said.
This continues even after the International Court of Justice concluded that this occupation is unlawful.
""The long-standing impunity granted to Israel is enabling the de-Palestinisation of the occupied territory, leaving Palestinians at the mercy of the forces pursuing their elimination as a national group,"" warned the expert.
""The international community, made of both states and non-state actors, including companies and financial institutions, must do everything it can to immediately end the risk of genocide against the Palestinian people under Israel's occupation, ensure accountability and ultimately end Israel's colonization of Palestinian territory.""
Experts believe continuous genocidal incitements by top Israeli officials, soldiers, armed settlers and others, prove the intent to destroy the Palestinian people under occupation.
Increasingly loud calls by Israeli officials for turning the towns in the West Bank and refugee camps into a ""mini-Gaza"" are translating into military action causing widespread destruction to the West Bank's urban areas.
The latest wave of aggression is the worst since the Second Intifada in the occupied West Bank more than two decades ago.
According to Palestinian Health officials, Israeli raids across the West Bank have so far left at least 30 Palestinians dead and more than one-hundred-twenty injured.
West Bank's Jenin 'ravaged by violence': UN
The head of UN agency for Palestinian refugees says Jenin has been ""ravaged by violence (and) destruction"" for a seventh day due to the Israeli military's operation in the Palestinian territory.
""Over more than 150 hours, people have been undergoing an Israeli military operation, armed clashes & the use of explosives by Palestinian armed groups. Residents have limited access to food, water & medicine,"" UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X."
IPFZDI13HN_NPYWQUQJ37Z6KE0,Alleged cybercriminal wanted by US spent 15 years evading arrest,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2024/09/sec-240904-voa01.htm,"By Matthew Kupfer September 04, 2024
When the U.S. State Department recently offered up to $2.5 million for information leading to the arrest of alleged cyber-fraudster Volodymyr Kadariya, it marked another turn in a saga that saw the man transform from suspected criminal to political dissident and back.
For 15 years, Kadariya has been wanted in his native Belarus on cybercrime charges.
American prosecutors accuse him of involvement in a scheme to transmit malicious malware to U.S. computers. Millions of internet users reportedly fell victim to the scheme.
But Kadariya has been particularly elusive.
After coming under suspicion in Belarus, he fled the country and lived abroad for many years. During this time, he managed to obtain asylum and eventually citizenship in Ukraine, according to multiple media reports and official government statements from the United States and Belarus.
When he was detained in Kyrgyzstan in 2022 on the Belarusian charges, he claimed to be facing political persecution. Even United Nations officials spoke out against his extradition.
Today, as the United States seeks his arrest, it is unclear whether Kadariya is even at liberty.
Mystery man
There is little publicly available information about Volodymyr â or, alternately, Vladimir Kadariya. That may not even be his real name.
Kadariya, 38, is a native of Belarus. Around 2008, he came under suspicion of stealing large sums of money ""by modifying computer information,"" according to the country's investigative committee.
Kadariya allegedly purchased stolen bank card information on the ""darknet,"" encoded it onto dummy cards, and used them to withdraw money.
Belarusian investigators say citizens of the United States, Poland, France and Britain fell victim to the scheme.
They also claim that, in 2016, Kadariya applied for refugee status in Ukraine. Later, he likely obtained Ukrainian citizenship.
Equally, little is known about Kadariya's life in Ukraine. According to open databases, someone with his rare name was previously among the beneficiaries of two Ukrainian companies: Cosmo Medical and Digital Med.
Kadariya also shows up in a photo from IT Nature Party International, a 2018 party held on the outskirts of Kyiv.
Arrest and extradition
According to Belarusian investigators, in 2022, they learned that Kadariya had been living for some time in Spain. After he flew to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, he was detained that September. Minsk requested his extradition.
Kadariya claimed he was being persecuted for political reasons in his homeland. Whether or not that claim was true, it likely sounded plausible.
After the 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, which the United States deemed fraudulent, a wave of protests struck the country. Security forces arrested thousands of people. There are still more than 1,500 political prisoners in Belarus.
Some estimates suggest that up to half a million Belarusians left the country in the wake of the crackdown.
In Kyrgyzstan, Kadariya claimed he was a Belarusian citizen originally named Andrei Kovalev. He received refugee status in Ukraine in 2017. Later, when receiving citizenship, he changed his name, his Kyrgyz lawyer told RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service in March 2023.
In a March 2023 interview with Current Time, a Russian-language TV and digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA, Kadariya claimed he had worked as the administrator of an opposition website in Minsk that published articles about corruption. He said that Belarusian security forces detained him in 2008 and seized his laptop, but due to data encryption, they could not confirm his connection to the opposition. After being released in 2008, Kadariya immediately left the country.
The Kyrgyz Prosecutor General's Office did not find any political motives in the charges against Kadariya and a court soon approved his extradition.
Kadariya tried to appeal. His lawyer said that his extradition would violate Kyrgyzstan's obligations to international organizations.
After the court rejected Kadariya's appeal, the United Nations weighed in. In a letter to the Kyrgyz prosecutor general, representatives of the U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Kadariya should not be deported because he had requested asylum in Kyrgyzstan. According to them, the court's decision to extradite him violated the U.N. Refugee Convention and local legislation, Current Time reported.
Kadariya penned an appeal to President Sadyr Japarov asking the Kyrgyz leader to prevent his deportation.
In March 2023, he was extradited back to Belarus.
In a video published that month by Belarusian investigators on the Telegram messenger, Kadariya states that he has no connections to the opposition and had never been involved in politics.
Dmytro Mazurok, a Ukrainian lawyer based in Kyiv who specializes in migration, says he would not trust a statement given in the presence of Belarusian investigators.
""They have a harsh system of coercion,"" he said.
At the same time, it's not unfathomable that Kadariya could have received asylum in Ukraine on false grounds â particularly at the time he applied.
""I can say for sure that obtaining refugee status and, subsequently, citizenship for a person with money is not a problem,"" Mazurok told VOA.
American accusations
On August 12, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Maksim Silnikau, the alleged leader of a cybercriminal group, was extradited from Poland to the U.S.
American prosecutors allege that he worked together with Kadariya and one other alleged cybercriminal, Russian citizen Andrei Tarasov. Like Kadariya, Silnikau holds both Belarusian and Ukrainian citizenships.
According to a New Jersey indictment, from 2013 to 2022 the three men used so-called malvertising on the internet to infect Americans' computers with malicious software, including one called ""Angler Exploit Kit.""
Among the ways they allegedly profited from this scheme was by selling stolen user information and access to infected devices to other cybercriminals.
To promote their scheme, the three accomplices created domains to host malware and posed as legitimate advertisers, the indictment states. It describes Kadariya as a ""malicious advertiser.""
If found guilty, each man could face 27 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 10 years for conspiracy to commit computer fraud, and 20 years for each count of wire fraud.
In Kadariya's case, one important question remains: Is he at large?
VOA was unable to contact Kadariya for comment or confirm his whereabouts.
He may be in custody in Belarus, where he was extradited a year-and-a-half ago, but the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.
The State Department and DOJ also did not answer VOA's questions about Kadariya's whereabouts.
Notably, the State Department announced August 26 that it is offering the $2.5 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction ""in any country."""
IPIWYRNW8I_36QLPK4XQBP9FNH,Moscow accuses Kyiv of launching massive drone attack on Russia,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240901-voa01.htm,"By VOA News September 01, 2024
Russian officials said Ukraine launched a massive drone attack early Sunday, hitting several regions in Russia, including power and refinery plants in Moscow and the nearby city of Tver.
Russia says air defenses intercepted and destroyed 158 Ukrainian drones, including two over Moscow and nine over the surrounding area. Forty-six drones were intercepted over Kursk, which has seen increased Ukrainian activity.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported that falling debris from two drones caused a fire at an oil refinery. He explained that the fire was in a ""separate technical room"" at the plant, but operations were not affected.
State news agency TASS later quoted emergency services as saying the blaze had been contained.
Three drones attempted to strike a coal-fired power plant at Kashira, but no injuries or damage were reported.
It was not possible to independently confirm the Russian reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.
Separately, Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's Kharkiv region injured more than 40 people, including five children. Overnight shelling in the Sumy area left one person dead and four wounded, according to local officials.
Elsewhere, at least three people were killed and nine wounded Sunday in Russian shelling in Kurakhove, about 33 kilometers south of Pokrovsk, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said.
The Ukrainian air force also shot down eight of 11 drones launched by Russia overnight.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for more advanced Western missiles to target more deeply into Russian territory.
It has also been nearly a month since Ukraine went on the offensive in Russia's Kursk region, even as Russian troops are reported to be making advances in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donetsk region.
Russia's defense ministry said Sunday it had taken control of the towns of Pivnichne and Vyimka, in Ukraine's Donetsk region. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claim.
Russian forces have been driving more deeply into the partly occupied eastern region; one of the Kremlin's primary ambitions is the total capture of the area. Russia's army is getting closer to Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub for the Ukrainian military in the area.
Kyiv is urging Washington to lift restrictions on using allied-supplied weapons to strike deep inside Russia. Ukraine argues such strikes would greatly impede Moscow' s ability to continue its attacks on Ukraine.
Senior officials from Zelenskyy's administration were in Washington last week, appealing to the United States for what Zelenskyy called ""capabilities to truly and fully"" protect his country.

IVKN6KZQNF_YDMHSHFCWU4E8F9,"Tens of thousands protest in Israel, as Netanyahu vows to 'settle the score' with Hamas",_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240901-voa02.htm,"By VOA News September 01, 2024
Tens of thousands of Israelis protested in the streets Sunday night, chanting ""Now! Now!"" as they demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reach a cease-fire with Hamas after six more hostages were found dead in Gaza.
Thousands of people gathered outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. In Tel Aviv, hostages' relatives marched with coffins to symbolize the death toll.
""We really think that the government is making these decisions for its own conservation and not for the lives of the hostages, and we need to tell them, 'Stop!'"" Shlomit Hacohen, a Tel Aviv resident, told The Associated Press.
The protest appeared to be the largest such demonstration in nearly 11 months of war.
Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu vowed to intensify the fight with Hamas after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages, all of whom were apparently shot to death by the militants just as troops were zeroing in on their location in Gaza.
""Those who kill hostages do not want an agreement"" for a Gaza cease-fire, Netanyahu said in a statement, telling Hamas leaders, ""We will hunt you down, we will catch you and we will settle the score.""
A military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, told reporters in a briefing, ""According to our initial estimation, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them."" They were found in a tunnel in the southern city of Rafah.
By evening, grieving and angry Israelis surged into the streets, chanting, ""Now! Now!"" and demanding that Netanyahu reach a cease-fire with Hamas to bring the remaining hostages home and halt nearly 11 months of fighting in Gaza.
Israel's largest trade union, the Histadrut, called a general strike for Monday to try to bring economic pressure on the government. The strike is expected to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, health care and the country's main airport.
Netanyahu also accused Hamas of carrying out a shooting attack earlier Sunday that killed three police officers near the city of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has not claimed responsibility for the attack but called it a ""heroic operation by the resistance.""
Netanyahu said, ""We are fighting on all fronts against a cruel enemy who wants to murder us all. The fact that Hamas continues to commit atrocities such as those it committed on October 7 obliges us to do everything we can to ensure that it can no longer do so.""
The Israeli military said the West Bank attackers fired at a vehicle at the checkpoint near Hebron. ""Security forces have begun to search for the terrorists,"" it said in a statement.
While the fighting in Gaza and the West Bank remained at the forefront, ""humanitarian pauses"" were started at several locations in Gaza so that the U.N. agency for Palestinians and the World Health Organization could start vaccinating 640,000 children under the age of 10 over the next several days against the threat of polio.
The disease was recently detected in Gaza for the first time in 25 years.
An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" show that Israeli forces are continuing to search tunnels near where the bodies of the hostages were found, only a kilometer from where a living hostage, Qaid Farhan Alkadi, a member of the Bedouin community in southern Israel, was rescued last week.
Oma Neutra, the mother of another hostage, Omer Neutra-Oma, said on CNN, ""It's time for the leaders to get this done,"" to reach a cease-fire to halt nearly 11 months of fighting in Gaza precipitated by the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.
""Enough is enough,"" she said.
The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.
Israel says it believes 101 Israeli and foreign hostages remain in Gaza, but about one-third of them is believed to be dead, while the fate of the others is not known.
Senior Hamas officials said that Israel, in its refusal to sign a cease-fire agreement, was to blame for the newest deaths.
""Netanyahu is responsible for the killing of Israeli prisoners,"" senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. ""The Israelis should choose between Netanyahu and the deal.""
Hamas has offered to release the hostages in return for an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants, jailed by Israel.
The Hostage Families Forum called on Netanyahu to take responsibility and explain what was holding up an agreement.
""They were all murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity. The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,"" it said.
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called on the government to reverse a decision last Thursday to keep Israeli forces in the Philadelphi Corridor along the border with Egypt, a key point of contention in negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza.
""The Cabinet must gather immediately and reverse the decision made on Thursday,"" Gallant said in a statement. ""We must bring back the hostages that are still being held by Hamas."" Gallant and Netanyahu got into a shouting match over the corridor issue, but other security officials sided with Netanyahu.
U.S. President Joe Biden, who has closely followed the fate of the hostages, said the six bodies found in the Gaza tunnel included Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Biden said he was ""devastated and outraged.""
""Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,"" he said in a statement.
Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, spoke to Goldberg-Polin's parents, Jon and Rachel, to express their condolences.
""My heart breaks for their pain and anguish,"" Harris said. ""I told them: As they mourn this terrible loss, they are not alone. Our nation mourns with them.""

IWCC95N7Q9_062VIS1A7JZFCM6,Baluch Leader Resigns From Pakistani Parliament,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/pakistan/2024/pakistan-240903-rferl01.htm,"By RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal September 03, 2024
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the chaiman of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) and a veteran politician, has resigned his seat in Pakistan's lower house of parliament, the National Assembly.
Balochistan in southwestern Pakistan borders Afghanistan and Iran and is home to Pakistan's Baluch ethnic minority. It has been the scene of a low-level insurgency and brutal army crackdown for years.
""I have resigned as member of the National Assembly,"" Mengal wrote on X on September 3, according to Radio Mashaal.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad later the same day, Mengal said he cannot serve his people as a member of the parliament and there was therefore no reason to stay in the seat.
A radical group known as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has waged an insurgency there for decades against the Pakistani state, carrying out mostly small-scale attacks against government forces.
But the region was the scene in late August of the deadliest bombings and shootings in years, and the BLA appears to have gained strength.
Pakistani militant groups including the BLA are believed to have obtained U.S. weapons and military equipment since U.S. and international forces pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021, leaving behind billions of dollars' worth of military gear and weapons seized by the hard-line fundamentalist Taliban after it took power in Kabul.

Ilya Tsukanov  20240904
The Kremlin confirmed on Wednesday that Moscow is working on an updated nuclear doctrine, taking into account the actions of the collective West. Veteran military analyst and retired Russian Army Colonel Viktor Litovkin breaks down the details of Russia's current nuclear doctrine, and comments on what the updated document may entail.
""Against the backdrop of challenges and threats provoked by the countries of the so-called Collective West, the Russian Federation is currently working to develop new approaches in the context of the upcoming renewal of the nuclear doctrine,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.
""This update is required by the current agenda and state affairs which arose as a consequence of the actions of the collective West,"" Peskov said. ""What kinds of actions are we talking about? They include the rejection of dialogue with the Russian Federation, the continued policy of attacking the interests and security of the Russian Federation, and provoking the protraction of the hot war in Ukraine. This cannot but have consequences. All of this has been taken account of by Moscow, is being analyzed, and will form the basis for the proposals that will be formulated.""
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova clarified that the update to the nuclear doctrine is connected to the ""strategic risks"" resulting from Western countries' policy in general, and to ""global and regional challenges to international security which are multiplying thanks to the absolutely irresponsible position of the West.""
Wednesday's remarks come after a series of statements from senior Russian officials, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, confirming that efforts were underway to update Russia's nuclear doctrine, and make possible changes to account for threats, including discussions among NATO countries about the permissibility of the use of low yield, tactical, so-called battlefield nuclear weapons.
""The United States and NATO are becoming increasingly aggressive toward Russia, and we need to make clarifications to some fundamental documents"" regarding Russia's nuclear doctrine, veteran military analyst Viktor Litovkin told Sputnik.
""The war in Ukraine is not a war between Ukraine and Russia. It is a war between the West and Russia using the territory of Ukraine, and the lives of Ukrainian servicemen. It is an attempt to weaken Russia, to bring Russia to ruin and to deprive Russia of its competitive advantage in the international arena,"" Litovkin explained.
Russia ""is not going to seek hegemony, as the US is doing, but we are also not going to lose our independence, sovereignty and right to independent action,"" Litovkin added.
NATO has tested Moscow's red lines repeatedly over the course of the proxy conflict in Ukraine, gradually ramping up the deadliness of offensive strike systems sent to Kiev, providing the Zelensky regime with intelligence and other battlefield support, looking the other way on the flow of mercenaries to the battlefield (which some Russian commanders suspect include active duty NATO servicemen), sabotaging peace talks, boasting openly about the alliance's intention to use the crisis to try to ""weaken Russia"" and fight Russia 'to the last Ukrainian', and feigning ignorance of Ukraine's attempts to target the assets of Russia's nuclear triad.
Russia's current nuclear doctrine consists of four key points divided among two documents, according to Litovkin - one being Russia's general Military Doctrine, and the other a June 2020 presidential decree 'On the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence'.
The former provides for the use of nuclear weapons in two cases:  1. if Russia or its allies are attacked by a country or coalition of countries using nuclear weapons,  2. if Russia is attacked by an aggressor or coalition of aggressors using conventional means so severe the very existence of the state is threatened.
The latter allows Russia to fire its nuclear weapons:  1. if it becomes aware that a ballistic missile has been launched toward it, or  2. if a strike is launched at government and military command and control centers.
Litovkin believes the ultimate goal of the updated Russian nuclear doctrine will be ""to combine these two documents into one,"" and ""clarify the role of nuclear weapons in ensuring Russia's security and ensuring deterrence against a possible aggressor.""
""I believe these two documents will form the basis of the new military doctrine. There may also be some additional clarifications in connection with the fact that the international situation is changing,"" Litovkin said.

This morning, our hearts are broken alongside the families of Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, and Eden Yerushalmi, may their memories be a blessing.
A few hours ago, we informed the families that the bodies of their loved ones had been located by IDF troops in an underground tunnel in Rafah. According to our initial assessment, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them.
They were abducted alive on the morning of October 7th by the Hamas terror organization. Their bodies were found during combat in Rafah in an underground tunnel, approximately one kilometer from the tunnel from which we rescued Farhan Alkadi a few days ago. Since Farhan's identification, the forces have been instructed to act with extra caution, even more so than usual, understanding that there might be additional hostages in the area. We did not have information on the exact location of the hostages. Combat was ongoing above ground, and the troops eliminated terrorists even during the battles there yesterday. The troops are still operating in the field at this time.
Last night, IDF troops located and retrieved the bodies of the hostages from the tunnel and brought them to Israeli territory for further identification. After the process, which was conducted by medical officials and the Lahav 443 Unit of the Israel Police, IDF representatives informed the families.
We share in the great sorrow of their families during this difficult time. It is impossible to put into words what the hostages have endured in Hamas captivity since October 7th, now 331 days, and what their families have been going through. This morning, this news shakes us all"

31 August 2024 - 20:42
Dear Ukrainians!  Today in Kharkiv, the clearing of rubble on the sites hit by Russian   bombs continues. In total, yesterday's strikes took the lives of six   people in Kharkiv. My condolences to their families and friends.
Ninety-seven people were injured; all of them were provided with the   necessary assistance. And this is just in Kharkiv, and this is just one   day of Russian strikes.
Since this morning, Russian terrorists have also been bombing the   Sumy region with guided aerial bombs, and again the Kharkiv region. And   this terror can be effectively stopped only in one way: by strikes on   Russian military airfields, on their bases, on the logistics of Russian   terror. And most importantly, it is possible. We talk about it every day   with our partners. We convince them. We present arguments.
These days, our Ukrainian delegation is working in Washington: the   First Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, representatives of   the General Staff, and the Head of the Office. There have been meetings   at various levels, and among the primary issues for us is the   long-range capability of our Defense Forces, the ability to prevent all   this terror that our Kharkiv and other our cities, many, so many   communities of Ukraine are forced to go through.
Clearing the Ukrainian skies of Russian guided aerial bombs is a   strong step to force Russia to seek an end to the war and a just peace.   Ukrainian representatives provided all the necessary information, all   the necessary details to our partners. And I appeal to the United   States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany: we need the abilities to   really and fully protect Ukraine and Ukrainians. We require both:   permissions for long-range use, and your long-range shells and missiles.   Vital decisions - exactly the ones that can influence events in the   right way - cannot be postponed.
We are also talking with our partners about air defense - about   systems, we need so much, especially now, before the school year starts,   to provide more security for our Ukrainian children in schools, for our   cities, for our energy sector. After all, we have the agreements with   you, on air defense and on missiles for air defense systems. It is   important to implement everything as soon as possible. We are working   even harder these days for such news - about additional air defense   systems.
I want to thank everyone in the world who is helping! And I thank all   the friends of Ukraine who do not keep silent about this Russian   terror, who react to all these strikes, who spread the truth about this   war and urge the world to be more decisive and therefore more effective   in defending Ukraine against Russia.
Today I spoke with the Commander-in-Chief. The Pokrovsk direction   faces the highest number of assaults. The situation is also difficult in   the Kramatorsk, Toretsk, and Kupyansk directions. Nearly two hundred   battles are being fought daily along the entire front. And the most   important thing now is to inflict maximum losses on the occupier and to   respond to all Russian strikes.
We also discussed with the Commander-in-Chief the details of our   offensive operations - active actions in the Kursk region. We continue   to replenish the exchange fund for Ukraine and push the war into Russian   territory. The resilience of each of our units, the precision of our   warriors and the strong decisions of our partners are equally crucial. I   thank all our combat brigades!
Glory to Ukraine!"

Taipei, Sept. 2 (CNA) President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸å¾·) said on Sunday that Beijing wishes to annex Taiwan because it wants to ""transform the rules-based global order"" and ""achieve hegemony"" and not because of concerns over ""territorial integrity.""
""China's intent to attack Taiwan and annex Taiwan isn't because any particular person or political party says something or does something,"" Lai said during a television interview broadcast Sunday evening.
""And a political party not saying something or not doing something won't be able to prevent China's aggression.""
Speaking on cable TV network ERATV's ""The View with Catherine Chang,"" Lai said China's aim of annexing Taiwan was not driven by concerns for ""territorial integrity.""
""If it is really about territorial integrity, why don't they take back the land that was signed away and occupied by Russia in the Treaty of Aigun?"" asked Lai, referring to the 1858 treaty signed by the Qing dynasty that ceded around 600,000 square kilometers of land in Manchuria to the Russian Empire.
According to Lai, China actually wants to annex Taiwan as part of its goal to ""transform the rules-based global order"" and ""achieve hegemony in the western Pacific region and internationally.""
During his hour-and-a-half interview with host Catherine Chang (å¼µéç´), Taiwan's president spoke on a wide range of topics, including his family background and upbringing, his interest in sports, high property prices, energy issues and the microchip industry.
The interview focused mostly, however, on issues related to Taiwan's sovereignty and Taiwan's position vis-a-vis growing Chinese assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region.
When asked by Chang what his attitude would be toward meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping (ç¿è¿å¹³), Lai responded by saying ""I'm not thinking about that.""
""As president and commander of the armed forces, my first mission is to ensure the nation's survival and development,"" he said.
Lai reiterated his government's opposition to the so-called ""1992 consensus,"" which the opposition Kuomintang, in power at the time, has described as a tacit agreement with the Chinese Communist Party that there is only one China, with each side free to interpret what that means.
The consensus was used as a formula to facilitate talks and closer ties between Taiwan and China when the KMT was in power from 2008 to 2016, but Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has never accepted it because it implies that Taiwan is a part of China.
According to Lai, Taiwan ""absolutely cannot accept the 'One China' principle of the '1992 consensus'"" because that would ""be equivalent to transferring Taiwan's sovereignty"" to China.
""The future of the Republic of China, Taiwan, should be decided by the 23 million [Taiwanese people],"" Lai told Chang, adding that this was the ""consensus in Taiwanese society.""
On national defense spending, Lai said it would be ""difficult"" to reach the target of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from the current ""more than 2.5 percent"" level.
Strengthening Taiwan's national defensive capabilities is based on ""developing asymmetric warfare capabilities"" and doing R&D at home while purchasing arms from abroad, the president emphasized.
Lai also said he would continue his presidential predecessor Tsai Ing-wen's (è¡è±æ) policy of modernizing training and making the armed forces ""more confident"" while continuing Taiwan's submarine-building program.
The first domestically built submarine was unveiled in September 2023, though it has yet to undergo its final harbor acceptance tests, and the next is scheduled for 2027.
In terms of resiliency against economic coercion from China, Lai noted that the proportion of Taiwan's overseas investment directed at China had fallen from 83.8 percent in 2010 to 11.4 percent in 2023.
This investment has instead been redirected to Japan, the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia, Lai said.
Lai also noted Taiwan's cooperation with various ""democratic camp"" alliances, such as the Quadrilateral Security Alliance (QUAD), AUKUS, and the Five Eyes Alliance that he said are ""increasingly standing together.""

JK4KLF4X6B_8U3WGML9QM65VAY,"US prioritizes deterrence over denuclearization on North Korea, experts say",_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2024/dprk-240902-voa01.htm,"By Young Gyo Kim September 02, 2024
As North Korea's nuclear and missile programs become increasingly sophisticated, U.S.-based experts see the United States shifting the focus of its diplomacy from the pursuit of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to one of deterrence.
Officially, the U.S. State Department insists that denuclearization remains the primary goal of the United States and South Korea, a policy that is unlikely to change regardless of the outcome of the November U.S. presidential election.
But in a series of email interviews with VOA Korean, more than half a dozen experts said they saw scant hope that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could be persuaded to give up his growing nuclear arsenal and that the U.S. must concentrate instead on seeing that it is never used.
""I think, in practical terms, most Americans believe we have little choice at this point but to prioritize deterrence, at least for the foreseeable future,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution in Washington, in an email to VOA Korean this week.
Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that American politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are questioning whether North Korea would even consider abandoning its nuclear weapons.
""I think there is little appetite in either political party to seek denuclearization with North Korea, given the failures of the late 2010s,"" Peters said, referring to the collapse of the nuclear talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who met three times in 2018 and 2019.
""I think all sides recognize that Kim will not give up nuclear weapons at any price.""
Shifting priorities
Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program between Washington and Pyongyang have been nearly nonexistent since October 2019.
Peters added, ""Bottom line â without question, the ground has shifted regarding how we think about the North Korean nuclear threat.""
Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said Washington's shift in direction was inevitable.
""The U.S. government has been forced to place more emphasis on deterrence over denuclearization because Kim Jong Un has shown no willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal or even meet with the U.S. to discuss denuclearization,"" Samore told VOA Korean via email.
""Instead, North Korea has continued to advance its nuclear and missile program, and the U.S. has responded by strengthening military cooperation with the ROK and Japan, including joint efforts to enhance extended deterrence.""
ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea.
Denuclearization of North Korea is now viewed in Washington as a ""mission impossible,"" said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.
""I think it is fair to say that the U.S. government is now more focused on deterrence, which is largely succeeding, than on denuclearization,"" Bennett told VOA Korean via email.
""This change does not mean that the U.S. and ROK have abandoned trying to negotiate for denuclearization, which North Korea steadfastly refuses to do, but rather that our governments no longer see denuclearization as a viable solution to the North Korean nuclear weapon threat.""
Markus Garlauskas, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told VOA Korean via email it was ""fully appropriate"" that Washington has been paying more attention in recent years to deterring North Korean aggression than attempting to negotiate denuclearization.
""I have long argued that Kim Jong Un does not intend to give up his nuclear weapons, that the nuclear weapons and missile capabilities of North Korea have grown and will continue to grow, meaning that we in the United States and its allies must adjust our strategy and policy accordingly,"" he said.
""We should not let hopes of negotiations get in the way of making tough decisions to improve deterrence,"" added Garlauskas, who served as the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea from 2014 to 2020.
He stressed, however, that ""accepting the reality that North Korea is nuclear-armed and will remain so while under Kim Jong Un's leadership"" does not mean that the U.S. should or would give up denuclearization as a goal.
""Our principled stand can and should remain that North Korea must comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions by halting its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and relinquishing its nuclear weapons, and I do think there is still broad agreement on that in Washington,"" Garlauskas said.
Commitment to denuclearization
Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said the U.S. should keep denuclearization as a priority, adding that ""denuclearization and deterrence are not mutually exclusive.""
""We have a responsibility on a day-by-day basis to deter provocative actions, coercion, blackmail and even possible invasion by North Korea and have been doing so for the last 70 years of armistice,"" said Seiler, who is now a senior adviser on Korean affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""Successfully ensuring deterrence does not mean abandoning the goal of the denuclearization of North Korea,"" he told VOA Korean via email.
Robert Abrams, a retired U.S. Army four-star general who served as commander of U.S. Forces Korea from 2018 to 2021, emphasized that a strategy of deterrence should be clearly differentiated from the goal of denuclearization.
""The U.S. strategic deterrent was never about stopping the North Korean regime from developing their own nukes,"" Abrams told VOA Korean in an August 20 email.
""Sanctions and diplomatic efforts were intended to stop North Korea's nuclear program. The strategic deterrent is to deter North Korea from ever using nuclear weapons, and that has obviously been very successful.""
Officially, Washington reiterates that denuclearization of North Korea remains a goal of the U.S.-South Korea alliance.
""The United States and the ROK continue to pursue the shared objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" a State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean via email this week. ""We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.""
But the spokesperson stressed that deterrence was also a crucial element of U.S. policy toward North Korea.
""At the same time, the United States and the ROK will continue working together to strengthen extended deterrence in the face of increasingly aggressive DPRK rhetoric about its nuclear weapons program,"" the spokesperson said.
He added that the 16-month-old Washington Declaration ""reinforces the fact that any nuclear attack by [North Korea] against [South Korea] will be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response from the United States.""
In April 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol adopted the Washington Declaration, which outlines a series of measures to deter North Korea's nuclear weapons use."

Tehran, IRNA -- The Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has fired a volley of missiles and rockets into northern Israeli occupied territories.
Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that its fighters had bombarded the command center of the Sahel Battalion at the Beit Hillel barracks and the Israeli artillery sites in Dishon with barrages of Katyusha rockets.
Israeli military radio reported that approximately five rockets were fired towards the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Shmona, located in the northern part of the occupied territories.
The Israeli army urged residents of Kiryat Shmona to seek shelter.
Additionally, Israel's Channel 12 reported that rocket fire from Lebanon resulted in fires breaking out in three different locations in the occupied Galilee region.
Channel 12 also said that two Israelis were injured near the settlement of Dishon due to the rocket attacks.
The Israeli military later announced that around 65 projectiles were fired from Lebanon.
Air raid sirens were activated in northern regions following the attacks.

K1ZNAZM7D1_8WU4MO51SIX9DUX,UK suspends around 30 arms export licences to Israel for use in Gaza over International Humanitarian Law concerns,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/israel/2024/09/israel-240902-ukfcdo01.htm,"The government has taken the decision that the UK will suspend arms export licences to Israel for use in military operations in Gaza, following a review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law.
2 September 2024
The government has taken the decision that the UK will suspend arms   export licences to Israel for use in military operations in Gaza,   following a review of Israel's compliance with international   humanitarian law.
The UK's robust export licensing criteria states that the government   will not issue export licences if the items might be used to commit or   facilitate serious violations of International Humanitarian Law.
The suspension will not change the UK's steadfast support for Israel's security, and the decision will be kept under review.
On day one in office, the Foreign Secretary commissioned a thorough   review into Israel's compliance with International Humanitarian Law, and   has travelled to Israel twice since being appointed to the role to   understand the situation on the ground.
These assessments have led to serious concerns about aspects of   Israel's compliance, and the government has concluded there is a clear   risk that items exported to Israel under these 30 licences might be used   in serious violations of IHL and is therefore suspending certain   exports immediately from today.
It comes after repeated calls by UK ministers for Israel to do more   to ensure lifesaving food and medical supplies reach civilians in Gaza,   and for improved treatment and access to detainees.
Foreign Secretary David Lammy said:
Facing a conflict such as this, it is this government's legal duty to review export licences.
It is with regret that I inform the House today, the assessment I   have received finds that for certain UK arms exports to Israel there   exists a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a   serious violation of International Humanitarian Law.
Therefore today we are announcing the suspension of around 30   export licences to Israel as required under the Export Controls   frameworks.
The UK continues to support Israel's right to self-defence in accordance with international law.
Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:
Our world renowned defence industry operates under one of the most   robust export licence regimes in the world, and we have a duty to uphold   both our domestic and international legal obligations.
That is why after assessing the latest available   advice, I have taken the difficult decision to suspend certain arms   licences for exports from the UK to Israel. By suspending these   licences, I am fulfilling our commitment to avoiding the risk that UK   exports could be used in IHL violations in the Gaza conflict. There will   remain however an important commitment to maintaining the F-35   programme which is integral to international security.
The suspension will apply to around 30 items used in the current   conflict in Gaza which go to the IDF, from a total of 350 licences to   Israel. The list of suspended items includes important components which   go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and   drones as well as items which facilitate ground targeting, that would be   used in Gaza.
There are a number of export licences which we have assessed are not   for military use in the current conflict in Gaza and therefore do not   require suspension.
These include items that are not being used by the IDF in the current   conflict (such as trainer aircraft or other naval equipment), and   other, non-military items.  Export licences cover a range of products   including things such as food-testing chemicals, telecoms and data   equipment.
UK components for the multi-national F-35 joint strike fighter   programme will be excluded from this decision, except where going   directly to Israel.
Any suspension of those pooled parts is not possible without having a   significant effect on the global F35 fleet with serious implications   for international peace and security.
Today the Foreign Secretary has also announced sanctions against 3   individuals within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force and   an IRGC unit for threatening the stability of the Middle East.
These targets seek to destabilise the region by sponsoring and   providing weapons to Iranian proxy groups and partners across the region   such as Lebanese-Hizbollah."

September 3, 2024  13:00  Ulaanbaatar
Prime Minister of Mongolia Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene (retranslated):I would like to express our deep gratitude to you, Mr President Vladimir Putin, for coming here to our country on an official visit. You are also taking part in celebrations marking the 85th anniversary of the joint victory in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol.
Three parties gained the majority of seats after theninth election to the State Great Khural, and they created a coalition government that I was appointed to lead as Prime Minister. After being appointed Prime Minister, I visited the two areas we would like to develop.
Our Mongolian and Soviet fighters defended the sovereignty and independence of our two nations, securing a victory and a historic date for our countries. I believe it is important for current and future generations to have proper understanding of the historical significance of this event.
Also, in connection with the 85th anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, the list for the government's activities for the next four years was supplemented by such large-scale projects as building a tourist cluster at Buir Lake in the area of the Khalkhin Gol river. For that cluster, we want to, first of all, build a 70-km road connecting the Khalkhin Gol with this lake, and also a new small aircraft airport. This cluster would serve to cover the historic event so that tourists can come and learn about our history.
I believe that we could establish this cluster to mark the 90th anniversary of our joint victory at Khalkhin Gol and it would be significant to honour the memories of our ancestors that way.
We have been informed that talks with the President of Mongolia went well and were fruitful. The two sides have already achieved tangible results and signed several important cooperation documents, including on establishing a joint working group which would enable our experts and researchers to work on building a hydropower plant on the Egiin Gol river. There were also documents dealing with proposals and efforts to carry out a project to upgrade and expand TPP-3. In addition to this, there are intergovernmental agreements to ensure stable supplies of oil products from Russia to Mongolia.
We got to see our old friends - Mr Sechin is here. We would like to thank him for his fruitful work. There is also the Russian Chair of the Russia-Mongolia Intergovernmental Commission [Alexander Kozlov], who has been very proactive and effective in his efforts. We are glad to welcome all of them and extend our gratitude for this fruitful work and its results.
Once again, I would like to say that the intergovernmental commission has been very effective and responsive, especially after Mr Kozlov was appointed Russian co-chair. We were able to gain substantial momentum and pick up a higher pace, reaching a whole new level in terms of coordinating our plans and working with our Russian partners. We would like to thank Mr Kozlov for his efforts.
When I attended the Eastern Economic Forum, Mr Mishustin and I discussed ways of further improving the way our intergovernmental commission operates. Russia appointed its new co-chair for the commission right after this conversation. He has recently visited our country and met with the new cabinet. Moreover, he compiled a plan of measures and projects, which we discussed with our new chair of the Mongolia-Russia Intergovernmental Commission. This way, they can monitor every project and every effort, and stages of their implementation.
Recently, we have faced shortage of oil products here in Mongolia, including petrol. In addition, we had to restrict power supply, although we did not waste much time and were able to overcome these challenges quite quickly thanks to the efforts by our ministers in charge of the intergovernmental commission's work. I would like to emphasise this one more time.
We know that during your today's talks with our President you have already done a great deal and achieved tangible results, so I will not elaborate further to save time. First, I would like to learn about your perspective, and after that I will voice my observations and proposals on three matters.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister,
In fact, you and I had a meeting on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok back in 2022. Even at that time we stressed that the relations between our countries rest on an extremely solid foundation.
Today, Russia views Mongolia as a priority country in terms of expanding our relations. We have been proactive in our political contacts, as well as in terms of our scientific, cultural, and educational exchanges. Our foreign ministries and security agencies have been working together and keeping in touch with one another.
As for our trade and economic ties, we do appreciate the fact that the Government of Mongolia and you personally have been pushing for consistent efforts to further strengthen our relations.
You can directly contact the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation [Mikhail Mishustin]. I hope that all corresponding agencies on both sides will work closely together.
It is true that the President of Mongolia and I had very fruitful talks. Several agreements were signed.
Let me note that bilateral trade increased by 21 percent in the first seven months of this year. Of course, our main goal consists of diversifying our economic ties.
I welcome the way you assessed the work of the intergovernmental commission and its Russian side. We have a lot of potential for expanding our cooperation in manufacturing, agriculture, energy and transport. We will also continue promoting and facilitating interregional ties.
Thank you for your warm reception."

3 September 2024
Urgent work to accelerate the delivery of the UK's military support   for Ukraine will be discussed between the Defence Secretary and his   counterpart, Rustem Umerov, during a visit to London today.
The visit comes during a milestone moment in international support   for Ukraine, with eight countries from across the world having now   joined the UK to provide more than Â£1 billion to the International Fund   for Ukraine (IFU), in a significant show of unity from Ukraine's allies.
It comes after the Prime Minister announced the IFU's largest ever   support package at the NATO Summit in July, with a Â£300m contract to   supply 152mm artillery shells to supply Ukraine's Soviet-era guns. He   also confirmed Â£3bn of UK aid for Ukraine per year for as long as it   takes.
The Defence Secretary confirmed today the Â£300m contract has now been   signed and is expected to deliver thousands of shells before the end of   the year - providing a significant boost for Ukraine's stockpiles and   aligning with the Government's acceleration of military support   deliveries.
Denmark, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Norway all confirmed their   intent this summer to invest additional money in the Fund to purchase   more drones to help on the frontline, as well as vital air defence   capabilities to help shield Ukraine's people and key infrastructure from   relentless Russian bombardment.
UK military equipment continues to prove invaluable for Ukraine's   war effort. The ongoing defensive operation in Kursk underlines the   crucial importance of continued support. And today's milestone for the   International Fund for Ukraine shows the value of working with our   Allies to deliver that support.
Our government is stepping up Britain's support   for Ukraine to fight Putin's illegal invasion. We are speeding up   deliveries of aid, with a much-needed ammunition package announced by   the Prime Minister at NATO set to begin deliveries within months. We   will continue to step up our support to help Ukraine achieve victory.
In his first days as Defence Secretary, John Healey met President   Zelenskyy and Minister Umerov in Ukraine, where he pledged to accelerate   the delivery of the UK's military support for Ukraine.
The artillery ammunition contract, placed by Defence Equipment &   Support - the MOD's procurement arm - will deliver 120,000   newly-manufactured shells over the next 18 months, and will stimulate   industrial capacity in Europe and safeguard reliable supply chains that   will continue to provide Ukraine with vital ammunition.
It follows previous packages of support from the IFU, which have   delivered heavy-lift and reconnaissance drones, maritime drones,   minefield-clearing capabilities, combat vehicle spares and air defence   systems.
The IFU was first launched by Denmark and the UK in 2022 to provide a   more efficient way for countries to pool resources to buy equipment and   weapons to support Ukraine's most urgent capability needs. The UK has   donated Â£500m to the Fund to date.
With artillery having proved critical to Ukraine's previous   battlefield successes, this new investment will support them in further   degrading Russia's forces and preventing them from making significant   breakthroughs.
Other contributors to the IFU include Australia, Iceland, New   Zealand, and Sweden. Further deliveries from the IFU's other contracts   will continue through the coming months."

By Taejun Kang for RFA 2024.09.02 -- Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said the island can take advantage of its semiconductor industry not only to promote the development of the economy but also as a key reason for the world to protect the island.
Commenting on a rumor circulating in the U.S. that Taiwan's semiconductor industry could be the very reason for China to decide to attack Taiwan, Lai said he would try his best to protect the island's security.
""Since TSMC's operating system is very complex, not any group of people could just take it and continue to operate it,"" he said during a televised interview on Sunday.
TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company.
In the first quarter of 2024, TSMC recorded a market share of 61.7% in the global semiconductor foundry market, while its closest competitor, South Korea's Samsung, occupied 11%.
Since controlling semiconductor production and distribution can reshape global economics and trade as well as establish a new technological order, Taiwan's semiconductor industry has become crucial in the strategic competition between the U.S. and China.
Lai said the purpose of any Chinese invasion of Taiwan would not be about acquiring more territory, but rather about the desire to change the ""rules-based world order"" in order to achieve hegemony.
Counting on the international community's support for Taiwan, the Taiwanese President said the Taiwan Strait issue was ""not only a Taiwan-China issue, but also an Indo-Pacific issue, and even a world issue"".
This echoes remarks made last month when Lai urged the world's democratic countries to come together and act to prevent China from expanding authoritarianism.
""China has even weaponized trade. Using various pressures and threats, it's politically manipulating not just Taiwan, but also Japan, Korea, Australia, Lithuania, Canada, and other countries,"" said Lai last month.
China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that should be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. The democratic island has been self-governing since it effectively separated from mainland China in 1949 after the Chinese civil war.
Regarding a rumor about his visit to the U.S., Lai said during the Sunday interview that he had no plans to do so, stressing that there were already ""very good"" channels of communication between Taiwan and the U.S.

K3VE9WDGHE_23SLA31PISV18P8,Think tank warns of accident risks caused by increasing Philippine air provocations,Global Times,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-globaltimes02.htm,"Global Times

A think tank warned of the risks of uncertainties and accidents more serious than ship collisions amid increasing Philippine air provocations on Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea. Experts emphasized that the withdrawal of Philippine forces and an end to provocations are the only way to resolve the situation.
Beijing-based think tank the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) analyzed the situation on Monday.
On August 28, the Philippines sent an H-145 helicopter and conducted airdropping of supplies to the Philippine Coast Guard ship MRRV-9701, which has been illegally anchored in the lagoon of China's Xianbin Jiao. The Chinese side monitored the entire situation, according to the China Coast Guard.
Counting more cases, the SCSPI said that the Philippines' incursions reflected Manila's running out of methods in maritime infringement given China's enhanced measures at sea.
Aerial encounters, especially confrontational ones, face much higher risks and uncertainties compared with maritime encounters. If the Philippines continues its aerial intrusions, China will be compelled to take corresponding measures, and in the event of an aerial collision, the consequences would be far more severe than those of a ship collision, the think tank warned.
From a technical point of view, the Philippine aircraft, fixed-wing planes or helicopters, have limited carrying capacities compared with ships, nor are they equipped with advanced avionics and sensors, so they cannot effectively carry out so-called supply or patrol missions, said a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity.
They are just political shows aimed at throwing mud at China, the expert said.
Xue Chen, a research fellow at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said that China is fully capable of intercepting the Philippines' airdropping should it decides to do so."

Palestinian factions have praised the resistance fighters for their recent retaliatory shooting operation in the southern occupied West Bank city of al-Khalil, describing it as a ""natural response"" to the massacres and acts of genocide committed by the Israeli regime against Palestinians.
The factions made the remarks in separate statements released on Sunday after three Israeli police officers were killed in a drive-by shooting at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, west of al-Khalil, earlier in the day.
The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas asserted that Palestinians will continue ""their path of jihad and resistance"" against Israel until their complete liberation from the regime's occupation and aggression, stressing that Israel's crimes against Palestinians will only make the resistance grow stronger.
The Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) echoed Hamas's statement, saying that the latest operation at the Tarqumiya checkpoint affirms the resistance's ""strength, significant effectiveness, innovative resilience, and legendary steadfastness.""
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) also noted that the operation ""proves the enemy's helplessness in the face of the resistance and redefines equations of deterrence in the West Bank.""
It added that this operation sends a strong message to Israel ""that the train of resistance operations is moving relentlessly, and no one can stop it.""
Fatah al-Intifada, another Palestinian resistance movement, said the operation demonstrates ""the determination of our resistance and its ability to strike the enemy with full force and precision.""
It also stressed that this operation ""sends a message of defiance that there will be no security or stability"" for the occupying regime as long as it continues its crimes against Palestinians.
On Sunday, Palestinian resistance fighters targeted a vehicle near the Tarqumiya checkpoint, leaving two Israeli police officers dead and another seriously injured who later succumbed to his wounds.
An Israeli security source said several gunmen opened fire toward a car on Route 35, and that the occupation forces are in pursuit of the shooters.
The Palestinians who carried out the operation managed to flee the scene despite significant Israeli security and military presence in the area.
The operation comes amid heightened tensions in the West Bank caused by an ongoing Israeli aggression in the occupied territory.
On Wednesday, the Israeli army launched its largest military offensive since 2002 in the cities of Tulkarm and Jenin, as well as in the al-Far'a refugee camp near Tubas, killing 22 Palestinians, according to Palestinian figures.
Since Israel unleashed a war on the besieged Gaza Strip in early October 2023, casualties have been rising in the West Bank as a result of intensified near-daily Israeli raids into villages and cities in the occupied territories.
According to Palestinian health officials, at least 675 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war on Gaza."

On the morning of September 2, 2024, President Xi Jinping met at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing with Malian President Colonel Assimi GoÃ¯ta, who is in China for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). The two heads of state announced the elevation of the China-Mali relationship to a strategic partnership.
Xi Jinping pointed out that the China-Mali friendship was personally forged by the elder generation of leaders of the two countries. Sixty years ago, the two sides issued a joint communique, which for the first time included China's eight principles in foreign aid, advocating respect for national sovereignty, development of an independent economy and non-interference in internal affairs. These principles not only serve as a guide for the long-term friendly cooperation between China and Mali, but also set the tone for China-Africa cooperation in promoting the establishment of a new international order. Under the current circumstances, China is ready to carry forward traditional friendship with Mali, continue to firmly support each other, and provide support within its capacity for Mali's economic development and improvement of people's livelihood. China will continue to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Mali, and deepen cooperation in agriculture, energy, mineral development, infrastructure construction and other fields. China hopes that Mali will provide security guarantees and policy facilitation for Chinese companies.
Xi Jinping stressed that China has always supported the African people in independently deciding their future and destiny, and is ready to work with Mali and other African countries to support each other and jointly pursue modernization paths suited to their respective national conditions. This FOCAC summit is dedicated to drawing a new blueprint for China-Africa cooperation in the new era, advancing modernization together, and building a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future. China is ready to work with Mali and other parties to make the summit a complete success.
Colonel Assimi GoÃ¯ta thanked China for hosting this FOCAC summit and for the warm and friendly reception. The people of Mali and China enjoy a brotherly friendship and bilateral cooperation is sincere and pragmatic. He thanked China for providing various and valuable assistance to Mali's economic and social development. Mali hopes to further consolidate the friendship with China, elevate the strategic partnership, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in agriculture, energy, mining, security and other areas. There is but one China in the world, and Mali firmly pursues the one-China principle. Both Mali and China respect national sovereignty and independence and oppose interference in other countries' internal affairs. Mali appreciates China's efforts and contributions to promoting regional and world peace and development and looks forward to closer multilateral cooperation with China.
Wang Yi was present at the meeting."

The   United States takes action to defend and protect U.S. election   institutions and processes from Moscow's attempts to influence the 2024   Presidential Election
WASHINGTON -- Today, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated10   individuals and two entities as part of a coordinated U.S. government   response to Moscow's malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S.   presidential election. Russian state-sponsored actors have long used a   variety of tools, such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) deep   fakes and disinformation, in an attempt to undermine confidence in the   United States' election processes and institutions. Beginning in   early 2024, executives at RTâRussia's state-funded news media   outletâbegan an even more nefarious effort to covertly recruit unwitting   American influencers in support of their malign influence campaign. RT   used a front company to disguise its own involvement or the involvement   of the Russian government in content meant to influence U.S. audiences.
""Today's   action underscores the U.S. government's ongoing efforts to hold   state-sponsored actors accountable for activities that aim to   deteriorate public trust in our institutions,"" said Secretary of the   Treasury Janet L. Yellen. ""Treasury will not waver in our commitment to   safeguarding our democratic principles and the integrity of our election   systems.""
Today's designations complement law enforcement actions   taken by the Department of Justice and the Department of State's   designation of the Rossiya Segodnya media group and five of its   subsidiaries, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik, as   Foreign Missions, steps to impose visa restrictions, and release of a   Rewards for Justice (RFJ) reward offer of up to $10 million relating to   information pertaining to foreign interference in a U.S. election.
The   Kremlin employs an array of tools, including covert foreign malign   influence campaigns and illicit cyber activities, to undermine the   national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and   its allies and partners globally. Russia routinely uses its intelligence   services, government-directed proxies, and covert influence tools in   these efforts. The Kremlin has increasingly adapted its efforts to hide   its involvement by developing a vast ecosystem of Russian proxy   websites, fake online personas, and front organizations that give the   false appearance of being independent news sources unconnected to the   Russian state.
Today's designations follow prior OFAC actions   that have highlighted and disrupted Russia's global malign influence   campaigns, including Kremlin-directed malign influence efforts, interference in U.S. elections, efforts to subvert democracy in Moldova, destabilization activities in Ukraine, and the operation of outlets controlled by Russian intelligence services, among others.
RT, formerly Russia Today,   is a Russian state-funded news outlet that began broadcasting   internationally in 2005. In 2017, RT registered as an agent of a foreign   government in the United States. Beginning in early 2024, RT executives   began an effort to covertly recruit unwitting American influencers. RT   used a front company to disguise its own involvement or the involvement   of the Russian government.
Margarita Simonovna Simonyan (Simonyan) is the Editor-in-Chief of RT and a central figure in Russian   government malign influence efforts. She allowed the operations of a   front company to occur under the cover of RT. Elizaveta Yuryevna Brodskaia (Brodskaia) is the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of RT, who has reported to Russian President Putin and other government officials. Anton Sergeyvich Anisimov (Anisimov) is an RT Deputy Editor-in-Chief, who conducts activities on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Andrey Vladimirovich Kiyashko (Kiyashko) is the Deputy Director of the RT English-Language   Information Broadcasting and is responsible for updating Russian   government officials and providing an overview of RT's operations. Konstantin Kalashnikov (Kalashnikov) is RT's Digital Media Projects Manager, who, in   early 2022, worked with Kiyashko. In midâ2023, Brodskaia and Kiyashko   implemented a large-scale influence operation for RT on U.S. social   media with the intent of obscuring RT's connection to the content meant   to influence online audiences. Elena Mikhaylovna Afanasyeva (Afanasyeva)   is an employee of RT's Digital Media Projects Department and reports to   Kalashnikov. Starting in early 2024, Afanasyeva covertly interacted   with prominent U.S. social media influencers under the cover of a fake   persona, purporting to be an employee at a U.S. company to obscure RT's   and the Russian government's involvement.
The pro-Kremlin hacktivist group RaHDit is composed of active and former Russian intelligence officers. Aleksey Alekseyevich Garashchenko (Garashchenko) is the head of RaHDit and was an FSB officer at the time   he started leading the group. Garashchenko directly interacts with   members of the Russian intelligence and security services, members of   the Russian Presidential Administration, and employees from RT. Anastasia Igorevna Yermoshkina (Yermoshkina) is an affiliate of Garashchenko. Aleksandr Vitalyevich Nezhentsev (Nezhentsev) works with Garashchenko and is an administrator and   developer of cyber tools used by the FSB. Nezhentsev also leads a team   focusing on developing new tools that can be used in the surveillance of   information data files.
Today, OFAC designated Simonyan,   Brodskaia, Anisimov, Kiyashko, Kalashnikov, Afanasyeva, Garashchenko,   Yermoshkina, and Nezhentsev pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or   controlled, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of,   directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.
Autonomous Non-Profit Organization (ANO) Dialog (ANO Dialog) is a Russian nonprofit organization founded in 2019 by the   Moscow city government that leverages AI technology in online Russian   disinformation for use against election campaigns. ANO Dialog Regions (Dialog Regions) is ANO Dialog's subsidiary organization that is   co-located at their Moscow headquarters and also has offices throughout   Russia.
Vladimir Grigoryevich Tabak (Tabak) is   the Director General of both ANO Dialog and Dialog Regions. He   previously held several positions in the Russian Presidential   Administration.
ANO Dialog is linked to DoppelgÃ¤ngerâa   Russia-linked influence operation network identified in 2022âthat used   deep fake content to develop Russian disinformation campaigns. In   fall 2022, Tabak was expected to attend a meeting with senior Russian   government officials. The meeting discussed the presumed success of the   DoppelgÃ¤nger activity and provided feedback and guidance on future   projects.
In July 2022, ANO Dialog and Tabak provided services to   the Russian government, working on a project for the creation of fake   online posts on popular social media accounts, including ""Reliable   Recent News"" (""RRN"") and ""War on Fakes""âa Russian disinformation website   publicly linked to the DoppelgÃ¤nger activityâthat would be composed of   counterfeit documents, among other material, in order to elicit an   emotional response from the audiences of these accounts. An ANO Dialog   advisor purchased RRN's new domain, ""rrn.world"" in order to avoid using   the former domain, ""rrussianews.com,"" which would have maintained a   connection to Russia. Tabak also coordinated with ANO Dialog and the   Russian government on the payment of services for an RRN-affiliate   translator.
In late fall 2023, ANO Dialog personnel identified   U.S., UK, and other public figures as potential targets for deepfake   projects. Because of this, the EU sanctioned ANO Dialog for its role in   the disinformation network and specifically as the owner and operator of   the ""War on Fakes"" website. In May 2024, Tabak and several Dialog   Regions officials coordinated with Russian government officials   regarding the creation of bot accounts on popular social media messaging   platforms for use in a misinformation campaign regarding voting   locations in the U.S. 2024 election.
Today, OFAC designated ANO   Dialog pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or   having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or   indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation; Dialog Regions   pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted   or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, ANO   Dialog; and Tabak pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled   by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or   indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation and for being a   leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of   directors of ANO Dialog and Dialog Regions, persons whose property and   interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.
Also   today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the seizure of   domains associated with RRN/ANO Dialog and Social Design Agency   (SDA)âwhich OFAC had previously designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for   its activities on behalf of the Russian governmentâthat have been used   in furtherance of the Russian DoppelgÃ¤nger disinformation efforts   targeting the United States and Europe.
As   a result of today's action, all property and interests in property of   the designated persons described above that are in the United States or   in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be   reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or   indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one   or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general   or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC's regulations   generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or   transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in   property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.
In addition,   financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain   transactions or activities with the sanctioned persons may expose   themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The   prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of   funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated   person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,   or services from any such person.
The power and integrity of   OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC's ability to designate and add   persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons   from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of   sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in   behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal   from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer toOFAC's Frequently Asked Question 897 here.

FOCAC to have great significance to world grappling with challenges: expert
By Yang Sheng and Shen Sheng Published: Sep 01, 2024 11:41 PM
Several national leaders of African countries have arrived in Beijing to attend the upcoming 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) which will be held in Beijing from Wednesday to Friday, as analysts from both China and Africa said the event will inject much needed new impetus into global economic recovery and set an example for South-South cooperation.
According to the Xinhua News Agency, from Saturday night to Sunday, leaders including Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, South Sudanese President Salva Kiir, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, President of the Comoros Azali Assoumani, and Mali's transitional president Assimi Goita, have already arrived in Beijing to attend FOCAC. Experts said the 2024 Summit of the FOCAC will be a major diplomatic event that will not only gather Chinese and African leaders and representatives of relevant regional and international organizations, it will also bring together business executives, scholars and youths from both China and the continent to boost high quality cooperation among the Global South, and these will have great significance to the world that is experiencing profound change and turbulence.
At a briefing for Chinese and foreign media on the 2024 Summit of the FOCAC on August 23, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong said that ""The leaders of China and Africa will discuss major cooperation strategies, explore cooperation plans together and strengthen exchanges on state governance, which will provide important guidance for the development of the Forum in the next stage.""
Chen said the Summit will introduce a series of new cooperation initiatives to deepen mutual understanding, respect and affinity between the peoples of China and Africa, so that the China-Africa friendship will be passed on from generation to generation and the flower of China-Africa friendship will blossom with renewed brilliance. According to public information, African members of the FOCAC include 53 African countries that have established diplomatic relations with China, and the Commission of the African Union.
He Wenping, a director with the Institute of West Asian and African Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the FOCAC summit this year will elevate China-Africa cooperation to new heights. ""It's likely we will see China and African countries boosting cooperation in new areas like the digital economy and green development based on existing infrastructure.""
Li Haidong, a professor from the China Foreign Affairs University, said that ""the world is still experiencing profound change and turbulence, with numerous uncertainties, and there are serious challenges confronting globalization and global economic recovery. China and African countries are developing countries that share common interests and the stance that multi-polarization of the world should be boosted, and to jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind."" Therefore, the upcoming FOCAC summit will surely send an encouraging message to not only China and Africa, but also the Global South and the rest of the world, as this is a successful example for cooperation within Global South with global significance, Li noted.
All-round cooperation
The President of the Central Africa Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera had already kicked off his trip in China with visits to Chongqing and Shandong Province from August 28 to Sunday to learn about China's achievements in areas such as urbanization, new energy, cultural industries, agriculture and the digital economy.
Experts said this shows that African leaders are taking their attendance at FOCAC as an opportunity to explore China in different ways. In addition to diplomacy, they are also very interested in learning about China's development and modernization from a broader and more comprehensive perspective, said the experts.
Endalkachew Sime, ex-State Minister of Ministry of Planning and Development of Ethiopia and founder and deputy CEO of the Africa-China Trade and Investment Facilitation Center, said that the FOCAC summit is crucial for two main reasons: First, they capture the focus and attention of the nations involved. Each leader attends these meetings with their own notes.
""Second, these events help create a better image of the cooperation at the grassroots level in each country. With high-level media coverage and significant signatories, these platforms send a strong message to citizens [of different countries], encouraging them to take the partnership seriously,"" Sime said.
Munetsi Madakufamba, executive director of the Zimbabwe-based Southern African Research and Documentation Center, said that ""The development approach and cooperation between China and Africa are a win-win partnership, emphasizing the importance of understanding each other's context, circumstances, and development priorities. If you look at the development experience of Africa and in terms of cooperation with the West, it has been a kind of relationship of one side exploiting the other, which is unbalanced development.""
Chinese analysts said that China has always seen Africa as a vibrant continent of hope, and treats African countries as equal partners.
They said now it is time for Africa to embark on their journey of modernization. Since other major economies, especially Western ones, have failed to play very constructive roles to support Africa, China-Africa cooperation that is marked by high-level mutual trust and traditional friendship will become more all-round and profound."

Manila aims to internationalize issue to mislead public: expert
By Zhang Han and Yu Xi Published: Sep 02, 2024 11:48 PM Updated: Sep 03, 2024 12:26 AM
While continuing to back Manila's provocative actions in the South China Sea, some allies of the US have been intensifying moves to smear China, Chinese observers said on Monday, when commenting on recent noises on the South China Sea issue from external parties.
The latest irresponsible remarks came from the European External Action Service (EEAS) spokesperson, which condemned China's ""dangerous actions,"" in a statement issued on Sunday.
The fact was that the Philippine Coast Guard ship MRRV-9701, which has been illegally stationed at China's Xianbin Jiao, on Saturday lifted its anchor and conducted continuous maneuvers, stirring up troubles in the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao. China Coast Guard (CCG) Vessel 5205 took measures including verbal warnings, monitoring and control in accordance with the law and regulations.
In the process, the Philippine MRRV-9701 deliberately rammed into CCG Vessel 5205 in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision for which the Philippines bears full responsibility.
China strongly deplored the EU's accusations over the collision, a spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the EU said on Monday.
Soon after the collision, the US on Saturday backed the Philippines' stance and claimed China's actions to safeguard its own interests were ""escalatory."" US allies including Australia followed suit in making a biased statement. Japan has also made a high-profile response targeting China over a previous China-Philippines collision incident at Xianbin Jiao in August.
The Philippines aims to internationalize the issue by leveraging alliance to mislead the public. By engaging with these non-involved parties, including making some off-table trade-offs, the Philippines seeks to ""enhance its bargaining power and maritime presence,"" said Chen Xiangmiao, director of the World Navy Research Center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies.
The US is the real ""mastermind"" behind the tension in the South China Sea, instructing Manila to stir up trouble but avoiding a scenario that goes out of control, and it is also the US that has mobilized its close allies to back the Philippines, Chen said.
The quick responses from the US and its allies after the Saturday incident fully demonstrated their close coordination in this disinformation campaign against China, and their ultimate goal of destabilizing the South China Sea and pushing the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy, analysts said."

Question: Will you comment on reports about Ukraine's ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on the condition that the Court's jurisdiction over war crimes committed by its nationals is limited for a period of seven years? What, in Moscow's opinion, could explain this reservation?
Maria Zakharova: Everyone is all too familiar with the reputation both the Kiev regime and the ICC have. Neither is independent, and neither can be associated with law or justice. It is a case when two negatives don't make an affirmative but raise lawlessness to the square.
The reservation made by Ukraine upon the ratification of the Rome Statute clearly shows the Kiev authorities' real attitude to international humanitarian law and justice.  In effect, they want to protect their citizens from the jurisdiction of that court, which is extremely loyal to them, while keeping the ability to initiate criminal proceedings in The Hague against citizens of other countries on the charges Kiev itself falsifies. This move cannot be regarded as anything other than an undisguised intention to give their military a free hand to commit grave war crimes.
All their attempts to evade responsibility are doomed. The Ukrainian criminals who are guilty of committing grave international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be called to account and get the punishment they deserve."

Taipei, Sept. 1 (CNA) Taiwan has signed a cooperation agreement with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) Secretariat to continue its ongoing support of the organization from 2025 to 2027, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced on Sunday.
The pact was signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang (ç°ä¸­å) and a representative from the PIF Secretariat during the annual Taiwan/Republic of China-Forum Countries Dialogue held in Tonga on Aug. 30, MOFA said in a press release.
MOFA did not provide other details on the three-year pact, including how much financial support is involved, saying only that the deal ""serves as a concrete demonstration of Taiwan's commitment and support toward the development of the Pacific region.""
The Aug. 30 meeting was the 29th edition of the Taiwan/Republic of China-Forum Countries Dialogue organized by the PIF Secretariat.
President Hilda Heine of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and PIF Secretariat Deputy Secretary General - Governance, Desna Solofa, co-hosted the Aug. 30 meeting, which was also attended by representatives from Palau and Tuvalu, two diplomatic allies of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the Pacific, MOFA said.
Tien is currently leading a delegation to visit Tonga to attend the Aug. 30 meeting, which is being held alongside the annual PIF summit which ran from Aug. 26 to 30.
The 18-member PIF, an inter-governmental organization, held its 53rd summit this year in Tonga. Despite being a nonmember, Taiwan has been an active participant at the annual event as a ""development partner"" since 1993.
Nonmembers including China, the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union also participate in the annual forum and other PIF events as ""dialogue partners.""
Over the years Taiwan has supported projects across the Pacific, including in agriculture, education, medical care, public health, ICT, women's empowerment, clean energy, and basic infrastructure, improving the well-being of people in the region, MOFA said.
During this year's summit, the Solomon Islands, a former Taiwan ally that ditched Taipei in favor of Beijing in 2019, proposed preventing Taiwan from attending future FIP events, allegedly under the instructions of China, according to MOFA.
The proposal was later rejected thanks to the support of Taiwan's three allies in the PIF, namely, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau, and two non-allies, Australia and New Zealand, MOFA said.
However, a PIF communique released at the conclusion of the summit that initially mentioned support for Taiwan was later withdrawn and republished with the country's name no longer mentioned, due to pressure from China.
MOFA said that the removal of the line supporting Taiwan in the communique will not affect Taiwan's status in the PIF or its right of future participation.

Earlier today, Russian missiles struck a military training facility and a hospital in Ukraineâkilling more than 50 people and injuring dozens more. I condemn this deplorable attack in the strongest possible terms.
This assault is a tragic reminder of Putin's ongoing and outrageous attempts to break the will of a free people. But for two and a half years, the people of Ukraine have stood unbowed. And the United States will continue stand with themâincluding providing the air defense systems and capabilities they need to protect their country.
Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war. The people of Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United States stands with them.

He also familiarised himself with an interactive presentation of results of the Russian Far East's development and took part, via video link, in the opening of new plants launched by residents of priority development territories.
September 4, 2024  15:15  Primorye Territory, Russky Island
The Ozyorny mining and refining facility, a modern plant specialising in mining and processing ores based on the polymetallic, mostly lead and zinc, deposit of Ozyornoye in the Republic of Buryatia, has been put into operation. It can produce up to 6 million tonnes of ore per year, including up to 600,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate per year and 82,000 tonnes of lead concentrate per year. Up to 1,300 new jobs will be created when it reaches its full production capacity. The plant will produce about 4.5 percent of world zinc concentrate output. The project has been implemented by the Ozyornoye Company. Ozyornoye Company General Director Vladislav Sviblov narrated about the company.
The Port of Sukhodol, a maritime complex specialising in receiving, storing and loading coal to sea ships in the southern Primorye Territory, has reached full production capacity. Following the introduction of additional capacities, its freight turnover will amount to 12 million tonnes of coal per year and prospectively to 20 million tonnes. Among other things, the project has been implemented to ease access to port infrastructure for small and medium-sized coal producers. The port is equipped with two shiploaders, each capable of handling 3,500 tonnes of coal per hour. Four stacker-reclaimers have a capacity of 3,500 tones per hour each.
The infrastructure includes a coal storage facility for 915,000 cubic metres, a cargo handling rail terminal (14 tracks), and a railway station (20 tracks). The explanations were provided by General Director of Seaport of Sukhodol Sergei Kropotov.
The first stage of the Primorye plastic pipe plant has been launched. It produces 20 to 1,200 mm single- and multi-wall polyethylene pipes for water- and gas-supply systems. Its manufactures are noted for their long service life (over 100 years) and will be in demand in the context of gas distribution programmes and housing and utilities upgrade projects.
The first stage includes four high-technology lines for a total of 18,000 tonnes of products per year. After the second stage becomes effective in 2026, this figure will rise to 35,000 tonnes per year. The plant has been built by Polyplastic Group, a resident of the Primorye priority development territory. Explanations were given by Chairman of the Board of Directors Lev Gorilovsky.

Deputy Prime Minister - Plenipotentiary Presidential Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yury Trutnev: Mr President,
First, I would like to report that we have created an integrated governance framework for promoting development on a macroregional level in Russia's Far East as part of the objectives you have set forth. In includes 81 laws and almost 500 government acts for ensuring that investors feel safe here and can generate profits in the Far East. Of course, there is an ongoing effort to further improve this framework. This year we have been drafting a law creating an international priority development territory. In 2023, we adopted a law governing deliveries of essential goods to the northern territories - people there really needed it.
What have we achieved with this solution? This macro region has been above the national average in terms of its main development indicators for a third year in row. These indicators include fixed capital investment, construction volumes, housing construction, corporate revenue and minerals extraction.
Over the past 10 years, the macro region attracted 4.2 trillion rubles in private investment, including 800 billion since the previous Eastern Economic Forum in 2023, and also launched 152 enterprises and created 18,000 jobs.
The international environment has changed, creating new challenges, as well as new development opportunities for Russia's Far East.
Developing the Eastern Operating Domain within our national railway system has primary importance in terms of developing the Far East and national development in general. On the one hand, this requires a lot of work and substantial funding. On the other hand, the 3.7 trillion rubles we need for upgrading the Eastern Operating Domain will also contribute to developing the Far East.
Having more businesses and new investment project means that the region needs more electricity. Even today, the power grids in Primorye and Trans-Baikal territories, Buryatia, and the Jewish Autonomous Area undermine investment. Mr President, the Energy Minister will present proposals during today's meeting resulting from your instructions to the federal Government.
At the same time, we need to do more to ensure that investment keeps growing. For that, we believe that we need to carry out a sectoral review in order to examine all the key sectors which contribute the most to developing the Far East in order to identify their potential and what needs to be done to attract more investment.
We must support the effort to establish two metallurgy clusters in the Khabarovsk Territory. In keeping with your instructions, we will carry out master plans, build shipyards, and expand deposit extraction sites by carrying out additional mineral surveys in the Far East.
In agriculture, land reclamation efforts will enable us to use more land.
Mr President, last year I reported on our plans to reach 10.5 trillion in investment by 2030. Today, I would like to tell you that we believe that we need to go beyond this point. This is why I am asking you to set this objective at 12 trillion. We will deliver.
Vladimir Putin: I can just as well set it at 15 trillion or higher, but we must proceed from what these projects actually represent and the support measures the Government can offer.
Yury Trutnev: Of course, Mr President.
Vladimir Putin: Do you think this 12-trillion goal to be realistic?
Yury Trutnev: We can do it.
Vladimir Putin: Great."

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.
On 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the ""Donbass republics"" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.

Japan and Australia will hold a ""two-plus-two"" security meeting in Australia on Thursday, aiming to strengthen defense and security cooperation, which Chinese analysts warn would be disruptive and detrimental to the regional stability and exert significant impact to push the Asia-Pacific region into security dilemmas or traps.
Japanese media outlet Jiji Press News reported on Friday that Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Defense Minister Minoru Kihara, and Australia by Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles.
Jiji noted that Tokyo and Canberra are expected to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening collaboration, citing China's behavior in the region.
According to analysts, the promotion of Japan-Australia cooperation came as the US launched the so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy and stepped up its pressure to push forward the coordination among allies and partners in an attempt to contain China and undermine its peaceful development.
Since the Australia-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), a treaty that provides a framework for each country's forces to operate in the other's, came into force in August 2023, how to further deepen and cooperate with each other based on the agreement could be a matter for discussion during the upcoming security meeting, said Chen Hong, executive director of Asia Pacific Studies Centre at East China Normal University.
With Japan also hyping up the Taiwan question and the Diaoyu Islands issue and stirring up trouble over the South China Sea issue, it is believed that Australia may conduct some cooperative actions under the guidance of US' anti-China strategy, according to Chen.
""It cannot be ruled out that Japan and Australia may propose joint military exercises, or even rope in a third party, such as the Philippines, to join,"" Chen said.
Also, considering that Japan might one day in some capacity join the AUKUS, an Australia-UK-US security partnership, related discussions are expected to be covered during the Japan-Australia security meeting, as they want to form a circle of deterrence around China, Chen noted.
The expert warned that as the Asia-Pacific is the engine of the world economy, undermining peace and stability in the region is actually a threat to world peace, security and development, which is also a serious concern for the international community."
LU895HD2RZ_XK91X7ZN310IXL7,"'Renaissance of illegals': Since start of war in Ukraine, Russia relies more on bargain-basement spies",_,_,20240901,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2024/intell-240831-voa01.htm,"By Graham Keeley August 31, 2024
They are known as ""illegals"" â spies who operate under the guise of normal jobs.
Since Russia lost many of its valuable spy assets when dozens of diplomats were expelled from Western countries after the invasion of Ukraine, these civilian agents have become essential.
Experts in Russian intelligence told VOA that this was the ""renaissance of illegals,"" with 90% of operations now carried out by these shadowy figures.
The August 1 hostage swap, in which American journalists and Russian rights activists were exchanged for an assassin and spies, exposed how some of these ""illegals"" operate.
Many manage to avoid detection by working in innocuous jobs that allow them access to events and people of interest to Moscow. The prisoner swap included supposed art dealers and a freelance journalist.
President Vladimir Putin welcomed back Russian couple Artem and Anna Dultsev, who posed as Argentinians and ran a tech start-up and gallery in Slovenia, and Spanish-Russian freelance reporter Pablo Gonzalez, also known as Pavel Rubtsov.
On the surface, Gonzalez worked as a reporter for media outlets that included DW and VOA, specializing in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. But in reality, according to the head of the British MI6 secret service, he was gathering information on Russian opposition groups and trying to destabilize Ukraine in the run up to Moscow's full-scale invasion.
Polish authorities detained Gonzalez in February 2022. Until August 1, he was held in a high-security jail on charges of spying for Russia â allegations he had denied.
Media watchdogs condemned the conditions in which Poland held Gonzalez, but footage of him being welcomed by Putin after the swap appeared to confirm his primary role was spy craft, not journalism.
Gonzalez himself gave VOA a cryptic answer to a request for an interview. Referring to an earlier VOA article about his release, Gonzalez said through his Spanish wife, Oihana Goiriena, ""If there are no more speculations, then I don't know what you want to talk about.""
Russian roots
Speaking perfect Russian and Spanish, Gonzalez forged a career in journalism after studying Slavic studies at the University of Barcelona. But despite his new life in the West, he retained much sympathy for his country of birth.
A source with knowledge of the Russian intelligence sector who did not want to be named told VOA that Gonzalez grew up in Spain's Basque country, where sympathies for a regional independence movement are common â and, in left-wing circles, support for Putin is not unusual.
This meant many who met him did not question his pro-Russian leanings; far fewer suspected he secretly worked for Russian intelligence.
""This is a renaissance for illegals,"" Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an expert in subversive Russian and Soviet special services, told VOA from Kyiv.
""Historically, it was so difficult to travel abroad. [These spies] can travel, they can live, they can join governments, businesses,"" said Danylyuk, who is an associate fellow of the London-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think-tank.
""Some people are still not convinced that illegals are important, but it is 90% of all the [Russian intelligence] activity.""
Danylyuk said part of their value is that millions of Russians â and foreign-national Kremlin sympathizers â can travel freely without suspicion.
""They can travel to Silicon Valley and steal secrets, and they can recruit Westerners. Why would you need to use diplomats?"" he said. ""For some specific tasks, yes, but in fact for other operations you would use illegals, and you would have spymasters.""
Danylyuk said one purpose of illegals is to exert influence on the Western world by infiltrating radical protest groups or opposition organizations.
In 2016, Gonzalez engaged with leaders of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom â named after the Russian opposition politician assassinated in 2015 â where he became close with key members of the group.
Nemtsov's daughter and co-founder of the foundation, Zhanna Nemtsova, said she was a target of Gonzalez's espionage.
""I was the first to tell Agentstvo about Pablo Gonzalez/Pavel Rubtsov in May 2023 after I had access to the case materials,"" she wrote on the social media X platform on August 27. Agentstvo is an independent Russian media outlet.
Gonzalez collected detailed reports on his contacts with Nemtsova and the foundation, Agentstvo said.
Spy operations
Marc Marginedas, a correspondent for Spanish newspaper El Periodico, said despite the expulsions of Russian diplomats after the Ukraine invasion, the Russian intelligence service is like a small army.
""Tens of thousands of people work for the different branches of the intelligence services in Russia. Some sources elevate this to hundreds of thousands if it includes those working not on a regular basis,"" said Marginedas, who specializes in the former Soviet states and Middle East.
Staff in Russian embassies and state-run media organizations, he added, are probably forced to work in some kind of intelligence capacity.
Marginedas agreed that ""illegals"" are now a mainstay of Moscow's spying operation.
""Russia has invested heavily in 'illegal' agents who do not enjoy diplomatic protection,"" he said.
""They provide them with a personal alibi that is very difficult to track down. Latin American countries, with not very tight controls and regulations when providing citizenship to foreigners, are very useful for this purpose.""
Marginedas said that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine resulted in large numbers of suspected Russian spies being expelled from embassies around the world. So, when Putin appeared at the airport in Moscow to welcome the agents in the prisoner swap in August, it sent a specific message.
""Following the war in Ukraine and the mass expulsions of Russian diplomats from Western countries, its capacities were seriously undermined,"" Marginedas said.
""Putin, by receiving those people with pomp at [Moscow's] airport and promising them jobs and medals, was sending out the message to the future spies that the Russian state will not abandon its spies.""
A journalist who knew Gonzalez said his real identity came as a shock.
Xavier Colas, who works for the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, has known Gonzalez since 2014 when they met in Ukraine.
""He was not a person who pretended to be a journalist. He really was one. He did reports and traveled and knew what he was talking about,"" Colas said. ""He styled himself as an expert in Ukraine and other [post-Soviet] republics. He knew his stuff.""
Colas, whom Russia expelled earlier this year, also said Gonzalez espoused ""pro-Russian"" arguments that attacked Ukraine and the European Union, and claimed Alexey Navalny, the late opposition leader imprisoned by Russia, was being treated well by the Russian government.
Navalny died in a penal colony in the Arctic in February.
""Gonzalez's opinions were very pro-Russian. But he was not some stupid young radical journalist. He knew what he was talking about, but his arguments did not make sense,"" Colas remembers.
He said that Gonzalez worked for mostly regional newspapers such as the pro-separatist Basque Gara newspaper, but he never seemed short of funds to travel to all parts of Ukraine and Syria.
Gonzalez worked for Spanish outlets Publico, La Sexta and Gara. He also worked as a freelancer for Voice of America in 2020 and 2021 and the public broadcasters Deutsche Welle and EFE.
VOA hired Gonzalez via a third-party freelance media platform. After learning of his arrest in Poland, the broadcaster removed his content.
Deutsche Welle did not reply to a request for comment. But Miguel Angel Oliver, president of EFE, told VOA: ""We have not made any comment. Gonzalez worked for EFE over two years ago. It was a brief collaboration principally about photographs at the start of the Ukraine war.""
Colas said he thought Gonzalez came from ""a wealthy Basque country family."" It was a shock, he said, when Gonzalez emerged from a plane with a Russian hitman and other spies.
""I knew for a while that the Spanish secret services believed he was a spy. But this was still a shock for me,"" he said.
Intelligence services
Three different intelligence services had no doubt about where Gonzalez's real loyalties lay â even if his colleagues and many peers were in the dark.
Spanish secret services, who spoke on background to a VOA reporter, said they believed he was a Russian spy. And Polish security services said Gonzalez was included in the prisoner swap because of ""common security issues"" with the United States.
In a statement, they said: ""Pavel Rubtsov, a GRU officer arrested in Poland in 2022, [had been] carrying out intelligence tasks in Europe.""
Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence service MI6, said at the Aspen Security Forum in 2022 that Gonzalez was an ""illegal"" arrested in Poland after ""masquerading as a Spanish journalist.""
""He was going into Ukraine to be part of their destabilizing efforts there,"" Moore said.
Gonzalez has always denied spying for Russia.
His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, noted the case of Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter Russia detained on false espionage charges who was freed in the prisoner swap and welcomed by U.S. President Joe Biden.
""Nobody in the USA has questioned that Gershkovich was simply a journalist. We think that neither Gershkovich nor Pablo Gonzalez are spies, but journalists are trapped in a new kind of cold war, where truth matters little,"" he told VOA.
Boye also acted as a lawyer for Edward Snowden and Carles Puigdemont, a fugitive former Catalan independence leader wanted in Spain on charges of embezzlement and misuse of public funds. (Boye himself has faced legal action, convicted in a 1996 trial involving Basque separatists.)
Gonzalez is now living in Russia, but his wife, Goiriena, still lives with the couple's three children in Spain's Basque country. She told VOA that she remains in touch with her husband daily by social media or telephone.
""So far there is no news of him coming back from Russia,"" she said. ""I think he has to recover from everything he has been through.""
While living in Warsaw in the run-up to Russia's invasion, Gonzalez had a girlfriend named in local media as Magdalena Chodownik. She is under investigation by Polish authorities for allegedly assisting espionage but denies any wrongdoing.
Chodownik, who has worked for several European outlets, declined to comment to VOA when asked about Gonzalez.
Spain's Foreign Ministry did not reply when asked by VOA if Gonzalez will be allowed to return to Spain to see his family while Poland has accused him of spying."

We will not   allow the rights of our Cypriot Turkish brothers and sisters to be   violated. We will resolutely put into action whatever TÃ¼rkiye's   interests necessitate in the Aegean, the Black Sea and the Eastern   Mediterranean without seeking anyone's approval or without heeding who   says what.""
President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan delivered remarks during the Naval War   College Commencement and Flag Handover Ceremony in Istanbul.
""TURKISH NAVY WILL CLIMB TO A VERY DISTINCTIVE LEAGUE""
Drawing attention to the steps taken uninterruptedly to reinforce the   Turkish Armed Forces, apple of the eye of the Turkish nation, President   ErdoÄan noted that the new-type submarine project has been coming to   fruition gradually, and said: ""We plan to commission our HÄ±zÄ±r Reis   submarine in 2025 and Murat Reis submarine in 2026. We will complete the   remaining three submarines by 2029. We will thus have added to the   ranks of our Naval Forces six modern submarines that have more advanced   qualities than their equivalents.""
Stressing that TÃ¼rkiye will be among the few countries in the world   in the area of submarines with the MILDEN project, President ErdoÄan   stated: ""We continue our contacts regarding our aircraft carrier that is   set to be the big brother of our navy's flagship, Anadolu. The Turkish   Navy will climb to a very distinctive league with the inclusion of our   aircraft carrier following our UCAV carrier.""
Noting that TÃ¼rkiye has been doing whatever is necessary to be an   effective naval power that has a high level of deterrence and   operational capability, President ErdoÄan added that much bigger   successes will be achieved by using the distance covered over the past   22 years as a stepping stone.
""WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE RIGHTS OF OUR CYPRIOT TURKISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO BE VIOLATED""
Stating that TÃ¼rkiye cannot reach its targeted destination if it   turns its face only to the west, President ErdoÄan pointed out that   TÃ¼rkiye can become a powerful, prosperous, prestigious and effective   country only if it strengthens its relations with the west and the east   concurrently. ""Any way other than this would not benefit but harm   TÃ¼rkiye, pushing it off the equation,"" said President ErdoÄan.   ""Therefore, we are under no obligation to make a choice between the   European Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as some claim.   Quite the contrary, we have to improve our relations both with these   and with other organizations on a win-win basis. We have always acted   with this understanding over the past 22 years.""
""While developing our relations with different geographies, we have   shaped our policies by caring about 'what our nation says' rather than   'what others say.' This is how we will continue on our path in the   future as well,"" said President ErdoÄan. ""We will protect our rights in   the Blue Homeland, trivialized by some, till the end. We will not allow   the rights of our Cypriot Turkish brothers and sisters to be violated.

At least three Israeli policemen have been killed in a retaliatory shooting operation near the southern West Bank city of al-Khalil.
The attack took place close to the checkpoint in Tarqumiyah city on Sunday morning.
Two officers were killed at the scene and the third succumbed to injuries later at the hospital.
An Israeli security source said several gunmen opened fire toward a car on Route 35, and that the occupation forces are in pursuit of the shooters.
According to Israeli media, the gunmen opened fire from a passing vehicle at the police car, before fleeing the scene on foot.
The shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the West Bank caused by an ongoing Israeli aggression in the occupied territory.
In the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli army conducted its biggest operation - dubbed ""Camps of Summer"" - in the West Bank in over 20 years, deploying hundreds of troops and airstrikes on Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the usurping entity.
So far, at least 22 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli raids and strikes in several West Bank towns, and many more sustained injuries."

The Iranian Army chief commander has congratulated the advent of the National Air Defense, saying the occasion is a reminder of the force's capability to record achievements based on self-reliance.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi made the remarks in a message issued on Sunday to commemorate the National Air Defense Day, which is celebrated annually on August 30.
This day ""is a reminder of the proud history of dozens of air defense operations during the imposed war [in the 1980s] and thousands of days and nights of guarding against, discovering, identifying, monitoring and countering aerial threats, along with protecting critical sites and ... the country' sky,"" he said.
""It is a day of hope in the capability of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force in the path of ... self-reliance.""
He added that the increased interaction of Iran's Air Defense Force with knowledge-based and academic companies, as well as the Defense Ministry, has resulted in the success of the Islamic Republic establishment in delivering responses to its enemies.
'Iran among 6 countries with highest range of surface-to-air missiles'
On Saturday, Commander of the Air Defense Forces in Northwestern Iran Brigadier General Abbas Azimi said the country ranks among the world's top six regarding the range of its surface-to-air missiles.
Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, all air defense equipment was imported from abroad, but he noted that they are produced by Iranian scientists and specialists today.
The range of Air Defense radars has also increased from 45 kilometers to more than 300 kilometers over the past 45 years.
Azimi further said, ""Iran is among the world's six countries in terms of the range of surface-to-air missiles, and this important and proud achievement was recorded after the Revolution and the Sacred Defense,"" referring to the eight-year war imposed by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
Iran's Air Defense kept surveillance on only 30 percent of the country's sky, but today the figure is 100 percent, he emphasized.
Iranian military experts and engineers have in recent years made remarkable breakthroughs in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment, making the armed forces self-sufficient.
Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the country will not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities which are entirely meant for defense, and that Iran's defense capabilities will be never subject to negotiations."

MANILA -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front's (MILF) decommissioning and the Moro National Liberation Front's (MNLF) profiling are key to peaceful elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim (BARMM) in 2025, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU) said Saturday.
Dennis Legaspi, director of OPAPRU International Private Partnership Office, said during the Saturday News Forum in Quezon City that the decommissioning of MILF combatants is a ""big help"" to ensure that next year's parliamentary elections would be orderly.
Darwin Wally Wee, director of OPAPRU's Communications and Public Affairs Service, also expressed optimism about the ""peaceful, orderly, and credible"" BARMM elections, given the success of the socio-economic profiling of the MNLF combatants, as part of the government's Transformation Program.
To date, about 26,132 MILF combatants have been decommissioned in three phases since 2019.
The fourth and final phase of the decommissioning process targets an estimated 14,000 combatants.
On the other hand, the government has already completed the socio-economic profiling for about 1,963 MNLF combatants, Wee said.
""So, there shall be a peaceful, orderly, and credible first BARMM elections in 2025. The first election in BARMM is very symbolic,"" he said.
Legaspi said other countries have also signified their intent to help the Philippine government educate BARMM voters as they participate in the first parliamentary elections in the region.
Peace celebration
Meanwhile, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. will lead the celebration of National Peace Consciousness Month and the commemoration of the 28th anniversary of the 1996 Final Peace Agreement with the MNLF at MalacaÃ±an Palace in Manila on Monday, Wee said.
""What we expect on Monday is the Moro leaders will express their support on the President's Bangsamoro peace agenda,"" he said.
""What we want here is not just for the Peace Month but for the entire year, we need to celebrate the peace. Peace, we often take for granted. Kapag pumunta po tayo sa mga grounds (When you go to the grounds) - Samar areas, Bangsamoro areas - peace is very fragile and we need to protect the peace process at all cost. Peace can be overturned in an overnight way, so we need to protect the peace process.""
Under Proclamation 675 issued in 2004, National Peace Consciousness Month is celebrated every September to instill consciousness and understanding of the importance of peace in the country.
The signing of the Final Peace Agreement with the MNLF on Sept. 2, 1996, ended the Moro fighters' hostilities in the southern Philippines since 1972. (PNA)"
MCGQZVNXPL_G4V02BIQKRIVE0R,How secure is Hun Manet's year-old premiership in Cambodia?,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240901-rfa01.htm,"Taking control of key power centers will be far more of a challenge than simply being handed the PM job.
A commentary by David Hutt 2024.09.01 -- On Aug. 22, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet marked his first anniversary in office by personally receiving dozens of Khmer artifacts returned to Cambodia by the United States. The ceremony at his Peace Palace was dripping with symbolism.
""Why did these Khmer statues leave Cambodia? Because we were divided,"" he declared. ""However, now, their return symbolizes our reunion. On the first anniversary of [his government], we have maintained stability, peace, and prosperity for the people. Today, we celebrate as a unified nation, free from war and division.""
However, just a week earlier, the Cambodian Interior Ministry had ordered police to tighten security around Phnom Penh, instructing provincial leaders to do the same, citing a group allegedly plotting a Bangladesh-inspired ""color revolution.""
There is unease in the country over tensions with neighboring Vietnam over the Funan Techo Canal, the Hun dynasty's legacy project, which could threaten Vietnam's rice-growing heartlands.
The public is also concerned about the implications of the Development Triangle Area, an old agreement involving Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam that has become a new point of contention in anti-Cambodian People's Party circles.
Despite the government's efforts to frame this as a purely economic zone, old prejudices persist, with some Cambodians viewing Hun Manet's government as unpatriotic, much like they did his father's.
Hun Sen, who ruled from 1985 until he handed power to his son last year, was often accused of being a puppet of Vietnam and later China, accused of selling off Cambodian land to the highest foreign bidder.
On the surface, despite concerns about the recent Bangladesh revolt, Hun Manet and his family appear secure. They control almost every significant political and social institution, and the economy continues to provide jobs and food for the people.
Hun Sen meticulously planned last year's transition, implementing a ""generational succession"" in which key political and civil service families passed power down to their sons or relatives.
Shrewd transition strategy
This strategy was shrewd, as many authoritarian governments have succumbed to fratricide during leadership transitions. By allowing the political families that matter to keep their patronage and corruption networks, no one lost wealth or influence, thus ensuring stability during the changeover.
The Hun family remains first among equals, the ruling house within Cambodia's political aristocracy. They control nearly every important institution except two: the navy, run by the Tea family, and the national police, overseen by the Sar family.
Hun Sen secured the presidency of the Cambodian Senate earlier this year, making him the acting head of state - a position that grants him the institutional power to intervene if his son's government faces a crisis.
To further consolidate power, he enacted constitutional amendments last year to weaken the National Assembly and appointed a loyalist, Khuon Sudary, as its president. Additionally, he installed a family ally as army chief, succeeding Hun Manet, while another son, Hun Manith, heads military intelligence and now serves as deputy army chief.
Another son, Hun Many, who leads the country's largest youth movement, was appointed minister of the Civil Service last year, ensuring the Hun family's control over the bureaucracy. Hun Sen intends to remain CPP president for life, with Hun Manet running the party's youth wing.
Hun Sen has also  brought the rowdy but powerful business tycoons into line through the Cambodia Oknha Association he formed last year and presides over.
The monarchy, while independent, lacks political interest, with King Norodom Sihamoni staying out of politics and the Queen Mother, the power behind the throne, now 88 years old. Moreover, Hun Sen, Hun Manet, and their allies dominate the Royal Council of the Throne, the body responsible for selecting the next king.
In this feudal-like political system, the Hun family has appeased other influential families by allowing them to keep their patronage networks while consolidating its power across almost every key institution.
Ordinary Cambodians' concerns
No family from this First Estate can rival the Huns. They also enjoy the support of the economic barons, the oknhas, and other business elites who finance the political aristocracy.
That leaves the Third Estate, the ordinary Cambodians. Hun Sen needed to rig last year's general electionsâand the two priorâto secure his son's ascent to power.
Repression has persisted under Hun Manet's rule. The opposition has been neutralized, and civil society has been either silenced or co-opted. Hun Manet's government has successfully distributed patronage to the middle classes, whose loyalty might have shifted toward a political alternative, if one was ever to exist again.
The government continues to deliver basic needs.
While the recent revolution in Bangladesh alarmed the Hun family, Cambodia does not face similar conditions. The country's garment industry, which many expected to collapse during the COVID-19 pandemic, has instead rebounded and is once again driving economic growth.
Cambodia's tourism industry has also recovered in terms of visitor numbers, though revenue remains about two-thirds of pre-2020 levels. There has been progress in the tech and service sectors, though the construction industry and related sectors, like brickmaking, have declined.
Typically, young women worked in garment factories while young men found jobs on construction sites, so the loss of construction jobs could have posed a threat to the government. However, many young men have returned to agriculture, which is thriving, especially with increased exports to China.
Economic challenges
However, there is a potential vulnerability.
The CPP framed last year's succession as a handover from the ""first generation"" of party leaders, such as Hun Sen, Tea Banh, and Sar Kheng, who ""saved"" Cambodia from the Khmer Rouge and brought peace and prosperity to a war-torn country.
The ""second generation,"" led by Hun Manet, is supposed to build on these achievements - a generation of technocrats, not warriors or visionaries. Their legitimacy stems from being the chosen successors of their heroic parents and from the economic progress they are expected to deliver.
Many Cambodians are skeptical of the first claim, recognizing that Hun Manet and his peers hold power due to patronage rather than merit. This means they will be judged entirely on their economic performance.
In fact, the current government has distanced itself from certain state matters. Hun Sen, as Senate president, has taken on a shadow foreign policy role, handling controversial issues and leaving the actual foreign ministry to focus solely on trade and investment.
Hun Manet's power will only be secure as long as his father remains.
While his family wields considerable institutional power, from the military to the civil service and business elites, most of these institutions ultimately answer to Hun Sen, not his son.
Taking control of these power centers will be far more of a challenge in the coming years than simply being handed the prime ministership. For now, Hun Manet's legitimacy rests solely on the economy, which ought to concentrate his attention.
However, holding power in Cambodia's political system requires more than just delivering jobs and food to the populace.

MJQG7IK2LS_M0LAC01K60CBBVQ,10 anti-government protesters go on trial for treason in Nigeria,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240902-voa04.htm,"By Timothy Obiezu September 02, 2024
Trial began Monday in Nigeria for 10 people charged with treason in connection with anti-government protests that erupted last month over the high cost of living. The defendants could face the death penalty if convicted.
The defendants are also charged with conspiring to incite the military to mutiny. They pleaded not guilty, and a bail hearing was set for September 11.
In early August, thousands of protesters took to Nigeria's streets to denounce President Bola Tinubu's policies and government.
Tinubu scrapped expensive fuel subsidy payments last year upon assuming office and soon afterward floated the national currency, the naira.
Authorities accused protesters of inciting public unrest and burning government buildings but pledged to address the economic hardship.
The case has drawn the ire of human rights group Amnesty International. Isa Sanusi, the country director for Amnesty in Nigeria, said, ""What they're doing is just a deliberate effort to psychologically and physically break down these people, who are resilient people and came out to express their anger over the way the nation is being run as a result of corruption and mismanagement. So the trial is a sham; it does not meet all the international standards of fair trial.""
Amnesty also called the trial a mockery of Nigeria's rule of law. The group said the government was attempting to stifle dissent, and it called for the protesters to be released and charges withdrawn immediately.
The 10 defendants are among hundreds of protesters who were arrested during last month's demonstrations, which came amid Nigeria's worst economic crisis in a generation.
In the nationwide protests, tagged ""Ten Days of Rage,"" demonstrators demanded better governance and a reversal of government reforms, including the scrapping of the fuel subsidy.
During the demonstrations, protesters in northern Nigeria hoisted Russian flags as they marched and chanted for President Vladimir Putin to come to their aid.
The protests were met with a fierce crackdown by security forces. Amnesty International said 13 people were killed, and Amnesty's Sanusi said Nigerian authorities should focus on investigating these killings.
Sanusi also said Nigerian authorities have been denying the detained protesters access to family and legal representation.
""These people have not been allowed to have access to adequate legal representation or assistance,"" he said. ""Treason carries the death penalty, according to the Nigerian laws. ... So that is the tactic they use - they use this ambiguity, suspense of being taken to court just to break down the spirit of these protesters, and we condemn this misuse of the Nigerian judicial system to suppress people.""
The government has not responded to Amnesty International's statement. But in the past, the government has often said it works in the interest of national security.
The legal counsel for the protesters, Deji Adeyanju, said a team of lawyers has been working to secure their release.
""The charge against the protesters is completely unacceptable because it's an attempt to criminalize freedom of assembly,"" Adeyanju said. ""The criminalization will be resisted.""
On Monday, Nigerian police also declared British national Andrew Wynne wanted for allegedly plotting to topple the Nigerian government. The Associated Press said the British high commissioner had not responded to a request for comment.
Police also said nine suspects have been arrested in connection with allegedly receiving monies from foreign sources to destabilize the country."

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement on September 3 expressing concerns over recently introduced changes to Kazakhstan's domestic-media accreditation regulations and proposed changes to foreign-media accreditation, saying they could be used to muzzle independent media.
""New and proposed amendments to Kazakhstan's accreditation regulations are excessive and open too many doors to censorship. Instead of the greater openness promised by President [Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev's] 'New Kazakhstan,' what journalists are really getting is ever more creeping state control,"" CPJ Europe and Central Asia program coordinator Gulnoza Said said.
""Kazakh authorities should heed journalists' legitimate complaints and revise the media accreditation rules.""
The changes regulating domestic media in the Central Asian country that came into force last month allow a journalist's accreditation to be withdrawn for six months if they twice fail to comply with rules at news events, which could potentially include asking off-topic questions.
Also last month, the Kazakh government proposed regulations for foreign media outlets that allow the Foreign Ministry to deny or revoke accreditation for any violation of Kazakh law, including minor ""administrative"" offenses.
A media law that came into force in June already bans foreign media from unaccredited journalistic activity.
Domestic and international rights groups and media experts have expressed concerns over that law, saying it will compromise independent journalism and lead to self-censorship in the tightly controlled former Soviet republic.
Another provision in the law that Toqaev signed on June 20 says that all Internet resources are to be considered media outlets.
Among other things, the law introduces a three-year period to file lawsuits over materials published in the media.
In 2024, Kazakhstan slipped from 134th place to 142nd in the press index of Reporters Without Borders, which monitors media freedom around the world.

MLFHHKNS8I_1DKL4FXA0Y1YJLS,UN officials repeat calls for peace as Gaza polio vaccinations gets underway,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240901-unnews01.htm,"1 September 2024 - The first phase of a UN-led polio vaccination campaign has begun in the middle areas of Gaza. The operation aims to inoculate 600,000 children in the coming days.
Hundreds of Gazan families have been queueing to await the turn of their child to receive a polio vaccination since early Sunday morning, in a campaign designed to stop the resurgence of a virus whose re-emergence has been blamed on insanitary conditions.
Speaking to international media on Sunday, Sam Rose, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, said that over 200 teams are administering the vaccine in 25 locations in the middle areas of Gaza.
A race against time
In order to stop the polio outbreak in Gaza, and to prevent an international spread of the virus, health workers will need to vaccinate at least 90 percent of children during each round.
Reacting to the launch on social media, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA described the campaign as ""a race against time"".
The campaign will be delivered in stages, over three days each, covering three different areas of Gaza. Vaccination coverage will be monitored and analyzed every day, and vaccination drives will be extended by one day if necessary.
The operation - organized by UNRWA, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Palestinian Ministry of Health -will continue in the coming days, if the temporary pause in fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces holds.
Security concerns
The UN bodies involved in the campaign and senior officials have underlined the importance of maintaining security for health workers and the Gazan population.
""For this to work, parties to the conflict must respect the temporary area pauses,"" wrote Mr. Lazzarini on social media. ""For the sake of children across the region a lasting ceasefire is overdue"". In another post, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of WHO, wrote that ""ultimately, the best vaccine for these children is peace.""
UN chief reacts to hostage deaths
On the same day that the campaign launch was confirmed, news broke of the death of six of the hostages taken by Hamas in the October 7 2023 attacks on Israel.
The UN Secretary-General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, reacted to the news by recollecting his meeting with the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the hostages reported dead on Sunday. The reports, he wrote in a social media post, are ""a devastating reminder of the need for the unconditional release of all hostages and an end to the nightmare of war in Gaza."""
MMDSZ2J41P_K0A3X25OPNGCO60,Taliban: Suicide bomb blast in Kabul kills 6 Afghan civilians,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240902-voa02.htm,"By Ayaz Gul September 02, 2024
Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reported Monday that a suicide bomb blast in Kabul killed at least six people, including a woman, and wounded 13 others.
Police confirmed the deadly attack in the Afghan capital, saying it occurred in the city's southwestern Qala Bakhtiar area when a suicide bomber detonated explosives strapped to his body.
Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that the victims were civilians and that investigations into the attack were ongoing. He shared no further details.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but the Afghan offshoot of the Islamic State, IS-Khorasan, is the primary suspect. The terrorist outfit has taken credit for almost all recent attacks in Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan.
Taliban officials say their sustained counterterrorism operations have ""almost decimated"" IS-Khorasan, and it has no ""physical presence"" in the country. The United States and regional countries dispute these claims.
""We know that we can't turn a blind eye to the threats from organizations such as ISIS-K and that we must keep a relentless focus on counterterrorism,"" Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters in Washington last week while reiterating U.S. worries about the growing threat of terrorism in Afghanistan. He used an acronym for IS-Khorasan."

Via Teleconference
12:25 P.M. EDT
MODERATOR:  Hey, everyone.  Hope everyone enjoyed the long weekend.  Kirby has a few words here at the top, and then we'll get into as many questions as we can.
MR. KIRBY:  Hey, everybody.  Thanks for joining.
First, on the Middle East.  As you all know, on Saturday, in a tunnel in Gaza, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages that were held by Hamas, including an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin.  He and five others were executed.  Hamas is responsible for their deaths.  And as the President said, Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes.
As you know, the President also had a chance to speak with Hersh's parents, Jon and Rachel, and â as did the Vice President â and they grieve with them and with all the families of everyone killed.
Yesterday, the President and Vice President had a chance to meet in the White House Situation Room with the U.S. hostage deal negotiation team to talk about next steps on our ongoing effort to secure the release of the hostages and to hold Hamas leaders fully accountable.
As for the status of those talks, over the past couple of days, we've heard a lot from Israel, we've heard some from Hamas, and we continue to consult with our co-mediators, Qatar and Egypt.
Just, again, to restate it: We're working on a proposal that will secure the release of the remaining hostages and will include massive and immediate relief for the people of Gaza, and also result in a stoppage of the fighting.
Now, I've seen some press reporting out there about ""take it or leave it"" and ""final proposal"" and ""text this"" and ""text that.""  All I'm telling you is our team is still working on trying to get this to closure, to try to conclude a deal that achieves all of those three things.
And I'm sure you're all curious as to what that proposal says and what's in it, and I'm sure you're also not going to be surprised by the fact that I'm not going to get into that detail.
What I can tell you is we are still actively working on this.  We are still in constant consultations with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.  And of course, Qatar and Egypt are in touch with Hamas.  And we're going to do what we can to get it done.
I can't tell you what the timeline looks like.  I can't tell you, if we get it done, exactly what every little â every little paragraph and context of the final proposal would look like.  All I can tell you is those are the three goals, and that's what we're still driving at, and we're still actively engaged in the effort.
The President himself is personally involved in working with our team and in working with leaders around the world to secure this deal, and that's what we're focused on.  And the killing over the weekend just underscores the sense of urgency that we have to have in order to get it to closure.
If I can switch to Venezuela.
The United States joins several of our international partners in condemning the unjustified arrest warrant of Edmundo Gonzalez in Venezuela for allegedly inciting violence â which, of course, is not accurate.
This is just another example of Mr. Maduro's efforts to maintain power by force and to refuse to recognize that Mr.  Gonzalez won the most votes on the 28th of July.
So, in coordination with those partners, we're considering a range of options to demonstrate to Mr. Maduro and his representatives that their actions in Venezuela will have consequences.
Now, I don't have anything to announce today, but as you've seen, we've already enforced and calibrated our sanctions towards Venezuela in light of overall U.S. interests and the actions and non-actions that are taken by Maduro and his representatives.
In fact, just yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of an aircraft used by Mr. Maduro and his representatives, based on sanctions and export control violations that were already in place.  This action taken by Justice was really done in the overall direction of our broader bilateral engagement with Venezuela.
And then, quickly on Ukraine.
Sadly, we have to yet again offer our deepest condolences to the people of Ukraine after another massive Russian strike, this time in a town called Poltova [sic] â I'm sorry, Poltava â which killed more than 40 people and wounded at least 180 others.  Just another horrific reminder of the extent of Mr.  Putin's brutality towards the people of Ukraine and the manner in which he's trying to punish them for his own invasion of that country, going after critical infrastructure and trying to make it harder just for them to live and to pursue livelihoods.
As President Biden has made clear, our support for Ukraine remains unshakable, and we're going to continue to be focused on strengthening their military and their air defenses against these kinds of assaults and attacks.
As you saw just 10 days ago, we announced yet another drawdown of military assistance.  That included ammunition for HIMARS systems, counter-drone equipment, munitions, Javelin anti-tank and anti-armor systems.  And there will be more coming in coming weeks.  So we're going to continue to stand by Ukraine as they try to defend themselves against these sorts of attacks.
With that, we can take some questions.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our first question will go to Zeke with the AP.
Q    Thanks, John, for doing this.  A couple weeks ago, you had said that the U.S. was putting forward a new bridging proposal to close the remaining gaps between the two sides.  Is the proposal that's being developed this week, the President is actively engaged in, is that a new proposal or is that just a refinement of what has already been on the table now for some weeks and, really, in essence, some months?
And then, separately, do you have any specific reaction to the Israeli Prime Minister's comments yesterday, sort of drawing the line on holding the Philadelphi Corridor?
And then, can you offer a little bit more clarity on the President's comments that Netanyahu isn't doing enough to get this deal?  Is a deal possible while Netanyahu remains in power?  Thank you.
MR. KIRBY:  The answer to your third question is: Yes, of course, there's a deal possible.  And the President wouldn't be personally engaged the way he is and he wouldn't have taken the time over the weekend to meet with his team if he didn't believe that that was, in fact, an outcome that we can achieve.
I won't get into the details of the proposal that we are working on, but we continue to work on it.  And it won't come as a surprise to anybody that when you're involved in negotiations, particularly at high stakes like this, there's a lot of back-and-forth, and there's amendments offered and there's amendments rejected, and there's text that changes from time to time.  That work continues, and I'm just not going to get into the details of what it looks like or what it may look like if we're successful.  But, yes, absolutely, it's possible.
And again, I think â not that we didn't have a sense of urgency before; we certainly did â but the killings over the weekend, the executions is the only way to put it, just underscores for us how important it is to keep that work alive and keep going.
I'm not going to get into a debate with the Prime Minister of what he said over the weekend about the Philadelphi Corridor.  The deal itself, the proposal, including the bridging proposal that we started working with â you guys know this; I'm not telling you anything that isn't out there publicly â included the removal of Israeli Defense Forces from all densely populated areas, and that includes those areas along that corridor.  That's the proposal that Israel had agreed to.  And again, we're going to continue to work on this as hard as we can.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Steve Holland with Reuters.
Q    John, what's the strategy behind referring to this as a ""final proposal""?
MR. KIRBY:  I'm just â I'm not using that phrase, Steve, so I can't â I can't speak to what strategy might be in place.
Q    (Inaudible.)
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I'm not using that phrase.  And there is a â there is a proposal we're working on.  It is still being negotiated, which means that the sides are still talking about the text itself.
But we believe â as I said to Zeke, we believe that we can get there.  We believe we can close this.  And we absolutely have to do it with as much speed as possible, especially given what happened over the weekend.
Q    And we've seen a number of protests in Israel in response to the death of the hostages.  Are you hoping these protests will put pressure on Netanyahu to do more to try to get a deal?
MR. KIRBY:  Well, I'll let the Israeli people speak for themselves, Steve.  I'm not qualified nor would I get involved in domestic issues there in Israel.
I think what happened over the weekend should serve as a reminder to everyone how evil Hamas is and how deadly, how lethal the situation is for all those hostages.  And it should underscore for everybody, and I think it does â I think it does in Israel; I think it does in the region; it certainly does here, inside the administration and in the United States â how important it is to get this deal in place and to get those hostages released, get them out, get them back with their families, where they belong.
So, again, I won't speak to domestic issues in Israel, and I certainly wouldn't speak for the Israeli people.  I can only tell you that, speaking for President Biden, he's going to stay 110 percent focused on seeing if we can't get this over the finish line and to do so as soon as humanly possible.
Q    Thank you, John.
MR. KIRBY:  Yes, sir.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Selina with ABC.
Q    Hi, John.  Thanks so much for doing this.  I know you don't want to talk about the specifics of this, quote, ""final proposal,"" but senior administration officials are saying that there could be a possibility, if that fell apart, that the U.S. could walk away from leading these discussions.  Is that a feasible reality, of the U.S. walking away?  Is there any world where that could happen â you know, just considering the stakes that are at play here for the U.S., considering some of these hostages are American?
MR. KIRBY:  We want to get them all released, Selina.  We want to get them released as soon as possible.  Today would be a great day to do that.  They should never have been taken in the first place by Hamas.  And Hamas bears the responsibility for their taking and for the lives that have already been lost and for the health and welfare of those who are still alive.  We want to get them out.  We want to get them out now.
I am simply going to refuse to speculate about what might happen or what might not happen as we are involved, as you and I are speaking, in constant consultations to get this deal over the finish line.  The less I say, the better on that.  And I'm certainly not going to speculate about what might or might not happen.
I'll tell you what needs to happen.  What needs to happen is the deal to get closed.  What needs to happen is the hostages to get home.  What needs to happen is more humanitarian assistance in.  And this deal would provide an extraordinary amount of additional humanitarian assistance to the suffering people of Gaza, the people who are suffering in Gaza because Mr. Sinwar decided to break a ceasefire, a deal that was in existence on the 6th of October.  And what needs to happen is an end to the fighting.  And that's what we're focused on.
Q    So, just another follow-up.  You've said these similar remarks before about how this needs to happen, it's going to happen, we're close.  Why is this time different?  Is there a sense that there is a greater sense of urgency that this could actually be achieved?
And number two, the UK is suspending some arms exports to Israel.  What is the official White House reaction to that?  And does the White House have any plans to follow suit to increase pressure on Israel?
MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, I never said it will happen.  I've said we believe it can happen.  We believe that we're close enough, that the gaps are narrow enough that it could happen.  And that remains the case today.
And we have always had a sense of urgency about getting this deal â well, I shouldn't say ""always.""  Since it was â since the President laid it out there publicly at the end of May, we have had a high sense of urgency to get it over the finish line, and we've been working very, very diligently over these last few months to do that.  That work will continue.  It will continue with the same sense of importance and energy that we've been applying to it.
But, certainly, the work is â the importance of that work is now underscored by the brutal execution of these innocent hostages over the weekend, including an American.  Those lives were just recently taken.  And I'd be lying to you if I said that the work going on yesterday, today, tomorrow, and the days ahead are not going to be informed or shaped or colored by our own grief and sorrow and shock and outrage about what Hamas did.  I couldn't â I couldn't say that it wouldn't be.
So, there has been a sense of urgency; there will continue to be.  And, clearly, what happened over the weekend underscores how important it is to get this done as quickly as possible.
On the UK, every nation can speak for themselves on how and to what degree that they support Israel.  I'm certainly not going to comment one way or another on the decisions that our British counterparts made.
I can just tell you that, number one, we're going to continue to do we have to do to support Israel's defensive capabilities; that support continues today.  Number two, we have, as I've said many times, reviewed individual reports as best we can and talking to the Israelis about individual reports about compliance with international humanitarian law.  And as we speak, there's been no determination by the United States that they have violated international humanitarian law.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Felicia with the Financial Times.
Q    Hi, John.  Thanks.  Just to follow up on the UK decision, has there been any conversations between the White House and Number 10 or any other parts of the U.S. or American government about the decision, or any calls to read out?
MR. KIRBY:  No calls to read out since they've announced their decision.  They did give us a heads up that they were going to â that they had arrived at that decision and were going to announce it.  So, we were aware.
Q    And are you worried that any other â I guess this is maybe the first major Western ally of Israel's to take this step.  Is the U.S. worried that other countries might follow suit?
MR. KIRBY:  I'll tell you what we're worried about.  We're worried about getting a deal to get the hostages home.  We're worried about getting more humanitarian assistance in.  And we're worried about finding an end to this conflict.  We're also worried about making sure we can continue to help Israel defend itself against what is clearly, and certainly should be a reminder to everybody about what happened over the weekend, a brutal, evil terrorist organization.  That's what we're worried about.
We'll let other nations decide for themselves if they're going to support Israel and to what degree.  That's their decision.  That's what sovereignty is all about.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Karen with the Washington Post.  One second.  Our computer is malfunctioning.
Karen, you should be able to talk now.
Q    Yeah, you've said several times now that the brutal killings over the weekend underscore the importance of getting this deal done.  Prime Minister Netanyahu, in his remarks over the weekend, said sort of the opposite, that â he said: What it underscores is that whenever you show flexibility or give something to Hamas, this is what they do, and we've shown flexibility thus far and we're not anymore â basically, he said.
Can you â how do you reconcile those two positions in terms of getting the negotiations completed?
MR. KIRBY:  I'm not going to reconcile those two positions, Karen.  That's not my job.  It's not my place.  I speak for this administration and for this President, and he has been rock-solid and consistent in pushing for his team to do everything they can to get this deal in place.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Tamara Keith with NPR.
Tam, you should be able to unmute yourself.  Okay, we will try to come back to you later.
Our next question will go to Barak with Axios.
Q    Hi.  Thank you for doing this.  John, two questions.  First, if we can go back to what the President said yesterday when he said that he doesn't think Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough to get a deal.  What did he mean?  What do you need Netanyahu to do that he's not doing?  Or what is Netanyahu doing that you think is not constructive for reaching a deal?
And the second thing, to go back to what you said about the Philadelphi Corridor.  You said that the proposal includes the removal of IDF from all densely populated areas, including the Philadelphi Corridor.  So, just to understand, do you mean during the first phase of the deal?  Do you mean during the entire deal?  Because in the next phases, all IDF forces need to be removed from the Philadelphi Corridor.
MR. KIRBY:  Right.
Q    And Netanyahu said yesterday that he will not remove the IDF from the Philadelphi Corridor ever.  So he did not speak only about the first phase of the deal; he spoke about it indefinite.  So, I'm trying to understand better what exactly is the U.S. position on the issue of the Philadelphi Corridor on phase one of the deal, on phase two of the deal, and going forward.
MR. KIRBY:  Look, it's all in the proposal, Barak.  And you've read the proposal, same as me.
Q    Yeah, I know.  But, John, the proposal â the last proposal, including the map that the U.S. approved, included the deployment of the IDF along the Philadelphi Corridor.  That's what I'm saying.  And not only in densely populated areas.  And the U.S. signed off on this map.  That's why I'm asking what's the exact U.S. position regarding the Philadelphi Corridor.  Because I don't think that the map that the U.S. has agreed on is the same â reflects the same position you just said.
MR. KIRBY:  I'm not going to get into negotiating this thing in public.  You know I'm not going to do that.  The deal says that they have to remove IDF from all densely populated areas in phase one, and that includes densely populated areas around â or adjacent to the Philadelphi Corridor, or where it intersects with those densely populated areas.  That's what the proposal says.  That's the proposal that was put forth at the end of May.
I'm not going to get into amendments one way or another that have subsequently been discussed.  I'm not going to negotiate this in public one way or the other.
And as for your first question, the President has in numerous conversations with the Prime Minister, as well as our counterparts in Qatar and Egypt, stressed the importance of doing everything we can to actualize, to conclude the proposal that, again, was an Israeli proposal agreed to at the end of May.
And we â he charged his team on Saturday â I'm sorry, over the weekend he charged his team to do everything that they could to see what we can do to get this over the finish line.
I understand it would be satisfying if I were to give a list of everything everybody should do outside the United States to make that happen, but I hope you can understand I'm not going to do that.  We've got to find a way to come to closure on this thing.  We are close enough that that is possible.  We believe that it's an outcome that can be achieved.  But as I've said many times: In order to do that, it requires compromise and it requires leadership from everybody.  And I'll leave it at that.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Neria with Israel Channel 13.
Q    Hey, Kirby.  Thank you so much for doing that.  During Netanyahu's speech/press conference last night, he said he told Sinwar forget about the Philadelphi Corridor.  I heard some officials saying that this could be the end for a possibility for a hostages deal.  So where do you get your optimism from?
And do you think that it was (inaudible) for the Prime Minister to say that?
And another question.  I do hear that the American hostages' families are asking the U.S. administration to try and release their hostages in case Israel doesn't want a hostages deal.  Can you tell us where does this stand?
MR. KIRBY:  I won't speculate about anything, not even the deal that we're working on, at this point.  We still believe that that is the best way to get all the hostages back with their families, is to get this deal in place.  And as I said earlier, we believe we're close enough and that the gaps are narrow enough to achieve that outcome.
It's not optimism, it's pragmatism.  And it's based on just looking at where we are, how far we've been able to come, and an essential belief that, practically speaking, these gaps can be narrowed.
But, look, I can't, nor would I ever, guarantee to you all that â a certain outcome.  We just believe that it is an outcome that's possible.
Q    But is the U.S. working on such an option of releasing the American hostages?
MR. KIRBY:  We are working on a proposal that would release all the hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that we've been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same proposal that the President met with his team over the weekend to discuss.  That is what we're working on.
Q    Thank you so much, Kirby.
MR. KIRBY:  Yep.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Jacob with the Times of Israel.
Q    Hi.  Thanks for doing this.  To just follow up on a previous question: You said that the offer that Israel agreed to includes a withdrawal of IDF forces from heavily populated areas, including those areas along the Philadelphi Corridor.  Does that mean that in areas that aren't heavily populated along the corridor, the U.S. supports or is okay with Israel staying there?  That's one question.
Next, just being â you said you're not using the term ""final"" to talk about the bridging proposal, but Brett had a briefing with us â it was on background â but he said several times that they're calling it a final bridging proposal.  So is the White House now walking back from that terminology?
And then, you were asked about, lastly, reports that the U.S. could walk away from the talks.  I know in the past you've said ""we'll never walk away,"" but that wasn't your response this time.  So I just wanted to see if you're â if there's anything we should be learning from that, how you respond to that question.  Thank you.
MR. KIRBY:  What I'm hoping you can take away from this discussion today is how seriously we're continuing to try to achieve a successful outcome here.  That's what I want you to take away from it.
On the Philadelphi Corridor, I think I could point you to what the Israelis have said publicly about their belief in the need to have some security along that corridor.  The proposal says that they have to remove themselves to the east from densely populated areas.  And that core, essential element of the proposal has not changed.  But the Israelis have said publicly that they believe that even in so doing, that they would need some security along that corridor, and I'd point you to what they're saying about it.
Q    And on the terminology about ""final"" and ""not final"" bridging proposal?
MR. KIRBY:  I've already answered â I've answered the question.
Q    Okay, thank you.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nathan with KAN.
Q    Hey, thanks.  I'd like to know if the President has any plans of speaking to Netanyahu directly to clarify the issue of Philadelphi in the agreement.  He said yesterday that that will happen eventually.  But if this is such an urgent issue, can we expect any kind of direct contact between them immediately?
And also, is the U.S. in any kind of contact with the Israeli opposition and with the protest movement in Israel?
MR. KIRBY:  I don't have anything on the schedule in terms of another call with the Prime Minister, but I think you can safely assume that there will be additional conversations between these two leaders.  And when that happens, we will do what we do every time, which is let you know it's happening and give you a readout when it's happened.  I just don't have anything to speak to at this time.
And we are not involving ourselves, nor would we, in Israeli domestic issues.  So I'd leave it at that.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Nadia.
Q    Thank you, Sam.  John, the President said on seven different occasions that we are very close to conclude this deal, we're closer than ever, we're closer than three days ago.  I'm just wondering how â what is your understanding of what went wrong?  And why do you believe that a deal could be achieved, considering that both Sinwar and Netanyahu are not willing to compromise on fundamental issues?
And my second question is: Some of the families, the hostage families, are actually blaming the administration.  They're saying that you did not exert enough pressure on Netanyahu, you didn't use any leverage to make sure that the deal could be concluded a long time ago, and that could have spared the killing of the six hostages, despite the fact that Hamas executed them, but there could have been a way to spare their life.  How do you respond to this?  Thank you.
MR. KIRBY:  We were looking for that way as hard as humanly possible.  And we certainly understand the grief, the sorrow, the anger that they feel, because we feel it too.  But that doesn't take away the incredible efforts that we expended to try to get this deal finished, and it certainly doesn't diminish the efforts going forward, which will remain consistent, steadfast, and aggressive, to try to get this deal in place.
And when we said at the time, and I've said it many times myself, that we're as close as we've ever been, that the gaps are narrow, those were accurate statements.  They were â they were true.  But we also never said it was going to be easy.  You can be that close.  And as I've said before, when you get to that close, when you get to that level of detail, that's when the horse trading gets incredibly difficult.  That's when the task of negotiators really intensifies.
And we're still, we believe, in that space right now, where we have gaps that can be narrowed, but there's no guarantee that they will be.  We just have to keep working as hard as we have been, and we will.  There's not going to be any slackening of effort from the United States to try to see if we can't hammer this out.
Q    And how do you respond to the fact that no leverage was used against Netanyahu?  Could you have used any pressure, publicly or publicly, to change his position?
MR. KIRBY:  We've been working with Israel and Qatar and Egypt â the latter two, of course, have direct communications with Hamas â to do everything we can to find language that works for both sides to bring this deal to a close.  And that work was not completely â it was not completely fruitless.  We were able to narrow the gaps and get close.  But obviously, nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated, and we haven't concluded.
So it's not like â it's not like we haven't worked hard to move both sides closer to a deal.  And as I said, it doesn't diminish the fact that we're going to continue to work hard for that outcome.
MODERATOR:  Thank you.  And that is, unfortunately, all the time we have today.  As always, if we weren't able to get to you, please email the NSC Press distro and we'll try to get back to you as soon as we can.  Thanks, everyone.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has seized Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's airplane in the Dominican Republic, citing sanctions laws, the Justice Department announced Monday.
""This morning, the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by NicolÃ¡s Maduro and his cronies,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.
""The Department will continue to pursue those who violate our sanctions and export controls to prevent them from using American resources to undermine the national security of the United States,"" said the attorney general.
The aircraft, which is a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the Southern District of Florida at the request of the United States ""based on violations of U.S. export control and sanctions laws,"" according to the statement.
This incident, which came a little over a month after Maduro's re-election, represents the latest chapter in the longstanding tense relations between the United States and Venezuela.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation against the Maduro government in support of opposition leaders.
An Executive Order issued in August 2019 prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions ""with persons who have acted or purported to act directly or indirectly for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela,"" according to the Justice Department statement.
In March 2020, the Justice Department indicted Maduro and his aides on narco-terrorism charges, accusing Maduro and other Venezuelan officials of conspiring ""with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.""
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department offered a reward of up to 15 million U.S. dollars for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro.
Also on Monday, Venezuela ordered the arrest of presidential candidate Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez, who is accused of crimes including forging a public document, incitement to disobedience of laws, conspiracy and sabotage, according to a report by Bloomberg."

POWIDZ, Poland -- The team of professionals from the 405th Army Field Support Brigade's Poland Battalion hosted the command teams from the 593rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command and the 53rd Transportation Battalion (Movement Control) at the Powidz Army Prepositioned Stocks-2 worksite recently.
The commander of the 593rd ESC, Brig. Gen. Kevin Cotman, and the ESC's senior enlisted leader, Command Sgt. Maj. Dawadrain Clark Sr., along with Lt. Col. Nathaniel Groves and Command Sgt. Maj. Edgar Zavala from the 53rd Trans. Bn. (MC), visited the U.S. Army's newest, most modern APS site, Aug. 29.
During the site visit, the two command teams received a walking tour of the Powidz APS-2 worksite by the command team of Army Field Support Battalion-Poland, Lt. Col. Omar McKen and Sgt. Maj. Olimpia Valdez, and the site director, George Palmer. While there, the two visiting command teams also observed Polish Provided Logistics Support personnel being trained on servicing and maintaining APS-2 equipment stored at the site.
The 593rd ESC command team from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, along with its subordinate transportation battalion, the 53rd Trans. Bn. (MC), visited the Powidz worksite to better understand APS-2 requirements and capabilities and to take some of AFSBn-Poland's recently acquired best practices back with them to Lewis-McChord, stated AFSBn-Poland in an operational update to the 405th AFSB.
The Powidz APS-2 worksite is comprised of 650,000 square feet of humidity-controlled warehouse space, a vehicle maintenance facility and supporting facilities. In addition, there is a 58,000 square foot earth-covered munitions storage area, nearby. A modernized armored brigade combat team's worth of APS-2 equipment is stored and maintained at the site, plus medical gear and supplies, sustainment and support equipment, and more.
The Powidz APS-2 worksite demonstrates the U.S. and NATO's commitment to maintaining rapid deployment capabilities, playing a crucial role in deterrence through enduring agreements and strategic investments. In addition, it alleviates many of the deployment requirements typically associated with deploying major combat units to Europe from the U.S. It is estimated that APS-2 worksites in Europe, like Powidz, can help reduce deployment timelines for an armored brigade combat team from 60 days to as little as a week or two.
""The Powidz worksite a forward projection platform to be utilized in Europe. It allows an armored brigade to deploy to Europe and receive necessary equipment within 48 hours,"" said McKen, who is tasked with mission command of the Powidz APS-2 worksite.
The 405th AFSB's APS-2 program enhances U.S. Army Europe and Africa's readiness and capability to support the warfighter while simultaneously promoting stability and security in the region. By providing turn-key power projection APS-2 packages ready to employ at a moment's notice, the APS-2 program is a key component of U.S. Army Europe and Africa's power projection and warfighter readiness missions.
The 405th AFSB is assigned to U.S. Army Sustainment Command and headquartered in Kaiserslautern, Germany. The brigade provides materiel enterprise support to U.S. forces throughout Europe and Africa - providing theater sustainment logistics; synchronizing acquisition, logistics and technology; and leveraging U.S. Army Materiel Command's materiel enterprise to support joint forces."
N2Q7XHB2I0_FFYQE9ONUS0BYA6,Israel announces killing of Hamas militant seen in October 7 attack video,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-voa02.htm,"By VOA News September 03, 2024
Israel's military said Tuesday it killed a Hamas militant who participated in the October assault on Israel and was seen in a widely viewed video drinking soda in front of two kids who were wounded in a grenade attack that killed their father.
The Israel Defense Forces identified the militant as Ahmed Fozi Wadia and said he paraglided into the Netiv HaAsara community during the October attack.
Wadia was among eight militants killed in a Saturday airstrike in Gaza City, the Israeli military said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday it will win its war against Hamas with or without arms from Britain, a day after the British government announced it would suspend some arms exports to Israel due to concerns about their use in Gaza.
""Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain's misguided decision will only embolden Hamas,"" Netanyahu's office said.
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said there was a ""clear risk"" that some of the weapons could be used to ""commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.""
British Defense Secretary John Healey told Times Radio on Tuesday that the suspension of 30 of 350 arms export licenses to Israel ""will not have a material impact on Israel's security.""
Netanyahu is also facing pressure at home after several days of protests calling on him to agree to a cease-fire with Hamas in order to bring home hostages still being held by the militants in Gaza.
""No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me. ... No one will preach to me on this issue,"" Netanyahu said Monday, according to The Associated Press.
Among the sticking points in negotiations is Netanyahu's push for Israel to retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. Israel claims Hamas uses tunnels along the corridor to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt and Hamas deny the claims.
On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Israelis marched in the streets to mourn the news that the bodies of six slain hostages were found in southern Gaza.
At a televised news conference Monday, Netanyahu said he sought forgiveness for failing to save the slain hostages.
""I ask for your forgiveness for not bringing them back alive,"" he said. ""We were close, but we didn't succeed. Hamas will pay a very heavy price for this.""
Late Monday, several thousand demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu's private home in central Jerusalem, chanting, ""Deal. Now.""
A general workers' strike Monday also disrupted Israel as the largest Israeli trade union and businesses sought to pressure the government to reach a cease-fire deal with Hamas to end fighting in Gaza as the war nears the 11-month mark.
Advocates for the hostages and critics of Netanyahu argued that a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza could have saved the hostages' lives. But Netanyahu's partners in the Israeli government's ruling coalition mostly oppose a compromise with Hamas.
Netanyahu has refused to agree to a cease-fire deal calling for an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza that would lead to a permanent halt to the fighting â for fear that Hamas could rearm itself and endanger Israel's long-term security.
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out negotiations by issuing new demands, including that Israel remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor and a second corridor running across Gaza.
Hamas has held to the broad agreements of a three-phase plan put forth by the Biden administration in July: Hamas would release all hostages in return for an end to the war, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners.
In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden rebuked Netanyahu for his handling of the hostage situation and cease-fire negotiations.
As he arrived Monday back at the White House after a vacation, Biden was asked whether he thought the Israeli leader was doing enough to free the 100 or so remaining hostages, a third of whom Israel believes are dead. Biden responded simply, ""No,"" but said he would have more to say after meeting with his security advisers.
Biden, who has closely followed the fate of the hostages, said Sunday he was ""devastated and outraged"" by the discovery of more dead captives.
The hostages were apparently shot to death by the militants just as troops were zeroing in on their location in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry said early Monday a forensic examination showed the hostages were killed by gunshots at close range, and within 48-72 hours before the examination.
A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing said in a statement Monday that if Israel remains committed to using military pressure to free hostages, then those being held will be returned to their families ""in shrouds."" The spokesperson said those guarding the hostages were given new instructions regarding what to do if Israeli troops approach them, and that the instructions were conveyed after a June Israeli raid that freed four hostages.
Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages during the October 7 attack on southern Israel. The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.

Turkey placed 10 people in pretrial detention Tuesday in connection with an assault of two U.S. Marines in Turkey's western port city of Izmir.
Several members of a Turkish nationalist group, Turkey Youth Union, or TGB, on Monday attacked two U.S. Marines from the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp, which docked in the city's port on Sunday, according to the Izmir Governorate.
Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday that the two Marines were not injured and are ""safe."" He said they were aided by other Marines in the area during the incident and were subsequently taken to a local hospital for evaluation as a precaution before returning to the Wasp.
""This is clearly a troubling incident. We are grateful for the support of the Turkish authorities who are looking into this,"" Ryder said.
He added that no Marines have been detained by authorities, and that those involved in the incident are cooperating with investigators.
Turkish authorities arrested 15 people on Monday over the incident, and a Turkish court released five of them under judicial control on Tuesday. The remaining 10 were ordered held in pretrial detention until they hear charges against them.
According to a video shared by the TGB on social media, TGB members were seen as they put a sack over a U.S. Marine's head.
""No one will be able to respond to the cries for help from U.S. soldiers. Your hands are stained with the blood of our brave soldiers and thousands of Palestinians. You will leave our lands!"" the TGB wrote on X, tagging the X accounts of the U.S. Embassy in Turkey and the U.S. Department of Defense.
""[U.S. soldiers] put a sack over the head of our soldiers in Sulaymaniyah,"" a TGB member said in the video, referring to an incident in which U.S. troops arrested at least 11 Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq in 2003.
Turkish media reported that the heads of the arrested Turkish soldiers were covered in sacks, and the arrests stirred a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and the United States. The incident is widely known as the ""Hood event"" in Turkey.
The video also showed several TGB members chanting, ""Yankee, go home,"" a historical anti-American slogan associated with 1960s leftist protests in Turkey.
Reports confirmed
In a statement on Monday, the Izmir Governorate announced that two women and 13 men, who are members of the TGB, physically attacked two U.S. military personnel in civilian clothes.
""Five U.S. soldiers in civilian clothes joined the incident after seeing it from a distance, and our security forces quickly intervened,"" the governorate said.
The U.S. Embassy in Turkey confirmed reports of the attack on Monday. ""We thank Turkish authorities for their rapid response and ongoing investigation,"" the embassy said on X.
In a statement to VOA, a White House National Security Council spokesperson also said, ""We are troubled by this assault on U.S. service members and are appreciative that Turkish police are taking this matter seriously and holding those responsible accountable.""
On Sunday, Defense Visual Information Distribution Service, or DVIDS, reported that the Wasp was in Turkey ""for a regularly scheduled port visit"" that ""provides an opportunity to further enhance strategic partnership between the U.S. and Turkiye.""
According to the DVIDS, the schedule of the U.S. personnel included ""tours organized by the ship's Morale, Welfare and Recreation team, such as a visit to the Ephesus historical site, snorkeling and scuba diving, and a guided tour of Izmir's cultural sites.""
U.S. Sixth Fleet spokesperson and Navy Commander Timothy Gorman told VOA the two assaulted Marines were from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit.
Middle East tensions
The U.S. sent the Wasp to the eastern Mediterranean for deterrence reasons in June amid the increased tensions between Hezbollah and Israel. The USS Bataan and the aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford were previously deployed to the region after the October 7 attack.
Omer Celik, the spokesperson for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, criticized the deployments.
""Every warship, every aircraft carrier sent there by other countries will provide an opportunity that will benefit those who say violence should continue and violence should spread even more to the region,"" Celik said.
The Wasp participated in bilateral at-sea training with two Turkish navy ships in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea from August 13 to 17. U.S. Marines shared information about the joint training, but Turkey's National Defense Ministry did not publicly announce it.
Later in August, Turkish media reported that the Wasp docked in Cyprus as part of the increased U.S. presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party criticized the government for not disclosing the joint training.

A former senior aide to New York Governor Kathy Hochul was charged Tuesday with acting as an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government.
Linda Sun, Hochul's former deputy chief of staff, is being charged with failure to register as a foreign agent, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, federal prosecutors said in a statement released Tuesday.
Sun was hired by New York state's Executive Chamber more than 10 years ago and was terminated in March 2023 when her alleged illegal activities were discovered. She held positions in several agencies during that time.
Sun is alleged to have acted on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party while working for the New York state government.
Sun ""never registered as a foreign agent,"" federal prosecutors said, and ""actively concealed that she took actions at the order, request or direction of PRC government and the CCP representatives.""
Sun and her husband, co-defendant Chris Hu, were arrested at their Long Island home Tuesday before pleading not guilty during their arraignment in Brooklyn federal court in the afternoon.
Hu faces money laundering charges in addition to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of means of identification.
U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said that while Sun worked for Hochul in the deputy chief of staff capacity, she and her husband ""actually worked to further the interests of the Chinese government and the CCP.""
""The illicit scheme enriched the defendant's family to the tune of millions of dollars,"" Peace said.
While allegedly working for both the New York state government and China, Sun was successful in preventing Taiwanese government officials access to high-level New York officials said.
Sun is also reported to have changed the messaging of high-level New York state officials about issues of importance to the PRC and the CCP. She also allegedly obtained official New York state proclamations for PRC government officials without proper authorization.
Other charges against Sun include an attempt to facilitate a high-level New York state politician's trip to China and scheduling meetings for visiting Chinese government delegations with New York state government officials.
Sun and Hu received significant economic rewards by working for China, including facilitation of millions of dollars in transactions for Hu's China-based business activities, travel benefits, the promotion of a close family friend's business and employment for Sun's cousin in China. Prosecutors said the benefits also included Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a Chinese government official's personal chef that were given to Sun's parents.
Sun and her husband ""laundered millions of dollars for the foreign country and used the monetary benefits of this scheme to buy luxury vehicles and million-dollar properties here in New York,"" said Thomas M. Fattorusso, special agent in charge of criminal investigations at the Internal Revenue Service in New York.
With their laundered money, the couple purchased a $4.1 million house on Long Island, a $2.1 million condominium in Honolulu, Hawaii, and several expensive cars, including a 2024 Ferrari.
Sun never reported any of the benefits she received from China, as was required as a New York state government employee.
Meanwhile, Hu unlawfully laundered money through bank accounts he opened in a relative's name but were entirely for Hu's exclusive use, prosecutors said. In addition, Hu unlawfully used an image of the relative's driver's license to open the accounts.

For Immediate Release  Office of Public Affairs
Defendants Are Senior Leaders of Hamas Responsible for Planning, Supporting, and Perpetrating Hamas's October 7 Terrorist Attacks in Israel Resulting in the Brutal Murders of More Than a Thousand Innocent Civilians, Including Over 40 American Citizens
Note: The complaint was unsealed on Sept. 3 and can be viewed here.
The Justice Department announced today the unsealing of terrorism,   murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges against six senior   leaders of Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization. The   charges relate to the defendants' central roles in planning, supporting,   and perpetrating the terrorist atrocities that Hamas committed in   Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 (the October 7 Hamas Massacres), involving the   murders and kidnappings of countless innocent civilians, including   American citizens, which was the culmination of Hamas's decades-long   campaign of terrorism and violence against Israel and its allies,   including American citizens. The defendants are either deceased or   remain at large.
""The Justice Department has charged Yahya Sinwar and other senior   leaders of Hamas for financing, directing, and overseeing a decades-long   campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the national security   of the United States,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ""On   October 7th, Hamas terrorists, led by these defendants,   murdered nearly 1200 people, including over 40 Americans, and kidnapped   hundreds of civilians. This weekend, we learned that Hamas murdered an   additional six people they had kidnapped and held captive for nearly a   year, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23 year old Israeli American. We   are investigating Hersh's murder, and each and every one of Hamas'   brutal murders of Americans, as an act of terrorism. The charges   unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of   Hamas' operations. These actions will not be our last.""
""Yahya Sinwar and the other senior leaders of Hamas are charged today   with orchestrating this terrorist organization's decades-long campaign   of mass violence and terror â including on October 7th. On that horrible   day, Hamas terrorists viciously massacred nearly 1,200 innocent men,   women, and children, including over 40 Americans, kidnapped hundreds   more, and used sexual violence as a weapon of brutality,"" said Deputy   Attorney General Lisa Monaco. ""Since that horrific day, we have worked   to investigate and hold accountable those responsible, and we will not   rest until all those who kidnapped or murdered Americans are brought to   justice. Our thoughts continue to be with the families of all the   victims of this barbaric terrorist attack.""
""From the moment Hamas launched its horrific attack on October 7, the   FBI has been dedicated to identifying and charging those responsible   for these heinous crimes,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. ""The FBI   has and will continue to relentlessly investigate these attacks on   civilians, including Americans. Hamas is a Foreign Terrorist   Organization with a long history of violence, and the group's actions   have resulted in increased terrorism threats in the U.S. and against   American interests throughout the world. Countering terrorism remains   our number one priority, and our work continues.""
""The core mission of the National Security Division is to protect   Americans from violent terrorists and extremist organizations like   Hamas,"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice   Department's National Security Division. ""The atrocities committed by   Hamas in Israel on October 7 are intolerable, and the Justice Department   will not rest in our pursuit to hold Hamas accountable for perpetrating   its campaign of terror, death, and destruction.""
""For decades, Hamas and its leadership have dedicated themselves to   the eradication of the State of Israel, and to murdering, maiming, and   brutalizing anyone â including dozens of Americans â who stood in their   way,"" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of   New York. ""The October 7 Hamas Massacres - in which over 40 American   citizens were murdered - is only the latest act of savagery carried out   by Hamas. This office has long been dedicated to serving as a bulwark   against terrorism, and striking blows against its leaders. Our   commitment is clear: if you hurt one member of our community, you hurt   all of us â and we stand with all victims of Hamas' reign of terror. We   will bring justice to this terrorist organization from the top down for   the atrocities they have committed.""
According to court documents, Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyya,   commonly known as Hamas, is a terrorist organization that was founded in   1987, and has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO)   by the United States since 1997. From its inception, Hamas' stated   purpose has been to create an Islamic Palestinian state throughout   Israel by eliminating the State of Israel through violent holy war, or   jihad. Hamas also promotes attacks against the U.S. and its citizens   and, over more than two decades, Hamas has murdered and injured dozens   of Americans as part of its campaign of violence and terror.
The defendants charged in the complaint are all senior leaders of   Hamas who have orchestrated, overseen, and supported Hamas's   decades-long campaign of terrorism, including the October 7 Hamas   Massacres. They and their co-conspirators control all aspects of the   terrorist organization, including its political and military branches,   known as the Politburo and Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades (al-Qassam   Brigades).
Ismail Haniyeh was the chairman of Hamas's Politburo from 2017 until   his reported death on or about July 31. Prior to 2017, Haniyeh was the   deputy chairman of the Politburo and the leader of Hamas in the Gaza   Strip. Haniyeh was based principally in Turkey and Qatar.
Yahya Sinwar, also known as Abu Ibrahim, 61, is the leader of Hamas.   Previously, beginning in approximately 2017, he was the leader of Hamas   in the Gaza Strip, and is one of the founders of the al-Qassam Brigades.   Sinwar is based principally in the Gaza Strip.
Mohammad Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif and al Khalid al-Deif,   was the commander in chief of the al-Qassam Brigades, a position he   held from in or about 2002 until his reported death on or about July 13.   Al-Masri was based principally in the Gaza Strip.
Marwan Issa, also known as Abu Baraa, was the deputy commander of the   al-Qassam Brigades from approximately 2007 until his reported death on   or about March 10.  Issa was based principally in the Gaza Strip.
Khaled Meshaal, also known as Abu al-Waleed, 68, was the chairman of   Hamas' Politburo from approximately 2004 to 2017 and is now the head of   Hamas' diaspora office â effectively responsible for Hamas' official   presence outside of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Meshaal is based   principally in Qatar.
Ali Baraka, 57, has been Hamas' head of National Relations Abroad   since approximately 2019, and was previously Hamas's representative in   Lebanon. Baraka is based principally in Lebanon.
Hamas has pursued its objectives through innumerable acts of brutal   terrorist violence, including launching thousands of rockets   specifically targeting civilian populations; suicide bombings of   restaurants, markets, public transportation systems, and other public   spaces; and military-style attacks on towns and residential communities.   Hamas's campaign of terrorism has killed and wounded citizens of   Israel, the U.S., and many other countries.
On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas committed its most violent, large-scale   terrorist attack to date â the October 7 Hamas Massacres. Hamas targeted   civilian populations with a barrage of rockets, before waves of Hamas   terrorists breached the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel,   infiltrated Israel, and launched attacks on civilians, by land, sea, and   air. Hamas sent thousands of armed fighters into southern Israel, where   they carried out the massacres of over a thousand people and the   kidnappings of more than 200 others. Hamas terrorists attacked   civilians, firing handguns, assault rifles, and handheld rocket   launchers, in small residential communities in Kfar Aza, Be'eri, Nir Oz,   Nahal Oz, Re'im, Holit, Zikim, Kerem Shalom, Sufa, and others; the   Israeli town of Sderot; and a music festival held near Re'im; among   other places. Armed Hamas operatives attacked and shot civilians,   including children, sometimes with machineguns and sometimes at point   blank range, and weaponized sexual violence against Israeli women,   including through rape and genital mutilation. Hundreds of civilians,   including Americans, and Israeli soldiers, were killed and wounded;   other victims, including Americans, were kidnapped, taken hostage, and   brought into Gaza by Hamas. As of the date of the complaint, over 40   American citizens were among those murdered, and at least eight American   citizens were taken hostage or remain unaccounted for. Most recently,   Hamas executed a U.S. citizen who was taken hostage by Hamas during the   October 7 Hamas Massacres and remained in captivity until he was   murdered.
Throughout Hamas' existence, the organization's ability to carry out   acts of terrorism, including the October 7 Hamas Massacres, has been   fueled in part by the Government of Iran, particularly the Islamic   Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its Qods Force (IRGC-QF) â the   element of the IRGC responsible for conducting external terrorism   operations and providing support to terrorist groups â which has   supported, supplied, and trained Hamas, and by the Lebanon-based Shia   Islamic terrorist organization Hizballah. Hamas' attacks have played a   significant role in the Government of Iran's regional and global   campaign of supporting terrorism to weaken and ultimately destroy both   the United States and Israel. Hamas' leaders, including the defendants,   have been instrumental in Hamas' relationship with the Government of   Iran, including through personal communications with leaders in the   Iranian regime. Emblematic of this close relationship, Ismail Haniyeh,   who had been the chairman of Hamas's Politburo since 2017, was reported   killed in Iran on or about July 31, while visiting Tehran to attend the   swearing-in of Iran's President. Hamas' leaders, including the   defendants, have acknowledged the importance of the support from the   Government of Iran and Hizballah to Hamas' ability to carry out the   October 7 Hamas Massacres, including the IRGC-QF providing Hamas, among   other things, rockets and technical assistance necessary to build   rockets, and extensive funding for Hamas' terror wing.
Hamas raises money to fund its terrorist activities through a variety   of methods, including by soliciting and receiving cryptocurrency   payments, advertising the ostensible anonymity of such transactions.   Since 2019, Hamas' military wing has used social media and other   platforms to call for cryptocurrency contributions from supporters   abroad, including in the United States, to Hamas-controlled virtual   wallets, explicitly acknowledging that those payments would be used to   fund Hamas' campaign of violence. Through these mechanisms, Hamas has   received tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency payments to fund   its activities.
The complaint unsealed today charges each of the defendants with:   conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist   organization resulting in death, which carries a maximum penalty of life   in prison; conspiring to provide material support for acts of terrorism   resulting in death, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison;   conspiring to murder U.S. nationals outside the United States, which   carries a maximum penalty of life in prison; conspiring to bomb a place   of public use resulting in death, which carries a maximum penalty of   death or life in prison; conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction   resulting in death, which carries a maximum penalty of death or life in   prison; conspiring to finance terrorism, which carries a maximum penalty   of 20 years in prison; and conspiring to violate the International   Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20   years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any   sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other   statutory factors.
The FBI is investigating the case.

Tech innovation encouraged to address info breach
By Fan Anqi Published: Sep 01, 2024 10:41 PM
A new set of rules for implementing China's Law on Guarding State Secrets took effect on Sunday, further refining the management of classified information, encouraging technological innovation in this field and enhancing cyberspace management to avoid information breach.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang signed a decree of the State Council to unveil the regulations on July 22, consisting of six chapters and 74 articles, aiming to ensure the effective implementation of the newly revised Law on Guarding State Secrets.
A special clause on the Communist Party of China's leadership in confidentiality work is added to the regulation, further emphasizing the adherence to and strengthening of the Party leadership, improving the system and mechanism of Party leadership, and specifying the responsibilities of central and local levels of relevant institutions. This will ensure confidentiality work follows the correct political direction, a spokesperson with the National Administration of State Secrets Protection said.
It also specified the requirements to establish and promptly update a list of state secrets, as well as clarifying the responsibilities of designated personnel, while outlining specific scenarios for derivative classification.
The ""list of state secrets"" is one of the highlights of the new regulations, which clearly and visually lists state secret contents, classification levels, confidentiality periods, scope of knowledge and the basis for classification, Liu Changsong, a lawyer from the Beijing Mugong Law Firm, told the Global Times on Sunday.
Furthermore, it clarifies the scope and specific responsibilities of individuals accountable for classification, help prevent issues such as shirking responsibilities due to unclear definition of duties, Liu said.
Meng Bo, a lawyer at Beijing Jingsh Law Firm, added that another highlight of this regulation is the management of network information and data confidentiality, strengthening the confidentiality management of network usage. This management clarifies the obligation of network operators to cooperate in investigating and alerting on confidentiality violations, and enhances the data confidentiality management system.
""These are important measures to adapt to the era of informatization and digitalization, effectively protecting information and data security,"" Meng told the Global Times.
Responding to Western media hypes that the new regulation could ""scare away"" foreign enterprises in China, Liu said such ""worries"" are completely unnecessary.
""It only makes it clearer for foreign enterprises to understand what areas involve China's national security concerns and which do not,"" Liu noted."

Indian Army unveiled two landmark events; 'HIM-DRONE-A-THON 2' and 'HIMTECH-2024' landmark events designed to harness military technologies for operations in high altitude areas. Envisaged as an opportunity to the Indian Drone Industry to showcase the capabilities of their drone solutions for high altitude areas, HIM-DRONE-A-THON 2 will take place at Wari La, near Leh on 17-18 September 2024. It will be followed by HIMTECH-2024 on 20-21 September 2024, an event conceptualised to discuss, demonstrate and discover new avenues for development, incorporation and cross pollination of technology, ideas and innovations with focus on harnessing military technologies for high attitude areas.
Major General CS Mann, Additional Director General of the Army Design Bureau highlighted that the Indian Army is deployed from icy heights of the Siachen Glacier to the rugged Himalayas where its soldiers face unparalleled adversities daily. For drone operations, rarified atmosphere results in reduced lift and degraded engine performance which are further accentuated by extreme cold temperatures and high wind speeds. These conditions are unique for Indian Army and demand systems that can adequately perform in these conditions. Since such altitude battlefields are not prevalent anywhere else, tailormade, indigenous solutions are the way forward. If the indigenous industry succeeds here, it also opens vistas for them to international arena and establish India as a credible drone manufacturing hub.
HIM-DRONE-A-THON-2 will focus on drone solutions for Indian Army for high altitude areas. The event is planned to be conducted under actual terrain and environmental conditions at altitude of 4000-5000 meters. The event is open to all indigenous drone manufactures and invites their participation for demonstration of Surveillance drones, Loitering munitions, Logistics Drones, Swarm Drones and drones with specific capabilities / role / payloads ie; Electronic Warfare, Synthetic Aperture Radar, Communication Intelligence and Electronic Intelligence. As of now more than 25 Drone manufacturing firms have registered for participation in the event. All the firms will be competing in a multifaceted competition at super high-altitude area for proving their suitability and capabilities.
HIMTECH 2024 is being held for the first time in Leh, to highlight and focus on development of technology and system for meeting operational requirements along the Northern Borders. The event being held in collaboration with FICCI will not only showcase industry partners and new generation equipment developed for high altitude areas but will also project Leh as the new business destination for new technology developers, industry and academia. The event will provide a platform to Indian Industries to showcase a wide range of the equipment and technologies comprising modern unmanned systems, all terrain mobility solutions, autonomous systems and advanced soldier systems.
The technology being demonstrated by the Indigenous Drone Industry, can also be harnessed for civilian use especially in high altitude areas and areas akin to terrain/ atmospheric conditions in Union Territory of Ladkah.

NGGFBSKM0Q_VDOHEES0XG4L587,EXPLAINED: What is the China-Africa summit and why does it matter?,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/09/china-240903-rfa01.htm,"Beijing sees developing countries as the 'base' from which a rising China will extend its global clout.
By Luisetta Mudie for RFA English 2024.09.03 -- Leaders of African countries are arriving in Beijing this week for a China-Africa summit, at which President Xi Jinping is expected to lay out his idea of a ""shared future"" with African nations, underpinned by Chinese demand for minerals and political support from Global South nations.
On the second day of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation, which runs Sept. 4-6 in the Chinese capital, Xi is expected to call for higher-quality, ""green"" investments, as China backs away from its earlier readiness to bankroll major infrastructure projects in favor of more sustainable public-private partnerships.
China remains keen to boost trade and gain access to raw materials from the continent, including copper, cobalt and lithium from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. But following debt restructuring agreements with Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana and Zambia, the country will likely proceed with more caution when it comes to the big loan packages that were a feature of pre-pandemic cooperation.
African countries remain the primary focus of Xi's flagship economic cooperation program. Yet Xi's Belt and Road Initiative has been widely criticized for ensnaring poorer countries in ""debt trap"" diplomacy, with Beijing wielding most of the power in partnerships that offer scant gains for local residents.
Critics say China's approach to its economic and trade partners in Africa remains colonial and extractive, and Beijing will want to try to shift that narrative at this week's forum.
Why is China-Africa cooperation so important to Xi Jinping?
For Xi, it's not just about trade and economic ties. There are big political gains to be made too.
Foreign policy under Xi's rule, now likely indefinite, has been about reshaping the U.S.-dominated international order to more closely reflect China's needs and priorities, including exporting a more authoritarian model of governance to countries under Beijing's political influence.
Under Xi's vision, a rising China will spread its wings (in Chinese) and influence globally, to the point where Beijing becomes a rule-maker rather than a rule-taker, as it starts to chafe under the U.S.-led ""rules-based international order.""
For that to happen, it needs other, often poorer, countries to accept its rules and act as its allies in international institutions, including organizations under the aegis of the United Nations.
Xi Jinping Thought, which has been enshrined in the ruling party charter since 2022, describes this as ""reform to the global governance system,"" which according to the government's China International Development Cooperation Agency, is at a ""historical turning point.""
""While China has always pursued global preeminence, it initially sought to be unobtrusive and progress stealthily with a low profile,""  according to a 2023 analysis by Paul Nantulya of the Africa Center for Strategic Studies.
""The Chinese Communist Party has signaled that the era of discretion is gradually being replaced with a bolder and more assertive approach.""
How extensive is China's presence in Africa?
Beijing's United Front outreach and influence operations in the continent seem to be working. African countries are consistent supporters of Beijing at the United Nations, voting Chinese nationals into top jobs at several U.N. agencies and backing attempts to rewrite the rulebook on human rights, while excluding democratic Taiwan.
And a Pew Research poll from 2023 revealed that Beijing gets its highest international approval ratings from Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.
""China's quest to 'reform' international governance has found willing partners in the Global South, including Africa, which has played no small part in advancing China's international project,"" Nantulya writes, warning that Chinese influence can also pose a challenge to ""core African norms"" and commitments on constitutionalism, human rights and democracy.
However, China's efforts to selectively reshape the workings of the international system -- including its human rights system -- can also undermine core African norms and commitments such as those on constitutionalism, human rights, and democracy, he warns.
As a BRICS nation, South Africa has signed up for China's New Development Bank to offer an alternative to the World Bank, while several African countries have joined its Asia Infrastructure Development Bank since its founding in 2015.
And Beijing's Global Security Initiative, a bid to export Chinese norms and security priorities, was incorporated into an action plan adopted at the last China-Africa summit in Dakar.
In recent years, China has persuaded Burkina Faso, Malawi, Liberia, Senegal and others to cut diplomatic ties with democratic Taiwan, a precondition of diplomatic recognition by Beijing.
What can we expect to see at the China-Africa summit?
According to state media, China and Africa will be launching projects with green and sustainable branding, including growing mushrooms using Chinese technology, biogas promotion and greenhouse cultivation.
Beijing also says it wants to ""further increase Africa's capacity in realizing independent and sustainable development as well as help it accelerate poverty alleviation,"" the China Daily reported.
Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative will also be a prominent feature of the forum.
Chinese companies have helped to build or upgrade more than 10,000 kilometers of railways, nearly 100,000 kilometers of highways, nearly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, and 66,000 kilometers of power transmission and distribution lines in African countries, according to state media reports. They have also helped build a 150,000-kilometer backbone communications network.
But experts expect Beijing to move away from its previous focus on eye-watering infrastructure figures in favor of healthcare, sustainable development, the digital economy and innovation.
Chinese sovereign lending, once the main source of financing for Africa's infrastructure, is at its lowest level in two decades, according to Reuters.
Yet public-private partnerships, Beijing's preferred new investment vehicle globally, have yet to gain traction in Africa, the agency reported.
Chinese officials at this week's summit will be wanting to change that.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III spoke on Sunday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant about the six hostages in Gaza murdered by Hamas, including 23-year-old U.S. citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder at news conference today.
Austin passed along his deepest condolences to the families of the slain hostages, and ""he expressed outrage at their vicious, illegal and immoral execution at the hands of Hamas,"" Ryder said.
The secretary affirmed that Hamas leaders must be held accountable for the murder of the innocent civilians, and the defense leaders reaffirmed their mutual commitment to swiftly reaching a cease-fire deal to secure the release of all remaining hostages, the general said.
Also on Sunday, U.S. forces in the U.S. Central Command partnered with Syrian Democratic Forces to capture Khaled Ahmed al-Dandal, an ISIS leader and facilitator who was assessed as helping ISIS fighters after he escaped from a detention facility in Raqqa, Syria, the press secretary said.
""The operation highlights Centcom's ongoing efforts to support our SDF partners to mitigate threats of future escapes by ISIS detainees from SDF detention facilities in Syria and to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS,"" Ryder said.
Yesterday, Iranian-backed Houthis attacked two crude-oil tankers transiting the Red Sea with two ballistic missiles and a one-way attack unmanned aerial system, hitting both vessels. The motor vessel Blue Lagoon 1 is owned by Panama and sails under the Panamanian flag; the operator is Greek. The motor vessel Amjad is flagged, owned and operated by Saudi Arabia.
""These reckless attacks of terrorism by the Houthis continue to destabilize regional and global commerce, while threatening the lives of innocent civilian mariners, as well as maritime ecosystems,"" Ryder said.
Currently, salvage efforts are underway in the southern Red Sea for the disabled motor vessel Delta Sounion, Greek-owned, which was attacked by Houthis on Aug. 21 and is still on fire and could develop into a major environmental disaster, according to a Centcom news release.
""The U.S. will continue to work with international partners and allies to protect maritime commerce and mitigate potential impacts to the environment, despite the irresponsible and careless actions of the Iranian-backed Houthis,"" Ryder said."

Tehran, IRNA -- Israeli forces have killed a Palestinian teenage boy in fresh attacks on the West Bank, and raided the house of the preacher of Al-Aqsa Mosque Sheikh Ekrima Sabri.
According to a Tuesday report by Al-Jazeera news channel, during an attack on Tulkarm city in the West Bank, a Palestinian youth was shot dead by the Zionist forces.
Al-Mayadeen reported that the martyr was a young Palestinian named Mohammad Kanaan.
The Zionist occupation forces also attacked the city of Jenin and its refugee camp in the West Bank with wide-ranging military equipment.
The occupiers also raided the city of Qalqilya in the West Bank and its cemetery and are searching for Palestinian resistance fighters in a bid to carry out their clearance operation.
The Zionist forces also stormed the Balata refugee camp in the city of Nablus using a military bulldozer and shot at civilians.
Media outlets of the Zionist regime reported that the West Bank has turned into a battlefield after the recent large-scale military operation, which was launched last Wednesday. The number of martyrs since the onset of this round of attacks reached 31.
The Zionist regime's intelligence forces raided the home of Sheikh Ekrima Sabri, the preacher of Al-Aqsa Mosque, and summoned him for interrogation at the Al Moscobiyeh Center in occupied al-Quds.
This comes as an Israeli military official said on Monday night that the West Bank is on the verge of becoming the second front of the war after the Gaza Strip.
The unnamed Zionist official told the regime's Channel 14 TV that the resistance groups are planning to carry out operations from al-Khalil in the southern West Bank.
The Israeli regime's Minister of Settlements, Orit Strook, said that she had asked the regime's officials to declare a state of war in the West Bank.

At the informal meeting of the European Union Defence Ministers held today in Brussels, member states discussed military support for Ukraine and issues concerning the EU's defence readiness.
""While the Ukrainian success in Kursk is inspiring, we must remind ourselves that they are fighting with one hand tied behind their back. The European Union can do more collectively to support Ukraine militarilyâwe must provide them with every opportunity to win. They need more weapons and ammunition, as well as permission to use these weapons to strike military targets on enemy territory,"" said Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur, who attended the meeting.
In parallel with assisting Ukraine, it is necessary to strengthen Europe's defence readiness. ""Only large-scale investments, which will require raising defence budgets to at least 2.5% of GDP, will send a strategic message to Russia about our preparedness. Defence bonds are a quick and effective option to finance both capability development and strengthening the industry. We will continue discussions on this topic with member states,"" commented Defence Minister Pevkur.
Agreement on the European Peace Facility has stalled in the European Union. The pending package is critically important, as it allows member states to be reimbursed for arms deliveries and to accelerate military aid in the future. ""The lagging implementation of the latest European Peace Facility decisions on military aid to Ukraine is embarrassing, and these issues must be resolved immediately. I expect a swift solution from the Hungarian presidency,"" added Defence Minister Pevkur.
Additionally, the defence ministers discussed the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM). ""Our goal is to adapt the training as closely as possible to Ukraine's needs. This is an ongoing process that we are focusing on, including how to equip these units. We are ready to consider all options,"" said Defence Minister Pevkur."

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will further expand its assistance to Ukraine by taking a more proactive stance to protect the status of vital energy infrastructure to ensure it does not impact nuclear safety. This follows a number of missile attacks that have either directly caused the disconnection of several nuclear power reactors, or led to dangerous instability of the national grid, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv today.
An IAEA expert team will soon travel to some of the damaged Ukrainian sub-stations - electrical switchyards forming the backbone of the grid - that have been identified as essential for nuclear safety. They will assess the situation at these sites and report back to headquarters for possible follow-up actions.
""The safety of operating nuclear power plants is dependent on a stable and reliable connection to the electricity grid. As a result of the war, the situation is becoming increasingly vulnerable and potentially even dangerous in this regard. I agreed with President Zelensky that the IAEA will widen its determined activities to help prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict and look closer at this important aspect of nuclear safety and security,"" Director General Grossi said.
""Our experts will apply the Agency's nuclear industrial safety and critical infrastructure protection expertise to assess these sub-stations,"" he added.
The IAEA already has specialist teams stationed at all of Ukraine's nuclear power plants (NPPs) to help maintain nuclear safety and security during the military conflict. The sub-stations essential for nuclear safety are located in different parts of the country, making the evaluation of these facilities also relevant.
Increased pressure on Ukraine's energy infrastructure over the past six months have caused instability in the grid, posing serious problems for Ukraine's NPPs. Access to reliable supplies of off-site power forms part of the Seven Indispensable Pillars for maintaining nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict outlined by Director General Grossi in March 2022.
On 26 August, widespread strikes targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure caused major fluctuations in the power supply and led to the temporary shutdown or disconnection of reactor units at the Rivne and South Ukraine NPPs, one of which has still not returned to full operation. The off-site power situation at the Khmelnytskyy NPP and Chornobyl site was also affected.
The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), located on the frontline of the conflict, has suffered eight complete loss of power events during the conflict, forcing it to temporarily rely on diesel generators. Just this week, the plant on Monday evening lost its connection to its sole remaining 330 kilovolt (kV) back-up power line, leaving it dependent on one single 750 kV line.
Director General Grossi will later this week travel to the ZNPP for the fifth time during the conflict, but he also underlined the nuclear safety and security risks at Ukraine's other sites.
""The heightened vulnerability of Ukraine's energy infrastructure is deeply concerning for nuclear safety at Ukraine's nuclear power plants, as we saw last week when several reactors stopped operating because of damage to the energy infrastructure elsewhere in the country,"" Director General Grossi said.
""Ensuring that the sub-stations can operate normally for safety related purposes is also of paramount importance for energy security in Ukraine, as the country to a large extent relies on the nuclear power plants for much of its electricity generation,"" he said.
In Kyiv, Director General Grossi also agreed with President Zelensky that the IAEA will provide technical support and nuclear safety advice for Ukraine's plans to purchase equipment from the interrupted Bulgarian project in Belene for the Khmelnytskyy NPP. This will help Ukraine ensure that this ongoing project continues in accordance with safety standards."

Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan and Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema on Wednesday jointly witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the revitalization project of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) railway.
Hassan and Hichilema are in Beijing for the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), which is taking place from Wednesday to Friday.
While meeting with Tanzania's Hassan on Wednesday, President Xi said that China is willing to take the summit as an opportunity to push for new progress in the revitalization project of the TAZARA railway and jointly improve the rail-sea intermodal transport network in East Africa.
These efforts will help Tanzania become a demonstration zone for deepening high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between China and African countries, Xi said.
The revitalization of the TAZARA railway holds important symbolic significance - it is not only a historical testament to traditional China-Africa friendship but also a key project in promoting regional connectivity in Africa, Song Wei, a professor at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.
The 1,860-km single-track railway was constructed through an interest-free loan from China and started operation in 1976. It links Dar es Salaam in Tanzania with New Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia.
Song noted that the TAZARA railway has played a crucial role in transporting copper from Zambia to Tanzania for export overseas, significantly contributing to the economic development of both countries.
However, the railway has encountered poor management, aging infrastructure and reduced capacity over time, Song said.
China has discussed how to update the TAZARA railway and enhance its role in promoting Africa's development. With the signing of the MoU, the three countries can make further efforts in its revitalization, analysts said.
Some have proposed developing the TAZARA railway into a tourist project, which would not only attract visitors but also promote Africa's green economic development, providing new growth opportunities for local communities.
Song said the TAZARA railway could serve as a pilot to explore how to achieve sustainable operation after a project was handed overed to African countries.
In this way, the TAZARA railway could continue to serve as a bridge for China-Africa friendship while offering new momentum for Africa's economic development and China-Africa cooperation, Song said."
O5HIMHKTLL_8W5QG6WP0OIBYDL,Myanmar military court jails 144 villagers detained after massacre,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2024/myanmar-240902-rfa01.htm,"Junta troops suspect the villagers were helping Arakan Army insurgents closing in on the state capital.
By RFA Burmese 2024.09.02 -- Myanmar's junta jailed 144 civilians for supporting insurgents more than three months after they were detained following a massacre of nearly 80 people in their village, which residents blamed on junta troops, families of the detained told Radio Free Asia on Monday.
Relatives of the jailed residents of Byain Phyu in Rakhine state dismissed the convictions, denying they had supported Arakan Army insurgents, who have been making significant advances on the battlefield against the military.
""How can we support the AA when day to day we're struggling ourselves and hardly making ends meet?"" said a relative of one of those jailed on Friday under a law against unlawful association by a military court in the main prison in the western city of Sittwe.
""But the court didn't accept this and convicted them anyway.""
Byain Phyu is on the outskirts of Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state, and junta forces have been keen to ensure that AA fighters can not dig into positions there from which to attack the city.
Shortly after the May 29 killings, a junta spokesman said the military had conducted a clearance operation there and rebel forces had attacked with ""drone bombs and artillery"".
At the time, the military said it found bunkers built from sandbags in houses throughout the village, which it said were positions for AA soldiers.
The military detained some 300 villagers at the time. Only four people on trail on Friday were found not guilty, residents said, adding that more than 150 more were due to be tried by the court on Monday.
The AA has made unprecedented gains in fighting in Rakhine state since late last year, leaving junta forces increasingly confined to pockets of territory, including Sittwe.
A Sittwe resident, who also declined to be identified for safety reasons, said junta forces were enraged by their setbacks and were taking out their frustration on civilians.
""Sources close to the court told us before that only 38 people would be jailed and the rest would be released, but days before the verdict, the Sittwe-based Regional Command Headquarters was attacked with heavy weapons by the Arakan Army,"" he said.
""It seems as if the attack might have caused casualties, so they convicted  the villagers.""
Neither the junta's main spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, nor the Rakhine states junta spokesperson, Hla Thein, responded to attempts by RFA to contact them for information.
Byain Phyu is largely deserted now with nearly 2,000 of villagers sheltering in monasteries and schools in Sittwe, residents said, with junta troops deployed to prevent anyone returning.
In Sittwe, nervous junta soldiers are conducting many checks and detaining people, residents said.
The AA has also made gains in both the north and south of Rakhine state.

Sep 1, 2024
Tehran, IRNA -- The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas blamed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden for the deaths of captives in Gaza.
According to the Palestine Information Center, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau Izzat al-Rishq stressed on Sunday that the responsibility for the death of captives held by the resistance in Gaza lies with the Zionist regime's cabinet, which insists on keeping up the genocide and evading the ceasefire agreement, as well as the US administration because of its support for the Israeli regime and its participation in the war against the people of Gaza.
Al-Rishq went on to say that if President Biden cares about the lives of the captives, he should stop providing financial and military support to the Israeli regime and put pressure on the regime to stop the war immediately.
He argued that those who will pay the price for 11 months of brutal crimes and genocide against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip are Netanyahu, his hardline cabinet, and all the supporters of the war against Gaza.
The Hamas official holds the US administration and President Biden personally responsible for the daily crimes of the Israeli occupying regime and the genocide in Gaza, as a result of which more than 150,000 people have been martyred and injured, 69% of whom are women and children.
On Sunday morning, the regime's army announced the discovery of the bodies of six captives in Rafah, who were captured on October 7, 2023, during Operation Al-Aqsa Storm. The White House announced that one of the dead captives was an American.

Ukrainian officials said Wednesday a Russian air attack killed at least seven people and injured more than 60 others in the western city of Lviv, which Moscow had only infrequently targeted before and is hundreds of kilometers from the front battle line.
Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said in a video posted on Telegram that the attack destroyed a building and damaged more than 50 structures, including schools and homes.
Among the dead were four people from one family, a woman and her three daughters, leaving their father as the only immediate survivor.
""We will not forgive the enemy and will take revenge,"" Sadovyi said on Telegram. ""They will feel what hell is like while they are still alive.""
Russia has ramped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine since Kyiv launched an unprecedented cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk region nearly a month ago, the first foreign incursion into Russia since World War II.
Lviv, whose old town is a UNESCO world heritage site, is close to the border with Poland and is sheltering thousands of Ukrainians displaced by the 30-month war. The strike on Lviv came a day after a Russian missile attack killed 53 people in the central city of Poltava, one of the deadliest single strikes of the invasion.
Ukraine's air force said the attack on Lviv was part of a wider barrage of new strikes, with 13 missiles and 29 drones targeting the war-torn country. The air force said it intercepted seven of the missiles and 22 drones.
Wreckage from a downed missile fell on the central city of Kryvyi Rih, emergency services said, damaging a hotel and wounding six people.
Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called for more air defense systems and for long-range weapons to strike Russia in the wake of the attack. The weapons delivered by Ukraine's Western allies, including the United States and NATO members in Europe, often come with restrictions prohibiting their use against most targets located inside Russia.
In eastern Ukraine, Russia said it had captured the village of Karlivka, the latest in a string of territorial gains. Karlivka is about 30 kilometers from Pokrovsk, a major Russian target that lies on a key supply route for the Ukrainian army.
Ukrainian officials on Wednesday announced a new round of compulsory evacuations for children living in villages close to the front line in the region because of the deteriorating ""security situation.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin had said Monday that his army was making rapid advances in the Donbas that covers the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
""We have not had such a fast-paced offensive in the Donbas for a long time,"" he said.
Ukraine was also in the midst of a major government reshuffle on Wednesday, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks to boost confidence in his government.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba submitted his resignation, a day after six other officials including cabinet ministers said they were stepping down.
""We need new energy. And these steps are related to strengthening our state in various areas,"" Zelenskyy told journalists when asked about the changes.
Russian officials said Ukrainian attacks throughout Wednesday killed six people in territory it controls.
Ukrainian shelling killed three people in occupied east Ukraine, according to the Russian-installed Donetsk regional governor Denis Pushilin, and another three in a Russian border village in Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters."

While in Singapore, Minister Sikorski gave a lecture on Europe: Confronting 21st Century Imperialism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which is a renowned authority on global security, political risk, and military conflicts. In his speech, he mainly focused on the colonial and imperial nature of Russia's war against Ukraine.
In this context, he noted that the successes of Poland and Singapore would not be possible without a wider framework, based on the principles of international order which superseded the imperialist play of powers. By supporting Ukraine, we are also defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which may be beneficial for all of us.
As Minister Sikorski assessed, we all live in the neighbourhood of large, powerful, and sometimes unpredictable states with global ambitions. But to ensure the right to follow our own path, revisionist powers must be prevented from overthrowing the system based on international law. It may be flawed and outdated, but the answer to these weaknesses is reform, not war.
While in Singapore, Poland's top diplomat recalled that imperialism in Europe, South America, Africa, and here in Asia always rewarded the few and oppressed the many. In contrast, multilateralismâthough imperfectâis the only viable and just alternative for the global community."
OD2Z3TXVHK_DJ3IVO9PMZQ00KG,Netanyahu pushes back on pressure to reach cease-fire with Hamas,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240902-voa01.htm,"By VOA News September 02, 2024
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back Monday against calls to soften his demands for a cease-fire with Hamas after six hostages were found slain in southern Gaza.
""No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me. ... No one will preach to me on this issue,"" Netanyahu said, according to The Associated Press.
Among the sticking points in negotiations is Netanyahu's push for Israel to retain control of the Philadelphi Corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border. Israel claims Hamas uses tunnels along the corridor to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt and Hamas deny the claims.
On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Israelis marched in the streets to mourn the news that the bodies of six slain hostages were found in southern Gaza.
At a televised press conference on Monday, Netanyahu said he sought forgiveness for failing to save the slain hostages.
""I ask for your forgiveness for not bringing them back alive,"" he said. ""We were close, but we didn't succeed. Hamas will pay a very heavy price for this.""
Late Monday, several thousand demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu's private home in central Jerusalem, chanting, ""Deal. Now.""
Earlier Monday, a general workers' strike disrupted Israel as the largest Israeli trade union and businesses sought to pressure the government to reach a cease-fire deal with Hamas to end fighting in Gaza as the war nears the 11-month mark.
Banks, public transit, hospitals, stores and the country's main airport were either shuttered or open in limited ways. In some sectors, the strike's effects were less noticeable.
The work disruption ended after eight hours, in midafternoon, when a court ruled that the Histadrut union had not given enough notice for the protest.
Advocates for the hostages and critics of Netanyahu argued that a cease-fire to halt the war in Gaza could have saved the hostages' lives. But Netanyahu's partners in the Israeli government's ruling coalition mostly oppose a compromise with Hamas.
Netanyahu has refused to agree to a cease-fire deal calling for an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza that would lead to a permanent halt to the fighting â for fear that Hamas could rearm itself and endanger Israel's long-term security.
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out negotiations by issuing new demands, including that Israel remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor and a second corridor running across Gaza.
Hamas has held to the broad agreements of a three-phase plan put forth by the Biden administration in July: Hamas would release all hostages in return for an end to the war, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners.
In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden rebuked Netanyahu for his handling of the hostage situation and cease-fire negotiations.
As he arrived back at the White House after a vacation, Biden was asked whether he thought the Israeli leader was doing enough to free the 100 or so remaining hostages, a third of whom Israel believes are dead. Biden responded simply, ""No,"" but said he would have more to say after meeting with his security advisers.
Biden, who has closely followed the fate of the hostages, said Sunday he was ""devastated and outraged"" by the discovery of more dead captives.
""Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,"" he said in a statement.
Thousands of people gathered Monday at a large cemetery in Jerusalem for the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a dual Israeli American citizen who was one of the six hostages found dead Saturday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed remorse in a eulogy that Israel had failed to protect Goldberg-Polin from the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel or to bring him home alive.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, spoke Sunday with Goldberg-Polin's parents, Jon and Rachel, to express their condolences.
""My heart breaks for their pain and anguish,"" Harris said. ""I told them: As they mourn this terrible loss, they are not alone. Our nation mourns with them.""
The hostages were apparently shot to death by the militants just as troops were zeroing in on their location in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry said early Monday a forensic examination showed the hostages were killed by gunshots at close range, and within 48-72 hours before the examination.
Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages during the October 7 attack on southern Israel. The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Prime Minister, friends and colleagues,
Welcome to Russia and to Vladivostok.
Mr Prime Minister, I would like to begin by thanking you for accepting our invitation to come here and attend the Eastern Economic Forum. Tomorrow, we will take part in its plenary session, and I am certain that this will be a useful event for discussing our objectives in bringing the regional economies closer together. In fact, we have many guests here from dozens of countries, which means that you will be able to engage in useful contacts not only with your Russian colleagues, but also with colleagues from other countries.
Of course, I do hope that we will have an opportunity to explore ways to expand our cooperation as part of these efforts. Today, trade between our countries amounts to about $3.5 billion, which can hardly be considered a satisfactory result for us considering the potential we have. In fact, there are many opportunities on both sides.
As you know, Russia pays considerable attention to developing its relations with Southeast Asia and ASEAN. Malaysia plays a prominent role in this association, and will be assuming the chairmanship of ASEAN next year. We sincerely hope that during your chairmanship, we will be able to explore new opportunities for cooperation with this rapidly growing and promising region.
To conclude my opening remarks, I would like to congratulate you and the Malaysian leadership, as well as the entire nation on Independence Day, the national holiday you have celebrated recently. As far as I know, it is observed on August 31. I would like to use this opportunity to wish the people of Malaysia all the best, prosperity and wellbeing.
Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim: Thank you, President Putin. First of all, let me express on behalf of my delegation how pleased we are to be here in Vladivostok and in a great country, Russia, which we admire and follow very closely. First and foremost, this includes its literature and the great novelists, and then of course its strength: economic, technological and space.
I think that as a country that believes in centrality, engaging with all countries, we, of course, decided to come with a big team to show our sincere attempt to enhance our collaboration. There is enormous potential that you have in Russia. You have done so much. And it is to our benefit too, if you could share this and collaborate in all fields.
You have shown your determination to be able to undertake difficulties and survive. I think that we will certainly benefit from this experience. Of course, we in ASEAN too look forward for your participation. As you know, ASEAN is always engaged with Russia. We have open trade with a focus on semiconductors and some other related fields, and I look forward to working with you and your team. Even more so, Mr President, I agree with you - the potential is huge. We have not fully utilised ours.
During our initial discussions when we were preparing to come here - this was not an easy feat, but we took this decision - and I think that this was the right decision. We have decided to enhance in all fields with you, and I am certainly looking forward to better relations, personal and governmental collaboration in all fields. So I must take this opportunity to thank you personally for giving time in your busy schedule today.
We would, of course, look forward to an effective follow-up programme since the discussion must not end here. I can assure you that when I assume the chairmanship of ASEAN, we will make sure that my colleagues in ASEAN take the same position to enhance our collaboration with Russia.
Thank you."

The Israeli military has killed at least 11 Palestinians in an airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City as school carnage in the war-wracked territory continues apace.
The attack struck the Safad school in the Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City on Sunday, a medical source said.
The source added that the number of Gazans killed in the Israeli bombing of the school has increased from six to 11, noting that those who sustained injuries have been taken to the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.
The bodies of the killed people ""were torn apart and scattered due to the intensity of the Israeli bombing,"" witnesses told Anadolu news agency.
They added that one of the school's buildings, where hundreds of displaced people have sheltered, was destroyed.
The Palestinian Civil Defense Agency said that the school has been evacuated after Israeli threats to attack its premises.
Since the beginning of Israel's genocidal war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, the regime has systematically attacked civic infrastructure, including schools housing displaced people, hospitals and places of worship, often claiming without evidence they are linked to Hamas, to evade international criticism.
More than 100 citizens were killed and dozens more injured on August 10 after the Israeli occupation forces bombed the al-Tabi'in school in the al-Daraj neighborhood in Gaza City, sheltering over 6,000 displaced people.
At least 40,738 Palestinians, mostly children and women, have been killed and 94,154 people wounded in the war that Israel began in early October last year following a retaliatory operation by the Palestinian territory's resistance movements.
Concomitantly with the war, the regime has been enforcing a near-total siege on the coastal territory, which has reduced the flow of foodstuffs, medicine, electricity, and water into the Palestinian territory into a trickle."

Published 03 September 2024
The Government has approved SEK 2 million in support to the inhabitants of Gammalsvenskby in Ukraine. The village, which was founded by Swedes in 1782, has been under immense pressure since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The new support will be used to meet the inhabitants' immediate needs during the winter. The initiative also means that the village's children will have the opportunity to attend a summer camp on Gotland next year. The support is a first step in Sweden's commitment to rebuilding the village's cultural heritage in the long term.
Russia continued to bomb Gammalsvenskby during the summer. The people have had a very difficult time and historic buildings such as churches have burned to the ground. The village has been extremely hard hit by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has been on the front line for the past year and a half. More than 80 per cent of the village's buildings have been destroyed.
""Sweden has been a partner to the inhabitants of Gammalsvenskby for a long time and we continue to stand by the villagers' side. The new funds amounting to SEK 2 million will help support the inhabitants during the coming winter through measures for medicine, heating and electricity. We also intend to help the municipality and villages with reconstruction when the situation allows,"" says Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Johan Forssell.
The support will be used to develop a cultural environment plan for reconstruction and rural development, aimed at making the village an attractive place to visit and live in in the long term. The initiative also includes short-term support - this involves helping the villagers survive the winter through measures for medicine, heating and electricity, and giving Gammalsvenskby's children a break from the war by offering them the chance to attend a summer camp on Gotland next summer.
The support totals SEK 2 million in 2024 and 2025 and is channelled through the Gotland Museum, which works to preserve the Swedish-Ukrainian cultural heritage that is currently found both in Gammalsvenskby and on Gotland."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Poland wants to set a ""world record"" for military spending next year by ramping up procurement of weapons and military equipment, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Tuesday.
""Next year, 4.7% of Polish GDP will be allocated to defense. This will be the absolute record and a world record that Poland will set,"" he said on the margins of a defense industry exhibition in the Polish city of Kielce.
Poland has already earmarked a record-breaking 4.1% of gross domestic product for the military spending in the 2024 budget. Polish media reported in August that the government intended to hike military expenditure to nearly 5%.
Only five allies in 32-member NATO spend more than 3% on their military needs: Poland, Estonia, the United States, Latvia, and Greece. Two-thirds of NATO member states have met the alliance's requirement of spending at least 2% on defense.

Kazakhstan will hold a referendum on October 6 on whether to build a nuclear power plant, President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev announced on September 2.
Toqaev has argued the project is needed to diversify energy sources in Kazakhstan, which has abundant oil and natural gas reserves. It is also the world's leading producer of uranium, used to fuel nuclear power plants.
Kazakh Energy Minister Almassadam Satkaliyev has said the construction of a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan is the only way to meet a rising domestic power demand and carbon-neutrality goals.
Currently, Kazakhstan gets about 80 percent of its energy from coal-fired plants and another 15 percent is generated by hydropower, while the rest comes from renewable energy resources.
A single Russian nuclear power reactor operated from 1972 to 1999, generating electricity and desalinating water.
No exact site for the future nuclear power plant has been announced, although two have been mentioned as likely: at Ulken near Lake Balkash and at Kurchatov.
It's also unclear who would build the plant. In 2023, the Kazakh Energy Ministry said Russia's Rosatom was one of four contractors whose reactors were under consideration for the plant, with EDF of France, the China National Nuclear Corporation, and South Korea's Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power the other three.
The project has been met by much opposition. In recent weeks, several activists known for their stance against the nuclear power station's construction have been prevented from attending public debates on the issue.
Nuclear-power-related projects have been a controversial issue in Kazakhstan, where the environment was severely impacted by operations at the Soviet-era Semipalatinsk nuclear test site from 1949 to 1991 and the Baikonur spaceport, which is still being operated by Russia.

Two Ukrainian deputy prime ministers on September 3 tendered their resignations after three other ministers stepped down as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more changes to Ukraine's government were coming.
The two deputy ministers who resigned are Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olha Stefanishyna and Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk.
Speaker of the Parliament Ruslan Stefanchuk said the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) had received separate statements from Stefanishyna and Vereshchuk saying they had decided to resign.
""After almost three years in the government, I submitted my resignation today,"" Vereshchuk said. She thanked Zelenskiy for his confidence in her and expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and colleagues in the government for their cooperation.
Stefanchuk said the statements of Stefanishyna and Vereshchuk had been received and ""will be considered at one of the nearest plenary sessions.""
Their resignations came hours after Strategic Industries Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin, Justice Minister Denys Maliuska, and Environment Minister Ruslan Strilets resigned. Kamyshin, who oversees domestic arms production, said he would continue working in the defense sector but in a different role.
Zelenskiy noted in his evening address that state institutions should be configured so that Ukraine can achieve the best results.
""That is why there will be a number of personnel changes in the cabinet of ministers and the office of the president,"" he said, indicating that the changes would be coming in the fall.
He said the changes would result in slightly different weight given to individual areas of foreign and domestic policy.
Ukraine needs more interaction between the central government and communities, especially during preparation for the winter season, he said.
Secondly, Ukraine has already achieved significant results in defense production, Zelenskiy said, indicating the reason for the change in Kamyshin's role.

Tehran, IRNA -- Two people have been martyred as a result of a drone attack by the Israeli regime's army on a car in southern Lebanon.
According to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, the Zionist regime targeted the vehicle in the city of Naqoura on Monday morning, killing at least two people.
Earlier in the day, Lebanese news website Al Ahed reported an Israeli airstrike on the town of Blida, also in southern Lebanon. No casualties were reported.
The Zionist regime claimed that the attack in Blida was carried out in response to the firing of 20 rockets from southern Lebanon towards its settlements in the north.
Meanwhile, Hezbollah announced in a statement that its fighters had directly targeted the location of Unit 8200, which is an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit, in Metat barracks.
Following the onset of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm by the Palestinian resistance groups on October 7, Hezbollah has been carrying out military operations against the regime's positions on a daily basis in order to engage Zionist forces in the north and to reduce pressure on the resistance in Gaza.
As a result of Hezbollah's strikes, a large number of Zionist settlers have been forced to leave their settlements, and most of the residents in the northern areas suffer from psychological problems.

Taipei, Sept. 3 (CNA) Taiwan's government intends to help the international community better understand United Nations Resolution 2758 this year so that Beijing can no longer misuse it to exclude Taiwan from the U.N. system, a senior Taiwanese diplomat said Tuesday.
Speaking during a press event announcing this year's strategy in pushing for Taiwan's inclusion at the U.N., Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang (ç°ä¸­å) said that Taiwan will again invite diplomatic allies to speak up for the country during the upcoming U.N. General Debate, as has been the country's approach since 1993.
Taiwan will also again ask these allies' permanent representatives to the U.N. to submit a joint letter to U.N. Secretary-General AntÏnio Guterres urging him to rectify the U.N.'s ""erroneous interpretation of Resolution 2758.""
Resolution 2758 was adopted by the 26th U.N. General Assembly in 1971 to address the issue of China's representation at the international body.
It resulted in Taiwan, officially named the Republic of China (ROC), losing its seat at the U.N. to the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan has since been excluded from participating in the international organization and its affiliates.
Repeating MOFA's argument, Tien said Resolution 2758 only addresses the issue of China's representation at the U.N. and does not mention Taiwan at all.
""The resolution does not authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the U.N. system, nor does it mention that Taiwan is part of the PRC,"" he explained.
The government is thus calling on the U.N. to actively stop China from undermining Taiwan's participation in international organizations by distorting the meaning of Resolution 2758.
Taiwan will also call on the U.N. to find ways to allow Taiwan to participate in its meetings so that the country can contribute to U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, Tien said.
Moreover, the U.N. should ""uphold neutrality"" and ""stop misusing"" Resolution 2758 as a pretense to prevent Taiwan passport holders from entering U.N. facilities, he added.
Asked why Taiwan is focused on explaining Resolution 2758 this year, Tien said that Nauru cited the resolution when it broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan earlier this year. The island country in Micronesia said its decision was made ""on the grounds of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and the 'one China principle.'""
Tien argued that if Taiwan does not clarify U.N. member states' understanding of the resolution soon, ""the cross-strait status quo that neither Taiwan nor the PRC is subordinate to the other will be overturned by the PRC.""
The PRC will likely continue to distort the resolution before ultimately using it as a legal pretense to use force against Taiwan by labeling cross-strait issue as an domestic dispute, he added.
Meanwhile, in support of Taiwan's participation in the global body, Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung (æä½³é¾) promoted an article titled ""To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system.""
The 79th session of the U.N. General Assembly will open on Sept. 10 and conclude on Sept. 30.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg refused on Saturday to admit that Ukraine had coordinated its attack on the western Russian region of Kursk with the allies, despite Russia's claims to the contrary.
""Ukraine did not discuss its planning of the Kursk offensive with NATO in advance. In this respect, NATO played no role,"" Stoltenberg said in an interview to German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
Stoltenberg argued that the choice of methods to defend itself lied with Ukraine and that its right to self-defense did not end at the internationally recognized Russian border.
Russian presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev said Ukraine would not have risked an incursion into Russia without a go-ahead from NATO and Western intelligence agencies. NATO countries have funneled weapons and military instructors to Ukraine and are providing intelligence and controlling Ukrainian actions, he added.
Early on August 6, Ukrainian forces crossed the border into Russia and launched an offensive in the Kursk Region. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the move a large-scale provocation that aimed at civilians and vowed a proper response.
The Russian Defense Ministry said on August 31 that Ukrainian troops had lost over 8,200 servicemen and 76 tanks in the offensive.

Tehran, IRNA -- The continuation of the Israeli regime's aggression on the Gaza Strip led to the martyrdom of 34 Palestinians in the besieged area during the past hours.
According to Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV network, the Zionist occupying forces heavily bombarded the Al-Zeitoun district in the Gaza Strip by using helicopters, drones and other military equipment.
The Israeli regime also targeted the southern areas of Al-Zeitoun neighborhood with artillery strikes and destroyed several residential buildings.
Nine people were killed and more than 10 were wounded in just one of such attacks on a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza.
Al Jazeera TV channel also reported that 34 Palestinians have been martyred in different parts of Gaza since early Saturday morning.
On Thursday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza announced in its latest statistics that the occupying regime committed four massacres in the past 24 hours, resulting in martyrdom of 68 people and the injury of 77 others.
According to the ministry, 40,602 Palestinians have been martyred and 93,855 wounded since the onset of the genocidal war on Gaza since October 7, 2023.
About 11 months into the war, fierce clashes are ongoing between the occupation troops and resistance fighters in various areas of the Gaza Strip.
This war, which was launched by the Israeli regime with the declared objectives of annihilating the Hamas movement and returning the Zionist captives, has not yet achieved any of these goals.

Special Briefing  Brian A. Nichols, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs  Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs  Via Teleconference  September 4, 2024
MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us today. This is an on-the-record press briefing with Assistant Secretary Brian Nichols about Secretary Blinken's forthcoming travel. This briefing is embargoed until the travel is publicly announced by the department, which is expected to occur later this afternoon. If you would like to ask a question, please use the raise your hand function, and we'll get to as many as we can. Assistant Secretary, I'll turn it to you for any remarks you want to make at the top before we get to questions.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Great. Thank you, and being here today to preview Secretary Blinken travel to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. During this trip, the Secretary will meet with Haitian and Dominican partners to discuss a range of priorities. On September 5th, the Secretary will travel to Port-au-Prince to meet with Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille and the Transitional Presidential Council. The Secretary will reaffirm the United States commitment to supporting the Haitian people and fostering a secure and peaceful Haiti. The Secretary, Prime Minister Conille, and the Transitional Presidential Council will also discuss Haiti's return to a democratic path and the urgent need for elections so the Haitian people can determine their own future.
We have seen Haiti take important steps forward in the last few months. In addition to the Transitional Presidential Council's appointment of the prime minister and designation of ministers of his cabinet, we have seen tangible signs of progress on the ground, including the opening of the airport and resumption of commercial flights, increased economic activity and movement in pockets of Port-au-Prince, and the deployment of the UN-authorized, Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission, which is working in close partnership with the Haitian National Police. With increased international support for both the MSS and the Haitian National Police, we are seeing a dramatic increase in patrols and operations designed to restore security and a sense of normalcy in Haiti. While in Haiti, Secretary Blinken will meet with the head of the MSS and the Haitian National Police and underscore the United States continued commitment to their success. We will also discuss Haiti's broader stabilization, development, and humanitarian needs.
Following his visit to Haiti, the Secretary will travel to the Dominican Republic. He will meet with President Luis Abinader to reaffirm our strong, multidimensional partnership and discuss three main priorities: strengthening our economic ties, including through the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity; advancing our shared values of freedom, democracy, and respect for human and labor rights; and promoting increased security in the region, particularly in Haiti. The Secretary and President Abinader will also discuss The 2025 Summit of the Americas, which the Dominican Republic will host. We look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Conille and President Abinader in the coming days to discuss these critical issues.
In Haiti, our goal is to recognize the positive progress made towards improving security and encourage efforts to appoint the provisional electoral council so Haiti can move toward elections. In the Dominican Republic, we will reinforce our shared priorities, such as promoting democratic governance, supporting free and fair elections in the region, and fighting corruption.
Thanks very much, and happy to take any questions.
MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Again, if you would like to ask a question, please use the raise your hand function. Our first question is going to be from Jennifer Hensler with CNN.
QUESTION: Hi. Thanks so much for doing this, Brian. I just wanted to get a better sense of why the Secretary felt it was important to take this trip now, and if you could give any specific details on anything he plans to announce. And then secondly, can you confirm reports that the U.S. is looking into transferring the MSS to a traditional UN peacekeeping force under those auspices? Thank you.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: So this is a crucial moment in Haiti, and I think - when we had the opportunity to go to Haiti with Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield to see sort of the beginning of the deployment of the MSS, to see the equipment that's on the ground, to see that base. and now that more than 30 MRAPs have been delivered, other equipment, the increased rhythm of operations, we're seeing that forward movement on the security side that we've long waited for. But we also need to see progress on the political side, and engaging the Transitional Presidential Council, the prime minister, and Haiti's political parties is a priority for the Secretary to make sure that progress towards elections moves forward.
With regard to the nature of the mission in Haiti, our goal is to have a mission that is effective, strong, able to deliver the kind of security progress that the Haitian people deserve - and we're working with our international partners to do that - and setting up a structure that ensures a reliable source of financing and staffing for that mission is a priority. A formal PKO is one of the ways that we could accomplish that, but we're looking at multiple ways to do that.
MODERATOR: Wonderful. Our next question is from Daphne from Reuters.
Do you have a question?
QUESTION: Are you able to hear me?
MODERATOR: Yes, we can hear you now.
QUESTION: Okay, sorry. Not sure what happened. Thank you for doing this. I wanted to ask about the 360 million that's been promised for the MSS. How much of that has been disbursed so far, and who has it been paid to?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: So the United States has provided over - through the Department of Defense - over $200 million for the construction and operation of the logistics support area, the base where the MSS is. And that has - that has been provided to the contractors who constructed and operate the base. And through the Department of State, we have provided over $50 million, I think, in equipment and support for the operations of the MSS in different ways on the ground. The assistance that we're providing also includes over $60 million in drawdown authority for support to the MSS. So drawdown authority is the ability to take things out of government stocks and provide them to the MSS, and we've provided all sorts of things - radios, tents, computers, night vision devices. So all those things are - UAVs, all sorts of things that are in process of delivery; some have already been delivered, and others are still pending. So that's broadly where that money has gone.
MODERATOR: Our next question is from Nick Schifrin from PBS.
QUESTION: Hi, Brian. Thanks very much. You paint a pretty positive picture of some improvements that you've seen, especially in Port-au-Prince, but Garry Conille gave an interview yesterday in which he says, ""The situation is the worst I've seen in my... lifetime."" He talks about delays in manpower and funding that you'll know very well - only 400 Kenyan troops, most of the 600 million hasn't arrived yet, and he's seeking Blinken's help to rally more aid. I'm wondering if you agree with his overall characterization of the situation.
And we saw a high-profile announcement yesterday of corruption charges against some high-ranking officials for illicit enrichment, abuse of office, et cetera. I'm wondering if you could react to that announcement, please. Thanks.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Well, I think if you look at the situation over the course of 2024, let's remember how difficult things were. I mean, we had a situation where the airport was closed and under fire. Former Prime Minister Ariel Henry couldn't return to the country because security was so bad. We were wondering if at one point Guy Philippe was announcing his march into Port-au-Prince to take over the government.
So we have come a long way since those very dark moments. The fact that we have joint operations by the MSS, the Haitian National Police, and the Haitian Army in neighborhoods like Bel Air, Fort National, Delmas, going after gangs and their leaders in a way that hasn't happened in years, from a security standpoint that is a major step forward. The - both the Haitian National Police and the MSS have recently received armored vehicles and equipment that'll allow them to more aggressively prosecute these operations, and that's an important step forward.
The United States, Canada, and a few other donors have made important contributions to the MSS UN trust fund to support these efforts. Nonetheless, we need the rest of the international community to step forward with much more significant financial contributions so that the force can continue to operate, and that additional nations can deploy their units as part of the MSS. The prime minister is rightly concerned about the future, but I think we have come quite a long way since the beginning of the year.
With regard to the corruption allegations involving - I think you're referring to the ones involving members of the Transitional Presidential Council, we certainly believe that Haitian authorities should investigate those and determine the substance of what happened and take appropriate actions to hold anyone who's responsible for corrupt acts accountable. The Haitian people deserve transparency and good governance, and the international community, which provides so much assistance, also needs to see that to have the confidence that funds that flow through the Haitian Government are used appropriately and transparently.
MODERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Nike Ching from VOA.
QUESTION: Good morning, Brian. Thank you very much for this phone briefing. First question: This is Secretary Blinken's first trip to both Caribbean countries as Secretary of State, correct? And then secondly, just to follow up with Nick's question, with about one month remaining in the mandate of MSS, how concerned is the U.S. about the slow deployment and some of the unfulfilled pledges, especially as the U.S. is the top funder of the MSS?
And then finally, regarding the Open Skies Agreement between the United States and the Dominican Republic signed on August 2nd, will the Open Skies Agreement come into effect during Secretary Blinken's visit to the country to exchange the diplomatic notes? Thank you very much.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: So Secretary Blinken has traveled to the Caribbean previously. He went to Port of Spain and he also traveled to Georgetown, Guyana. The Secretary has met with Caribbean - oh, and Jamaica earlier this year. So he's made several trips to the region and he's met with Caribbean leaders in Washington as well as on the margins of the OAS General Assembly in Peru. So he's had a number of engagements with Caribbean leaders as well as meeting leaders and foreign ministers here in Washington during their visits, and our relations with the Caribbean are a big priority for the Secretary as well as the rest of our government from President Biden on down.
The - with regard to the Open Skies Agreement, I will have to get back to you on when that will enter into force, but it's - we know it's a big step forward and we hope that it will provide more reliable and more economical travel between the United States and the Dominican Republic going forward.
QUESTION: How about the concerns about the MSS slow deployment and some of the pledges?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Well, the - the MSS is - just in the course of the last few days has begun much more active operations, and we hope that the deployment of additional MSS force members from a number of other countries will take place in the very near future. But in order for the operation to succeed, we need to ensure the international community provides the financial resources in addition to the manpower and equipment that the force needs to deploy, and we have been tireless in pressing others in the international community to make significant contributions to the UN MSS trust fund or to contribute people or materiel to the force, and we will continue to press for that. The one-year anniversary of the mission is October 2nd, and we're going to work to ensure that it is poised for success and a renewal of its mandate in whatever form that takes going forward.
MODERATOR: Our next question is from Jacqueline Charles with the Miami Herald. Jacqueline?
QUESTION: Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: We hear you.
QUESTION: Good morning. Fine. Thanks for doing this. A couple of questions for you. The bribery scandal - just yesterday the members of the CPT tried to take measures against the three who were accused, but because it comes down to 4-3, they couldn't do it. So everyone is wondering whether or not Secretary Blinken will raise this issue to try and get some - some sort of decision or progress on this since we know that investigations in Haiti take a long time. Secondly, humanitarian corridor - the Secretary will be using the humanitarian corridor as he travels between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The skies have been shut down to Haitians for several months now, and we're wondering whether or not he will be raising this issue with the Dominican Republic in terms of the fact that there's no commercial traffic between the two.
And then third, I just came back. The Kenyan force commander says that they have been in this sort of deployment phase, but Haitians are frustrated because they haven't seen any big gang leaders arrested or killed. And what we've seen is that communities on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince have suffered increased attacks. So we're just wondering whether or not this push for a UN peacekeeping mission you think would be more successful in addressing the long-term security issues.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Well, thanks. That's a lot there. I think certainly the Secretary will raise the importance of transparency, rule of law in dealing with the corruption allegations in - that have come to light in the BNC case. We believe that Haitian officials should investigate this and hold those responsible to account, and I'm sure that the Secretary will raise this issue while he's there.
The - with regard to the progress thus far, this week we've seen the arrival of the - of the last of the MRAPS that are coming in this tranche, which provides the force with sufficient vehicles, heavily armored vehicles, that they can carry out operations. Similarly, the provisions for the Haitian National Police have really now postured those forces to be able to carry out significant operations safely. And we want to make sure that every element that the force needs, they have, to be able to do their job safely and effectively to bring those responsible for crimes to justice while safeguarding the general population, respecting human rights, and strengthening broader Haitian institutions. Those were all important steps.
I think you've seen - you've been on the ground. I hope you got a chance to see all of the equipment that's there, the work that's being done. It's quite impressive. The - sort of the final point I think you raised on air travel and movement between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, we certainly hope to see more normal relations between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The countries are inexorably linked. And we certainly will have those conversations with leaders on both sides of the border, and we're very cognizant of the fact that the Dominican Republic is providing significant assistance to Haiti and to the MSS, and that we more broadly hope to see the ties between the two countries operated in a normal fashion in the future. But obviously, those are sovereign decisions for both governments. And to the extent that we can facilitate those conversations, we will.
MODERATOR: Our next question is with Anton La Guardia from The Economist.
QUESTION: Thank you very much. Can you hear me?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Yes. Hear you loud and clear.
QUESTION: Thank you very much, Brian, for making the time. Can I just ask you to clarify a couple of points. How many MSS personnel are deployed? Just picking up the question about the slow pace of deployment right now. I've seen a figure of 400, which is way below the 2,500 number that was supposed to be there. And also, are you able to confirm reports that the Kenyan police have not been paid for two months? And third, you spoke about the need to investigate and prosecute corruption and bribery and so on, but as I understand it, many of the prisons have been destroyed. So are there - is there a problem with the general administration of justice question? How do you resolve that?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: So keep in mind that while Kenya is the lead nation for the force, we expect other countries to make contributions and ensuring that all the equipment, training, human rights vetting is in place before some of the other countries deploy is something we've been focused on. There are a number of other countries that are in the process of preparing for deployment, including Caribbean countries, South American countries, Central American countries that are - will make different contributions to the force.
But yeah, right now there are approximately 400 Kenyans who are deployed there - a little bit less than 400. The - and we expect those deployments ideally to take place in the very near future. The - you note the overall ceiling. Yes, the ceiling is higher, but we want to make sure that the force is effective and grows in a sustainable way and that all of the things that they need to succeed are in place before we grow above the force numbers that we're seeing now.
The - and then just in terms of our longer-term approach, we want to make sure that this operation is sustainable to get Haiti through an electoral process and for the Haitian National Police to grow to the level that it's able to take responsibility for Haiti's security, and that's going to take some time.
MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Danica Coto with the AP. Danica?
QUESTION: Good morning. Can you hear me?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: Yes.
MODERATOR: Yes, we can.
QUESTION: Great. Well, thank you for hosting this. What would a PKO provide that the current mission doesn't, and how likely is it that such an operation would happen? And aside from the PKO, what other options are there?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY NICHOLS: So you - a key challenge is a sustainable funding and infrastructure - administrative infrastructure to support the deployment. And a PKO means that you have an assessed contribution to fund the deployment. Right now, the deployment depends on voluntary contributions. The United States and then Canada have made the largest contributions to the force. The - both direct contributions as well as in-kind, as well as equipment, and then contributions to the trust fund that does things like provide the - some other day-to-day costs for the force.
The - there are different varieties of assessed missions. So there could be an assessed mission where the funding is secured, but the actual operation of this mission is very, very similar to what it is now or there's a more traditional peacekeeping operation of the types that we've seen in many different countries around the world, including Haiti. But our challenge going forward is to make sure that there's a reliable, sustainable source of funding for the MSS to take it through stabilization, elections, and the growth of the Haitian National Police. We'll be working and coordinating with our partners around the world, and particularly in the Security Council and in the region, to figure out how we best address that going forward.
MODERATOR: Thank you very much. That is all the time we have for questions today. We appreciate you joining this call. As a final reminder, this briefing is embargoed until the travel is publicly announced by the department, which is expected later this afternoon. Thank you very much."

By RFA Staff 2024.09.04 -- Japan's defense ministry has released its annual white paper for 2024, warning that the Asia-Pacific region is facing ""the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II.""
Days before, the ministry requested a record budget of 8.5 trillion yen (US$59 billion) for the next year to boost deterrence.
The English version of the 572-page white paper, which sets out Tokyo's defense plan, was made public on Tuesday.
In the report ""Defense of Japan 2024,"" Minister of Defense Minoru Kihara wrote that the international community had entered ""a new era of crisis"" and was facing ""the greatest trial"" since World War II.
Kihara singled out China, which has been building up military strength while intensifying activities in the East China Sea and the Pacific, as one of the greatest strategic challenges to Japan, alongside North Korea and Russia.
The ministry assessed that China had been ""intensifying changes to the status quo by force"" in the entire region around Japan, including in the East China and South China Sea.
Japan fears that an armed conflict over Taiwan, which China considers a province that must be reunited with the mainland, would spill over to Japan. Tokyo has been deploying more troops and military equipment to its outlying islands close to Taiwan.
Japan's defense policy is to continue building up capabilities, especially so-called stand-off defense, or responding from outside the threat zone, using integrated air and missile systems, and to strengthen cooperation with allies and partners.
""The alliance with the United States is a key pillar of Japan's national security policy,"" the ministry said in the white paper, noting that both Japan and the United States are ""in agreement that the highest priority is ... to prevent unilateral changes to the status quo by force,"" a reference to China and Russia without naming them.
China has reacted angrily to the white paper, saying it uses China as a pretext to mislead the Japanese public, as well as the international community, and to justify Japan's  military expansion, according to media reports.
Record defense budget
Japan's defense ministry on Friday requested a record  budget of nearly US$60 billion for 2025, mainly to fortify its southwestern islands against the threats from China, the Associated Press reported.
The money would be spent on developing and acquiring new drones, missiles, satellites, cyber defense and cloud-based command and control systems.
The budget has grown through the years. It was 6.6 trillion yen ($45.5 billion) in 2023 and is projected to reach 7.7 trillion yen ($53 billion) in 2024, according to the  defense ministry.
Tokyo is expected to double its annual military spending to about 10 trillion yen ($68.9 billion) by 2027, becoming the world's third largest military spender after the U.S. and China, AP reported.
While the request must go through the ministry of finance, which will likely reduce it before making a decision in December, China has already criticized it.
China's Global Times quoted experts as saying that Japan's continuous increase of military spending reflected its ""militarism resurgence"" and the ambition to expand its military presence in the region.
Japan's aggression before and during World War II is deeply resented in parts of Asia, in particular China and South Korea.

Q2C1ZMSBMV_ZU4X8YVGGA5LZDK,German far-right surge raises doubts about Berlin's support for Ukraine,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240903-voa02.htm,"By Henry Ridgwell September 03, 2024
The future of German military aid to Ukraine and support for Ukrainian refugees in Germany are being called into question after a surge in support saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party emerge victorious Sunday in elections in the state of Thuringia.
The AfD won with 32.8% of the vote, ahead of the Christian Democrats with 23.6%. The newly formed far-left BSW party was in third place with 15.8%. The AfD came in second in the neighboring state of Saxony, just behind the Christian Democrats.
BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, the AfD leader in Thuringia, said it was a ""historic victory.""
""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win. And today, dear friends, we have won!"" HÃ¶cke told cheering supporters Monday in the eastern town of Erfurt.
It's the first state victory for Germany's far right since World War II.
Rival parties, however, have vowed not to work in coalition with the AfD, meaning complex coalition talks could lie ahead for control of the state legislature.
Although widely predicted, the results have shocked many of Germany's allies - not least Ukraine. Germany is Ukraine's second-biggest donor of military aid, behind the United States. That is now in doubt, said Mattia Nelles, co-founder of the German-Ukrainian Bureau, a political consultancy based in DÃ¼sseldorf.
""Both the far-right and the far-left populist forces were campaigning on cutting German aid for Ukraine, and they were explicitly calling for a reduction in military aid,"" Nelles told VOA. ""They called on the government to finally pressure Ukrainians to start negotiating with Russia. They were for pressuring Ukraine into submission. And that is very unfortunate for Ukraine to have these very vocal forces gaining traction in these regional elections.""
In the short term, Nelles said the state election results won't affect the federal government's funding of aid to Ukraine, ""but you already see a slight change in the rhetoric of the centrist parties [toward Ukraine]. We have four centrist parties, and some of them already took some of the narratives or the frames that the populist and far-right parties were using,"" he added.
Germany is set to hold nationwide federal elections next year.
Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the liberal Free Democratic party - part of the ruling coalition - is pushing for aid to Ukraine to be halved in the next budget. His party gained less than 5% in the Thuringia state election and fears a repeat in the 2025 federal elections, noted analyst Liana Fix of the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.
""[They] are afraid that they will not get into parliament, which has happened already once before, that they were not able to cross the 5% threshold for the German parliament. So it's really a sort of a fight, a battle for political survival, especially for the liberals who are pushing for this agenda of cutting the budget for Ukraine,"" Fix said.
Immigration was a major issue driving votes for the far right, with much rhetoric directed at non-European, and especially Muslim, migrants. Germany, however, is also hosting more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees - and the financial cost was under the spotlight during the state election campaigns of both the far right and far left, said analyst Nelles.
""They were both - though on separate notes, different tonalities - campaigning on lesser aid or cutting of aid for Ukrainian refugees in Germany. The question whether and how they should be funded and whether they should be drafted or sent to Ukraine - that is a delicate issue,"" Nelles said.
""We have males, Ukrainian males, that are legally eligible for the draft. So, there is growing pressure also on the male Ukrainian refugee population in Germany to push them back to Ukraine,"" he added. ""Germany is unable for good reasons to send males back to Ukraine. But the pressure on the government to do so is growing.""
The federal government has given no indication that it intends to cut support for Ukrainian refugees or send them back to Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said last month that Berlin would support Kyiv with military aid ""as long as necessary.""
Scholz's Social Democrat Party highlighted Monday that German intelligence services had classified the AfD as an extremist party and said its victory in Thuringia must act as a ""wake-up call."""

CAIRO (Sputnik) - At least 89 people have been killed and another 205 injured in Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip in the past two days, the enclave's health ministry said on Saturday.
""Over the past 48 hours, the Israeli occupation forces have committed five mass murders of families in the Gaza Strip. Eighty-nine dead and 205 injured have been admitted to hospitals,"" the ministry said.
This brings the Palestinian death toll in Gaza up to 40,691, with more than 94,000 others injured since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel estimated that some 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others taken hostage in the onslaught.
In response, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Iron Swords in the Gaza Strip. Israel declared a total blockade of the enclave, cutting the supply of water, electricity, fuel, food, and medicines to the besieged enclave.

Taipei, Sept. 2 (CNA) Taiwan should prepare to coordinate joint operations with the United States in case a cross-strait conflict arises, Shen Ming-shih (æ²æå®¤), a research fellow at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), has suggested.
At an academic forum held in Taipei on Sunday, Shen said that the U.S. could assist Taiwan in different ways amid a cross-strait conflict and that Taiwan must prepare for every scenario.
In terms of the extent of the intervention, the U.S. may solely provide weaponry and intelligence, dispatch the navy and air force, or dispatch large-scale ground troops to Taiwan, said the security expert.
Shen said the most significant form of assistance would be an alliance mode, which would especially require prior coordination, integration of command, related training and logistics planning.
The U.S. is currently assisting Taiwan under a ""quasi-alliance mode"" based on the Taiwan Relations Act, in which it sells weapons, provides military financing and helps with military training, Shen pointed out.
While the U.S. has no diplomatic relations or mutual defense agreements with Taiwan, Shen said it is ""highly likely"" the two countries would form an alliance because of Taiwan's strategic importance.
For example, Shen said, although Ukraine is not a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the U.S. and NATO provided military support to the eastern European country even before the full-scale Russia-Ukraine War broke out due to geopolitical concerns.
Huang Chung-ting (é»å®é¼), an associate research fellow at INDSR, a government-funded think tank, said Taiwan needs to inspect the ""future progressive tense"" of the cooperative relationship between Taiwan and the U.S.
If Taiwan sees the U.S. dispatching troops as an option, it should sign a ""Visiting Forces Agreement"" or a ""Reciprocal Access Agreement"" with the U.S. in advance as a legal basis, he added.
Shen and Huang were speaking at the academic forum titled ""Defending Freedom and Democracy in the Western Pacific Region: from the Mutual Defense Treaty to the Taiwan Relations Act,"" hosted by the Taiwan Association of University Professors.
The forum invited seven experts and scholars to discuss the relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan, from perspectives such as defense, history and current affairs.

On the morning of September 3, 2024, President Xi Jinping met with Kenyan President William Ruto, who is in China for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperationâ(FOCAC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
Xi Jinping pointed out that China and Kenya have a time-honoredâfriendship that developed in their strugglesâfor national liberation and deepened on their journey toward national rejuvenation.âChina and Kenya have always joined hands and been at the forefront of Belt and Road cooperation,âand completed a number of flagship projectsâin connectivity, significantly contributing to regional economic and social development and benefiting the two peoples.
Xi Jinping suggested that the two sides should deepen theâChina-Kenyaâcomprehensive strategic cooperative partnershipâby pursuing the goal of becoming ""three types of partners"". First, the two sides shouldâcarry forward friendshipâandâbe sincere partners of mutual trust. The two sides shouldâfirmly support each other in safeguarding national sovereignty and independently exploring development paths suited to their national conditions. Second, the two sides should uphold fundamental principles whileâbreakingânew ground, and be cooperative partners of mutual benefit and win-win results. The two sides shouldâclosely synergize the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with Kenya Vision 2030, build an East African connectivity hub and industrial belt, and strengthen cooperation in such areas as digital economy, new energy, economy, trade, poverty reduction and agricultureâdevelopment. Third, the two sides should strengthen confidenceâand be strategic partners in upholding fairnessâand justice. The two sides shouldâenhanceâcommunication and coordination on international and regional issues, work together to safeguard the common interests of the Global South,âand promote regional peace and stability.
William Rutoâthanked China for hosting the FOCAC Beijing Summit, which provides an important platform and opportunity for Africa and China to seek common development in the future.âKenya-China relations are based on deep friendship, mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual benefit.âThe two sides have successfully implemented major infrastructureâconstruction cooperationâprojects such as the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, which has strongly promoted Kenya's economic and social development and become a new symbolâfor Kenya-Chinaâfriendly and mutually beneficial cooperation.âKenya hopes to take theâFOCAC Summit as an opportunity to push for further development of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between Kenya and China.âChina is welcome to continue to increase investment in Kenya and expand bilateral practical cooperation in various fields, especially cooperation in connectivity, new energy,âyouthâand other areas.âKenya highly admires and actively supports a series of major global initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping that have played an important leading role in strengthening solidarity and cooperation amongâdeveloping countries and countries of the Global South.âKenya firmly pursuesâthe one-China policy andâis readyâtoâstrengthen multilateral cooperation with China andârenderâfirm supportâto each other.
During the summit, China and Kenya will sign a number of bilateral cooperation documents in financing, infrastructure and other fields.
Wang Yi was present at the meeting."

Sept. 2, 2024  Release Number 202400902 - 01  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TAMPA, Fla -- U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces, partnered with Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), captured an ISIS leader, who was assessed as helping ISIS fighters after escape from a Raqqah Detention Facility in Syria.
During the early morning hours of Sept. 1, CENTCOM forces and SDF captured Khaled Ahmed al-Dandal, an ISIS facilitator assessed to be aiding efforts of detained ISIS fighters to include recently escaped fighters.
Previously, on Aug. 29, five ISIS Foreign Terrorist Fighter detainees (Two Russians, two Afghans, and one Libyan) escaped from the Raqqah Detention Facility. SDF recaptured two escapees: Imam Abdulwahed Akhwan (Russian) and Muhammad Noh Muhammad (Libyan). The search continues for the three who remain at large: Timor Talbrken Abdash (Russian) and Shuab Muhammad Al-Abdli and Atal Khaled Zar (both Afghans).
A primary objective of ISIS remains to free their fighters currently held in detention and subsequently fuel an ISIS revival. CENTCOM forces, in coordination with SDF, will continue to mitigate threats of future escapes and to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.
""Over 9,000 ISIS detainees remain in over 20 SDF detention facilities in Syria, a literal and figurative 'ISIS Army' in detention. If a large number of these ISIS fighters escaped, it would pose an extreme danger to the region and beyond. We will continue to work with the international community to repatriate these ISIS fighters to their countries of origin for final adjudication,"" said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, Commander, U.S. Central Command.
CENTCOM remains committed to supporting our SDF partners to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and to promote regional stability."

Beijing, September 4, 2024
Your Excellency President Bassirou Diomaye Faye,  Distinguished Colleagues and Your Spouses,  Friends and Distinguished Guests,
Good evening!
It is my great pleasure to meet you here on the eve of the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in the name of my wife and myself, I extend a warm welcome to you all.
To quote a Chinese poem, ""True friends always feel close to each other, no matter the distance between them."" I have been to Africa 10 times and hosted many African leaders in China. All our meetings have been cordial and heartwarming. They have reinforced my belief that the China-Africa community with a shared future is built on a strong foundation, has been blessed with a good start, and enjoys broad prospects. It sets a stellar example for building a community with a shared future for mankind.
The China-Africa community with a shared future is deeply rooted in our traditional friendship. Since the mid-20th century, we have been fighting shoulder to shoulder imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism, and advancing hand in hand along the path of development, revitalization, and modernization. China-Africa friendship remains robust and is growing stronger through generations no matter how the world changes.
The China-Africa community with a shared future thrives on the strength of win-win cooperation. Twenty-four years ago, FOCAC was born at the dawn of a new century. Through this key cooperation platform, we have together built roads, railways, schools, hospitals, industrial parks, and special economic zones. These projects have changed the lives and destiny of many people.
The China-Africa community with a shared future grows in step with the times. Following the Eighth FOCAC Ministerial Conference in Dakar in 2021, we have worked together to fully implement the nine programs and deliver on other outcomes of the meeting. We pulled together in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We maintained close cooperation and coordination on major international and regional issues. Together we have made the voice of the Global South stronger.
Friends and Distinguished Guests,
We human beings have been dreaming of a community with a shared future, and modernization is what it takes to turn our dream into reality. China and Africa have been, and remain, pioneers in building this community, and we will stay at the forefront in pursuing modernization. I am confident that as long as the 2.8 billion-strong Chinese and African people are united for this common goal, we will accomplish new and even greater feats together on the way toward modernization, spearhead the modernization drive of the Global South, and make greater contributions to a community with a shared future for mankind.
Now, I would like to propose a toast;

To the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and African people;
To the success of the Summit; and
To the health of all distinguished guests and your families.

QGD9EMZB6O_3GKRE25ISSGR1O2,Philippines says 200-plus Chinese vessels have clustered in its EEZ,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-rfa01.htm,"Up to 71 Chinese coast guard ships and other vessels were spotted at Sabina Shoal alone, from Aug. 27-Sept. 2.
By BenarNews staff 2024.09.03 -- The Philippine military said Tuesday that it had monitored more than 200 Chinese vessels in several areas within Manila's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea during the past week alone - the highest number recorded this year.
According to Filipino officials, a majority of the ships and boats were spotted near Sabina (Escoda) Shoal, a disputed reef and scene of an incident on Aug. 31 where Manila accused the Chinese coast guard of ramming into a Philippine Coast Guard ship at least three times.
""We can attribute the surge [of Chinese vessels] to the attention given to Sabina/Escoda Shoal in the last few weeks,"" said Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, the Philippine Navy's spokesman for the West Philippine Sea.
Manila calls South China Sea waters within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) the West Philippine Sea. An EEZ gives a coastal state exclusive rights up to 200 miles from its coastline to regulate fishing activities, as well as explore and exploit natural resources within the zone's waters, seabed and subsoil, according to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS.
Seventy-one  Chinese vessels were monitored at Sabina Shoal, from Aug. 27 to Sept. 2, compared with 53 the previous week, officials said. The Chinese vessels comprised 53 maritime militia boats, nine Navy ships and nine Coast Guard vessels, according to Trinidad.
Sabina Shoal, a reef located 75 nautical miles (140 km) from the Philippine island of Palawan, has been the site of maritime standoffs between Philippine and Chinese personnel in the past weeks.
The latest was on Saturday, when Manila blamed a Chinese coast guard vessel for ramming into the BRP Teresa Magbanua, a Philippine coast guard ship deployed at the shoal since April, amid reports that Beijing may be trying to reclaim land there.
China has repeatedly accused the Philippines of ""illegally grounding"" the BRP Teresa Magbanua to ""forcibly occupy"" the shoal, which the Chinese call Xianbin Jiao.
""The Philippines sent its Coast Guard vessel to the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao which has been illegally anchored there for many days now n an attempt to permanently occupy the area. This is the root cause of the current escalatory situation at Xianbin Jiao,"" Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, said Monday.
""The measures China took at Xianbin Jiao [on Saturday were] aimed at protecting its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. They [were] fully legitimate and lawful.""
In addition to the Chinese vessels clustered around Sabina Shoal, Trinidad said 52 others were monitored at the Philippine-occupied Thitu (Pag-asa) Island during the same period, up from 35 the previous week.
There were also 26 Chinese vessels at Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal during the same period, compared with only 23 the previous week, Trinidad said.
Another 54 Chinese vessels were monitored at various South China Sea features that lie within Manila's EEZ, including Iroquois Reef, Scarborough Shoal (Bajo de Masinloc or Panatag Shoal), Loaita (Kota) Island, and Commodore (Rizal) Reef, according to Trinidad.
Beijing's presence in the territories that lie within Manila's EEZ is illegal, Trinidad said.
He said that the Philippine Navy and the Armed Forces of the Philippines would ""continue to perform its mandate to protect our territory as we uphold international law and contribute to regional peace and stability.""
The Philippines and China are locked in a years-long dispute over the potentially mineral- and gas-rich South China Sea.
China has refused to heed an international tribunal's landmark verdict, which ruled in favor of the Philippines in 2016 and said there was no evidence to support Beijing's assertion it had exclusive control over the waterway based on historical grounds.
The recent maritime and air confrontations between Manila and Beijing happened despite both sides agreeing to dial down tensions in the South China Sea in July.
Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have territorial claims in the strategic waterway.

ULAANBAATAR (Sputnik) - Military-technical cooperation between Russia and Mongolia includes the supply of weapons to Ulaanbaatar and the training of military personnel, currently Russia has already trained 340 Mongolian soldiers, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said on Tuesday.
""The supply of weapons and military equipment, repair, maintenance, modernization,"" Fomin outlined the areas of cooperation, adding ""... we are cooperating on the military-technical line. And in the military as well. We teach. We have already trained about 340 people this year.""
One of the training sites for Mongolian military personnel is the presidential cadet school in Kyzyl, the official said.

QUUOET3UTA_TGS0YLSA3YSGU7U,Putin makes renewed push for gas pipeline deal with China,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2024/09/russia-240905-voa01.htm,"By Christy Lee September 05, 2024
During his recent trip to Mongolia, Russian President Vladimir Putin promoted a plan to build a pipeline from his country to China. The pipeline, which could weaken U.S. energy leverage over Beijing, would have to pass through Mongolia.
In a joint press conference held after talks in Ulaanbaatar on Tuesday, Putin said cooperation in the gas sector looks promising.
The two sides have completed drawing up documents to design the Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline extension in Mongolia and it is ""at the stage of state expert appraisal and assessment,"" Putin said.
New export market
The Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline extension is part of the Power of Siberia 2 (PS-2) pipeline. The PS-2 pipeline would transport about 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas annually to China when completed.
It is seen as an effort by Moscow to divert gas that had been exported to Europe to Asia after the Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea was damaged by explosions last year.
Russia uses the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline to deliver gas to China, exporting 22.7 bcm in 2023. It aims to raise the supplies to 38 bcm annually by 2025.
""China is really Russia's option to find a customer for a sizable portion of the pipeline gas it previously sent to Europe,"" said Erica Downs, a senior research scholar focusing on Chinese energy markets at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.
""Putin will continue to champion the project and look for ways to characterize any discussion of the project with Mongolian officials as progress,"" she continued.
Beijing and Moscow have been in talks for years over PS-2, but a final agreement has not been reached. Mongolia also has not made a final approval for the pipeline to pass through its land.
""The pipeline, if built, would reduce U.S. LNG [liquefied natural gas] exports to China,"" further weakening U.S. energy leverage over China that is already declining, said Joseph Webster, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center.
Beijing seeks to reduce foreign energy dependence by ""replacing imports with indigenously produced energy"" including solar, wind, and nuclear energy, Webster said.
A report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service on Aug. 28 said, ""PS-2 could strengthen China's bargaining position"" with the U.S. if it receives additional Russian natural gas. The U.S. has been the sixth largest exporter of LNG to China between 2016 and 2023, the report noted.
The report said PS-2 could also help Russia avoid sanctions imposed by the West because ""PS-2 would involve pipeline trade of natural gas"" and ""no existing sanctions would impact this trade.""
Renewed push
Putin made an extra effort to promote the pipeline deal at the press conference with Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh.
He said Russia and Mongolia are ""not only talking about the transit of Russian gas across Mongolia"" but ""the potential delivery of gas to Mongolian consumers.""
Ahead of the talks, Putin said Mongolia initially ""preferred to limit themselves to being just a transit country"" for the pipeline but is now considering a deal to obtain ""cheap pipeline gas to support the development of their economy and infrastructure.""
Putin made the comments in a written interview with Mongolia's Onoodor newspaper, according to the Kremlin on Monday.
Putin's renewed push to boost PS2 came after Mongolia in August excluded the pipeline project in its national development plan through 2028.
Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, said Putin made the remarks ""to project strength"" and because he ""needs a market for his oil.""
""He wants to see what the West says,"" and also ""to see whether Mongolia changes its mind,"" but the pipeline deal is still incomplete ""until we get confirmation from Mongolia,"" she said.
Khurelsukh did not confirm in his statements in the bilateral talks with Putin whether he agreed to allow the pipeline deal to proceed.
In a series of documents signed on Tuesday, Russia and Mongolia made agreements on the supplies of oil, petroleum products, and aviation fuel but did not mention any agreements on the pipeline deal.
China-Russia competition
Mongolia is heavily dependent on Russian energy, importing 95% of its petroleum products and more than 20% of electricity. A spokesperson for the Mongolian government told Politico on Tuesday that is why it did not arrest Putin when he was in the country.
The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest for crimes committed in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a member country of the ICC, Mongolia was obligated to arrest him.
""Mongolia probably does not have to make a final decision about Power of Siberia 2 anytime soon because China is in no hurry to move forward with the project,"" Downs said.
""The fact that Mongolia did not include Power of Siberia 2 in its next four-year spending plan indicates that it does not expect the project to move off the drawing board before 2028,"" she said.
Russia also has been in talks with China about the project in recent months.
In May, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Beijing and Moscow are expected to sign a contract on the PS-2 gas pipeline ""in the near future.""
But the pipeline deal between the two remained stalled over pricing demands by Beijing, the Financial Times reported in June.
On Wednesday, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui apparently told the Russian News Agency Tass on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok that Beijing and Moscow would eventually launch PS-2 despite difficulties surrounding the project.
""China always drives a hard bargain on the pricing of gas imports and wants to control as much as possible of the transportation network involved in its imports and exports,"" said Thomas Duesterberg, senior fellow at Hudson Institute.
""Russia and China compete over influence in Mongolia, and the Russo-Mongolian deal is subject to close scrutiny because of these factors, and that likely explains the failure at this time to reach a deal,"" he added.
Chinese Vice President Han Zheng will visit Mongolia from Sept. 4 to 8 after attending the Eastern Economic Forum held in Vladivostok, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday.
It is uncertain, however, whether Beijing and Ulaanbaatar will discuss the PS-2 pipeline project."

More facts are emerging about London's deep involvement in the planning and implementation of the Kiev regime's terrorist attacks in Russia.
In particular, the examination of the electronic components of the drones which Ukraine used in early August 2024 to attack a fuel depot in the Kamensky District, Rostov Region, has shown that the drones' flight controllers were pre-programmed near the headquarters of Callen-Lenz GB in Salisbury, UK, and in the hangars of Safran Seats GB in the vicinity of Newport, Wales. These two companies provide technological solutions for the aircraft and aerospace industries.
The drones were assembled in the Vyshgorod District, Kiev Region, and launched from a site near Slavyansk in the part of the Donetsk People's Republic that is currently controlled by the Ukrainian army.
We regard these facts as evidence of London's approval of the terrorist methods used by the Kiev regime. Britain's actual financing and involvement in preparing attacks on the civilian infrastructure and innocent civilians in Russia makes London fully responsible, on a par with its Kiev puppets, for the continuing bloodshed.
The concerned Russian agencies take Britain's destructive activity and its relentless striving to escalate the conflict into account. Conclusions are made, and the best response algorithms are considered, but it would not be right to speak openly about the details of this work, for obvious reasons. We would like to remind you, though, about the warning issued by the Foreign Ministry on May 6, 2024, that any UK military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian territory and beyond could be hit as a response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with British weapons.
We call on London, which is sacrificing Ukrainian people and Ukrainian statehood to promote its own geopolitical interests, to immediately stop supporting the inhuman regime and refrain from any other actions that can further escalate the conflict."

JERUSALEM, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli police officers, a female and two males, were killed after Palestinian gunmen opened fire on an Israeli checkpoint in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to Israeli authorities.
The Israeli army said in a statement that the gunmen arrived with a car near the Tarqumiyah checkpoint in the southern West Bank. They fired at a police vehicle before abandoning their car and fleeing the scene.
Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service confirmed that three police officers were killed by the gunshots.
Israeli forces have launched a search for the attackers.
The incident occurred amid the ongoing large-scale raids carried out by the Israeli military in the northern West Bank. The military stated that the raids were launched in an attempt to arrest wanted persons and prevent future attacks against Israel.
Tensions have escalated in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023."

On the fourth day of Israel's assault on the West Bank, the city of Jenin has been ""cut off from the world"" as the regime's troops have blocked access to aid for Palestinians and continue their deadly raids on the occupied territory.
According to a report by Al-Jazeera Arabic, Israeli troops were stationed on the outskirts of the Jenin refugee camp on Saturday, blocking access to aid for Palestinians there.
A Jenin resident told AFP that they ""are cut off from the world.""
""The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.""
Director of Jenin Government Hospital, Wisam Bakr, also said that he thinks ""it's the worst day since the start of the raid"" on the occupied territory on Wednesday.
""We hear from time to time clashes and sometimes there is a big bombing.""
The regime's forces have killed at least 20 Palestinians, including a person with disabilities and several children, in the northern West Bank since the regime has launched its deadly raid on several cities in the northern West Bank, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
According to residents of Jenin, Israel's bulldozers rumbled through the streets on the first day of the raid, clearing the way for Israeli soldiers while tearing up the asphalt and piercing underground pipes.
Red Crescent ambulance shot
According to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), the regime's military forces fired at one of its ambulances in Jenin on Saturday.
It said the ambulance was hit despite its entry being coordinated ahead of time.
PRCS medics have been repeatedly targeted while on the job in the occupied West Bank, with at least 22 of them being killed since October 7, according to the organization.
Israel has once again come under intense international pressure to halt its deadly raids on the occupied West Bank, with the UN human rights office, (OHCHR) warning that the regime's latest hostilities risked further enflaming an ""already explosive situation,"" in the occupied territory."

I would like to wish you and members of your delegation a pleasant stay in our country.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Chairman,
I am also very pleased to visit friendly Mongolia.
Together with the Mongolian people we marked a milestone event - an anniversary of our common victory over the aggressors on the river Khalkhin Gol. In those battles we ensured Mongolia's independence and territorial integrity.
We have just noted with Mr President in the course of our talks that Mongolia turned out to be a very loyal and reliable ally of the Soviet Union and Russia during our fight with German Nazis during the Great Patriotic War.
Throughout decades Russia and Mongolia have maintained very close and friendly relations, and today they are effectively developing. Trade is growing. We interact through our parliaments; last year our interparliamentary commission held its first meeting.
We give very much importance to interaction between our government authorities. In today's world and in our countries it is an essential addition to the development of contacts between the executive bodies. Direct interaction between the parliaments creates a very good atmosphere and contributes to the creation of a legal framework for such interaction.
Thank you very much for the warm reception.
Dashzegve Amarbayasgalan: Thank you very much.
This year, we held the ninth parliamentary elections. Formerly consisting of 76 members, the Mongolian Parliament has been expanded to 126 members through constitutional amendments. Representatives of four parties and one union were elected to join the Parliament.
We will certainly pursue a course of regular contacts and cooperation with the supreme legislative body of the Russian Federation, our eternal neighbour.
The Mongolian chapter of the Mongolian-Russian Interparliamentary Group will be co-chaired by two representatives. They are Deputy Chairman of the State Great Khural from the Democratic Party Mr Purevdorj and Deputy Chairman from the People's Party Ms Khurelbaatar Bulgantuya, who is another deputy head of the Mongolian-Russian Interparliamentary Group.
In concordance with your desires, we will focus on having consistent contacts and discussing cooperation between the parliaments and between parliamentary and interparliamentary groups.
We have been informed that your meeting and talks with the President of Mongolia were quite productive and you have reached certain agreements. On behalf of the Parliament, we will focus on measures agreed by the presidents and by our respective ministries."

The Finnish Government aims to improve national security of Finland by tightening the legislation on foreign real estate transactions. A working group appointed by Minister of Defence Antti HÃ¤kkÃ¤nen drew up a report on the matter, which will be sent out for comments next. The legislative proposal is due to be submitted to Parliament before the end of the year.
The working group proposes that no permit to buy real estate be granted to persons whose country of nationality has been found by the European Union to be in violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of another country or whose country of nationality may be a threat to Finland's national security. This prohibition would also apply to entities who are domiciled in the territory of such a country or who are owned or influenced by citizens or entities of such a country. Further provisions on such countries would be issued by government decree.
""In recent years, Western countries have seen continual examples of the increasingly flagrant means employed to destabilise our societies.  Finland must make sure not to leave any windows of vulnerability open to hostile actors. We must identify and neutralise in advance any risks that could compromise the functioning of society and the security of the population in times of crisis,"" says Minister of Defence HÃ¤kkÃ¤nen.
The security situation in Europe and in Finland is more serious and more difficult to predict than at any time since the Cold War, and the change is expected to be long-lasting. The threat of intelligence and influence targeting Finland's critical infrastructure has increased both in the physical and cyber environment as a result of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and Finland's membership in NATO.
The purpose of the proposed provisions is to prevent hostile broad-spectrum influencing by means of property owned in Finland. Foreign real estate ownership can be exploited to prepare hostile action against the Finnish society. Such action can be used against the Finnish economy, infrastructure, businesses and security of supply or against Finland's self-determination and capacity to provide security for its population.
The legislative project is related to the Programme of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo's Government, which states that the Government will examine the adequacy of the regulation on the acquisition and possession of real estate by parties outside the EU and the EEA. The Government will also examine possibilities to engage in more effective ex post facto intervention and control in respect of assets central to the security of society and security of supply.
The report is available in Finnish in the Gateway to Information on Government Projects (PLM005:00/2023).
The deadline for comments on the report is 25 October 2024. All organisations and private individuals may submit comments online at lausuntopalvelu.fi. Following the consultation round, the law-drafting work will continue at the Ministry."

MOSCOW, (Sputnik) - Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that due to the active military actions of the Russian army in the Kramatorsk, Kupyansk and Toretsk directions, a difficult situation has developed for the Ukrainian forces, the most difficult for Kiev is in the Krasnoarmeysk sector (Ukrainian name Pokrovs'ke).
""Today I spoke with the Commander-in-Chief. The Pokrovsk direction faces the highest number of assaults. The situation is also difficult in the Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Kupyansk directions. Nearly two hundred battles are baing fought daily along the entire front,"" Zelenskyy said in a video message on Telegram.
On August 21, retired SBU Col. Oleg Starikov stated that a tactical crisis had already occurred for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, which could develop into an operational one.
Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrsky previously stated that the situation along the entire front line was difficult. According to Syrsky, the Russian army has an advantage in the air, missiles, and artillery ammunition.
Last week, the General Staff of the Ukrainian troops reported a tense situation in the Kupyansk and Seversk directions.
Earlier, the head of the Russian administration of the Kharkov region, Vitaly Ganchev, said that the Russian Armed Forces were liberating the road connecting Kupyansk and Svatovo, and several villages along it had already come under the control of Russian troops. According to Ganchev, the Russian Armed Forces are slowly but surely advancing toward Kupyansk.
On Friday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Yug (""West"") group of forces had liberated the settlements of Stelmakhovka in the LPR and Sinkovka in the Kharkiv region. On Saturday, August 31, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Yug group of forces had defeated units of four Ukrainian brigades and repelled a counterattack, with the enemy losing up to 780 servicemen.

And I am also grateful to all journalists of Ukraine, Europe, and the   world - to all those who speak truthfully about what is happening, about   this war, and about the importance of protecting lives.
Today, the Taoiseach of Ireland came on a visit to Ukraine, and he   was not only in Kyiv, but also in Hostomel and Borodyanka. He saw what   the Russian war brought to Ukraine. Today we signed a bilateral security   agreement with Ireland, which is substantial, as it should be. It is   the 26th such agreement. Although Ireland is a militarily neutral state,   we cooperate actively in the political, economic and humanitarian   spheres. And we will work even more actively. We have secured the amount   of Ireland's assistance to Ukraine for this year. We have agreed to   make more joint efforts to ensure that sanctions against Russia for this   war become stronger, and that reconstruction in Ukraine is more active.   I suggested that Ireland should look more closely at the possibility of   patronage for the restoration of one of our regions. And, of course, it   is very valuable that Irish society and the political class know what   is happening in Ukraine and what exactly is needed to end this war as   soon as possible.
Today, there was a report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi. As every   day, it was about each part of the front, with special reference to   Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and the Kurakhove direction. Separate mention was   made of the operation in the Kursk region. It is very important that   absolutely all the objectives set for our Kursk operation are being   realized. For this, I thank every soldier, every sergeant and every   officer involved. As of now, this operation continues to be the largest   replenishment of the exchange fund from one direction.
And today we also continued evacuating our people from the Middle   East - from Lebanon. 11 children, 14 adults. They are now safe. And our   diplomats and intelligence will continue helping - all Ukrainians in the   region who need it can contact our diplomatic missions in the Middle   East and get everything they need, all help, all assistance.
And one more thing.
We are preparing important meetings with our partners. Something that   can and should strengthen our positions - not only of Ukraine, but of   all of us in Europe, of all of us in the world who want a real end to   this war and a real joint work on ensuring that security never collapses   again. This week, next week, and all of September must be productive   for all of us. Primarily, this is about air defense, our capabilities on   the front and in reconstruction. We are preparing substantial things.
I thank everyone who stands with Ukraine! I thank all those who fight   and work - really work one hundred percent - to defend our   independence, our people!
Glory to Ukraine!"
RS1CW1WFWV_RKJ35LBAPJEW5OY,Voting Ends In Azerbaijani Elections Amid Reports Of Irregularities,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240901-rferl02.htm,"By RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service September 01, 2024
Voting has concluded in Azerbaijan's first parliamentary elections since it reclaimed full control of its breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, with reports of irregularities taking place at polling stations in the highly controlled electoral process.
The balloting offered Azerbaijan's 6 million-plus voters limited alternatives to loyalists of President Ilham Aliyev and came early in a fifth term built for decades on petro-wealth and carefully choreographed elections.
Although the outcome was never in doubt, one exit poll showed the ruling party winning 63 of 125 seats, down from 69 in the current legislature, the Milli Mejlis parliament, which is dominated by Aliyev's New Azerbaijan party. Most of the rest belong to small pro-government parties or independents.
RFE/RL's Azerbaijani Service said instances of alleged vote tampering were being reported. It posted several videos that appeared to show the same voters casting ballots more than once.
When asked by RFE/RL whether he had voted twice as it appeared in a video, a man in the Neftchala region refused to answer. A member of the election commission denied that a person had voted twice.
A woman in Baku and one in Sumgait were also filmed apparently voting twice. The woman filmed in Sumgait gave her name as Shahnaz Mammadova and indicated to RFE/RL that she had voted at two different voting stations and said she was sent by people from her work office.
An RFE/RL correspondent also filmed what appeared to be two people entering a single voting booth at the same time in the city of Sumgait.
An hour before polls closed, election officials reported a turnout of 33.8 percent.
The national election commission said 50 organizations would conduct observer missions. The largest observer contingent, from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is scheduled to present its preliminary assessment of the election on September 2.
The Musavat party, the major opposition grouping, put forward 34 candidates for the election but only 25 of them were registered. The Republican Alternative opposition party has 12 candidates. The leading opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (AXCP) is staying away from ""the government's masquerade of a fraudulent election"" for the seventh straight time.
Aliyev was himself reelected to another seven-year term in a snap poll in February that was widely deemed to have been unfair and flawed.
Western observers have consistently criticized elections cementing Aliyev's reign as undemocratic, and Azerbaijani votes stretching back to 2003 and as recently as 2020 have been marred by violence.
Aliyev has sought a boost in popular support following Azerbaijan's victory over ethnic-Armenian separatist forces in the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region in September 2023 in a lightning offensive.
Baku has been negotiating with Yerevan on a peace treaty looking to end decades of violence in the region.

Saturday, 31 August 2024 11:14 AM
Palestinian resistance groups have commended two separate retaliatory car bomb explosions that targeted the illegal Israeli settlements of Gush Etzion and Karmei Tzur in the southern part of the occupied West Bank.
According to the Israeli military, a car exploded at a gas station near the Gush Etzion junction in the first incident Friday. Troops dispatched to the scene shot dead a Palestinian, who had arrived in the vehicle and who purportedly attempted to attack them.
In the second incident, which occurred about 20 minutes later, another Palestinian breached into the nearby Karmei Tzur settlement, before being shot dead. The Palestinian man's car exploded inside the community.
Media reports said at least three Israeli settlers were injured in the two separate attacks.
Hamas said in a statement that the operations send a clear message that the resistance front will remain firm, strong and resilient as long as Israel continues its brutalities and acts of aggression against the Palestinian nation and occupied territories.
""The qualitative operations have profound significance as they were carried out in the southern West Bank city of al-Khalil, and came at a critical moment as the occupying entity has stepped up its aggression in the northern side of the West Bank, and intensified its massacres and genocide in the West Bank.
""These operations remind the Zionist regime of the fact that it cannot partition any part of our homeland, and that our people and heroic resistance fighters will surprise Israel anywhere and anytime,"" the statement read.
Hamas noted that the coordinated car bomb explosions represent a new blow to the Israeli security apparatus, and highlights that illegal settlers cannot enjoy security on occupied Palestinian lands and will continue to receive more painful strikes from Palestinian resistance fighters.
""We call upon our people and resistance groups to further confront and respond to the ongoing Israeli crimes. We are in the midst of the blessed al-Aqsa Storm battle, and must therefore unite all our efforts in order to deter the occupying Israeli regime and thwart its fiendish plots.""
For its part, the Islamic Jihad resistance movement dismissed as ""a futile attempt"" the Israeli media outlets' campaign to downplay the repercussions of the operations.
""Their made-up stories will not change the reality. These attempts only reveal that the operations have put the Zionist entity's security and political services to shame,"" the Gaza-based group said.
""We reaffirm that the enemy's attempts to eliminate the resistance front, whether in the West Bank or Gaza, will fail. An end to the crimes being committed by the criminal Israeli regime is the core issue of surprise operations launched by resistance groups,"" it said in a statement.
The Palestinian Freedom Movement also stated that the operations are indicative of the fact that resistance fighters are present in all areas and that they are the ones who decide the timing, location and manner of their retaliatory attacks.
""We urge our people and resistance fighters to conduct more heroic operations in response to the Zionist regime's Nazi crimes, and step up actions aimed at jamming up the Israeli war machine. Through the establishment of deterrence, the occupying regime's aggression and malicious plans could be foiled,"" it said in a statement.
Since Israel unleashed a war on the besieged Gaza Strip in early October 2023, casualties have been rising in the West Bank as a result of intensified near-daily Israeli raids into villages and cities in the occupied territories.
According to Palestinian health officials, at least 670 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war on Gaza.
Nineteen Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during raids over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.
On Saturday, Israel pressed on with a large-scale invasion of the West Bank for a fourth day on Saturday, as fierce fighting raged in the nearly 11-month Gaza war.
At least 20 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli troops since Wednesday in raids in several cities in the northern West Bank.
The dead included an 82-year-old man, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, and two teenagers, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, which said another 55 had been wounded since the launch of the Israeli operation.
Since Friday, soldiers have concentrated their operations on the city of Jenin and its refugee camps.
In Gaza, Israel pushed forward with its onslaught despite a three-day pause announced by the UN World Health Organization (WHO) for polio vaccinations.
Gaza's civil defense agency said its rescuers pulled 29 bodies from the rubble since dawn and transported dozens of wounded to hospitals across the devastated Palestinian territory."
S48XWEH8PN_VNKSOWMYKTOBNYS,Rafale - United Arab Emirates,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/uae-af-rafale.htm,"A doctored social media video  falsely attributed to Al Jazeera  alleged that the UAE froze a $17 billion contract with France for Rafale fighter jets in retaliation for its citizen's arrest, putting the close military ties between the two countries at stake. Analysts were closely monitoring the situation for any further developments, particularly as this decision may affect other nations considering similar deals with France. It has been determined that the #Russian intelligence was behind the fake news. They even created a fake Al-Jazeera report to make it more.
The disinformation campaign began around 8:00 PM Moscow time 28 August 2024 with a leak on certain dubious Telegram channels. The publishers are not known for maintaining information hygiene, often spreading unverified fakes (that are sent to them by their followers) for the sake of hype and subscribers.  The portal http://Avia.pro, cited by several Russian media outlets, published the news at 20:48, also without any reference to the original source. (Simply because there wasn't one). Andrew Korybko wrote :"" If I knew it was connected to Avia Pro then Id have never given it any credence since thats an infamous fake news factory from the good ole Syrian days!  Theyve pushed tons of fakes about Russia allegedly plotting to shoot down attacking Israeli jets and even bomb Israel!""
Amir Tsarfati wrote ""The United Arab Emirates has completely FROZEN the implementation of a contract to purchase 80 fighter jets from France following the arrest of Pavel Durov!""  Kim Dotcom wrote on X: The French Govt just lost $17 billion over the arrest of Pavel Durov. The UAE froze a deal to purchase 80 Rafale fighter jets and says that the arrest of Pavel Durov is outrageous. Pavel is a citizen of the UAE and a close friend of Deputy Prime Minister Hamdan Al Maktoum. From there, the fake started seeping into Twitter (X). The news was picked up by opposition opinion leaders (and even politicians!) in the US and Europe. Considering how rapidly it spread across credible public channels and being picked up by conservative opinion leaders who don't bother with verification, relying on each other, it's a blatant setup that damages right-wing and opposition thinkers.
United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported to have unexpectedly canceled its US$20 billion agreement with France for the purchase of 80 Rafale fighter jets, a decision that has sent shockwaves through the global defense industry. The cancellation followed the brief detention of Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, by French authoritiesan incident that has strained diplomatic relations between the UAE and France, despite Durovs subsequent release on bail.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested on 24 August 2024 regarding 12 alleged criminal activities involving his widely recognized Telegram application, Durov was born in Russia, yet he spent much of his formative years in Italy. He holds citizenship in the United Arab Emirates, France, Russia, and the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis.
The arrest of Telegram founder and owner Pavel Durov triggered a spate of conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns on the internet. Amid the prevailing confusion in the wake of the high-profile arrest, which had allegedly ruffled some feathers in the UAE due to Durovs Emirati citizenship, a doctored video surfaced on social media. The doctored social media videofalsely linked to Al Jazeeraclaimed that the UAE had decided to cancel its deal with France for 80 Rafale fighter jets. The report stated that the decision was based on a diplomatic fallout between the two countries following Durovs arrest. Additionally, media reports added that, in light of Durovs detention, military-technical cooperation between the Emirati Kingdom and France could totally cease. The report also asserted that the UAE had requested consular access to Durov.
France had viewed the Rafale deal as a cornerstone for boosting its defense industry, with significant implications for both economic growth and international standing.  The suposed freezing of this contract represents a major setback for French President Emmanuel Macron, who had championed the deal as a symbol of France's strategic partnership with the UAE. The decision also seemed to deliver a blow to Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of the Rafale jets, which now faced uncertainty regarding future orders. The UAEs claimed cancellation of the deal is seen as a clear message that geopolitical tensions can rapidly influence major business agreements.
The United Arab Emirates agreed to buy 80 French-made Rafale fighter jets in a deal  worth 16 billion euros (Dh66 billion), the biggest international order ever made for the warplanes, officials said on 03 December 2021 during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron. The French presidency said in a statement ""This is an outcome of the strategic partnership between the two countries, consolidating their capacity to act together for their autonomy and security"". The Rafale order is the biggest made internationally for the aircraft since it entered into service in 2004. The agreement was signed by Dassault Aviation director-general Eric Trapier as Macron held talks with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed on the first day of a visit to the Gulf. The fighter jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation will be delivered to the UAE between 2026 and 2031. The UAE will be the first user of the Rafale F4 outside France.
The UAE Air Force and Air defence had been operating MIRAGE 2000 for many years and had contracted with Dassault Aviation for the delivery of 30 new MIRAGE 2000-9 aircraft and for the modernisation of its existing fleet of 33 MIRAGE 2000 up to the latest-9 standard. The UAE will be the first 2000-9 operator following its $2-billion order for the aircraft. Delivery of the new 2000-9s was scheduled for late 2001.
In June 2008, the UAE said it was ""seriously considering"" the possibility that the Rafale could enter service in about 2013. By early 2010 it was reported that the United Arab Emirates and France were discussing the joint development of a more capable, new-generation Dassault Rafale strike fighter. The jets would replace the Mirage 2000-9s bought from France in 1998. The discussions had moved forward from buying the Rafale to co-developing the next-generation Rafale. The prospective new model would meet UAE requirements, and would be a big boost for the twin-engine fighter jet. Dassault Aviation had entered the Rafale in bidding for contracts in Brazil and India, and had offered it to Kuwait and Libya, but as of early 2011 failed to find foreign customers. The main upgrades for the UAE were an active electronically scanned array radar, frontal sector optronics and an electronic warfare suite, systems supplied by Thales, and a 9-ton-thrust M88 engine, up-rated from the 7.5-ton engine that powers the French Air Force and Navy Rafales.
One report suggested that Paris had agreed to buy back the Mirage 2000-9s for service with the French Air Force, putting its own Mirage 2000-5s on the secondhand market and retiring the Mirage 2000N nuclear strike variant. The consortium of French aerospace companies hoping to sell as many as 60 Rafale fighter jets to the UAE offered to set up facilities to make the aircraft in Abu Dhabi.
As of 2011 Dassault was still looking for customers to buy the Mirage 2000-9 aircraft that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) intended to replace with Rafales, Chief Executive Charles Edelstenne said March 19, 2009. A first delivery of the Rafale to the UAE would not be before 2012; and the UAE Air Force would probably need about three year's time to train aircrews on the new aircraft. ""We have time to prospect,"" he said. DGA Chief Executive Laurent Collet-Billon said March 17, 2009 that the French Air Force would not be taking the Mirage 2000-9s from the UAE.
In September 2011, it was widely predicted that Rafales selection would be announced at the Dubai Airshow. But the UAE said in November 2011 that the offer for Rafales from France's Dassault Aviation was uncompetitive and opened up the tender to competition. The UAE has pressed for the aircraft's engines to be upgraded with extra thrust and for better radar.
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed was quoted by the UAEs official news agency WAM in N0vmber 2011 : Thanks to French President Sarkozy, France could not have done more diplomatically or politically to secure the Rafale deal. Bilateral relations have never been stronger and his constant personal intervention in this process has sustained Dassault at the forefront of our considerations. Regrettably Dassault seems unaware that all the diplomatic and political will in the world cannot overcome uncompetitive and unworkable commercial terms.
Qatar and Kuwait were considering buying French Rafale fighter jets, but were waiting to see whether the United Arab Emirates would make a purchase first. French defence minister Gerard Longuet said 09 January 2012 that ""They are in effect interested but they won't know for sure until the first one jumps in."" The UAE was in talks with France to buy 60 Rafales. Industry experts have estimated that Kuwait needed 18-22 new fighter jets and that Qatar needed 24.
France could seal a long-awaited deal for Dassault to sell at least 60 Rafale fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates by April, turning around what appeared to have been a lost cause, French newspaper La Tribune reported in February 2012.
By early 2015 the United Arab Emirates had restarted talks on ordering the Dassault Rafale, with a planned major upgrade of the fighter jet in contrast to the off-the-shelf deals for Egypt and India. France had been in talks for more than five years on a sale of 60 Rafales, with the UAE requiring a more capable fighter with an extensive weapons suite. The Rafale would replace the fleet of Mirage 2000-9s.
UAE was looking at upgrades of the systems and engine of the Rafale. These might include active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, frontal sector optronic and an electronic warfare suite, systems supplied by Thales. A 9-ton-thrust M88 engine would be uprated from the 7.5-ton engine that powers the French Air Force and Navy fighters.
By November 2015 the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was said to be in the final stages of negotiations to buy French Rafale fighter jets. Separately, Abu Dhabi [one ofthe UAE Emirates], which was looking to purchase 60 fighters worth an estimated $10 billion, was studying the Dassault-built Rafale after rejecting the four-nation Eurofighter.
By November 2021 negotiations with Abu Dhabi were reportedly ""very advanced"" for the order of the French combat aircraft, most likely to the F4 standard, the version planned for the Air Force by 2025. If negotiations continue to advance at this rate, it could not be announced before the end of the year. The next tour of Emmanuel Macron in the Gulf, the last of his five-year term, was due to visit Abu Dhabi on December 2, followed by a trip to Doha (Qatar) and then to Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) on December 3 and 4.

GAZA (Sputnik) - A campaign to vaccinate Palestinian children against poliomyelitis, a severe and potentially deadly infectious disease, began in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on Sunday, a Sputnik correspondent reported.
Some 1.2 million polio vaccines have been delivered to central Gaza ahead of the campaign, underway at the primary health care center in the camp.
""Today is the first day of the polio vaccination campaign. The campaign is necessary for children as young as one day old and is absolutely harmless,"" a campaign organizer told Sputnik.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said that polio vaccination in the Gaza Strip would take place from September 1-12. It will be carried out in the city of Deir al Balah from September 1-4, in Khan Yunis and Rafah from September 5-8, and in Gaza City and the northern part of the Gaza Strip from September 9-12.
In July, the Gaza Health Ministry declared the enclave a polio epidemic area, citing the months-long fighting as the main reason for the spread of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) called for a humanitarian pause in the enclave to allow for vaccination.
Palestinian movement Hamas said it supported the humanitarian pause. Israel confirmed on Saturday that it would open a humanitarian corridor for medical personnel and designate safe areas for administering the vaccines during a short period.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has called for a complete arms embargo on the criminal Israeli regime.
Safadi on Tuesday praised the British government over its decision to partially suspend some arms export licenses to Israel, calling for a complete weapons embargo on the Tel Aviv regime.
Amid criticisms of the UK's indirect involvement in the Israeli genocide of the helpless Palestinian people trapped in the Gaza Strip, the UK on Monday suspended 30 of its 350 arms export licenses.
""The UK did right to suspend some arms exports licenses to Israel,"" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on X, formerly twitter.
""We urge an expansion of this suspension and call on all countries to impose a complete arms embargo on Israel.""
""Unless consequences are real, (Israeli prime minister Benjamin) Netanyahu will not end his aggression on Gaza and the West Bank, and will not stop violating intentional law and threatening the security of the whole region,"" Safadi said.
Jordan's Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawaneh had announced earlier this year that peace with the Israelis remained to be a strategic choice for Amman, in complete disregard for the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza.
Israel has killed over 40,800 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023."

4 September 2024 - 13:25
I        Introduction
1. Ukraine and Ireland, hereinafter jointly referred to as ""the   Participants"", reiterate their unequivocal condemnation of Russia's   ongoing full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine and temporary   occupation of the territory of Ukraine. Europe's security is facing its   gravest threat in decades. Ireland remains unwavering in its commitment   to support Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity   within its internationally recognised borders as of 1991, including its   territorial sea.
2. Russia's brutal war is a blatant violation of international law   and the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter), the Helsinki Final   Act and the Charter of Paris. Russia's aggression against Ukraine   weakens security and stability across Europe and undermines Russia's   credibility as a party to international agreements. The war continues to   aggravate a food and energy crisis that affects the poorest and most   vulnerable communities globally.
3. Further to the Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine (""G7   Declaration""), adopted in Vilnius on 12 July 2023 by the Group of Seven   and the European Union (EU) and co-signed by Ireland, Ireland is   committed to maintaining support for Ukraine as it defends its   sovereignty and territorial integrity, rebuilds its economy, protects   its citizens, and advances its reform agenda, and as it pursues its   pathway towards EU integration and accession.
4. The Participants will deepen their cooperation and partnership by   pursuing the long-term bilateral security commitments set forth in this   Agreement. These commitments are based on the Participants' common   interest in defending the global multilateral system and international   law, based on the UN Charter, and protecting fundamental human rights   and freedoms.
II       Scope
5. The Participants will strengthen their cooperation by pursuing   bilateral and long-term commitments across a range of areas, including   political support, security assistance and cooperation, humanitarian   support, recovery and reconstruction, and ensuring accountability, by   pursuing the measures referred to in this Agreement.
6. Since February 2022, Ireland has committed approximately â¬380   million in humanitarian, stabilisation and non-lethal military   assistance to Ukraine. Ireland's commitments to Ukraine seek to   complement contributions by the other signatories of the G7 Declaration,   including the EU and its Member States. These commitments to Ukraine   are coordinated with partners and fully reflect the Joint Security   Commitments between the EU and Ukraine, signed on 27 June 2024.
7. In this context, Ireland will continue to provide long-term   political, security and financial support, as well as humanitarian   assistance to Ukraine, as it defends its sovereignty and territorial   integrity against Russia's invasion. Ukraine, for its part, is strongly   committed to the implementation of governance reforms, including   transparency, accountability and anti-corruption reforms.
III     Political support for Ukraine
8. The future of Ukraine and its people lies within the European   family, in the EU. Ukraine's security is an integral part of European   security and Ukraine has the right to choose its own foreign and   security policy path, and its own security arrangements.
9. The Participants reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine's European   aspirations, and in particular towards Ukraine's membership of the   European Union and other international organisations. The Participants   therefore warmly welcome the decision by the European Council in   December 2023 to open EU accession negotiations with Ukraine, and the   convening of the first Inter-governmental Conference on 25 June 2024.
10. The Participants reaffirm their commitment to work constructively   on Ukraine's progressive integration towards the EU, with a view to its   future EU membership. Ireland, in cooperation with the EU and its   Member States, will continue to support Ukraine in its reforms and   accession path.
11. Ireland remains committed to supporting Ukraine, bilaterally and   through the EU and its Ukraine Facility, to support Ukraine's recovery   and reconstruction, and modernisation reforms in line with its EU   accession path.
12. The Participants recall the merit-based nature of the EU   accession process. Ireland commends Ukraine for the successful reform   process so far and acknowledges Ukraine's efforts to strive for the   implementation of necessary reforms under extremely challenging   circumstances.
13. Ireland recalls its strong support for the EU's efforts to   support Ukraine's immediate and long-term security and resilience,   including through the contribution of non-lethal military and civilian   assistance, humanitarian, financial, trade and economic support, hosting   of displaced people, support to reforms, recovery and reconstruction,   as well as restrictive measures, support to accountability mechanisms,   diplomatic support and global outreach.
14. Ireland will continue its diplomatic efforts to promote the   implementation of Ukraine's Peace Formula. Ukraine deserves a just and   lasting peace based on international law and respecting Ukraine's   sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The Participants   will work together for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that has   broad global support.
15. Ireland will remain engaged on specific elements of Ukraine's   Peace Formula, including the work of the International Coalition on the   Return of Ukrainian Children under point 4 of the Peace Formula, which   aims to secure the return of all prisoners of war and unlawfully   displaced Ukrainian children and other Ukrainian civilians.
16. The Participants reaffirm their strong commitment to the   Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and call for   Russia's immediate return to respecting the OSCE's principles and   commitments. Ukraine and Ireland commend the important work of the   Support Programme for Ukraine and are willing to make full use of the   OSCE's tools in support of Ukraine's security, stability and   reconstruction. The Participants will work closely to this end.
IV     Security assistance and cooperation
17. The EU and Ireland, as an EU Member State, have strongly   condemned Russia's war of aggression. Ireland strongly supports the   joint position and action taken by the EU to support Ukraine in its   self-defence, including the joint security commitments agreed between   the European Union and Ukraine, signed on 27 June 2024 and unanimously   approved by the European Council.
18. In 2022 and 2023 Ireland committed â¬122 million in non-lethal   military support to Ukraine. In 2024 Ireland has committed a further   â¬128 million in non-lethal military support to Ukraine.
19. In this context, Ireland also fully supports the continued   mobilisation of predictable, sustainable and long-term support through   the European Peace Facility (EPF) and the dedicated Ukraine Assistance   Fund (UAF) under the Facility. Ireland's military support to Ukraine   through the European Peace Facility will continue to focus on non-lethal   equipment, as outlined in its Programme for Government commitments in   respect of the EPF.
20. Ireland will work on supporting efforts to improve capabilities   of the security and defence forces of Ukraine to defend itself against   Russian aggression now and deter possible further aggression in the   future, with particular focus on de-mining capabilities and training   supports through EUMAM as well as to contribute to Ukraine's Future   Force Design.
21. Ireland will continue its training support aimed at addressing   the needs expressed by Ukraine in the framework of the European Union   Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM). This   framework provides the principal mechanism for Ireland's continuing   non-lethal military support to Ukraine.
22. Recalling that Ireland has already provided various elements of   direct support, including the provision of equipment such as mine   clearance systems, transport vehicles, ambulances, body armour, and   other non-lethal equipment, as well as funding for cyber security   support, Ireland will continue to provide ongoing assistance to Ukraine,   as it defends its sovereignty and territorial integrity against the   ongoing aggression in line with Article 51 of the UN Charter.
23. Ireland will continue to support Ukraine for the ten-year duration of this Agreement.
24. Ireland's support will remain steadfast and will remain centred,   according to its own capabilities and policy approach, on non-lethal   military assistance based on Ukraine's needs. Such support in the field   of security and defence will include, but will not be limited to, the   following areas:
25. Recognising the scale of the contamination of Ukraine's territory   with mines and explosive remnants of war, mine action has been   identified as a key priority in the short to long-term. Ireland is   committed to supporting the mine clearance of the territory of Ukraine   and will continue to explore the provision of funding under the European   Peace Facility to support demining, as well as the provision of   training support under EUMAM-Ukraine in response to Ukrainian expressed   needs in this area, including in developing and sustaining international   demining standards.
26. Recalling Ireland's existing support in the area of cyber   security, participants will explore opportunities to deepen cooperation   in digital resilience and cyber security to assist Ukraine in detecting   and countering Russian and any other malicious cyber activity, in   accordance with international law. This will be achieved through   enhanced cyber resilience and critical infrastructure protection, cyber   threat intelligence sharing, and providing technical and/or financial   assistance to Ukraine.
27. The Participants will explore strengthening bilateral cooperation   and resilience in countering hybrid threats, as well as countering   foreign information manipulation and interference disinformation   campaigns and malign propaganda primarily by Russia and any other   hostile actors. The Participants will deepen their cooperation within   the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats,   including through Ukraine's enhanced partnership with the Centre.
28. The Participants will explore mechanisms to share relevant   information and analysis on activities by hostile actors, which impact   on any aspect of national security and the functioning of democratic   institutions, in accordance with applicable legal frameworks.
29. Ireland will also continue to provide strong support for the EU   Advisory Mission in Ukraine (EUAM Ukraine). By sharing expertise through   the EUAM, Ireland will continue to support Ukraine in reforming the   civilian security sector, law enforcement, and the rule of law. Ireland   will continue to contribute to the work of EUAM Ukraine in the   investigation and prosecution of international crimes, and   re-establishing the rule of law in the de-occupied and adjacent   territories in Ukraine.
30. The Participants reaffirm their commitment to comply with their   obligations under international law, including the duty to respect and   ensure respect for international humanitarian law. Ukraine will ensure   that any military equipment provided by Ireland is used exclusively for   Ukraine's self-defence, and is used in accordance with international   law, including international humanitarian law.
31. The Participants recognise the importance of the maritime order   based on international law, in particular the United Nations Convention   on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In this regard, Ukraine and Ireland will   promote freedom of navigation and safety at sea. The Participants will   coordinate their efforts on strengthening international cooperation and   collaboration in this domain.
V       Humanitarian, reconstruction and reform support
32. Ireland continues to provide temporary protection for people   fleeing from Ukraine due to Russian aggression, under the EU Temporary   Protection Directive. To date, over 109,000 people from Ukraine have   applied for temporary protection and have been welcomed in Ireland since   February 2022.
33. Ireland is committed to providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, to   assist Ukraine in reconstruction, and to support its programme of   reform and pathway to membership of the European Union. Ireland's   support will remain steadfast, durable and long-term in nature.
34. In 2022 and 2023, Ireland committed â¬90 million in humanitarian   and stabilisation support to Ukraine. In 2024, Ireland has committed at   least â¬40 million in humanitarian and stabilisation support to Ukraine,   including for humanitarian, reconstruction, macro-economic and reform   programmes in Ukraine, and will work closely with the Ukrainian   government and international development partners, including the UN, in   disbursing this funding.
35. Irish assistance will also be channelled through relevant trusted   civil society organisations operating in Ukraine. Ireland commits to   remaining a firm champion of civil society and will in particular seek   to pursue appropriate opportunities to support this sector.
36. The Participants recognise the importance of supporting private   businesses in Ukraine, as their input plays a vital role in supporting   the local economy and enhancing the resilience of affected communities.   Therefore, the Participants are willing, in accordance with their   national laws and applicable international law and obligations arising   from the international agreements to which they are party, to work   together to identify opportunities for private sector investment and   cooperation in Ukraine.
VI     Commitment to reform in Ukraine
37. Inclusive reform is indispensable for Ukraine's current and   future security and prosperity, for its democracy, the resilience of its   institutions and for Ukraine's aspirations for EU membership. Ukraine   commits to implement reforms as defined by the EU and the International   Monetary Fund, notably in the areas of governance, transparency,   anti-corruption and democratic control over its security and defence   forces.
38. Ireland will continue to provide strong support for the   strengthening of the rule of law in Ukraine, with a view to ensuring   that Ukraine's recovery, reconstruction and implementation of key   reforms is fully aligned with EU rules and standards.
39. Ireland stands ready to provide further advice and assistance to   Ukraine, drawing on the experience of its own accession process and   membership of the European Union, as Ukraine progresses along its EU   path.
VII    Promoting Accountability
40. The Participants acknowledge the importance of justice for a   lasting and sustainable peace in Ukraine and beyond, and the imperative   of ensuring that there is no impunity for international crimes committed   in and against Ukraine.
41. The Participants reaffirm their commitment to ensuring the   accountability of the Russian Federation for all damage, loss or injury   to individuals and entities in Ukraine, as well as to the state of   Ukraine, as a result of the internationally wrongful acts of the Russian   Federation in or against Ukraine, including waging a war of aggression   in violation of the UN Charter. The Participants are committed to   ensuring accountability for the crime of aggression against Ukraine and   are convinced of the need to establish a tribunal for that purpose. The   Participants will continue their engagement in the ""Core Group on   options for the establishment of a tribunal on the crime of aggression   against Ukraine"".
42. The Participants will continue to support the investigation and   prosecution of alleged international crimes committed in and against   Ukraine and will continue to support the work of the International   Criminal Court (ICC). Furthermore, Ireland will continue to deploy   experts through the EUAM to support the work of the Office of the   Prosecutor General of Ukraine and to build Ukraine's capacity to   investigate and prosecute war crimes in the context of Russia's war of   aggression.
VIII Compensation for damage, loss and injury caused by Russian aggression
43. The Participants reaffirm that the Russian Federation must be   held accountable for the damage caused by its internationally wrongful   acts in and against Ukraine. Ireland will continue to support the   immobilisation of Russian sovereign assets within the EU until Russia   ceases its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates Ukraine for   the damage caused by this war.
44. Ireland supports the work ongoing to find ways to utilise frozen   and immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine and its recovery and   reconstruction, in accordance with EU and international law and in   coordination with partner countries.
45. The Participants welcome the agreement reached at EU-level to   ensure the extraordinary revenue generated from immobilised Russian   sovereign assets will be used to support Ukraine. Ireland will continue   to support efforts within the EU to examine further possibilities for   use of extraordinary revenue generated from Russian sovereign assets, in   coordination with international partners, including the G7.
46. As a priority, the Participants will continue to work together,   along with G7 states and others, towards the establishment of an   international compensation mechanism to provide compensation for damage,   loss or injury caused by Russia's aggression, as envisaged by the   Statute of the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the   Russian Federation against Ukraine adopted by the Resolution of the   Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe CM/Res(2023)3. This may   include the exploration of appropriate options for the financing of an   international compensation mechanism to provide prompt and adequate   compensation to victims of aggression.
IX Sanctions
47. The Participants recognise the value of sanctions in restricting   the Russian Federation's access to the finance, goods, technology and   services it is utilising in its aggression. Ireland will remain   committed to pursuing robust restrictive measures and export controls   against those sectors of the Russian economy and outside that are   supporting or profiting from the war, or assisting in sanctions   circumvention in third countries.
48. Ireland will continue to take determined action through the EU to   uphold sanctions against the Russian Federation and to tackle all forms   of circumvention of restrictive measures. Ireland will also cooperate   and share expertise with Ukraine on EU restrictive measures, their   implementation and efforts to combat sanctions evasion.
49. The Participants will provide each other with up-to-date   appropriate information on the grounds for sanctions listings and   related relevant information, in compliance with relevant obligations   and national laws.
X       Consultation mechanisms
50. In order to facilitate the implementation of this Agreement and   to ensure an ongoing strategic dialogue, appropriate consultation   structures between the Participants will be arranged.
51. In particular, the Participants will develop senior-level   consultations on political and strategic matters, including regular   strategic dialogues on the strengthening of Ukraine's security, defence,   resilience, and reform path.
52. In the event of future Russian armed attacks against Ukraine or   the significant escalation of the ongoing aggression, the Participants,   at the request of either of the Participants, will consult within 24   hours, bilaterally or via other channels they both deem appropriate, in   order to determine appropriate next steps.
XI     Final Provisions
53. The Participants will implement this Agreement in accordance with   their international and national legal obligations, including Ireland's   obligations as a member of the EU, budgetary appropriations, and in   full respect for Ireland's longstanding policy of military neutrality.
54. This Agreement will remain in effect for 10 years from the date of its signature.
55. In accordance with the G7 Joint Declaration of 12 July 2023, the   Participants share the opinion that this Agreement is without prejudice   to Ukraine pursuing a pathway toward future membership in NATO.
56. The Participants will, if necessary, designate authorised bodies   for the development and implementation of bilateral arrangements in   accordance with the areas of cooperation specified in this Agreement.
57. The authorised bodies of the Participants may conclude executive   and technical arrangements on specific areas of cooperation within the   framework of the implementation of this Agreement or supplementary to   this Agreement.
58. This Agreement may be brought to an end by either Participant at   any time by written notice to the other Participant. The Agreement will   be discontinued six months from the date of receipt of such notice.
59. This Agreement may be amended and supplemented, including by   adding annexes thereto, by mutual consent of the Participants, which   will be made in writing.
60. Any difference in the interpretation and implementation of this   Agreement will be settled amicably through direct consultations between   the Participants.
61. This Agreement will come into effect on the date of signature.

Tuesday, 03 September 2024 11:15 AM
Israel is reportedly expected to change its policy in the occupied West Bank, designating the occupied Palestinian territory as ""the second most critical front, immediately after Gaza"" where the regime is waging a genocidal war.
The daily Israel Hayom reported on Tuesday that recent tensions have convinced the occupying regime's top officials that they can no longer view the West Bank as a ""secondary arena"" requiring stable maintenance.
Although the directive to classify the West Bank as a ""combat zone"" is still in its initial stages, a series of attacks across the occupied territory are imminent, the report added.
It also noted that Israeli raids ""are set to continue in the foreseeable future"" as two brigade combat teams are currently deployed in the Jenin refugee camp and the city of Tulkarm.
""The Jenin operation is just the beginning,"" the report cited security officials as saying.
On August 28, the Israeli military launched a massive West Bank assault, deploying hundreds of troops and conducting airstrikes on Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the usurping regime.
Local Palestinian resistance forces have been confronting the invading Israeli military since the start of the aggression, which is the largest in the occupied West Bank in more than two decades.
""Our fighters are fighting fierce battles with the enemy forces storming Tulkarm camp and are showering the infantry forces in the camp's alleys with heavy barrages of bullets, achieving direct hits,"" the Tulkarm Brigades, the local branch of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's al-Quds Brigades, said on Tuesday.
So far, at least 31 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's West Bank assault, according to the official WAFA news agency.
Israeli forces and settlers have also killed almost 680 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since 7 October, 2023 when the regime launched its brutal Gaza onslaught."

During a visit to the United States as part of a Ukrainian delegation headed by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yuliia Svyrydenko, Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak met with U.S. military and security experts.
The meeting was also attended by Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umerov, Deputy Minister of Defense Oleksandr Balanutsa, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Volodymyr Horbatiuk, Chief of the Main Logistics Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Mykola Shevtsov, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Mykola Tochytskyi and Advisor to the Head of the Presidential Office Dariia Zarivna.
During the meeting, the prospects for cooperation on joint arms production were discussed. The parties shared their perspectives and exchanged recommendations on further steps in this direction.
Rustem Umerov informed in detail about the situation on the battlefield.
The Head of the Presidential Office noted that Russia continues to systematically destroy our country's energy infrastructure and emphasized the importance of strengthening Ukraine's air defense. This week alone, Russia has fired over 400 missiles and drones of various types at Ukraine.
In addition, the Head of the Presidential Office pointed out that Ukraine needs partners' assistance to increase the production of long-range weapons, including strike drones and cruise missiles."
SY0IMI0OP8_PGHYW84AQ1I7LZG,North Korea may have executed officials over flood damage: spy agency,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2024/dprk-240904-rfa01.htm,"Heavy rains in late July flooded large areas along the Amnok River on the northern border.
By Taejun Kang for RFA 2024.09.04 -- North Korea is suspected of executing a number of officials held responsible for devastating floods this year and South Korea's spy agency said it was ""monitoring signs"" to try to determine what had happened.
The agency's announcement came a day after a South Korean broadcaster reported that up to 30 officials in flood-hit regions of North Korea had been shot to death.
Heavy rains in July flooded large areas along the Amnok River in North Korea's North Pyongan, Jagang and Ryanggang provinces with some South Korean media outlets reporting that more than 1,000 people were killed or were missing.
At that time, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said that he would punish officials for the damage, which a South Korean government ministry said appeared to be an attempt by Kim's to dodge blame for the disaster.
Since then, Kang Pong Hun, the chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the North's ruling party, and other senior officials, including Public Security Minister Ri Thae Sop, were dismissed from their posts over the flood damage, according to North Korea's state-media.
The South's National Intelligence Service, or NIS, said Kang was possibly among the executed officials.
NIS's announcement came a day after South Korea's TV Chosun cited an unidentified South Korean government source as saying North Korean officials deemed responsible for the flood disaster had likely been executed.
""We understand late last month, 20 to 30 officials in the affected region were shot to death, including Kang Pong Hun"" TV Chosun quoted the official as saying.
Since the disaster, the North's state media have featured Kim leading flood relief efforts, emphasizing his concern for the victims, but it has given no details of casualties.
South Korea said that there was a high possibility of casualties given that North Korea was reporting the rescue effort in such detail.
A resident of the northwestern province of North Pyongan told Radio Free Asia Korean, on condition of anonymity for security reasons, that residents affected by the flood were forced to watch propaganda videos that portrayed Kim as a hero and were told they must avoid showing even a hint of sadness on their faces.
Another resident told RFA Korean that soldiers mobilized to rebuild flood-hit towns were stealing food and other supplies because they have been given none by the government, upsetting residents.
North Korea reportedly declined a rescue offer from China, and did not respond to a South Korean offer of aid.
But the North's official Korean Central News Agency reported in August that Russian President Vladimir Putin offered humanitarian assistance to help North Korea cope with flood damage in another sign of expanding relations between the two nations.
Russia's state-run Tass news agency carried a similar report, saying that Putin told Kim in a message: ""You can always count on our assistance and support.""

20240831
MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The administration of US President Joe Biden has abandoned the idea to ââsend American contractors to Ukraine to maintain F-16 fighter jets due to concerns about safety, instead suggesting that European countries take responsibility for servicing the fighters, US media reported, citing US officials.
On Thursday, the Ukrainian air force confirmed media reports that a US-made F-16 jet, which was transferred to Ukraine by its Western partners, crashed on Monday just weeks after the first batch of such aircraft was delivered to Kiev.
The report said that according to officials, the US National Security Council considered the proposal to send civilian contractors to Ukraine to maintain F-16s and other weaponry, but the intelligence community deemed it too risky, so the hope instead is that European countries will take on more responsibility for the maintenance.
""The intelligence community raised concerns over the prospect of Russia targeting American contractors in Ukraine,"" a US official told the WSJ.
However, according to the report, the US administration does not rule out that US contractors could be sent to Ukraine in the future.
Russia has been conducting its special military operation since February 2022. President Vladimir Putin has said the operation aims to ""protect people subjected to genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years."" According to the president, the ultimate goal of the operation is to completely liberate Donbas and create conditions that guarantee Russia's security.
Russia earlier sent a note to NATO because of arms supplies to Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said any cargo that contains weapons for Ukraine will become a legitimate target for Russia.

01 September 2024  From U.S. Fleet Forces Command Public Affairs
NORFOLK, Va. -- The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Laboon (DDG 58) returned to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, from an independent deployment to the U.S. 2nd, 5th, and 6th fleet areas of operation, Sept. 1.
Laboon deployed for 279 days to the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea providing deterrence and defense to U.S. partners.
Rear Adm. Kavon Hakimzadeh, commander, Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 2, was on the pier to welcome home the crew of Laboon.  ""We are honored to welcome back the men and women of USS Laboon who have proven their proficiency and resolve throughout a demanding deployment,"" said Hakimzadeh. ""From safeguarding critical maritime routes to deterring threats in volatile regions, Laboon's crew has exemplified the very best of our Navy's tradition of excellence. We are deeply proud of what they have accomplished, and we thank each Sailor and their families for their unwavering dedication to our nation's security.""
While independently deployed, Laboon participated in the multi-national Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb, and Gulf of Aden. In support of freedom of navigation, Laboon and her crew countered multiple attacks carried out by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in the Red Sea.
""It has been a challenging nine month deployment to hostile waters, but this team demonstrated time and again just how capable our warships are and that we have the best trained most professional warfighters in the world ready to bring the fight to any enemy,"" said Cmdr. Eric Blomberg, Laboon's commanding officer.
Chief Petty Officer Rickey Gisclair attributes Laboon's success to training and teamwork.
""This deployment really embodied why we train so hard and every Sailor stepping up to fulfill their role in a challenging environment,"" said Gisclair.  While on deployment, a refrain heard frequently onboard was: ""If we have to fight; we fight and we win!"" Laboon is named for Pittsburgh, Pa. native John Francis Laboon who left to serve his country as a U.S. Naval officer. After attending Carnegie Technical Institute (now Carnegie Mellon University), he was commissioned at the Naval Academy and served as the communications officer, gunnery and torpedo officer and executive officer on USS Peto (SS 265), a Gato-class submarine in World War II. During a Western Pacific patrol, while under intense enemy fire, he rescued a downed pilot from heavily-mined waters and was awarded the Silver Star. Shortly after the war, he left the Navy only to be called back to duty as a Chaplain to become Father John Francis Laboon or ""Father Jake.""
During their 5th Fleet operations, Laboon upheld the tradition of Father Jake, rescuing three mariners in distress in the Gulf of Aden who had been stranded adrift at sea for ten days.
U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations encompasses about 2.5 million square miles of water area and includes the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Red Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean. The expanse comprises of 20 countries and includes three critical choke points at the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal and the Bab al-Mandeb.  NAVEUR-NAVAF, headquartered in Naples, Italy, operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.
U.S. 2nd Fleet, reestablished in 2018 in response to the changing global security environment, develops and employs maritime forces ready to fight across multiple domains in the Atlantic and Arctic to ensure access, deter aggression, and defend U.S., allied, and partner interests.
U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) is responsible for manning, training, equipping and employing more than 125 ships, 1,000 aircraft, and 103,000 active duty service members and government employees, and providing combat-ready forces forward to numbered fleets and combatant commanders around the globe in support of U.S. national interests. USFFC also serves as the Navy's Service Component Commander to both U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Strategic Command, and providing naval forces in support of joint missions as Commander, Naval Forces Northern Command (NAVNORTH) and Commander, Naval Forces Strategic Command (NAVSTRAT). USFFC is the Strategic Command Joint Force Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC STRAT), and executes Task Force Atlantic in coordination with U.S. Naval Forces Europe."
T93OLBUYH6_W0ZRO86Z3EGHC1H,Top opposition party official arrested in Phnom Penh on incitement charge,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-rfa02.htm,"Chin Bunnaroth is leader of the Nation Power Party, formed last year.
By RFA Khmer 2024.09.03 -- A high-ranking official with a new Cambodian opposition party, the Nation Power Party, was arrested Monday and charged with incitement, in what the party said was an attempt to intimidate government opponents.
Chin Bunnaroth, the party's director-general of administration in southern Takeo province, was arrested by six civilian-clothes police officers in Phnom Penh on Monday, according to a National Power Party statement.
No arrest warrant was presented and it was unclear what prompted the ""incitement to cause serious social chaos"" charge, the party said.
The ruling Cambodian People's Party, or CPP, often puts pressure on police to arrest political opposition members on politically motivated charges - particularly in the run-up to elections to ensure its own politicians retain power or win new seats in contested areas.
Last May's local elections featured a crackdown on opposition activists, including the arrests of three opposition party members on May 9.
The Nation Power Party's president, Sun Chanthy, was one of the three. He was arrested at Phnom Penh International Airport upon his return from Japan, where he had addressed Cambodian supporters. He was also charged with incitement.
Another example of intimidation
Chin Bunnaroth was placed under pre-trial detention at Prey Sar prison in Phnom Penh on Tuesday, according to National Police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun.
The Nation Power Party called on the government to unconditionally release Chin Bunnaroth. The arrest was another example of the government's use of the courts to threaten and intimidate political activists, the party said in its statement.
Rong Chhun, a prominent labor activist and an adviser to the Nation Power Party, told Radio Free Asia that the arrest appeared to violate human rights principles.
Eventually, arresting political opponents will have a negative effect on Cambodia's international reputation and could severely damage the investment and tourism climate, he said.
""The party's statement is a political issue,"" Chhay Kim Khoeun told RFA. ""I have nothing to say. We just enforce the law by following the court's order.""
The Nation Power Party was formed in 2023 by breakaway members of the Candlelight Party, the main political organization opposing the government under the CPP, which has ruled the country since 1979.
The party has stated that it wants to promote a truly democratic Cambodia through free, fair and equitable elections.

Several Arab countries have dismissed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's allegations that weapons are being smuggled to the Palestinian Hamas resistance group through the Egyptian border.
The Jordanian Foreign Ministry expressed its rejection of Netanyahu's statements about the Philadelphi Corridor - a demilitarized area along Egypt's border with Gaza - stressing they are ""baseless allegations aimed at obstructing the mediation efforts undertaken by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States to reach a swap deal leading to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.""
It reiterated its ""full solidarity with Egypt in confronting all Israeli claims.""
The ministry rejected ""all claims promoted by Israeli officials in futile attempts to justify the Israeli aggression on Gaza and the occupied West Bank"" and said it considers the accusations to be a ""condemnable incitement and an escalation that aggravates the serious tension in the region.""
In his first public address since Sunday's mass protests that saw hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers urging a deal with Hamas for the release of captives being held in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu said he will not relinquish Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor.
Netanyahu claimed the corridor is vital to ensuring Hamas cannot rearm via tunnels. ""This is the oxygen of Hamas,"" he said.
""No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me. ... No one will preach to me on this issue,"" he further claimed.
The Qatari Foreign Ministry also voiced ""full solidarity with the brotherly Arab Republic of Egypt and its rejection of the statements made by the prime minister of the Israeli occupation.""
It said that through remarks, Netanyahu ""tried to use Egypt's name to distract Israeli public opinion and obstruct joint mediation efforts aimed at a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the exchange of captives and detainees.""
""The Israeli occupation's approach based on an attempt to falsify facts and mislead world public opinion by repeating lies will ultimately lead to the demise of peace efforts and the expansion of violence in the region,"" it warned.
It also stressed the need ""to strengthen regional and international efforts to oblige Israel to immediately end its brutal aggression on the Gaza Strip, in preparation for addressing the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Strip.""
For its part, the Palestinian presidency also condemned ""statements made by Netanyahu aimed at justifying the continuation of the aggression against our people.""
It expressed appreciation for ""the Egyptian role in opposing the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land.""
Additionally, the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry accused Israel of trying ""to hinder joint mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar, and the US that aim to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.""
Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Oman also joined the Arab countries' solidarity with Egypt in the face of Netanyahu's allegations.
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Netanyahu's claims, lambasting Israel for attempting to ""derail efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and perpetuate ongoing violations by Israeli forces.""
It rejected Israel's attempts to distort truth and mislead the international community about the border area between Gaza and Egypt.
The ministry went on to call for ""intensified regional and international efforts to pressure Israel to end its aggression in Gaza immediately, and to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the territory.""
The Saudi Foreign Ministry also censured Netanyahu's remarks, describing them as ""baseless"" and part of an ""ongoing attempt to justify Israel's continuous violations of international laws and norms.""
Riyadh warned that such provocative comments only undermined mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire in Gaza."

The Turkish president says Israel must be prevented from ""plunging the whole region into war,"" warning the West against widespread support for the regime.
Erdogan, speaking in a press conference in Ankara along with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, said some states continue to provide ""unconditional support to Israel"".
""In this fashion, they are accessories to Israel's crimes,"" Al Jazeera quoted Erdogan as saying. ""They are accomplices to their crimes in the massacres and pogroms perpetrated against the civilian population of Gaza.""
Erdogan said the Israeli regime, in addition to dropping thousands of tonnes of bombs on civilians, has continued to conduct a starvation war on Gaza.
""Each and every Palestinian citizen or child who dies of starvation remains the responsibility of Israel, and those backing Israel,"" Erdogan said.
The Egyptian president said the situation in Gaza was an ""unprecedented catastrophe.""
Sisi also called for ""a stop to the escalation in the West Bank"", where Israel has been leading a deadly campaign since last week.
""I reiterate the joint stand of Egypt and Turkey calling for an immediate ceasefire, rejecting further escalation by Israel in the occupied West Bank, and taking tangible measures to live up to the aspiration of the Palestinian people for the establishment of an independent state based on 1967 borders with [occupied] East Al-Quds as its capital,"" he said.
In the meeting in Ankara, which was held during the first such visit by an Egyptian leader in years, the two sides said they wanted to deepen cooperation.
""We will strengthen our cooperation in all areas,"" said Erdogan, who visited Sisi in Cairo in mid-February, when the two leaders said they had turned over a ""new leaf"" in bilateral ties.
Ankara and Cairo cut ties in 2013 after Sisi, then defense minister, ousted President Mohamed Morsi, an ally of Turkey and a Muslim Brotherhood figure.
On Wednesday, the two leaders signed 17 cooperation agreements, according to the Turkish presidency.
""We want to improve our cooperation with Egypt in the domain of energy, especially natural gas and nuclear power,"" Erdogan said.
Despite a decade of estrangement, trade between the two countries never ceased: Turkey is Egypt's 5th largest trading partner. Egypt is Turkey's largest in Africa."

A high-ranking official with the Palestinian Hamas resistance movement says the six Israeli captives found dead in a tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip were killed in Israeli airstrikes against the besieged coastal territory.
""The ones who kill our people daily are the Israeli colonizers with American weapons. The captives found in Gaza were not killed by us but by the relentless Zionist bombardment,"" Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, said in a statement on Sunday.
He further criticized the United States, saying, ""If President [Joe] Biden truly cares about the lives of Israeli hostages, he should cease his support for this enemy with money and weapons and pressure Israel to end its aggression immediately.""
Rishq emphasized that Hamas had been more concerned about the lives of the hostages than Biden himself, citing Hamas's agreement to a ceasefire proposal and the UN Security Council's resolution, both of which were rejected by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Earlier on Sunday, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, alleged that Hamas murdered the six captives, whose bodies were found inside a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
The Israeli army identified them as 23-year-old Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Ori Danino, 25; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Almog Sarusi, 27; Alexander Lobanov, 33; and Carmel Gat, 40.
Hamas has offered to release Israeli captives in return for an end to the genocidal war on Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners.
Netanyahu has taken a tough line in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, and repeatedly said that military pressure is needed to bring home the captives.
According to Israeli media, he has feuded with the regime's high-profile officials who have said a deal should be struck urgently.
Hamas has said that dozens of captives were killed by Israeli airstrikes targeting Gaza.
Israel launched the war on Gaza on October 7 last year after Palestinian resistance groups carried out a surprise retaliatory operation into the occupied territories.
So far, the regime has killed at least 40,691 Gazans, most of them women, children, and adolescents. Another 94,060 Palestinians have sustained injuries as well."

Eswatini's King Mswati III's plans to wed Nomcebo Zuma, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, as his 16th wife. Political analysts dismiss the union's geopolitical impact but see its potential in strengthening ties between the two leaders.
A royal delegation from Eswatini, also known as Swaziland, visited Jacob Zuma's homestead at Nkandla in July in accordance with tradition, marking the start of Mswati's marriage proposal to Zuma.
Political analyst Mandla Hlatshwayo sees this union as a strategic move, cementing economic and political interests.
""President Zuma's role and capacity to be a major ambassador for Swaziland or the Swazi royal family is a noncontestable issue and has become even far more important in my view with the development or the emergence of MK [uMkhonto weSizwe] as a political party with President Zuma as its absolute president.""
Sicelo Mngomezulu, a Swazi-born, South Africa-based lawyer, downplays the political impact of the marriage, arguing that Zuma's diminished role in South African politics renders him unable to influence Swazi politics.
However, he foresees the marriage ""strengthening bilateral relations between the king of Swaziland and the former president, as we know by now that the former president of South Africa and king are actually business partners in some shape or form ... and so, we expect that part of their relationship will actually blossom.""
Zuma is expected to go on trial on multiple corruption and racketeering charges next April. He has pleaded not guilty.
Meanwhile, Mswati has been criticized for his controversial polygamy and lavish lifestyle. Former Eswatini lawmaker Mduduzi Simelane points out the king's wedding will be expensive.
""Firstly, this high-profile wedding, with its steep dowry of 100 cattle and R2 million [2 million rands, or USD $113,300] and all the other hidden costs associated with a wedding of this nature, puts a significant strain on Swaziland's economy. Secondly, within royal circles, this union has also been met with internal opposition among the royal wives. ... This marriage will cause an uproar.""
Eswatini High Court lawyer Sibusiso Nhlabatsi agrees that whether seen as a strategic union of two powerful families or a personal decision to extend influence and financial gain, the king's marriage to Nomcebo Zuma will have a lasting impact on the two nations' ties, for better or worse."

By Yang Sheng, Zhao Yusha and Liu Caiyu Published: Sep 03, 2024 12:44 AM
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday started holding bilateral events with foreign leaders who will attend the 2024 Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), set to run from Wednesday to Friday in Beijing.
On Monday alone, President Xi had bilateral meetings with leaders from African countries including South Africa, Guinea, Eritrea, Seychelles, Djibouti, Togo, Comoros, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to the Xinhua News Agency.
Over the years, the solidarity and cooperation between China, the largest developing country, and Africa, the continent with the most developing countries, have continued to benefit the nations involved, setting an example for how Global South countries can unite to foster common growth and sustainable development.
The high level of mutual trust, as well as the fruitful cooperation between China and Africa, are related to the traditional friendship, as China and African countries share historical experiences of suffering imperialist invasion, a common need for social and economic development, and similar perspectives and demands regarding the international order and global governance, experts said, adding that these are the reasons why both sides have always understood and respected each other.
During his meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday, Xi said China will open its door wider to African countries, adding that the country stands ready to work with South Africa and other African countries to create new momentum for cooperation and promote high-quality development of China-Africa cooperation, Xinhua reported.
The more complex the international situation becomes, the more the Global South countries must uphold independence, strengthen unity and cooperation, and jointly safeguard international fairness and justice, Xi said.
Munetsi Madakufamba, executive director of the Zimbabwe-based Southern African Research and Documentation Center, told the Global Times that ""The development approach and cooperation between China and Africa are a win-win partnership, emphasizing the importance of understanding each other's context, circumstances, and development priorities. If you look at the development experience of Africa and in terms of cooperation with the West, it has been a kind of relationship of one side exploiting the other, which is unbalanced development.""
Unlike Western powers that often interfere in the internal affairs of African countries, China proposes a ""five-no"" approach to cooperation with African countries: no interference in their pursuit of development paths that fit their national conditions, no interference in their internal affairs, no imposition of will, no attachment of political strings to assistance, and no seeking of selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.
Advance modernization
According to the announcement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the theme of the 2024 FOCAC Summit is ""Joining Hands to Advance Modernization and Build a High-Level China-Africa Community with a Shared Future.""
During his meeting with DRC President Felix Tshisekedi on Monday, Xi stressed that ""at the upcoming FOCAC summit, China and Africa will announce a new positioning of China-Africa relations and a series of major measures for jointly advancing modernization, thereby drawing a new blueprint for China-Africa relations,"" the Xinhua News Agency reported.
Analysts from China and Africa reached by the Global Times said that the remarks by the Chinese president at the upcoming FOCAC Summit will attract global attention and send a new message on China-Africa ties, and will keep guiding the way for China-Africa cooperation to withstand the challenges and to seek opportunities in a turbulent world.
The COVID-19 pandemic, along with pending global hot spot issues, brought brand new variables to the world, and further exposed the conflict between multilateralism and unilateralism, and the unprecedented and profound challenges faced by the global governance system, said Joseph Olivier Mendo'o, a scholar from Cameroon and executive director of the international exchange department of the China Africa Business Council.
""China-Africa cooperation is setting a model not only for South-South cooperation, but also for the world's development and cooperation at large"" in a world beset by turbulence and profound change, said the scholar.
According to an old saying in Chinese, ""it is always better to teach a hungry person to fish than to give him a fish,"" Li Haidong, a professor from the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. ""And this is why China attached great importance to cooperation with Africa on vocational training and inter-governmental exchange on governance, which allows African countries to not just rely on major economies from outside, but also to become mature economic entities and markets in the global industrial chain,"" he said.
Inspiring partners
In his meeting with Malian President Assimi Goita on Monday, Xi said China has consistently supported African people's right to independently determine their future, and is willing to work with Mali and other African countries to support each other in pursuing modernization paths suited to their national conditions.
Goita said Mali appreciates China's efforts and contributions in promoting regional and global peace and development and looks forward to closer multilateral coordination with China.
As a partner that advances modernization and industrialization with Africa, China has many unique advantages, which allows it to comprehensively participate in and even become a part of Africa's industrialization, said Mendo'o.
""China is an inspiring partner in African countries' poverty reduction efforts,"" and hence ""many African countries have shown an interest in adapting China's experience to their national context,"" he said.
""China is an important source of machinery and tech transfer (inbound trade) for African countries,"" Mendo'o noted.
""When Africa achieves real modernization and industrialization, it will lead to a better world. This transformation will benefit everyone globally, as it will bring balance across the planet,"" Madakufamba said."

Saturday, 31 August 2024 2:30 AM
In two separate attacks, at least 3 Israeli settlers have been injured in the occupied West Bank.
Media reports said on Friday the incidents happened in two different Israeli settlements.
The first incident took place close to a gas station near Al-Quds where a vehicle exploded, injuring two settlers.
The Israeli military says the man behind the attack was shot and killed.
Separately, in an attempted car ramming attack a settler was injured near Al-Khalil.
The regime troops said the person responsible was shot and killed.
The operations come against the backdrop of Israel's large-scale incursion into the occupied West Bank.
The regime has killed over 670 Palestinians in the West Bank since it started genocide in the Gaza Strip last October.
Israeli assaults on refugee camps and towns in the West Bank are a near-daily occurrence and have intensified since October 7.
Since then, Israel has killed at least 40,600 people and wounded another 93,778 in the besieged Gaza Strip
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, al-Haq and Al Mezan Center for Human Rights have warned of escalating violence in the West Bank and the use of tactics by Israeli forces that the world has witnessed in its war on Gaza.
In a landmark opinion on July 19, the International Court of Justice declared Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian land unlawful and demanded the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East al-Quds.
Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East al-Quds, areas Palestinians want for a future independent state, in a 1967 war."

Tuesday, 03 September 2024 10:17 AM
Israel continues to commit more massacres against Palestinians in Gaza, as its genocidal war on the besieged strip enters its 333rd day.
Palestinian media reports said dozens of people were killed and injured in Israeli air and artillery strikes that hit residential buildings, tents sheltering displaced people and streets across Gaza on Tuesday.
Gaza's Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, said an artillery shelling killed one person and wounded many others in the Zeitoun neighborhood, south of Gaza City.
He added that the bodies of four women from the al-Arja family were also recovered after an Israeli strike on the al-Tannour neighborhood, east of Rafah city.
A Palestinian man was also killed in an Israeli attack near al-Fardows school in Mawasi in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.
Another man and his three-year-old son were also killed in an Israeli strike that targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Gaza's southern city of Khan Yunis in the early hours of Tuesday.
This comes as the death toll from the Israeli attack on a bread queue in northern Jabalia has risen to eight people. A number of people were also injured in the attack that took place on Monday evening.
Also on Monday evening, a bombing in southern al-Mawasi killed two children, and another raid on al-Karama area in northern Gaza City claimed the lives of at least four people.
Polio outbreak and deepening humanitarian crisis
Israel's relentless assaults on Gaza, including its health care and public health infrastructure, and the complete blockade imposed on the strip have also taken a heavy toll on the under-resourced health system in the territory.
On Monday, the aid group MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, stressed that Israel's destruction of Gaza's infrastructure was behind the polio outbreak in Gaza.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, children in central Gaza continue to receive polio vaccines on Tuesday.
The campaign in central Gaza will continue until Wednesday evening, while children in southern and northern Gaza will get their doses starting from Thursday and Monday, respectively.
Some 158,992 children have so far received their doses as part of the campaign that aims to vaccinate 640,000 children under 10.
The campaign began after Israeli agreed to limited pauses in fighting to allow health workers to vaccinate the children against polio, after the first confirmed case in Gaza in 25 years was recorded.
These so-called ""humanitarian pauses"" are not a ceasefire deal in Gaza that mediators, including Qatar and Egypt, have been trying to secure in the past few weeks.
Netanyahu defies Israeli protesters amid failed truce talks
Anger is rising in Tel Aviv amid the failed Gaza truce talks, with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing mounting domestic and international pressure after the killing of six captives in Israeli attacks.
US President Joe Biden said Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure the release of captives.
Despite international pressure and mass protests in the occupied territories calling for a deal to secure the return of Israeli captives held in Gaza, Netanyahu refuses to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, which is a major obstacle to a ceasefire deal being reached.
""This is the oxygen of Hamas,"" he said on Monday, adding ""No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me ... No one will preach to me on this issue.""
The Israeli opposition has as slammed Netanyahu for blocking a truce deal with his insistence on continued Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor and central Gaza's Netzarim Corridor.
The opposition blasted Netanyahu's comments that Philadelphi is essential for Israel to achieve its war aims as ""baseless political spin"", saying that Netanyahu had years to retake the corridor and didn't bother, and only sent the Israel troopers to do so eight months into the current war.
Netanyahu's remarks came as angry protests took place in the occupied territories after Israeli forces recovered the corpses of six captives at the weekend.
Israel launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.
The regime's genocidal war on Gaza has so far killed at least 40,786 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 94,224 others. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble."

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Taoiseach of Ireland Simon Harris signed an Agreement on Support for Ukraine and Cooperation between the two countries.
Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ireland has   provided humanitarian, stabilization, and non-lethal military aid to   Ukraine, totaling approximately â¬380 million.
This year, Ireland has committed to providing an additional â¬128   million in non-lethal military support and at least â¬40 million in   humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
Ireland will also supply mine clearance systems and explosive   ordnance disposal equipment, continuing its involvement in the demining   coalition. Additionally, Ireland will explore other potential support   pathways within the capability coalitions of the Ukraine Defense Contact   Group, such as the IT Coalition.
Ireland will ensure the ongoing training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces through EUMAM Ukraine.
Separate sections of the agreement outline humanitarian aid, as well   as support for Ukraine's recovery and reform efforts, particularly on   the path toward EU membership. Ireland will assist in holding Russia   accountable, compensating for damages caused by the aggression, and   further strengthening sanctions pressure on Russia.
Moreover, Ireland will continue its diplomatic efforts to implement   the Peace Formula and participate in the activities of various working   groups and implementation of specific elements of the Formula, including   the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children.

Djibouti's Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf says his country has a proposal that could solve the dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia.
In an interview with VOA's Horn of Africa Service, Youssouf said his country has offered to give Ethiopia access to the port of Tadjoura, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the border with Ethiopia.
He said Djibouti and other countries such as Turkey have been trying to solve the dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia, which ignited at the beginning of this year when Ethiopia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the breakaway region of Somaliland, a deal Somalia sees as an infringement to its sovereignty.
Under the deal, Somaliland would lease 20 kilometers (12 miles) of shoreline to Ethiopia in return for recognition, according to Somaliland officials.
Ethiopia already relies on Djibouti's main port to import most of its goods, using four different terminals, said Youssouf, who is a candidate for the African Union Commission chairperson.
""Djibouti is even ready to hand over a new port, a brand-new port that has been built, a brand-new corridor to the northern border of Djibouti, that corridor will be very helpful to Ethiopia, at least to decrease the cost of transport,"" he said.
""Djibouti is even ready to consider a mix-management of the port with Ethiopia,"" he added.
After no agreement was reached following two rounds of talks in Turkey, Ethiopia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Taye Atske Selassie said he is a confident that ""Ethiopia's legitimate interests to secure dependable access to and from the sea will be fulfilled peacefully in cooperation with our neighbors.""
Somalia is willing to accept giving commercial sea access to Ethiopia but rules out any naval base, said Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
""If Ethiopia wants access to Somalia sea, we welcome it. But we want Ethiopia to have access the same way that Uganda has access to Kenya sea, the same way that Burundi and Rwanda have access to Tanzania sea ... and the same way Ethiopia has access to Djibouti sea,"" he said.
""We are not accepting anything beyond that,"" he added.
Youssouf said Djibouti put the port proposal on the table a month ago and informed Ethiopian leaders, who responded.
""The response we get is a positive one, so they are considering the technicalities of it, so we will certainly in a few days' time or in [a] few weeks, sit down again and put the final adjustments to the formula and see how we can help,"" he said.
Djibouti is a small Horn of Africa country in a strategic maritime location. It hosts military bases for France, the United States, Italy, Japan and China. Youssouf said his country hosts these five militaries because it is neutral and because the maritime route between the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden faces threats from militants, Houthis and, sometimes, piracy.
""The presence of those naval bases in Djibouti is first and foremost to protect, you know, and guarantees the safety of navigation in the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb,"" he said.
Asked if Djibouti's offer includes a naval base for Ethiopia, Youssouf said, ""No.""
""I mean it's [a] small country, which is already crowded, so we have even turned down from other countries â India, Russia, and we told them that it's a very small place, so we don't want to create any friction, any tension between those who are already present,"" he said.
""We need to keep [a] conducive environment for those who are already present to protect the strait of Bab el-Mandeb and fight all kind[s] of illegal acts.""
Youssouf said Djibouti's proposal is based on a plan to restore the ""good relationship"" that used to exist between Ethiopia and Somalia.
The foreign ministries of Somalia and Ethiopia did not immediately respond to VOA requests for comment."

Tuesday, 03 September 2024 5:18 PM
The United States has come close to agreeing on supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles despite warnings from Russia that such moves would lead to ""spiraling tension.""
Despite Washington's initial reluctance to supply US long-range missiles to Ukraine, informed sources cited by media on Tuesday, said the US was now close to agreeing on sending long-range missiles to Ukraine; however, the delivery of them could take months.
Washington's agreement to send long-range missiles will follow the Biden administration's gradual acceptance to provide US tanks and warplanes to the former Soviet republic presently fighting Russia.
Three American officials, who US media said remained anonymous because they were not authorized to talk to the news outlets about the matter, said the inclusion of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) in Kiev's future weapons shipment is expected to be announced.
They said sending JASSMs to Ukraine could significantly alter the strategic landscape of the war by putting more of Russia in range of powerful, precision-guided munitions, an important concern of the Biden administration.
Military analysts George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California described the JASSMs as ""stealthy"".
""They're pretty stealthy, but not completely designed around maximum stealth,"" Herbert said. ""A few years ago, a bunch were fired at Syria after chemical weapons incidents, and Russian air defense systems in the country failed to shoot many down, possibly none of them.
""I would expect that carefully planned missile flight paths would let JASSM be effective almost anywhere in the war area.""
Military experts say the JASSMs, which have a range of 400 to 800 kilometers, could push Russian staging areas and supply depots back by hundreds of kilometers.
They say this would extremely complicate Russia's ability to sustain its offensive operations and potentially provide Ukraine with a strategic advantage.
Since the war started in early 2022, the Western countries support Ukraine in fighting a proxy war against Russia have delivered hundreds of shipments of military equipment, including all kinds of weapons and munitions.
The Western countries even supplied long-range missiles, tanks and warplanes to Ukraine despite initial resistance.
Meanwhile, following Kiev's failed operation in Kursk last month, Russian troops have gained momentum simultaneously attacking Ukrainian forces on both sides.
The Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its troops had liberated two more settlements in the Donetsk region, including Ptyche, just 21km southeast of Pokrovsk, and were ""continuing to advance deep into the enemy defenses.""
Earlier reports said that the Russian troops were also pushing Ukrainian troops out of Kursk.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that the Ukrainian forces' incursion into Russia's Kursk region will not stop Russia's armed forces from advancing in eastern Ukraine, vowing to deal with the Ukrainian ""bandits"" on Russian territory.
""Their calculation was to stop our offensive actions in key parts of the Donbas,"" Putin told a group of students in the republic of Tyva on Monday, adding that ""The result is known... They did not achieve stopping our advance in the Donbas.""
Two-and-a-half years have passed since the conflict between the two neighboring countries turned into a full-fledged war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the aim of a surprise incursion into Russia's southern Kursk region launched last month is to accrue territories and troops for exchange but said, ""We don't need their land.""
""We don't need Russian territory,"" Zelenskiy told NBC News through an interpreter in an interview excerpted on September 3.
""Our operation is aimed at restoring our territorial integrity. We capture Russian troops to replace them with Ukrainian,"" he said. ""We tell them, you know, we need our military soldiers in exchange for Russian ones. The same attitude is to the territories. We don't need their land.""
Since its incursion began in the Kursk region in early August, Kyiv claims to have gained control of more than 1,200 kilometers of Russian territory.
Early reports hinted that the operation was intended to better position Kyiv in the event of peace talks amid some calls for more intense efforts to end the 36-month-old full-scale war.
Ukrainians and analysts have also suggested it is designed to drive the seriousness of the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine home to Russians.
It marked the first foreign invasion of Russian territory since World War II.
Kyiv and some of its allies have argued recently that Western providers of military aid, weapons, and artillery should further lift restrictions on how Ukrainian defense forces can use such supplies, including by allowing strikes deeper inside Russia.
Asked if Ukraine will seek to capture more Russian territory, Zelenskiy replied to NBC in English: ""I will not tell you. Sorry, I can't speak about it.""

Tehran, IRNA -- The Yemeni Armed Forces have announced a new military operation against an Israeli-bound ship in their latest move to support Palestinians in war-ravaged Gaza.
The announcement was made by the Yemeni Army Spokesman Yahya Saree on Saturday.
He said that Libera-flagged Groton ship was targeted in the Gulf of Aden because its owner company violated a Yemeni ban on ships entering ports in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Yemen's ""naval, UAV, and missile forces"" participated in the operation, and ""the ship was hit accurately and directly"", he added.
Saree also said that the Saturday attack was the second on Groton ship this month. The vessel was first targeted on August 3, he added.
The spokesman further noted that the Yemeni armed forces will continue their maritime operations in support of the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank until Israel stops its aggression and lifts its siege on Gaza.
Yemen began its pro-Palestine operations in mid-November and has continued them despite airstrikes by the US and the UK on Yemeni territory, which have been ongoing since mid-January.
Yemen says the strikes by the two Western states are aimed at supporting the Israeli regime.

PRAGUE -- Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic denied having close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and repeatedly batted back the notion that his EU candidate country was a ""Trojan horse"" for Moscow despite its refusal to join European sanctions since Russia invaded Ukraine and other differences with the bloc.
Speaking at the Globsec conference in Prague on August 31, Vucic said he hadn't met or spoken to Putin in at least the two and a half years since Russian troops rolled across the Ukrainian border in February 2022.
""There are no 'both sides,'"" Vucic said. ""We are on the EU path. Yes, we have traditionally very good ties -- and we are not hiding it and I'm not ashamed of that -- with Russia; it has always been the case between Serbs and Russians.""
He said that, while he'd recently had a ""great"" conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who was also in Prague this week, ""Nobody in Europe agrees with me on this issue, but everybody in Europe understands my position.""
He added that he thinks Serbia has implemented its growth and reform agenda ""better than anyone else.""
Serbia and Turkey are the only EU candidate countries that have avoided imposing sanctions on Russia.
Serbian officials, particularly current Vice Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin, have maintained close ties with Moscow since the invasion of Ukraine.
Alongside his Montenegrin counterpart in Prague, President Jakov Milatovic, Vucic called on his EU partners to show more trust in Serbia's intention to join.
He said the process depends not on Serbia's relations with Russia but primarily on normalizing relations with Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. Belgrade does not recognize its former province's sovereignty.
""Yes, we are on [an] EU path, and the biggest problem for Serbia...is our relationship with Pristina,"" Vucic said. ""It's not all this stuff on Ukraine, because all these big political decisionmakers, they know everything.""
""It's all about this, and this is a very difficult issue for us; everybody knows it,"" Vucic said.
Kosovo and Serbia have been negotiating normalization since 2011 through the Brussels dialogue, supervised by the EU.
""The goal is to establish mutual trust between Serbia and the EU, not to view Serbia as a Russian 'Trojan horse,'"" Vucic said.
Vucic disagreed with Milatovic regarding the EU perspective. Milatovic took an ""optimistic position,"" predicting that Montenegro could become an EU member by 2029, while Vucic said Serbian integration would not be possible before 2030.

Two people have been killed in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in south Lebanon, the health ministry says.
The ministry said the attack hit the car in the border town of Naqoura early Monday, but did not provide information about the identity of the victims.
Separately, the Israeli army claimed that it had carried out overnight airstrikes on ""military buildings"" belonging to the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah in Yaroun, Ayta al-Shab, Hanine, Tayr Harfa and Blida in southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging deadly fire since early October last year, shortly after the regime launched a genocidal war against the Gaza Strip following a surprise operation by its resistance groups.
Hezbollah has vowed to keep up its retaliatory attacks as long as the Israeli regime continues its Gaza war, which has so far killed at least 40,786 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 94,224.
Hezbollah officials have repeatedly said they do not want a war with Israel while stressing that they are prepared in case it occurs.
The Lebanese resistance movement on August 25 conducted a large drone and rocket attack ""accurately and effectively"" against Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander, in an Israeli airstrike on a building in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh on July 30.
Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah called the retaliatory strikes ""Arbaeen Operation,"" reiterating that the main targets were the spy bases and the air defense bases."

By Taejun Kang for RFA 2024.09.03 -- China has adopted a resolution condemning a series of U.S. sanctions against the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and providing support for affected companies, state media reported.
The U.S. introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or UFLPA, in 2022 with the goal of ensuring that American entities are not funding forced labor among ethnic minorities in the region.
As of August this year, Americans were banned from doing business with 73 companies on the act's Entity List, although a broader prohibition on importing any goods produced even in part by the slave labor of Uyghurs was already in place.
All 73 blacklisted companies are accused of either working directly with local authorities in Xinjiang region, where the majority of the mostly Muslim minority live, to forcibly employ imprisoned Uyghurs, or else of sourcing inputs from companies that do so.
The sanctioned companies are involved in industries such as textiles and clothing, and silicon-based solar products.
The Chinese resolution, which took effect on Monday, aims to ""expose to both the international community and the people of Xinjiang, what is clearly the U.S. sinister intention in implementing sanctions against Xinjiang, to reveal the U.S. suppression of the region's enterprises and its undermining of Xinjiang's social stability and development,"" Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.
""The rights of workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are guaranteed and people live harmonious lives,"" the resolution stated, according to Xinhua.
""However, neglecting these facts and such progress, the U.S. maliciously slanders the human rights situation in Xinjiang,"" it said.
""U.S. unilateral sanctions and the implementation of long-arm jurisdiction violate international law and business ethics, undermine the stability of global industrial and supply chains, and disrupt the international trade order.""
Calling the UFLPA ""unwarranted,"" the news agency said the resolution urged the U.S. to ""restore a fair market environment for sanctioned enterprises, a development environment in which people in Xinjiang can pursue a happy life, and a fair economic, trade and rule of law environment for the international community.""
Under the resolution, local governments are encouraged to help sanctioned companies expand their domestic and international markets, promote their products, boost innovation, and strengthen the appeal of company brands, according to Xinhua.
Since 2021, the U.S. government has accused China of carrying out a campaign of ""genocide"" against Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, including by sterilizing women, banning the exercise of culture and imprisoning many Uyghurs in high-security internment camps.
Escaped Uyghurs report being forced to work for Chinese companies for little or no money in order to leave the camps.
Beijing denies that any genocide or slavery is taking place and has defended what it says are ""poverty alleviation"" programs providing training in vocational skills.
""These sanctions have embarrassed Chinese officials and affected the export of Chinese goods,"" said human rights lawyer Teng Biao.
Biao noted, however, that it was unusual for a resolution related to the United States to come from a regional government, and not the National People's Congress in Beijing.
Xinjiang party members may be trying to obtain economic support for regional industries from the central government, according to China expert Raymond Kuo at the Rand Corporation, a Washington think tank.
""The Chinese economy is not doing great right now,"" he said.

Monday, 02 September 2024 7:32 AM
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi says the Islamic Republic supports any ceasefire deal agreed by the Palestinians and the resistance movement Hamas.
Abbas Araqchi made the remarks during a phone call with his Bulgarian counterpart Ivan Kondov on Sunday.
During the conversation, Araqchi pointed to the situation in Gaza and the Palestinians' dire need for humanitarian aid, saying, ""Iran supports any agreement accepted by Palestinians and Hamas [that aims] to achieve ceasefire and provide a ground for sending humanitarian aid to Gaza,"" he said.
That comes as a new round of ceasefire talks, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US, has recently been resumed.
The Cairo talks come as the humanitarian situation in Gaza is further deteriorating, with malnutrition soaring and polio discovered in the Palestinian territory.
Israel launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.
The regime's bloody onslaught on Gaza has so far killed at least 40,738 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 94,154 others. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble.
Elsewhere in his remarks, Araqchi expressed Tehran's keenness to enhance cooperation with Sofia, particularly in the economic field.
Kondov also voiced his country's readiness to strengthen bilateral ties with Iran.
In their telephone conversation, the two ministers also discussed consular issues.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who emerged victorious in the second round of the presidential vote on July 5, has stressed that the Islamic Republic's principled policy is to foster peace and friendship, prevent tensions and interact with world countries."

JERUSALEM, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of Israelis rallied across the country on Sunday, demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas to secure the return of hostages held in Gaza.
According to Israel's Ynet news site, around 700,000 people participated in demonstrations on main roads and at junctions nationwide, with 550,000 attending the central rally in Tel Aviv. The protests began in the morning after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the recovery of six hostages' bodies and continued through the night.
In Tel Aviv, an emotional demonstration took place outside the Kirya military base, the IDF's headquarters. Protesters waved Israeli flags and chanted ""A deal -- Now!"" Many carried posters featuring the hostages. There are still 101 hostages in Gaza, with about half presumed dead due to either Hamas attacks or Israeli bombings.
Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, addressed the crowd, claiming that there is ""a deal proposal on the table"" but that Netanyahu refuses to accept it to avoid losing support from his coalition of pro-settler leaders.
Later in the night, thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv set fire on the Ayalon Highway, temporarily blocking the main freeway. Police said they dispersed the crowd and reported at least 12 arrests nationwide.
By nightfall, cinemas, theaters, museums, universities, restaurants, cafes, pubs, and other businesses across the country closed in solidarity with the protest.
The demonstrations are expected to continue into Monday with a general strike. Arnon Bar-David, secretary-general of the Histadrut, Israel's largest workers' organization, announced the strike on live television, accusing Netanyahu of hindering the deal due to ""political considerations.""
The protests followed the recovery of the bodies of two women and four men from Gaza. The IDF said they were killed in a Hamas tunnel shortly before soldiers arrived.
The six had been captured alive on Oct. 7, 2023, during Hamas's surprise attack on Israeli communities, which killed about 1,200 people and resulted in the capture of approximately 250 others."

Location  Washingtion, DC  United States
Remarks as Prepared for Delivery
Good afternoon, everyone.
We launched the Election Threats Task Force to respond to a dangerous increase in violent threats against the public servants who administer our elections.
We did so because countless Americans were enduring terrible threats simply for doing their civic duty.
And we did so because threats to election workers constitute threats to our democracy itself.
In just a few minutes, the Task Force here will meet to discuss its continuing work in advance of the upcoming elections.
But before we begin, I want to address the tragic shooting that occurred this morning at a high school in Winder, Georgia.
We are still gathering information, but FBI and ATF are on the scene working with state, local, and federal partners.
I am devastated for the families who have been affected by this terrible tragedy.
The Justice Department stands ready to provide any resources or support the Winder community needs in the days ahead.
Before I get to the work of the Task Force, I also want to announce two major law enforcement actions the Justice Department is taking that are separate from the important work of this Task Force, but are part of our broader effort to protect our elections from unlawful interference of any kind.
First, this morning, we unsealed an indictment in the Southern District of New York of Konstantine Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, two Russia-based employees of RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet. They are charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
That law, enacted nearly a century ago, was enacted to ensure that the American people were informed when a foreign power engages in political activities or seeks to influence public discourse.
The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda. The company never disclosed to the â I'm sorry.
And that is what we allege happened in this case.
In the wake of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, RT â which was then known as Russia Today â was dropped by its American distributors. The company ceased its formal operations in the United States. And the European Union, the U.K., and Canada banned RT's broadcasting.
But, as RT itself has boasted, the Government of Russia continued to use RT to direct disinformation and propaganda. In the wake of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, RT's editor-in-chief said the company had built an ""entire empire of covert projects"" designed to shape public opinion in ""Western audiences.""
We allege that, as part of that effort, RT and its employees, including the defendants, implemented a nearly $10 million scheme to fund and direct a Tennessee-based company, to publish and disseminate content deemed favorable to the Russian government.
To implement this scheme, the defendants directed the company to contract with U.S.-based social media influencers to share this content on their platforms.
The subject matter and content of many of the videos published by the company were often consistent with Russia's interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Russian interests, particularly its ongoing war in Ukraine.
The company never disclosed to the influencers â or to their millions of followers â its ties to RT and the Russian government. Instead, the defendants and the company claimed that the company was sponsored by a private investor. That private investor was a fictitious persona.
The charges unsealed this morning do not represent the end of the investigation. It remains active and ongoing.
In a separate enforcement action, the Justice Department is seizing 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian sponsored actors have used to engage in a covert campaign to interfere in and influence the outcome of our country's elections.
As alleged in our court filings, President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including Sergei Kiriyenko, directed Russian public relations companies to promote disinformation and state-sponsored narratives as part of a program to influence the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.
An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is securing Russia's preferred outcome in the election.
The online infrastructure used by the Russian public relations company â known as the Social Design Agency, or SDA â and related actors included what are sometimes referred to as ""cybersquatted"" domains. These websites were designed to appear to American readers as if they were major U.S. news sites like The Washington Post or Fox News.
But, in fact, they were fake sites. They were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other in countries.
Internal documents of the Kremlin described the content as, ""bogus stories disguised as newsworthy events."" This malign influence campaign has been referred to as ""Doppelganger.""
The Russian public relations companies drove viewers to these websites by deploying influencers and paid social media advertisements. They also created fake social media profiles, posing as U.S. citizens, to post comments on social media platforms with links to the sites.
According to SDA's records, it actively sought to ""eliminate the possibility of detection of the 'Russian footprint.'""
Both of the schemes I have just discussed make clear the ends to which the Russian government â including at its highest levels â is willing to go to undermine our democratic process.
But the enforcement actions I have discussed also make clear that the Justice Department will aggressively counter such efforts.
And the same is true of the entire United States Government.
Today, our colleagues at the State and Treasury Departments are announcing parallel actions in both of these matters.
Unfortunately, we know that Russia is not the only foreign power seeking to interfere in our elections.
As the U.S. Intelligence Community noted two weeks ago, we have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle.
That includes recently reported activities by Iran to compromise former President Trump's campaign and to avoid an election outcome that it regards as against its interests. Those recently reported Iranian activities also include efforts to obtain access to individuals who themselves have access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties.
The Justice Department's message is clear: we have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our democratic system of government.
We will be relentlessly aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by Russia and Iran â as well as China or any other foreign malign actor â to interfere in our elections and undermine our democracy.
Now, I will to turn back to the topic of today's meeting. Just as we are dedicated to combating foreign threats to our election security, we are equally dedicated to confront domestic threats against the public servants who administer our elections.
Since the 2020 election, we have seen an unprecedented spike in threats against the public servants who do administer our elections.
Election officials, workers, and volunteers in communities across the country have been targeted with heinous acts and threats of violence. The following are a few examples of successful enforcement actions that the Justice Department has taken over the past year:
In New Mexico, county commissioners and other elected officials were targeted with a series of shootings that the Department has alleged in court papers were organized by an unsuccessful candidate for the state legislature who claimed that the election had been ""rigged"" against him. At least three of the shootings occurred while the intended victims or their children or their family members were at home.
In February, two shooters who we allege were recruited by the candidate pled guilty to carrying out the attacks. In March, the candidate himself was charged in a 13-count superseding indictment.
In Arizona, a man sent a state election official a bomb threat warning that if she did not resign within two days, ""the explosive device impacted in her personal space will be detonated."" In March, the man was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for making the threat.
In Maricopa County, Arizona, an elections official, a county attorney, and their families were threatened by a defendant who called for ""a mass shooting of poll workers and election officials"" in precincts he believed had ""suspect"" results. His revolting comments included: ""dead children burn into the memories of people.""
The county attorney who had been targeted later reported that he, his wife, and four children had been assigned round-the-clock protection and issued body armor in response to the threat.
And the elections official who was targeted said in a victim impact statement that:
""While I am the person directly threatened [in] this case, the impact of such threats is felt by a much larger community: the thousands of committed election workers who operate our democratic processes. When threats are made against any election workers, the impact reverberates [through] the [whole] community.""
That defendant was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
In recent months, our enforcement actions have continued.
In July, we secured the guilty plea of an Alabama man who repeatedly threatened to kill Maricopa County election workers and officials. In one particularly chilling message, he said: ""You better not come in my church, my business or send your kids to my school. You are [...] stupid if you think [your lives] are safe."" His sentencing is scheduled for next month.
Also in July, the Justice Department secured a 14-month sentence for a man who sent a death threat to a Michigan election worker. In a voicemail, he said: ""Ten million plus patriots will surround you when you least expect it."" And he added, ""We'll [...] kill you.""
Less than two weeks ago, we charged and arrested a Colorado man for allegedly threatening the lives of election officials, judges, and law enforcement officials in both Colorado and Arizona.
As I have said before, and I will reiterate again today, these cases are a warning: if you threaten to harm or kill an election worker or official or volunteer, the Justice Department will find you. And we will hold you accountable.
In a democracy, people vote and argue and debate â often loudly â in order to achieve the policy outcomes they desire.
And the Justice Department will continue to relentlessly protect the rights of all Americans to peacefully express their opinions, beliefs, and ideas.
But the promise of our democracy is that people will not employ violence to achieve their preferred outcomes.
The public servants who administer our elections must be able to do their jobs without fearing for their lives.
That is why this Task Force has been marshaling the full resources of the Justice Department to aggressively investigate and prosecute threats targeting election workers, officials, and volunteers.
And we will continue to do so in the months ahead, when the Task Force will build on the partnerships with state and local election officials and the law enforcement officials tasked with protecting them.
Since March, the Task Force has participated in more than 25 convenings, engagements, trainings, tabletop exercises â including both with our law enforcement partners and with our partners in the election community nationwide.
Over the next several weeks, Task Force representatives will be on the ground meeting with election workers.
And in early November â both in advance of, and after Election Day â the FBI will be hosting federal partners at its Headquarters command center to address events, issues, and potential crimes related to the elections in real time.
Election officials and administrators do not need to navigate this threat environment alone. We are here to support them and to make sure they can safely carry out their critical work.
Protecting our democracy and protecting our elections was a founding purpose when the Justice Department was established in 1870.
The Department answered that charge then. And we will answer that charge today as we confront those who would use violence or threats of violence to attack those who administer our elections.
I'd now like to ask the Deputy Attorney General to make some remarks.

Press Statement  Matthew Miller, Department Spokesperson  August 31, 2024
The United States stands with its ally, the Philippines, and condemns the dangerous and escalatory actions by the People's Republic of China (PRC) against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the vicinity of Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea on August 31.  A China Coast Guard vessel deliberately collided three times with a Philippine Coast Guard vessel exercising its freedom of navigation in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ), causing damage to the vessel and jeopardizing the safety of the crew onboard.
This is the latest in a series of dangerous and escalatory actions by the PRC.  On multiple occasions throughout August 2024, the PRC has aggressively disrupted lawful Philippine aerial and maritime operations in the South China Sea, including at Sabina Shoal.  The PRC's unlawful claims of ""territorial sovereignty"" over ocean areas where no land territory exists, and its increasingly aggressive actions to enforce them, threaten the freedoms of navigation and overflight of all nations.
The United States reiterates its call for the PRC to comport its claims and actions with international law and to desist from dangerous and destabilizing conduct.
The United States reaffirms that Article IV of the 1951 United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft - including those of its Coast Guard - anywhere in the South China Sea."
V4G4B2OHXU_3NYVDLC9JHTXO0A,About 600 Russian tourists visited North Korea since February: report,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2024/dprk-240904-rfa02.htm,"The tourism recovery has prompted plans to upgrade road and rail links between the neighbors.
By Taejun Kang for RFA 2024.09.04 -- About 600 Russian tourists have visited North Korea since it reopened its borders to tourists in February following the COVID-19 pandemic, Russian state media reported.
Most of the visitors traveled to the capital, Pyongyang, and the city of Rason from the far eastern Russian region of Primorsky Krai, said the region's tourism minister, Natalia Naboychenko, as cited by the TASS news agency.
The minister said efforts were being made to establish a regular train service between Russia and North Korea, citing high demand from Russian tourists wanting to visit Rason, which is close to the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok.
Vladivostok has become a hub for travel to North Korea with people from other parts of Russia heading there via Vladivostok's international airport, Naboychenko said, explaining that tourists often stay in the Russian city for a few days before traveling to North Korea.
North Korea was closed to foreign tourists for just over four years, after it sealed its borders in January 2020 to try to keep COVID-19 at bay.
In June, the Federal Customs Service of Russia said that the passenger rail service between the two countries had been restored, with 41 Russian tourists taking the train to the North.
""The first train with Russian tourists left for the DPRK through the Khasan checkpoint,"" said the service at that time. ""After a four-year break, Ussuri customs officers cleared the first passenger train for departure to North Korea.""
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK, is North Korea's official name.
Separately, Russia and North Korea agreed to build a new road bridge connecting their countries over the Tumen River in North Korea's northeast, raising the prospect of a trade and tourism boost.
The agreement was made during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Pyongyang on June 19. The two countries have been discussing road bridge construction since 2015, but talks ended in 2016 when the North conducted its fourth nuclear test.
In June, Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced a partnership treaty, agreeing to offer each other military assistance ""without delay"" if either were attacked. They also underscored their shared defiance of Western sanctions and expanded cooperation in various sectors.
Kim also assured Putin of full support for Russia's war in Ukraine. In his latest message in August, though not referring to Ukraine by name, Kim told Putin he was sure of Russia's victory.
Russia has been cozying up to North Korea since Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The United States says that North Korea has supplied Russia with large amounts of weapons for the war in Ukraine, in particular artillery rounds and ballistic missiles, although both Russia and North Korea deny that.
In exchange for its weapons, North Korea is suspected of getting Russian technological assistance for its space program.

V7E8CPR1BP_5N74UNO5P342MJD,Serbia Air Force - Rafale,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/serbia/rafale.htm,"Serbia signed a contract 29 August 2024 to purchase 12 Rafale warplanes from Frances Dassault Aviation. The widely anticipated deal will see Serbia receive nine single-seat and three two-seat jets by 2029 for an undisclosed sum, according to Dassault chief executive Eric Trappier. The dozen multi-role fighter aircrafts will help Serbia modernise its air force and replace ageing Soviet-era combat jets. During that tender attempt for the procurement of new fighter planes, from 2011, the expert part of the team preferred Rafale. The same ones that Croatia bought a little earlier, for about the same cost: about three billion dollars.
Serbia has long been close to Russia and China and purchased arms from both countries over the years, while relying on the two countries for diplomatic backing over its dispute with Kosovo. Serbia remains an outlier in Europe after refusing to join sanctions against Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Balkan country has been reliant for years on support from the Kremlin and Beijing to prevent the United Nations from recognising Kosovo as an independent state.Serbia has been a candidate to join the European Union since 2012, but its prospects are seen as bleak without a normalisation of relations with Kosovo.
Serbia's signing of an agreement to purchase Rafale aircraft from France will not have a negative impact on relations between Belgrade and Moscow. The Russian leadership's reaction to the deal confirmed Russia's respectful attitude toward the Balkan republic, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin told TASS. ""The purchase of Rafale aircraft was carried out for military and practical reasons and will in no way have a negative impact on relations between the Republic of Serbia and the Russian Federation. Serbia remains military neutral and will not join the anti-Russian hysteria or any form of anti-Russian sanctions,"" Vulin emphasized. ""In this case, Russia has shown how dear Serbia is to it, and why it is a country led by people respected all over the world, because Russia has once again expressed respect for Serbia and has not put its interests above Serbia's. If it had been different, if Serbia had bought the MiGs, would NATO and the EU have behaved in the same way? Would they have sent Serbia words of understanding or threats?"" the Deputy Prime Minister said. ""Russia behaves towards Serbia as an equal partner, and the Serbs are grateful to it for this,"" Vulin concluded.
In December 2021, Serbian Defense Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic announced that the country's armed forces were planning to purchase fighter jets and were choosing between Russian and French ones . At the time, he noted that Belgrade was leaning more toward the Rafale, but the final decision would only be made after a thorough analysis of the situation, since ""we are talking about very expensive things.""
In the spring of 2022, Vucic said that Serbia was negotiating with France to buy 12 new fighters, as well as with ""another country for another 12 aircraft,"" but used ones. He did not specify which country he was talking about.
In the summer of 2023, Vucic said that Serbia was discussing with France the price of the fighter jets and the type of missiles that could be used on these aircraft. According to him, Paris would not like to sell its Meteor air-to-air missile to a country that is not a NATO member. Vucic then noted that the purchase of Rafale ""would make Serbia a different country and a much greater force.""
The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, visited France in April 2024. Vucic laid a wreath on the memorial plaque ""Loyalty for Loyalty"", which is dedicated to Serbian soldiers. This is the 20th meeting between the two presidents so far, and the Serbian president said it may be the most important meeting for the country in the last three decades. Serbia expects to sign a ""huge"" deal for French fighter jets during a visit this week from France's leader, President Aleksandar Vucic told AFP.
The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, hosted a formal reception, on 08 April 2024 for the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, at the Elysée Palace. Before the meeting, the two presidents addressed the media. Macron said that Serbia has a place in Europe, but also pointed out that ""the issue of Kosovo is a promise and a pledge for the future of the region"". Vucic thanked the French president for always wanting to listen to the Serbian side.
During the second day of his official visit to Paris, on 09 April 2024 the President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic had discussions on dedicated industry and defense, as well as on the improvement of economic cooperation with French companies.	The conversation with the Minister of Defense was good and meaningful, President Aleksandar Vucic said. ""A good and meaningful conversation with Minister Sébastien Lecornu about the cooperation between our Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Defense of France, our dedicated industries, various experiences and technologies, as well as the procurement of the most modern weapons and tools for defensive purposes,"" wrote Vucic on  Instagram.
President of France Emmanuel Macron arrived in Belgrade on 29 August 2024 at the invitation of the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic. The two statesmen said at a joint press conference in Belgrade  that they believe in Serbian-French friendship and that they want to write new pages in the relations between the two countries, which is confirmed by the exchange of bilateral documents on cooperation, among which is the contract for the purchase of new fighter planes ""Rafal"" worth 2.7 billion euros. The first installment will be 421 million euros. Vucic did not answer the media's question about when the first aircraft is expected to be delivered.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told RTS before French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Belgrade that he will discuss very important issues with him, as well as that the purchase of Rafale aircraft is still being discussed and that it is no longer a question of price, but of certain guarantees.He noted that not everything is over when it comes to military-technical cooperation and the purchase of Rafal aircraft.
""The sleepless night is ahead of us and it is not over yet. It would be a big thing for us, because it would mean a huge progress in the combat readiness and military power of Serbia, the security of our country. We are not causing problems anywhere, nor do we plan to do so, nor do we intend to do so. This is a huge signal of trust between France and Serbia. We only want to preserve our country, but this would make Serbia many times, many times stronger. We have one more thing that we do not agree on. It is not a question of certain guarantees. If we manage to solve it, it will be fine, but we have been struggling with this for four days,"" said Vucic.
On the eve of Macron's two-day visit to Serbia, Vucic said that most of the planes Serbia has, or all the interceptor and fighter planes, come from Russia. ""Most of our planes, or all our aircraft, all our interceptors and all our fighter planes came from Russia and now we have to change ourselves, our habits and everything else in order to prepare our army,"" said the President of Serbia.
The contract will most likely, financially speaking, be the most expensive single contract for the procurement of a weapon system and its supporting elements in the history of Serbia. About two billion and eight hundred million euros were given for all armaments for Serbia from 2014 to 2023.  The   Serbian Air Force and Air Defense will receive newly manufactured fighters, that is, in the case of the Rafale, new multi-purpose fighter planes, for the first time since 1987, when the Yugoslav People's Army's Air Force and Air Force acquired MiG-29 fighters .
French President Macron  welcomed the potential of a strategic change with the signing of the deal during his state visit to Belgrade. Serbia has been a candidate for EU membership since 2012 and hopes to strengthen ties with France. Macron said that Serbia has a place in the EU and that the EU needs a strong Serbia, but also that Serbia needs a strong and sovereign EU. It is an opening towards a strategic change despite a lot of pressure, which must be underlined. It is real strategic courage and an opportunity for Europe, said Macron during a press conference in Belgrade.
Defense Minister Bratislav Gaic signed a contract for the purchase of ""Rafal"" aircraft with the general director of the French company ""Dassault Aviation"" Erik Trapij, the total value of which is 2.7 billion euros. In the presence of the President of the Republic and Commander-in-Chief of the Serbian Armed Forces, Aleksandar Vucic, and the President of the Republic of France, Emmanuel Macron, a ceremony for the exchange of signed bilateral documents was held in the ""Serbia"" Palace.		 The Minister of Defense, Bratislav Gaic, exchanged the signed Agreement on the procurement of the Rafal aircraft and accompanying goods and services with the general manager of the Daso Avijacija company, Erik Trapij. The total value of the contract is 2.7 billion euros for 12 completely new aircraft, along with all the accompanying equipment, the Ministry of Defense announced.
The signing of the Agreement on the purchase of ""Rafal"" was attended by Assistant Minister for Material Resources Nenad Miloradovic, Commander of the Air Force and Air Defense Lieutenant General Duko arkovic and representatives of the company ""Dassault Aviation"". Equipping the Air Force and anti-aircraft defense with ""Rafals"" will provide long-term protection of the airspace of the Republic of Serbia and contribute to the overall security of our country and its citizens, according to the statement of the Ministry of Defense.
President Vucic said 30 August 2024 that ""we are happy to become part of the ""Rafal"" club"". He added that the contract signed with the French manufacturer, which includes a complete auxiliary logistics package, spare engines and other parts, is worth 2.7 billion euros. Macron emphasized that the choice of ""Rafala"" is a clear choice that represents the will for a long-term alliance between our two countries as part of a strong, sovereign European Union, and that choice participates in our strategic autonomy.
""We know how important Serbia is for the peace of the entire continent. Serbia has moved closer to the 'Rafala club' and it is very important that we have a strategic partner. I respect Serbia's sovereignty and partnerships with other countries. This is an indicator of the European spirit,"" Macron said. The French president thanked Vucic for his strategic decisions, for the commitment he has made, and that he appreciates the fact that he always does what he says.
""The decisions we made today in a modest way continue this glorious past and our friendship, which is really strong. I am your sincere friend and I respect you, we want to write new pages of our friendship at a time when it is important to have historical solid friends and that we have among to you,"" said Macron, who reminded us of the Olympic Games and heroic athletes like Novak Djokovic who connect us.
Macron and Vucic, at the end of the two-day official visit of the French statesman to Belgrade on 30 August 2024, emphasized the importance of friendship and cooperation between the two countries, and in that spirit unveiled a plaque - a symbol of the completion of the modernization of Nikola Tesla Airport. Macron said that his visit to Serbia fundamentally improved the relations between the two countries.
Vucic, said ""Thank you very much for your visit, I see that everyone in the world is only commenting on 'Rafale', thank you for your trust in Serbia, thank you for your good will to spend time with us and thank you for the respect and honor you have shown to our small country"". Vucic added that we are proud of our friendship and that we can't wait for another opportunity to warmly welcome Macron again in Serbia.
Macron thanked Vucic for his hospitality during the visit. ""I want to tell you that France is a friend of Serbia and I am personally a friend of Serbia,"" Macron said and emphasized that he thinks the visit has fundamentally improved relations between France and Serbia.
Belgrade-based analyst Vuk Vuksanovic said that Vucic likely saw the Rafale deal as crucial for ensuring Frances support in the future. The president believes that by purchasing these Rafales, which are an extremely expensive product of the French military and industry, he will buy President Macrons favour and political protection, Vuksanovic, a senior researcher at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, told AFP.
Vucic sought to assure that Serbia will not share Rafales technology with Moscow. ""We are not Russian spies to transfer technology, we paid for this with Serbian citizens' money,"" Vucic said. Belgrade curtailed military cooperation with Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Le Mode editorialized 30 August 2024 ""No one will dispute the benefits to France and Europe of equipping the Serbian air force with French rather than Russian  or even American  aircraft. Such a sale implies a prolonged link with the producing country, in terms of training, maintenance and the supply of spare parts. But we must hope that every precaution has been taken to guarantee the protection of the technology and know-how involved in the Rafale, in a country where Russian nationals have free rein, and where Chinese and Russian producers of anti-aircraft defenses will be able to verify their performance at their leisure.""

Tehran, IRNA -- The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has blamed Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for preventing a ceasefire agreement on the Gaza Strip.
In response to Netanyahu's recent statements emphasizing the presence of the Zionist army in the Philadelphia axis in Gaza, Hamas said on Tuesday morning that such stance shows he is not in favor of a truce, the Palestinian Shihab news agency reported.
Netanyahu's Monday night statements were a desperate personal speech aimed at an illusory victory that has no buyer among Israelis, Hamas movement emphasized.
The movement in the continuation said that Netanyahu and the Israeli military authorities have not been able to achieve any of their goals in the war, except for genocide in Gaza.
Hamas also said that Netanyahu is lying to the Zionist community and that his statements that of his American backer are full of lies.
Hamas emphasized that all the Zionist captives could return home immediately and any delay in signing the agreement would mean endangering their lives.
Netanyahu has time and again put forward precondition in the ongoing ceasefire negotiations, which Palestinians, say are aimed at disrupting the talks. Hamas on the other hand made it clear that it remains committed to what were agreed on July 2 under the US president's proposals that stipulated the complete withdrawal of Zionist forces from Gaza among others.
Netanyahu lying to prevent collapse of his coalition
Yair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader has also reacted to the Prime Minister's statements on Monday night, saying Benjamin Netanyahu is lying to prevent the collapse of his coalition.
What bothers Netanyahu is talking is not the Philadelphia axis, but his axis with Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, and this is his new trick to prevent the collapse of his far-right coalition, Lapid said.
While denying Netanyahu's claim about his opposition to withdrawing from the Philadelphia axis, he emphasized that the Zionist regime withdrew from there 19 years ago and Netanyahu also voted in favor of it.
The head of the opposition parties also said that Netanyahu was the prime minister for 15 years and never thought of taking back the Philadelphia axis and therefore there no point now to insist on that.
When Sharon decided to withdraw from Gaza, I did not agree to leave the Philadelphia axis, when we entered the Philadelphia axis, we saw a strategic change in our favor and Hamas's position in the negotiations changed, Netanyahu said in his statements.
Benny Gantz, a former member of the Zionist war cabinet, also responded to Netanyahu's words and said that whoever does not know how to achieve the goals of the war, including the return of the captives, cannot lead the battle and should leave.

VETSPP7MDH_YUBZQZ7C86QLT03,Venezuela issues arrest warrant for opposition candidate Gonzalez,_,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240903-voa04.htm,"By VOA News September 03, 2024
Venezuela has issued an arrest warrant for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, a move that was condemned Tuesday by several countries, including Brazil, the United States and the European Union.
The warrant comes as the South American country is embroiled in an election dispute. Gonzalez says he is the rightful winner of the July 28 presidential vote, while incumbent President Nicolas Maduro says he was the victor and remains in power.
""There is no denying that there is an authoritarian escalation in Venezuela,"" Celso Amorim, Brazil's top foreign policy adviser, told Reuters on Tuesday. The arrest of Gonzalez ""would be a political arrest, and we do not accept [that there should be] political prisoners.""
""This is just another example of Mr. Maduro's efforts to maintain power by force and to refuse to recognize that Mr. Gonzalez won the most votes on the 28th of July,"" according to White House national security spokesperson John Kirby, who said Gonzalez's warrant was ""unjustified.""
Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, posted on X, ""Enough of the repression and harassment of the opposition and civil society. The will of the Venezuelan people must be respected.""
Gonzalez has been in hiding since the election dispute, but ""he has not requested asylum, he has not requested to be treated as a guest in any embassy,"" Gonzalez's lawyer, Jose Vicente Haro, said outside of his client's house in Caracas.
""He's not at his residence in order to preserve his freedom, his security, his life and to preserve the will of the Venezuelan people,"" Haro added.
Venezuela's Supreme Court has backed Maduro's claims that he beat Gonzalez in the disputed election.
The court, which includes Maduro loyalists, said that after reviewing materials supplied by the electoral authority, it agreed that Maduro had won a third six-year term.
Gonzalez has ignored several summonses from the Supreme Court.
Venezuela's electoral authority, which declared Maduro the winner of the vote within hours of the polls closing, reported that the president won more than half the votes, but it has not published any results.
The opposition claims that Gonzalez won the election in a landslide. It backed its claims with voting tallies that it said were gathered from 80% of the country's 30,000 voting booths showing that Gonzalez won by a ratio of more than 2-to-1.
On Monday, the U.S., which has urged Venezuelan authorities to release the election results, seized Maduro's airplane â a Dassault Falcon 900EX â in the Dominican Republic. The U.S. says the plane was illegally exported from the U.S., violating U.S. export control and sanctions laws.
""The Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by NicolÃ¡s Maduro and his cronies,"" U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said.
The U.S. will continue to take moves against Maduro for his actions that ""long predate his most recent anti-democratic action,"" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
""There are a number of things that we have called on him to do â to stop cracking down on dissent, to release the actual tally sheets, which he still has not done, and to get Venezuela back on its democratic path,"" Miller said. ""We are considering a range of options to demonstrate to Maduro and his representatives that their illegitimate and repressive actions in Venezuela have consequences.""

The United Nations has warned that Israel is using ""lethal war-like tactics"" against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, more than a week after the occupying entity launched a massive military aggression in the Palestinian territory, killing dozens of people.
At a press conference in New York on Tuesday, spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), StÃ©phane Dujarric, said that the Tel Aviv regime had resumed its aggression in Tulkarm and Jenin.
""The UN has recorded more than two dozen fatalities over the past week, including children,"" he said, adding that multiple organizations mobilized by the OCHA were set to carry out an assessment in Jenin but were denied access by the Israeli authorities.
""OCHA warns that access impediments are impacting the ability to provide meaningful humanitarian response,"" Dujarric said, noting that the movement of ambulances and medical teams has been impeded and delayed since the onset of the current aggression.
In the early hours of August 28, the Israeli military conducted its biggest operation - dubbed ""Camps of Summer"" - in the West Bank in over 20 years, deploying hundreds of troops and airstrikes on Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the occupying entity.
The ongoing military aggression in the West Bank is currently concentrated in the city of Jenin, whose streets and infrastructure have been damaged by over 70 percent since the onset of the ""Camps of Summer"", according to its municipality.
Dujarric also warned that Israeli forces continue to employ ""lethal war-like tactics"" in the West Bank, including airstrikes, with people being killed, injured and displaced.
While in Tulkarem on Saturday, OCHA teams verified that 120 Palestinians, including over 40 children, were displaced due to the destruction of their homes.
""At the time of the assessment, 13,000 people in Nour Shams refugee camp experienced water cut-offs, attributed to damages caused to the water network, and sewage overflow was observed. The teams also noted that the population was traumatized and in need of psychosocial support,"" the OCHA report said.
Since the onset of the current aggression in the West Bank, the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces has increased to 34. This includes 19 in Jenin, 8 in Tulkarm, 4 in Tubas, and 3 in al-Khalil. The total death toll in the occupied West Bank has now reached 685 since October 7 last year.
The heightened tensions in the occupied West Bank come as the Israeli regime has since October been conducting a barbaric onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip, claiming the lives of more than 40,000 people, most of them women and children."
VLVPU1P8RZ_HW0T7TRV6MWBPED,Ukraine's Parliament Begins Dismissals Ahead Of Government Shake-Up,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240904-rferl04.htm,"By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service September 04, 2024
Ukrainian lawmakers began voting in Kyiv on September 4 on the possible dismissals of cabinet members and other senior officials after a spate of resignations tendered in the past 24 hours that followed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's suggestion of a looming government shake-up.
Deputies dismissed one deputy prime minister and three ministers, but the session did not take up the fate of one of the highest-profile resignations, that of Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
Kuleba, one of the main faces of Kyiv's efforts to gird international support since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, submitted his resignation earlier in the day.
Commenting on Kuleba's and the rest of the 22-member cabinet's futures, Zelenskiy said on September 4 that ""we need new energy, and these steps relate to strengthening our state in various areas.""
Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk informed the public of Kuleba's resignation, as well as those a day earlier of two deputy prime ministers and three cabinet ministers as part of what could be the biggest cabinet overhaul since Russia's full-scale invasion began 36 months ago.
The head of Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party, Davyd Arakhamia, said on September 3 that more than half of the government's 22 cabinet positions would be changed in a ""big government reboot.""
Word of the move precedes Zelenskiy's expected visit later this month to the United States at what many regard as a crucial juncture of the war, with Russian troops advancing in eastern Ukraine and Ukrainian troops in control of about 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in a monthold incursion of their own.
Pressure among allies has been building for Washington and other capitals to remove curbs on Kyiv's use of Western-supplied weapons and artillery, including to allow for attacks deeper inside Russian territory.
In one of lawmakers' first moves in the September 4 session, they failed to dismiss Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk with just 214 votes in the 450-plus Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament.
They approved the dismissal of Strategic Industries Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin, who has overseen domestic arms production, with 243 votes. Lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak of Zelenskiy's party suggested Kamyshin would become a strategic adviser to Zelenskiy but that could not be independently confirmed.
Lawmakers also approved the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olha Stefanishyna and of Environment Minister Ruslan Strilets.
A vote on the dismissal of State Property Fund Chairman Vitaliy Koval fell short by one vote, according to lawmaker and Zelenskiy ally Oleksiy Honcharenko.
They did not appear to have voted on the resignation of Justice Minister Denys Malyuska.
Zelenskiy has said more changes to the government are coming in an effort to strengthen the it and deliver the results that the country needs.
""That is why there will be a number of personnel changes in the cabinet of ministers and the office of the president,"" he said on September 3, indicating that the changes would be coming in the fall.
Zelenskiy also said Ukraine needs more interaction between the central government and communities, especially during preparation for the winter season.
Kuleba in particular has been regarded by many as an effective messenger of Ukraine's warnings that stopping Russia's aggression is essential for the rest of Europe and the West along with pleas to continue massive military and other supplies by NATO members to a nonmember defending itself against Russian attack.

VOPA7GN9B5_HS980D65MHGS6OP,Israel targets Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon as families of hostages demand Gaza cease-fire,_,_,20240905,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240904-voa03.htm,"By VOA News September 04, 2024
Israel's military said Wednesday it carried out attacks targeting Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon after dozens of rockets were fired at Israel.
The military said Israeli air defenses intercepted some of the 65 rockets, while others fell in open areas.
Fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border has raised fears of a widening regional conflict amid the war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.
Family members of some of the hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza protested Wednesday outside the Tel Aviv headquarters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party.
The family members chanted slogans in favor of the Israeli government reaching a cease-fire deal with Hamas that includes the release of hostages.
The demonstration followed pressure Tuesday by the United States calling on Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire.
""There are dozens of hostages still remaining in Gaza, still waiting for a deal that will bring them home. It is time to finalize that deal,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters after Israeli forces found six hostages over the weekend that Hamas had shot to death in a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
""The people of Israel cannot afford to wait any longer. The Palestinian people, who are also suffering the terrible effects of this war, cannot afford to wait any longer. The world cannot afford to wait any longer,"" Miller said.
He said that the United States will work ""over the coming days"" with mediators Egypt and Qatar ""to push for a final agreement.""
One key point of contention in the negotiations has been Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain at the border between Gaza and Egypt.
But Miller said the U.S. is opposed ""to the long-term presence"" of Israeli troops in Gaza.
The State Department spokesman said that reaching a cease-fire and release of the 100 or so remaining hostages ""will require both sides to show flexibility. It will require that both sides look for reasons to get to yes rather than reasons to say no.""
Netanyahu has refused to agree to a cease-fire deal calling for an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza that would lead to a permanent halt to the fighting â for fear that Hamas could rearm itself and endanger Israel's long-term security.
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out negotiations by issuing new demands, including that Israel remain in control of the Philadelphi corridor and a second corridor running across Gaza.
Hamas has held to the broad agreements of a three-phase plan put forth by the U.S. administration of President Joe Biden in July: Hamas would release all hostages in return for an end to the war, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners.
Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages during the October 7 terror attack on southern Israel. The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes several thousand Hamas combatants.
Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., the U.K. and other Western countries.

The Chinese side strongly deplores, firmly opposes and rejects the European Union (EU)'s accusations, urging it to face up to the facts, maintain objectivity and fairness, exercise caution in words and deeds on the South China Sea issue, a spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the EU said on Monday, after the European External Action Service (EEAS) spokesperson made irresponsible remarks on the South China Sea issue.
According to media reports, at 08:02 on Saturday, the Philippine ship 9701 weighed anchor and continued its provocations at China's Xianbin Jiao in the South China Sea. In response, the Chinese coast guard ship 5205 lawfully issued verbal warnings and conducted monitoring and control measures, according to the China Coast Guard (CCG) on Saturday.
At 12:06, the Philippine ship deliberately rammed into the Chinese ship 5205 in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision for which the Philippines bears full responsibility, CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
However, the EEAS spokesperson condemned Chinese side for the ""dangerous actions"" in a statement issued on Sunday.
Xianbin Jiao is part of China's Nansha Qundao and inherent Chinese territory. The Philippine Coast Guard vessels entered the lagoon of China's Xianbin Jiao and have been illegally there for a long time, unilaterally altering its uninhabited status without facilities. China has protested to the Philippines multiple times through diplomatic channels and asked the Philippines to withdraw its vessels immediately, according to the spokesperson from the Chinese Mission to the EU.
The Philippines has ignored these demands and instead intensified its actions by sending coast guard vessels to continue provocation in the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao and even acting dangerously to deliberately ram the Chinese Coast Guard vessel which was carrying out law enforcement operation.
These facts are crystal clear. The maneuvers by Chinese side at the scene were justified, lawful, professional and indisputable. The responsibility of causing the collision fully lies with the Philippines, the spokesperson noted.
The EU is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to point fingers on this issue. In disregard of facts, to confuse right and wrong, the EU is openly backing the Philippines' provocative actions that infringe on China's territorial sovereignty, leading people to question the EU's motive by adding fuel to the fire and favoring one side of the issue, the spokesperson said.
China will continue to take resolute measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and to uphold the seriousness of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, according to the spokesperson."

Dear Ukrainians!
First of all, about the tragedy in Poltava. Rescue efforts are still   underway - the rubble is being cleared. All services are involved. As of   now, the number of injured is 271 people. Everyone is being provided   with the necessary assistance. I am grateful to all the rescuers,   doctors, medical nurses and all the Poltava residents who have joined in   to help, donated blood, and who provide support. We know that there are   people under the rubble of the destroyed building. Everything is being   done to save as many lives as possible. According to current information   available, this Russian strike killed 51 people. My condolences to all   the families and friends. Law enforcement agencies and the Ministry of   Defense of Ukraine are investigating all the circumstances of this   tragedy. The Russians carried out this strike with two ballistic   missiles. The air raid alert was sounded. Everything else - every detail   - must be established and verified during the investigation.
Today, I held a meeting of the Staff. We had a substantive discussion   about the use of air defense and about the protection of our cities and   communities. Steps have been identified to improve the effective use of   the systems we already have. We are also working on obtaining   additional defense for Ukraine. We are counting heavily on the Patriot   that Romania is preparing to hand over; I will be grateful for this step   of assistance from Romania. This is something that will truly support   our people, our country, our entire region. And of course, we continue   to work with all partners for stronger decisions in support of our   defense - for long-range decisions that would be able to destroy a   significant part of Russian ballistics even before launch. This is one   of the key issues of this war in general. The issue of our long-range   capabilities and the corresponding permissions from our partners,   long-range shells and missiles that we could use. Russian strikes will   be impossible if it is possible for us to destroy the occupier's   launchers where they are, along with Russian military airfields and   logistics. Providing Ukraine with such permissions and such weapons is   definitely the biggest step towards a real, just end to this war. Russia   simply does not know how to wage war without terror - it is terrorist   strikes and the ability to sow destruction that replace both tactics and   strategy of war for Russian leaders.
Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of Canada. I informed him about   the situation on the battlefield, about the consequences of Russian   terror. We discussed what exactly can strengthen our positions. Air   defense, defense packages, and equipment needs. It is very important   that Justin is ready to convince our partners more actively to provide   Ukraine with more long-range capabilities.
Also today, at the Staff meeting, there were important reports on   drones - various types of drones used by our Armed Forces of Ukraine,   the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Defense Intelligence of   Ukraine. Efficiency of use, priorities... There are experiences that   should be shared. There are also mistakes that should be corrected. Our   Ukrainian drones must be one hundred percent effective, because this   literally means that Ukraine will be one hundred percent effective on   the battlefield. And I thank all our people who gain this positive   experience of using drones for Ukraine, who share this experience among   the military. I thank everyone who produces and supplies drones. And I   thank all those who really accurately destroy the occupier and destroy   the Russian war potential right there on the enemy's territory.
There was also a long report by Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi on the   frontline and the operation in the Kursk region. The Pokrovsk direction -   there is a decision that can strengthen our positions. Active actions   in the Kursk region continue replenishing the exchange fund for our   state.
And one more thing.
Autumn will be extremely important for Ukraine. And our state   institutions must be set up in such a way that Ukraine will achieve all   the results we need - for all of us. To do this, we need to strengthen   some areas in the Government - and personnel decisions have been   prepared. There will also be changes in the Office. I also expect that   certain areas of our foreign and domestic policies will have a slightly   different emphasis. First - we need more interaction between the central   authorities and the communities. Especially now, when we are preparing   for the winter season. Second - Ukraine has already achieved significant   results in defense production. And this should be strengthened at all   levels, in particular, to make it easier to attract partner investment   in our strategic industries. Third - we need to significantly advance   our work with NATO; this requires special interaction. Fourth - the   European Union, real membership negotiations, preparation of the   relevant parts of the future membership agreement. This is very clear   both legal and political work. Personal responsibility for it will be   imposed. And fifth - we need to integrate everything that Ukraine has   achieved in its relations with partners - trust in Ukraine, strength of   the Ukrainian spirit, relations with partners - with the tasks that our   state faces in countering Russian propaganda and protecting Ukrainian   cultural heritage. We need a new level of simultaneous information work,   cultural and diplomatic. And a new level of relations with the global   Ukrainian community. Now is the time to give new strength to Ukraine's   Governmental institutions, and I am grateful to everyone who will help.
Glory to Ukraine!"

CCTV: In a joint letter to President Xi Jinping, 63 scholars from 50 African countries highly commended the historic achievements of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and said they keenly look forward to the upcoming FOCAC Summit. In his reply letter, President Xi Jinping expressed the hope that they will continue to offer important intellectual support for building a high-quality China-Africa community with a shared future and upholding the common interests of the Global South. Some of those African scholars said that President Xi Jinping's reply letter shows the importance China attaches to academic exchanges with Africa, and that people-to-people exchanges have contributed to Africa-China dialogue and cooperation. How does China view the role of people-to-people exchanges in the development of China-Africa relations?
Mao Ning: China and Africa share a long-standing friendship and our two peoples enjoy natural affinity. As President Xi Jinping said in the reply letter, China and Africa have always been a community with a shared future.
People-to-people exchange is part and parcel of China-Africa cooperation in the new era. Thanks to joint efforts, the two sides have had fruitful education cooperation, expanded the variety and range of cultural exchanges and continued the long tradition of exchanges between the Chinese and African civilizations. Mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples have further deepened. Inspiring events such as the China-Africa Youth Festival and ""Shared space, China-Africa dreams"" provide fresh impetus to China-Africa friendship.
China believes the upcoming FOCAC Summit will further strengthen the cultural bond, write a new chapter of understanding and affinity between the Chinese and African people, and give a strong boost to the relations and building of a community with a shared future between China and Africa.
AFP: Chinese authorities repeatedly said that the recent collisions between Chinese and Philippine coast guard ships in the South China Sea are entirely the Philippines' fault. And both sides have released video footage now of the relevant collisions in the last few days, but these videos do clearly seem to show the front of the Chinese coast guard ship colliding with the side or back of a Filipino coast guard ship. So is this truly unintentional? Is this not intentional ramming on the part of the Chinese side? Can the Foreign Ministry explain the actions of the Chinese coast guard boats in these situations? And does China still hold the Philippines entirely responsible for these collisions?
Mao Ning: Xianbin Jiao is part of China's Nansha Qundao. On August 31, the Philippine Coast Guard vessel, which has been illegally anchoring in the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao for weeks now, acted unprofessionally and dangerously by deliberately ramming China Coast Guard vessel which was there to safeguard China's sovereignty and lawful rights, resulting in the collision of the vessels. The Chinese side responded with necessary measures in accordance with the law, which was fully justified, lawful and beyond reproach.â
The Philippines' moves gravely infringe upon China's sovereignty and violate international law and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). China asks the Philippines to immediately withdraw the vessel illegally anchored in the lagoon, and stop infringement activities and provocations at once. China will continue to take resolute measures in accordance with law to safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and uphold the sanctity and effectiveness of the DOC. Meanwhile, we are ready to maintain dialogue and communication with the Philippines through diplomatic channels to properly address relevant issues and put the maritime situation under control.
AFP: I just want to follow up because it sounds as though the Chinese side's position is unchanged. So I'm just curious how would the Philippine ship deliberately ram the front of the Chinese boat from the back or from the side. Why would the Philippine sailors expose themselves to that sort of danger? The Foreign Ministry must be aware of the footage itself. So how do you explain what you say is the Philippines' actions in this regard?
Mao Ning: Xianbin Jiao is part of China's Nansha Qundao. The Philippines sent its Coast Guard vessel to the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao which has been illegally anchored there for many days now in an attempt to permanently occupy the area. This is the root cause of the current escalatory situation at Xianbin Jiao. The measures China took at Xianbin Jiao are aimed at protecting its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. They are fully legitimate and lawful.
Reuters: Bloomberg reported that China has threatened severe economic retaliation against Japan if Tokyo further restricts sales and servicing of chip-making equipment to Chinese firms. Senior Chinese officials have repeatedly outlined that position according to the report. Could the Ministry comment on this? Will these discussions target Japan's access to critical minerals used in automotive production?
Mao Ning: I am not sure where that report came from. China is committed to keeping the global industrial and supply chains secure and stable, and has kept our export control measures just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. Certain country, in order to perpetuate its supremacy, has been turning normal economic cooperation and trade into political and security issues, co-opting other countries to join the tech blockade against China and deliberately disrupting global industrial and supply chains. China firmly rejects this. We hope relevant countries will uphold market principles and the spirit of contract, say no to economic coercion, and jointly uphold the stability of the global industrial and supply chains.
China News Service: The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell recently said that the West needs to recognize the success of the Chinese system and that the different European and Chinese political systems and the differences in many issues ""should not push us into a systematic confrontation,"" and the two sides must be partners. Borrell noted China's rise is a fact and ""to oppose ourselves to the rise of China as a power is impossible."" Borrell stressed as China and the US are competing with each other, the EU must bear in mind its own interest and act in its own way. What's China's comment?â
Mao Ning: China commends High Representative Josep Borrell for his objective understanding of China's development and his positive remarks on China-EU relations.
China will stay committed to the development path it has chosen, which is a path completely different from that of traditional powers. China's development adds to the force for global peace, stability and progress. China's development is integral to the growth of developing countries as a whole and a just endeavor for better human development. On this particular front, China needs the world, and the world needs China.
China attaches great importance to China-EU relations, and believes that in the context of China-EU relations, the two sides should be characterized rightly as partners, not rivals. Cooperation, rather than competition, should be the defining feature of the relationship, autonomy, rather than reliance, its key value, and win-win, rather than confrontation, its future. The 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held its third plenary session with a focus on further deepening reform across the board, building a high-standard socialist market economy, and improving the institutions and mechanisms for high-standard opening up. This will provide more opportunities for Europe's prosperity and China-EU cooperation. China is ready to be the EU's key partner in economic and trade cooperation, priority partner in scientific and technological cooperation, and reliable partner in industrial and supply chain cooperation. The EU is welcome to share the opportunities provided by China's mega-sized market and take an active part in China's high-standard and institutional opening up.
Next year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations. China stands ready to work with the EU to remain each other's partners, deepen strategic communication, carry out dialogue and cooperation, properly settle differences and frictions, in particular deepen cultural and people-to-people exchangesâwe expect to find people who will follow Marco Polo's steps in the new era, and make sure the China-EU relations will become more stable and constructive, deliver more mutual benefit and contribute more globally. By working together, China and the EU can and will contribute more to the wellbeing of the two peoples and a stable and prosperous world.
Yonhap News Agency: Senior official from the office of the ROK President said yesterday that after the ROK-China-Japan trilateral summit meeting and the ROK-China leaders' meeting in May in Seoul, there has been ongoing high-level exchanges between the ROK and China. The official added that China also intends to restore its ties with the ROK and if the relationship is restored, it is believed that Chinese leader will perhaps visit the ROK. What's China's response?
Mao Ning: I noted the media reports. China and the ROK are close neighbors and each other's important cooperation partners. Advancing the sound and steady growth of China-ROK relations serves the common interests of the two countries. High-level exchanges play an important role in growing relations between countries. They require sound preparation, a favorable atmosphere, and sufficient potential deliverables. On future high-level exchanges between the two sides, I have nothing specific to share.
Ukrinform News Agency: Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov yesterday in a comment to the TASS News Agency stated that Russia will make changes to its nuclear doctrine in response to the so-called ""escalation course"" of the West. This has no doubt that it's about intention to further expand the possibilities for the use of nuclear weapons. How do you comment on such a statement with threats of nuclear weapons?
Mao Ning: We noted the media report. China has been very clear that nuclear weapons should not be used and nuclear war must not be fought. In January 2022, the leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states released the Joint Statement on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, which stated that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Under the current circumstances, all parties must exercise calm and restraint, and jointly seek to cool down the situation through dialogue and consultation to reduce strategic risks.
Global Times: The US State Department issued days ago a statement marking the second anniversary of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' Assessment on the Human Rights Situation in Xinjiang and attacked the human rights situation in Xinjiang. What's China's comments?
Mao Ning: The US statement lacks factual basis and its accusations are wrong and false. The statement is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and a malicious attack on China's Xinjiang policy. China deplores and opposes it, and has protested to the US. The so-called assessment report is a patchwork of disinformation invented by the US and some in the West as a political tool to strategically use Xinjiang to contain China, and is illegal, null and void. The 51st session ofâthe Human Rights Council voted down a Xinjiang-related draft decision tabled by the US and a few other western countries. That says a lot about the world's attitude on the assessment report. The US keeps using the assessment report to make an issue. That fully reveals their calculation of using Xinjiang-related disinformation to contain and suppress China and makes it clear enough that they themselves are the ones behind this false report.
Of all people, the people in Xinjiang, whatever their ethnic backgrounds, are in the best position to tell the world what the human rights conditions are like in Xinjiang. Xinjiang today enjoys social stability and economic growth and the people there live a happy life. It is enjoying development progress like never before, and China's Xinjiang policy is widely supported by the people. The US's attempt to undermine Xinjiang is bound to fail. We urge the US to stop such attempts at once, stop using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs and harm China's interests, and stop propagating lies about Xinjiang.
AFP: Japan has said that a Chinese naval ship sailed through its territorial waters on Saturday. This incident has been just a few days after a Chinese surveillance aircraft is alleged to have briefly entered Japanese airspace. How does China explain the latest incidents with the alleged ship incursion? Was that incident also unintentional on the Chinese side's part? And are these incidents part of a more deliberate pattern by China? Whether we're talking about contested parts of the East China Sea, or contested parts of the South China Sea, there seems to be an increasing amount of alleged violations by the Chinese side in these areas. I'm wondering if that means that the Chinese side is trying to step up the pressure a little bit in these areas?
Mao Ning: Pursuant to relevant UNCLOS articles, the Tokara Strait can be sured for international navigation, and by sailing through the strait, the Chinese vessel was exercising its right of transit passage, which is fully lawful and legitimate. Regarding Japan's claim about the entry of a Chinese military airplane into Japanese airspace, the Chinese side responded to the question and made its position clear last week. There is no need to arbitrarily link or interpret them. China remains firmly committed to the peace and stability in this region.â
Bloomberg: Just on the FOCAC. I just wanted to see if you could help me with the size and scope. Previously it was said by MOFA official that the upcoming FOCAC is the largest diplomatic event in recent years. I was just wondering if you could maybe add some specifics to that? Is this largest in terms of the number of foreign leaders? And also can you specify since what year? This kind of details is helpful for us to put it into context.
Mao Ning: Thank you for your interest in the FOCAC Beijing Summit. FOCAC is a platform for China-Africa friendly cooperation and consists of China, 53 African countries and the African Union Commission. African leaders attach great importance to the cooperation under the framework of the forum. The FOCAC Summit has always been a large gathering of African leaders. Please stay tuned to find out what exactly this year's attendance will be and other specifics of this year's summit.
Bloomberg: I'd just like to ask about the news of the killing over the weekend of the six hostages in Gaza, including one American national. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment on this development?
Mao Ning: China expresses deep regret for the death of the six captives. The pressing imperative is to fully implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions, bring about an immediate ceasefire, and create conditions for the early release of those held captive. We will continue working with the international community to play a constructive role in efforts towards deescalation."

Russian opposition political activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was released from a Russian prison last month in a major prisoner swap between Russia and the West, says Mongolian authorities ""must arrest"" President Vladimir Putin during his visit to the East Asian country.
Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which Mongolia joined in 2003, for the unlawful deportation and unlawful transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia.
Putin arrived in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, on the evening of September 2 ahead of a planned visit that will include an appearance on September 3 at ceremonies marking Soviet and Mongol battle victories in World War II.
""In terms of the International Criminal Court, in terms of the Rome Statute, in terms of international law, Vladimir Putin should be arrested,"" Kara-Murza told Current Time on September 1.
""If Mongolia considers itself a country with the rule of law that aspires to be part of the civilized world,"" Kara-Murza said, ""then Mongolia must comply"" with the terms of the Rome Statute that established the ICC.
He added that he and other Russian opposition politicians and activists signed an online petition calling on the Mongolian authorities to arrest Putin.
""From the point of view of international law, it's not a matter of choice or willingness -- it's a matter of a legal obligation that most definitely requires compliance,"" Kara-Murza said.
On September 2, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement urging Mongolia to either deny entry to or arrest Putin.
""Mongolia would be defying its international obligations as an ICC member if it allows [Putin] to visit without arresting him,"" said Maria Elena Vignoli, senior international justice counsel at HRW.
The Kremlin said on August 30 that it had ""no worries"" about the trip, adding that Russia had ""a wonderful dialogue with our friends from Mongolia.""
Putin plans to take part in events in Mongolia devoted to the 85th anniversary of joint Soviet and Mongol armed forces' victory over Japanese troops in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.
Putin's visit to Mongolia will be his first visit to a country that signed and ratified the ICC's Rome Statute since an ICC warrant was issued for him in March 2023.
In December 2023, Judge Erdenebalsuren Damdin of Mongolia was elected as an ICC judge.
On August 30, Ukraine also urged Mongolia to arrest Putin.
Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC.
Under the Rome Statute, each of the 124 ICC member states would be expected to enforce the arrest warrant should Putin visit their territories.
However, the ICC does not have tools to secure the implementation of the treaty and relies on the cooperation of its member states to conduct any arrest warrants.

Tehran, IRNA -- Leader of the Opposition in Israel Yair Lapid in a letter to the cabinet ministers said that the Zionist prisoners in Gaza are being killed one by one and the Israeli army is facing the deepest crisis.
According to the Zionist TV Channel 12, Lapid warned against the collapse of the regime in a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet ministers, with the exception of Internal Security Minister Itamar Ben Goyer and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
He emphasized that Zionist prisoners are being killed by Hamas in Gaza one after another and that the Israeli army is facing its deepest crisis.
You are involved in the biggest crisis and disaster in the history of Israel and you are responsible for all the decisions made by this cabinet.
The Salah al-Din Axis (Philadelphia) is Netanyahu's excuse to prevent an agreement for fear of the collapse of his cabinet.
Israel was hit by a general strike that has shut down businesses as public anger boils against Netanyahu for what Israelis see as deliberate efforts to torpedo a Gaza truce deal with Hamas and prevent the release of captives held in the Palestinian territory.
The strike was called by Israel's largest labor union Histadrut on Sunday when massive protests hit the occupied territories over Netanyahu's failure to release the captives.
The protests erupted in different cities, including Tel Aviv, Haifa and occupied Al-Quds. In Tel Aviv alone, 300,000 people were estimated to attend, with some blocking a major highway. Police used water cannons to disperse the crowd. Arrests were also made in Haifa.
The demonstrations took place after the Israeli military said that it had located and recovered the bodies of six captives in the southern Gaza Strip on Saturday.
The protesters urged Netanyahu to urgently accept a deal with the Palestinian Hamas Resistance Movement for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining captives.
The Sunday demonstrations were among the biggest rallies in Israel in the past months since Hamas captured some 250 people, including Israelis and non-Israelis, during its October 7 Al-Aqsa Storm Operation on southern Israeli-occupied territories.
Dozens of captives have already been released, while around 100 remain in Gaza.

Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and Edem Wosornu, Director of Operations for humanitarian coordination wing, OCHA, were briefing ambassadors in the Security Council, against the backdrop of the recovery of the bodies of six hostages killed in Gaza and polio vaccination campaign which began at the weekend.
The urgent meeting was requested - separately - by both Algeria and Israel. According to media reports, Israel demanded the Council condemn Hamas in the strongest possible terms and address the dire situation of the hostages still held in captivity.
Algeria reportedly requested the meeting to discuss the worsening situation in Gaza and the West Bank.
Next month will mark the somber one year-mark of the 7 October terror attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel, in which more than 1,250 Israeli and foreign nationals were killed and around 250 were abducted and taken into Gaza.
At least 101 hostages - including some remains of those declared dead - remain in Gaza, which has been under a relentless Israeli military onslaught that has claimed more than 41,000 Palestinian lives, according to the Strip's health authorities.
Heartbreaking news
Ms. DiCarlo recalled her meeting last November with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the hostages killed.
She said that according to the Israeli Government, the hostages had been shot multiple times at close range and that they were killed by Hamas shortly before Israeli soldiers were able to reach them inside a tunnel in Rafah.
Following the recovery of the bodies, Hamas announced that militants guarding hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had new instructions to kill hostages before they could be recovered alive by Israeli forces, she added.
""I echo the words of the Secretary-General once again: all hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally,"" Ms. DiCarlo reiterated.
""For as long as they are held, in accordance with international legal obligations, they must be treated humanely and allowed to receive visits and assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).""
Ms. DiCarlo also updated on the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, included the latest on large-scale Israeli military operations, settler attacks and armed Palestinian violence against Israelis.
'No limits' to brutality
Briefing alongside Ms. DiCarlo, Ms. Wosornu highlighted the death and destruction across the Gaza Strip, stating ""the brutality of this conflict seems to know no limits.""
""We see this in the many attacks harming humanitarian workers: 295 humanitarian workers killed since 7 October [2023],"" she added.
Many humanitarian assets, including several UN vehicles ""have been directly hit in more than a dozen separate incidents even though their movements were notified,"" she said.
Ms. Wosornu outlined the fallout from this, limiting the delivery of lifesaving aid to those in desperate need, such as the temporary suspension of staff movements by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) following an attack on one of its convoys last week.
Polio pauses, rare ray of hope
Both UN officials welcomed the local humanitarian pauses, which enabled the launch of the emergency polio vaccination campaign.
""The polio pauses are a rare ray of hope and humanity amid the horror in Gaza,"" Ms. DiCarlo said, noting that the images of young children receiving their vaccinations amid utter ruin ""are both moving and distressing.""
She added that the arrangements established between UN agencies and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to pause military activity in the designated vaccination areas ""have so far been respected"".
Humanitarians remain
Ms. Wosornu further noted that humanitarians - despite overwhelming challenges - remain on the ground, providing essential assistance, including food and shelter and protection, as best as they can.
Food rations are being distributed, albeit at reduced levels, with wheat flour prioritized only for the 14 bakeries supported by humanitarian actors.
Tents are also being distributed, though they are insufficient to match the needs of repeatedly displaced families, especially with the approaching cold and rainy weather.
Turn promises into reality
She urged the Security Council ""to turn its promises into reality and end the suffering.""
""We once again appeal to Council Members and all Member States to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities and a sustained ceasefire in Gaza, and to de-escalate the situation in the West Bank,"" she urged.
""Resolutions passed by this Council promised an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. They also called for the release of hostages. Yet, months later, the violence continues, thousands more people have been killed, and hostages separated from their families."""

PRAGUE -- Azerbaijan's deputy minister for renewable energy has expressed surprise at the emergency weekend suspension of operations at a nuclear plant in neighboring Armenia and hinted at concerns over ""certain technologies that Armenians are using currently.""
Deputy Minister Elnur Soltanov warned in the comments to RFE/RL on September 1 that ""nuclear plants in the neighborhood"" might not be up to world standards and ""it's not just Armenia that will suffer"" in the event of an accident.
The comments follow the emergency shutdown and temporary disconnection from the grid of Caucasus neighbor Armenia's only functioning nuclear reactor, at Metsamor, after a lightning strike late on August 30. The facility was put back online the next day.
Soltanov was speaking to RFE/RL on the sidelines of the Globsec security conference in Prague early on September 1.
Approached as he left a panel discussion on navigating climate change and the upcoming UN climate conference, COP29, which his country is hosting in November, Soltanov was initially unclear what ""crisis"" he was being asked about.
Informed that neighboring ""Armenia's only nuclear power plant suffered a safety-related shutdown"" about 36 hours earlier, he said, ""Really? I have no idea. Oh my God.""
Soltanov continued to discuss the COP29 cooperation including ""mutual support"" that resulted in the lifting of Armenia's veto on Baku hosting the event.
Then he argued the importance of nuclear technology in the climate fight as ""sine qua non"" to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
""But it has to be secure. It has to be safe. It should be answering the global standards,"" Soltanov said.
""Because we know what happened in certain technologies that Armenians are using currently. So in that sense, yes. Anything that is constructively contributing to the process, pushing the situation to the world standards, which we believe that may not be the case with the nuclear plants in the neighborhoods, would be very great.""
""Because...it's not just Armenia that will suffer, right?"" Soltanov said. ""Everybody will suffer, and the consequences could be dire for everybody.""
Armenia's only nuclear power plant is located 36 kilometers from the capital, Yerevan, and is less than 100 kilometers from Azerbaijani territory.
The plant's initial Soviet-era construction with VVER-440 plant technology with no secondary containment building and with technology designed to withstand quakes of limited magnitude was controversial in a region regarded as heavily earthquake-prone.
Both of Metsamor's reactors were closed in the late 1990s but Armenia reopened one of them in 1995 as energy demand grew.
Longtime bitter foes Armenia and Azerbaijan are currently locked in tough discussions around a possible peace treaty following Azerbaijan's decisive operation to retake Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas controlled for decades by Yerevan-backed ethnic Armenians.
Soltanov has been deputy energy minister since 2018 responsible for renewable energy and energy efficiency.
He was also appointed chief executive officer for the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP29, which Baku will host in mid-November.

WHFM3P5X6E_9LY5YKWI6TJ6KPM,Temporary protection for Ukrainians displaced by war to continue,Finnish Government,_,20240904,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2024/09/ukraine-240903-fingov01.htm,"Finnish Government
Ministry of the Interior  Publication date 3.9.2024 14.18  Press release
The Ministry of the Interior has set up a legislative project to amend the legislation on temporary protection in order to extend temporary protection for Ukrainian nationals and their family members even after 4 March 2025. The project will prepare the necessary amendments to the Aliens Act.
Temporary protection is based on the EU Temporary Protection Directive, which was activated for the first time on 4 March 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2024, the Council of the European Union decided to extend temporary protection until 4 March 2026.
Temporary protection will continue to be granted not only to Ukrainian nationals and their family members but also to third-country nationals who have been residing in Ukraine under a permanent residence permit or international protection.
However, Finland will no longer grant temporary protection to those third-country nationals fleeing Ukraine who have been residing in Ukraine without a permanent residence permit or international protection. The reason for their stay in Ukraine may have been, for example, work or studies. Temporary protection for these people will end on 4 March 2025. The legislative amendments are based on the decision made by the Government on 7 September 2023.
The provisions of the Aliens Act on temporary protection entered into force in 2004, and they are partly outdated in the current situation. By law, temporary protection can last up to three years, meaning that temporary protection granted on the basis of the war in Ukraine will cease on 4 March 2025. After that, extending temporary protection will require legislative amendments.
Granting temporary protection makes it possible to provide protection to a limited group of people through a swift process that is lighter than the asylum procedure.
In 2022-2024, Ukrainians have submitted a total of about 74,000 applications for temporary protection in Finland. There are around 46,000 Ukrainian beneficiaries of temporary protection in Finland now. Approximately 23,000 Ukrainians are registered in the reception system for asylum seekers, and about 23,000 Ukrainians have been allocated a municipality of residence. Others are thought to have returned to Ukraine or moved elsewhere in the EU.
The term of the project is from 3 September 2024 to 31 March 2025. The project will monitor and take into account what decisions are made in the EU regarding the extension of temporary protection. Finland's national decision must be in line with the decisions of the EU and other Member States. The government proposal is scheduled to be submitted to Parliament during the 2024 autumn session. The legislative amendments must enter into force on 5 March 2025."

The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) has   released its annual Security Threat Environment report, with updated   assessments on the nature of foreign interference, espionage and violent   extremism in New Zealand.
The second annual release of the report features more case studies to   illustrate the current range of threats observed by the NZSIS.
Director-General of Security Andrew Hampton said the release of last   year's unclassified report was a significant step in raising awareness,   and this year's edition goes even further.
""Our independent assessment is about being as upfront as we can   about the reality of national security threats facing our country. The   point is not to alarm anyone but to alert New Zealanders to the threats   so that we can work together to manage them,"" he said.
""In recent years there has been considerably more public   discussion around topics such as foreign interference and violent   extremism, which is why our annual assessment is so important. We aim to   provide an upfront and factual basis to this ongoing national   conversation.""
There is a focus in the assessment on highlighting common behaviours   and activities associated with foreign interference, espionage and   violent extremism in New Zealand.
A number of real-world case studies are included in the analysis from   recent investigations that lift the lid on the range of national   security threats observed by the NZSIS.
The report contains links to relevant protective security advice to   help people and organisations take steps to increase their resilience to   these threats. There is also advice on how to respond after witnessing   any concerning behaviours or activities.
""When we all understand what's happening and some of the   motivations that lie behind these activities, everyone can be better   prepared to manage the risks, whether you are a member of a community,   business owner or an elected official"" Andrew Hampton said.
""This report contains insights anyone can use. It can support   sound decision-making or even help someone ask the right questions such   as ""what might this threat look like in our community"" or ""what does   this mean for our business or organisation?""

Taipei, Sept. 4 (CNA) The new de facto United States ambassador to Taiwan Raymond Greene on Wednesday listed enhancing bilateral cooperation to boost Taiwan's overall resilience and security, as well as facilitating its connection to the world, as his top priorities.
Speaking during his first press conference since taking office as director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in July, Greene, in his address delivered in Chinese, noted that the world has become increasingly aware that maintaining cross-strait peace is vital.
About half the world's trade passed through the Taiwan Strait and up to 90 percent of high-end semiconductors were made in Taiwan, he noted.
""If peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are disrupted, the global economy will suffer a heavy blow and every country will be affected,"" he said.
Greene said his chief mission as AIT director is to continue to enhance Washington-Taipei cooperation by focusing on three priorities, namely, ""resilience, security and connectivity.""
He pledged that the U.S. will help Taiwan beef up its resilience against climate change, natural disasters, global epidemics and geopolitical risks.
On the U.S. security commitment toward Taiwan, the American envoy reiterated his government's stance to provide Taiwan with arms sales to support its self-defense capabilities.
Greene also said the U.S. is committed to enabling Taiwan, a highly developed economy, to share its expertise in multilateral forums.
He added this includes calling for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the United Nations system and other international organizations.
Washington will also continue to increase economic, trade and cultural exchanges with Taiwan, he noted.
The AIT represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of official diplomatic ties. It is headquartered in Virginia and has a main office in Taipei and a branch office in Kaohsiung, with its Taipei director serving as the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan.
During Wednesday's press event, Greene said the Biden administration and U.S. Congress see the issue as a ""topic that is a high priority,"" when asked about the roughly US$20 billion backlog of weapons orders Taiwan bought from the U.S.
Given the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, as well as the U.S.' military needs, he said ""the defense industrial base in the United States and our partners is under increasing strain.""
The U.S. government is now tapping into ""non-traditional sources of supply"" by working with companies not traditionally in the defense sector to provide asymmetric capabilities, he added.
The U.S. is also collaborating more with countries that have significant manufacturing capabilities to boost the global defense industrial supply chain, he noted.
Asked if Taiwan could potentially join such a defense industrial supply chain, the AIT director said it could be an option.
Washington is working with several partners on the possibility of expanding the joint production of military material and supplies, ""and I would not rule out Taiwan being one of those partners in the future,"" he said.
On whether the AIT has a U.S. citizen evacuation plan ready should China invade Taiwan, Greene said Washington and its allies in the region -- namely Japan, Korea and the Philippines -- have been strengthening their alliance over recent years to prevent a potential cross-strait conflict.
The growing network of alliances and Taiwan's defense reform efforts are working to maintain the status quo in the region, he said.
""We don't have a special plan or discussions about evacuations. We have also not talked about this with any outside parties,"" he added.
On the issue of President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸å¾·) potentially stopping on U.S. soil before visits to Taiwan's diplomatic allies, Greene reiterated Washington's long-held stance on the issue.
""We facilitated seven transits for President Tsai [Ing-wen] (è¡è±æ) during her term in office,"" he said.
The U.S. expects Lai to visit Taiwan's diplomatic partners in the future ""and we look forward to facilitating his transit in the United States when those plans come up,"" he added.
Greene, whose most recent post was as deputy chief of mission of the U.S. Embassy in Japan, took up the Taipei post in July, succeeding Sandra Oudkirk, who left the office after concluding a three-year tenure.
This marks the third time Greene has been posted in Taiwan, according to the AIT. He served as deputy AIT director from 2018 to 2021.

Bern, 03.09.2024 -- The Federal Office for Defence   Procurement armasuisse has completed the practical testing of the three   systems on the shortlist as part of the evaluation of a new artillery   system. The tests took place in cooperation with industry and the Armed   Forces between January 2023 and June 2024 in Switzerland and abroad. It   was checked whether the systems meet the requirements. The results and   findings will be evaluated over the next few months and summarised in an   evaluation report.
After the pre-evaluation, the Federal Office for   Defence Procurement armasuisse decided to evaluate three systems. These   are the systems: Archer mobile howitzer from the company BAE Systems   Bofors from Sweden and, from the company KNDS Germany the systems RCH   155 with Boxer carrier platform and AGM Artillery Gun Module with   Piranha carrier platform.
Since   the beginning of 2023, the three shortlist systems have been tested and   analysed in depth, together with industry and the Armed Forces in   practical trials in Switzerland and abroad. Logistical clarifications,   technical shooting trials, mobility trials and troop trials were carried   out with each of the three prototypes from industry. In particular, it   was checked whether the systems meet the project goals and the military   requirements, whether suitability for use in a militia army is the case   and whether the performance specified by the manufacturers is achieved.   In   parallel to the practical testing, official requests for offers are in   progress, which pertain to contractual and business aspects as well as   life cycle costs. The results and findings obtained from the practical   tests will be evaluated over the next few months and summarised in an   evaluation report. Together with the offers received, it forms the basis   for the subsequent type decision. Procurement is to be requested in one   of the next Armed Forces Dispatches.
The   self-propelled howitzers M109 currently in use are from the 1960s and   will have reached the end of their useful life in the next few years.   They therefore need to be replaced with a new, modern artillery system.   The project ""Artillery weapons platform and weapons 2026"" (Art WPWM 26)   aims to ensure the maintenance and further development of the ability of   indirect fire at medium operating distance with increased range,   precision and mobility."

Many common understandings reached between the two heads of state then have been implemented. Bilateral practical cooperation in various fields has advanced by leaps and bounds, benefiting both sides. It is of strategic significance and serves as a model for developing countries to jointly advance modernization.âChina is comprehensively advancing Chinese modernization with high-quality development, while the DRCâis entering a new stage of national development and revitalization. The two countries are partners on the path to modernization and should be sincere friends with common idealsâand beliefs, mutually beneficial partners, and good friends working together for peace.âChina supports the DRCâin safeguarding national sovereignty and realizingâindependent development, and is ready to consolidate political mutual trust with the DRC, firmly support each other, seek common development, deepen cooperation in agriculture, mineralâproductsâprocessing,âvocational trainingâand other fields, and continue to help the DRCâturn its resource advantage into momentum for development.
Xi Jinping stressed that at the summit, China and Africa will define the new positioningâof China-Africa relations, announce a series of major measures to jointly advanceâmodernization, and draw a new blueprintâtogetherâfor the growth of China-Africa relations.âChina is ready to work with the DRCâto seize historic opportunities, strengthen strategic mutual trust, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, joinâhands toâpromoteâChina-Africa cooperation, jointly safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and encourage countries in the ""Global South"" to pursue peace and development in a changing world.
Felix Tshisekediâsaid, the DRC and China are brothers with solid and sincere friendship. Based on equality,ârespect and a high degree of mutual trust, bilateral cooperation has achieved mutual benefitâand win-win outcomes. The DRCâside admires President Xi Jinping's outstandingâleadership and hopes to learn from China's successful experience, take China as a top priority partnerâfor cooperation, and continuously deepen friendship and practical cooperation in various fields.âHe thanked China for supporting the DRC in safeguarding its national sovereignty and independence. The DRC firmly pursues the one-China policy and recognizes Taiwan as an inalienable part of China's territory.âThe FOCAC has provided an important opportunity for African countries to realize their development dreams. Heâexpressed the beliefâthat the summit will be a complete success and deliver more tangible results to the peopleâof African countries.
During the summit, China and the DRC will signâa number of bilateral cooperation documents in areas such as economic partnership for common development, human resources development, customs capacity building,âand press.

This afternoon, Russia attacked Poltava with two ballistic missiles. This attack has killed dozens of people and injured over 200. It is yet another targeted bloodshed that proves Russia's determination to continue with its brutal war against Ukraine and its people, trying to cause highest possible loss of lives and inflict a large-scale devastation. We share the grief of the families of the victims and stand by the Ukrainian people.
For the past two and a half years, Russia has been continuously terrorising Ukraine's population by waging its illegal war of aggression, with indiscriminate missile and drone attacks across Ukraine's territory cowardly aiming mostly at civilian targets.
This only underlines the need for Ukraine, in accordance with its legitimate right to self-defence under the UN Charter, to be able to fend off effectively such heinous attacks launched from military platforms in Russia and push the aggressor back.
The European Union remains committed to stepping up the delivery of military support, including air defence systems and ammunition. These deliveries strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save innocent lives, and reduce the level of the destruction in Ukraine."

A Russian guided-bomb attack hit a village in Ukraine's Kharkiv region Saturday, killing two people and injuring 10 others, including children, local officials said.
Governor Oleh Syniehubov said guided bombs struck Cherkaska Lozova, damaging a residential building.
""Two women were killed,"" Syniehubov said. ""One was found in the rubble, and the other died in an ambulance.""
Two children were among the injured.
The Kharkiv region, which borders Russia, has faced frequent shelling and bombings during the 30-month conflict.
In a separate incident, Ukrainian air defenses reported shooting down 24 of 52 Russian drones launched overnight across eight regions.
The Ukrainian air force said 25 Shahed drones fell on their own, while three veered toward Russia and Belarus.
No injuries or major damage resulted from these drone attacks, though air alerts caused many people to take cover.
In Kyiv, where the air alert lasted approximately four hours, all drones targeting the city were intercepted without causing significant damage.
This was Kyiv's fourth drone attack this week.
Ukrainian air defenses also shot down drones in the Poltava, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolayiv regions.
In Cherkasy, drone debris caused damage to several private homes.
On Friday, a similar Russian bomb attack on Kharkiv hit a playground and a 12-story residential building.
Officials say six people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed. On social media Saturday, regional Governor Syniehubov said the number of injured had risen from 47 to 96.
Twenty of the injured are reported to be in serious condition, officials say.
The residential building also caught fire.
Ukrainian officials say Russia used glide bombs in the attack. Such bombs are equipped with navigation systems that direct them to their targets. They are difficult to intercept and can cause massive destruction.
Following the strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy again called on his country's Western allies to relax their restrictions and allow Ukraine to use long-range Western weapons in attacks on Russian military bases.
The strike ""would not have happened if our defense forces had the ability to destroy Russian military aircraft where they are based,"" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. ""There is no rational reason to restrict Ukraine's defenses.""
US, Ukrainian officials meet
Meanwhile, in Washington on Friday, a delegation of top Ukrainian officials, including Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
""The Ukrainian side noted that Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defense in order to protect people and critical infrastructure,"" Zelenskyy's office said in a statement about the meeting.
The statement also said Andriy Yermak, Ukraine's head of the office of the president, ""emphasized that it is extremely important for our state to receive weapons from the already announced defense packages as soon as possible.""
On the Russian side, officials said Ukraine fired cluster munitions on the city of Belgorod, killing five people and wounding 37 others.
Meanwhile, in Brussels on Friday, European Union defense ministers called on Ukraine's allies to deliver on those promised weapons systems. The defense ministers met for their first informal meeting following a summer recess, and speaking to reporters ahead of the meeting, they said military aid for Ukraine remains at the top of the agenda.
Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said Ukraine's recent incursion into Russia's Kursk region was going in the right direction but added that Ukraine is doing so with one hand ""behind the back,"" because it needs more weapons systems. He urged colleagues to deliver on promised weapons systems.
Netherlands Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said his country is close to delivering Patriot missile defense systems it promised to Ukraine. He said he did not want to give a precise date because he did not want to tip off the Russians but said it would be soon.
Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, attended the EU defense ministers meeting in Brussels and urged EU member states to pressure Britain and the United States to drop restrictions on using donated long-range weapons against ""legitimate"" targets deep inside Russia.
Both Britain and the United States have put limits on Kyiv's use of donated long-range missiles for fear of escalating the conflict with Russia. Earlier this year, U.S. officials had agreed to allow Ukraine to fire on targets inside Russia in direct response to Moscow's offensive against the city of Kharkiv but left other restrictions in place.
Speaking with reporters, Kuleba said he expects permission to be granted and the delivery of weapons to be used for that purpose. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, speaking alongside Kuleba, expressed his support for lifting the restrictions and urged EU members to pressure Britain and the U.S. to do so.
Fighting continues
Meanwhile, fighting continues in Ukraine, with local authorities in the northeastern Ukraine city of Sumy saying a Russian strike Friday killed two women and wounded eight other people.
The city's prosecutor general's office said the airstrike caused a fire, prompting regional authorities to ask residents to stay inside and close the windows. The office said that a factory that was hit manufactured packaging for baby food, juices and household products.
Sumy lies just across the border from Russia's Kursk region, where Kyiv launched an offensive on August 6 it said was aimed at creating a ""buffer zone"" in Russian territory, among other goals.
Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse."

MIHAIL KOGÄLNICEANU AIR BASE, Romania -- The U.S. Army, in collaboration with Sev1Tech, a leading provider of IT modernization, engineering, fielding, training, and program support services for U.S. government agencies, hosted a two-day event to train U.S. Soldiers on new radio equipment at Mihail KogÄlniceanu Air Base, Romania, Aug. 28-29, 2024.
The ability to communicate effectively in combat environments has been a cornerstone of military success for centuries. In modern warfare, radio is one of the most essential tools for maintaining this communication. With increasing reliance on digital networks and real-time data exchange, ensuring that Soldiers are well-trained in using and maintaining new radios in the field is paramount.
""Today's training is about transitioning from older radio equipment to much newer radio equipment,"" said Pfc. Josalynne McCants, a joint fire support specialist assigned to the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry). ""This training exercise is important because a lot of what we do relies heavily on effective communication; therefore, learning and becoming better acquainted with the tools that will enhance and improve communication is absolutely essential.""
Hands-on training with the AN/PRC 14 Delta and AN/PRC 170 allowed the Soldiers to familiarize themselves with the new communication technology. This technology is crucial in maintaining tactical advantage and seamless coordination during operations. The two-day course covered everything from basic operational procedures to advanced troubleshooting and maintenance.
Army training programs designed to teach Soldiers how to operate new radio systems have become a top priority as technology advances. This training initiative, led by expert defense contractors, focused on hands-on instruction with the latest field radios. Soldiers were taught to set up secure communication links, troubleshoot common issues, and maintain connectivity in difficult environments.
""The goal of this training event is to become more knowledgeable about our equipment, to learn the correct skills, and acquire the knowledge needed to operate the new radios proficiently,"" said 1st Lt. Julia Agan, a fire support officer assigned to 10th MTN Div. (LI). ""As a fire support officer, we are first into the battlefield with the infantry units, so it's extremely important to be well-versed with the new equipment so that we can do our jobs efficiently.""
Through training initiatives like this, V Corps â the Army's only forward deployed warfighting headquarters â continues its unwavering commitment to maintaining a combat-ready force. Through modernization, resolving capability gaps, and evolving force structure, V Corps continuously engages in competition, responds to crises, and prepares to win in conflict.

The Babylon Brigades, which identifies as a Christian militia in Iraq but has Shiite Muslim members and is closely tied to Iran, is taking over Ninevah Plains towns in the country's Christian heartland, displacing Christian mayors and officials on behalf of Iran after Islamic State was swept out.
A militia leader closely linked to Iran, Rayan al-Kildani, has removed Christian officials in the historic Christian towns of Iraq's Ninevah Plains, said Nadine Maenza, president of the Washington-based International Religious Freedom Secretariat, who recently visited the area.
Maenza told VOA al-Kildani has been working to install local leaders who agree with Iran's vision for Iraq. The militia leader portrays himself to be a Christian.
""He took over the Ninevah Council,"" Maenza said. ""He got his own people elected and then he started buying them off. He removed 15 mayors and directors. He replaced all with his own people. So, he basically took over the Ninevah Plains. There are no more Christian (political) leaders outside of the KRG (Kurdistan Regional Government) control.""
Maenza met with some of the mayors who lost their jobs.
Her organization encourages the improvement of religious freedom conditions in 40 countries worldwide, including Iraq. Maenza said local Christians hope an Iraqi Federal Court will rule on al-Kildani's action.
Writing in the Wilson Center's MENA 360 Degree online publication, Maenza said that if al-Kildani continues his campaign, ""it will remove the last independent Christian mayors outside of the Kurdistan region and have a devastating impact on the historic Syriac, Assyrian, and Chaldean Christian cities of Bartella, Qaraqosh, Tel Kef and the Yazidi homeland of Sinjar.""
Maenza told VOA al-Kildani's moves follow his success last year in having the title of patriarch removed from Patriarch Cardinal Louis Sako, the head of Iraq's largest Christian denomination, the Chaldean Catholics. It is an ancient Eastern rite church in full communion with the Vatican.
Sako accused al-Kildani of trying to take over Christian endowments and properties.
Al-Kildani denies the charge and accuses Sako of the same. But Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani reinstated Sako's title in June.
Some Iraqi clerics, including Chaldean Catholic Archbishop Bashar Warda of Irbil, view al-Kildani favorably. The Catholic online publication, The Pillar, reports that his ""diocese has received al-Kildani's assistance in building and pastoral projects, as well as security assistance and political protection.""
The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned al-Kildani in 2019 for alleged human rights abuses, including intimidation, extortion, persecution of religious minorities, and illegally seizing property.
Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said al-Kildani's deal-making has raised his profile with the main political blocks running Iraq and supported by Iran.
""Rayan al-Kildani has provided his support for a range of pro-Iran political forces in Iraq to get their own governance appointed and in return he got rewarded with these lower-level appointments in places that he really cared about within the Ninevah Plains,"" Knights said. ""A lot of the folks are angry about Rayan al-Kildani's rise. He has very, very thin credentials to claim leadership of the Christian community in Iraq or control of their property.""
Maenza called for the reinstatement of election rules in Iraq to protect the political representation of Christians, Yazidis, and other religious and ethnic minorities in parliament so only minority community members can vote for their own representation.
Since 2009, Iraq has allowed all Iraqis to vote for designated minority parliamentary seats, effectively upending minority control of their own representation. This, observers say, has also encouraged the practice of vote buying from non-Christian Iraqis in the minority quota system.
Al-Kildani's party won four of the five Iraqi parliamentary seats reserved for Christians in the last election. His candidates were backed by Shiite political forces.
Still, Knights urged the U.S., the European Union and the worldwide Christian community to work on tightening sanctions on al-Kildani, whether on his property abroad or by curtailing his ability to travel, as another step to rein in his â and Iran's â growing dominance."

Ukraine's Kharkiv and Donetsk regions continued to be hit by deadly strikes from Russia, even as Kyiv's defense chief traveled to the Pentagon to maintain pressure on Washington to loosen restrictions on the use of U.S.-made long-range weapons and allow strikes deeper into Russia to stop Moscow from ""killing our citizens.""
Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Ukraine's Kharkiv region, said on August 31 that a Russian guided bomb attack on a residential building killed two people and injured 10 others -- including children -- in the village of Cherkaska Lozova.
""Two women were killed. One was removed from the rubble, the other died in an ambulance,"" he said.
A day earlier, Synyehubov reported that at least seven people were killed and nearly 100 injured -- including at least 22 children -- when a Russian strike on Kharkiv hit a high-rise residential building and playground.
In the Donetsk region, five people were killed by Russian shelling on August 31 in Chasiv Yar, according to Vadym Filashkin, the head of the Donetsk regional government.
""Chasiv Yar -- is a city in which normal life has been impossible for more than two years. Don't turn yourself into a Russian target! Evacuate!"" he wrote on Telegram.
Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said on August 31 that its forces had captured the settlement of Verezamske, in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, part of incremental gains claimed by Moscow's forces at a time when Ukrainian troops are operating in Russia's Kursk region following their surprise cross-border attack on August 6.
The reports could not immediately be confirmed.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, visiting the Pentagon, told CNN that the U.S. administration is still considering Kyiv's request to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons to hit deeper inside Russia, saying he has presented a list of proposed targets to senior U.S. officials.
""We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect our citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,"" Umerov said in the August 30 interview.
Umerov, who met on August 30 with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, told CNN that ""we are showing that the airfields that they are using to hit our cities are within the range of deep strikes.""
""They're killing our citizens. That's why we want to deter them, we want to stop them, we don't want [to] allow their aviation to come closer to our borders to bomb the cities,"" he said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pressed the United States and other allies to ease restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), saying the use of such weapons would allow Kyiv to strike sites inside Russia used by the Kremlin to launch attacks against civilian areas in Ukraine.
On August 26, he called on Ukraine's global allies to take ""decisive action"" after Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other cities across the country that damaged vital utilities.
The United States and other allies of Ukraine have placed restrictions on the use of the weapons over concerns that it could escalate the war.
Washington has signaled it has given its approval to Kyiv to strike over the border in response to Russian attacks into Ukraine but has resisted further loosening of restrictions.
""You've heard us say that the Ukrainians can use U.S. security assistance to defend themselves from cross-border attacks, in other words counterfire,"" Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said this week.
""But as it relates to long-range strike, deep strikes into Russia, our policy has not changed,"" he added.
Umerov also said the recent dismissal of Air Force chief Mykola Oleshchuk was ""not related"" to the crash of an F-16 fighter jet and was more related to a ""rotation"" of leadership.
""I would probably say that this is a rotation. These are two separate questions...at this stage, I would not link them,"" Umerov said.
""We are analyzing what happened [in regard to the crash]. We have also opened this case to our partners so that they can also analyze it and investigate it with us,"" he added.
Zelensky dismissed Oleshchuk from his post as commander of the Air Force on August 30, a move that came after Ukraine lost the first F-16 fighter jet provided by Western partners. The pilot was killed in the crash.

Iran has summoned the British charge d'affaires over recent sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom against the Islamic Republic.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that it had summoned the chargÃ© d'affaires of the British Embassy in Tehran ""following the recent imposition of sanctions by the UK against three Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity.""
The development came just a day after the UK imposed sanctions against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF) Unit 700 over alleged conduct aimed at destabilizing the UK or any other country.
London also imposed sanctions against three Iranian individuals, namely Hamid Fazeli and Behnam Shahriyari over having alleged intention of destabilizing Israel, and Abdolfatah Ahvazian over the alleged intention of destabilizing the UK.
""The condemnation of these actions, which are contrary to the new UK government's claimed policy of willingness to engage and cooperate, was expressed,"" the Iranian ministry said it had informed the British chargÃ© d'affaires.
""It was also emphasized that everyone knows the largest source of insecurity in the region is the Zionist occupying regime, which is supported politically and militarily by some who claim to maintain stability in the region, including the UK,"" the Iranian ministry said.
""The support of these countries for the genocide of Palestinians and their efforts to prevent accountability for [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, the war criminal, are the basis of instability and insecurity in the region,"" the ministry stated."

Early parliamentary elections took place in the Republic of Azerbaijan on 1 September.
According to the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission, the election took place within a restrictive political and legal environment that did not enable genuine pluralism and resulted in a contest devoid of competition. Despite a voting process that was orderly and assessed to be overall efficiently run, serious irregularities and omissions of important safeguards were observed, particularly in the vote count, raising questions about the integrity of the process. The OSCE/ODIHR mission further noted that the elections took place against the background of continued repression of dissenting voices.
The European Union calls on the Azerbaijani authorities to take on board and implement the OSCE/ODIHR recommendations in relation to these and previous elections. The EU stands ready to assist in this process."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) keeps in touch with different countries to prevent possible use of nuclear weapons, Director General Rafael Grossi said on Monday, adding that he expected to resume dialogue with Iran on its nuclear program as soon as possible.
""Use of nuclear weapons could lead to unstoppable escalation and to a situation which could be completely out of control. So, we try to engage with countries, we try to help to deescalate the situations that may lead to that,"" Grossi said in an interview with Al Arabiya broadcaster.
He also expressed hope to meet with new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as soon as possible in order to discuss the country's nuclear program and the issues associated with it. The IAEA's chief said he is ready to come to Tehran to continue the bilateral dialogue with Iran.
Meanwhile, it is ""extremely improbable"" that Tehran might be secretly developing nuclear weapons behind the backs of international agencies, such as the IAEA, amid the agency's current inspection and verification capability, Grossi added.
In 2015, Tehran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, with the involvement of the European Union. The deal committed Iran to scaling back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump, leading to the collapse of the deal. In 2021, Tehran voluntarily permitted the IAEA to replace cameras at the nuclear facility in the Iranian city of Karaj, saying, however, that it would provide data of the cameras' footage only after the US cancels its sanctions.

An Israeli military commander has been killed during the regime's now-four-day-old deadly escalation across the occupied West Bank.
In a statement on Saturday, the Israeli army said 20-year-old Elkana Navon ""fell during operational activity"" in the city of Jenin in northern West Bank earlier in the day, describing the fatality as a ""squad commander.""
Another trooper was ""severely injured"" in the same incident, it added.
The statement described the incident as an encounter that took place between the Israeli forces, who had invaded a house in the city's refugee camp, and Palestinian resistance fighters.
Saturday marked the fourth day of the escalation by the regime, which has seen its forces bringing various areas across the West Bank, especially those lying in its northern parts, under intensified airstrikes and ground attacks.
Also on Saturday, Herzi Halevi, Israeli army chief of staff, who was visiting Jenin, said the regime's attacks featured going ""from city to city, refugee camp to refugee camp, with excellent intelligence, with very good operational capabilities, with a very strong air intelligence envelope...""
At least 22 Palestinians have been killed so far during the escalation.
Reacting to the massacres, the Gaza Strip-based Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has warned that the regime was seeking to expand its October-present genocidal war on Gaza, which has so far claimed the lives of at least 40,691 Palestinians, to the West Bank.
On Friday, however, the Islamic Jihad, Hamas' fellow Gaza-headquartered resistance group asserted that the Israeli aggression would only further embolden the resistance in its ongoing endeavor to liberate the Palestinian territories from Israeli occupation.
Such crimes, the group said, ""will not achieve its (the regime's) goals, but will only increase our determination and resolve to resist until the occupation is expelled from our land."""

PRAGUE -- Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has insisted Ukraine has a right to defend itself, including through attacks on Russian territory amid a debate over Western-imposed limits on the use of weaponry, but he acknowledged that Prague's allies supplying the most sophisticated weapons face ""strategic dilemmas.""
Speaking on the second day of the Globsec security conference in Prague on August 31, the Czech Republic's top diplomat also acknowledged broadly that there are ""a lot of difficulties and a lot of divergences"" ensuring that allies are on the same page.
""The Czech Republic has a very simple stance: Ukraine is a victim of aggression, and according to the UN Charter, the aggressor has the right to defend itself,"" Lipavsky told RFE/RL. ""This defense can logically also take place on the territory of the aggressor. That means the Czech Republic does not set any limits on the systems it provides, or on the weapons or ammunition it supplies, to what military equipment is supplied to Ukraine.""
Czech President Petr Pavel and outgoing EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell each argued publicly on August 30 for abandoning restrictions on how Ukraine can use donated weapons.
With the United States and Germany most notably said to be imposing such curbs, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly urged them and others to take ""decisive action"" and allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-provided weapons.
Earlier this month, Ukraine launched an incursion into Russian territory with Zelenskiy saying Russia ""must feel what it has done.""
""On the other hand,"" Lipavsky said in Prague, ""let's be realistic in that the most sophisticated weapons systems, which may have a long reach, or simply put the supplier into certain strategic dilemmas, do not flow from the Czech Republic. That means we do not [face] the questions that some of our allies have, for example.""
Russian aerial bombardments have devastated Ukraine's power and other infrastructure and caused large numbers of civilian casualties throughout the country in the two-and-a-half-year full-scale invasion, although Moscow insists it does not target civilians.
""It's better if the plane with the missile or bomb doesn't even take off, to give an example, than trying to shoot down the plane or the missile that is targeting [Ukraine]. I think that is logical and Russia has no claim it can impose on Ukraine,"" Lipavsky said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a day earlier that Central Europe was ""the beating heart of solidarity"" since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
But the Czech Republic's neighbors -- and fellow EU and NATO members -- Slovakia and, especially, Hungary have resisted or, in Budapest's case, refused to supply Kyiv with military aid despite widespread consensus among most members.
Lipavsky said the Czech stance ""is absolutely clear and Czechia is committing to support Ukraine militarily, humanitarily, [and] politically as long as it is necessary for Ukraine to win.""
But he acknowledged that maintaining the kind of ""solidarity"" that von der Leyen referred to is a challenge even among Central Europeans, keeping allies like Hungary and Slovakia on side.
""We have to work on that. It is not easy,"" Lipavsky said. ""Here is a lot of difficulties and a lot of divergences. But this is the task, to keep them as close as possible.""

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov took part in the talks.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Vulin, I am delighted to welcome you to Vladivostok and to Russia.
I hope that your business mission here will be both successful and useful, particularly in terms of carrying out a careful review and assessing cooperation opportunities with Russia's Far East, a vast region that holds immense potential and promise.
We have so many guests from a wide range of countries here, representing companies of all kinds and from across the world, including Asia and Europe. I believe that in addition to taking part in informal debates and official events, you can also engage with your colleagues from other countries. This is what makes events of this kind so valuable, among other things.
As for our bilateral relations, it is widely known what they represent. I am referring to the deep-rooted relations, their historical roots and the spiritual affinity between the people of Russia, the Russian nation and the Serbian nation.
Unfortunately, in terms of our trade and economic ties, trade has been declining, albeit slightly. I am aware that you and your cabinet are working on these matters. Perhaps it is time to hold an intergovernmental commission meeting in order to review the obstacles we face in this regard and remove them. Moreover, we have so many interesting avenues for cooperation in manufacturing, transport and industrial cooperation.
As you know, Russia plays a crucial role in supplying Serbia with energy resources, doing so efficiently and at a high level, always in a timely manner and on favourable terms for Serbia. This is something we will also discuss. There are specific issues we must address in this regard. For example, I am referring to the fact that our gas supply deals are set to expire in March 2025.
Of course, we are looking forward to hearing your assessment of what has been happening in your region from a security perspective and in terms of fulfilling the existing international agreements, particularly the Dayton Agreement. It would be very interesting and useful to hear your perspective and assessments on all these matters.
Welcome.
Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vulin (retranslated): Mr President,
It is a great honour and privilege for me to have a conversation with you today, and I can assure you that it is a great source of inspiration for all the people of Serbia. After all, we, the Serbs, are always better off whenever Russia is there for Serbia and cares about what Serbia is doing.
Serbia would not exist, had Russia failed to persevere throughout all these centuries. Not only do our nations have a shared past but they are also building their future together. I would like to take this opportunity, which is a great honour for me, to convey to you the heartfelt and fraternal greetings on behalf of President Aleksandar Vucic. He wishes you to stay strong and healthy for many years to come, and to serve as the leader of the Russian land for the wellbeing of the people of Russia.
As you know, Serbia is more than just a strategic partner for Russia. Serbia is also Russia's ally. It is for this reason that we face so much pressure from the West. However, under Aleksandar Vucic's leadership, Serbia would never join NATO, nor would it impose sanctions on the Russian Federation. It would not allow anyone to use its territory for any anti-Russian undertakings. Serbia has not taken part and will never contribute to the anti-Russia hysteria.
We respect and appreciate Russia. The forum I am attending demonstrates that attempts to isolate Russia bring nothing but harm. You cannot isolate Russia. Serbia would never participate in any initiative of this kind. You know that our region is facing quite a challenging situation, at least as far as Serbia is concerned. Pristina has been taking unilateral steps to reshape the situation on the ground, subvert Resolution 1244 and carry out ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Metohija. Pristina disregards its own decision and the fact that it undertook with its own signature to create a Community of Serb Municipalities and carry out the Brussels Agreement.
Republika Srpska has also been a matter of concern for us. There is a lot of pressure now to diminish it and alter the Dayton Agreement. This cannot be done. If you want peace, if you want stability, it is President Aleksandar Vucic who guarantees peace. In fact, he is the utmost champion and guarantor of peace and stability in our region. I am very grateful for giving me the opportunity to convey this message to you.
I would like to extend my gratitude for your personal contribution to our relations and the way you have been seeking to preserve the truth. You have been there for us and helped us counter attempts to adopt a resolution on the alleged Srebrenica genocide. You resonated with our cause and supported us in important ways. It happened back in 2015 when the UK put forward this resolution at the Security Council. We will never forget your personal contribution to our struggle for truth about the Serb nation. We would like to express our immense gratitude to you and the Russian people for helping preserve our territorial integrity and sovereignty on the Kosovo and Metohija issues.
We do know that whenever Russia's voice is heard, Serbia can also make its voice heard. And whenever someone tries to silence Russia, Serbia loses its voice, too. Make no mistake, the people of Serbia under President Vucic's leadership would never allow our fraternal relations and our strategic partnership to be undermined.
Vladimir Putin: Please, send my best wishes to President Vucic. We are looking forward to seeing him at the events which will be held as part of the BRICS leaders' meeting in Kazan in the BRICS Outreach format. We have sent him the invitation. I hope that the President accepts it.

XXFQ596089_OOKT4FKAPQR7WUW,US transfers 'some aircraft' used by former Afghan army to Uzbekistan,_,_,20240902,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240901-voa01.htm,"By Samiullah Jalalzai, Roshan Noorzai September 01, 2024
The United States has handed over to the Uzbek government possession of aircraft that former Afghan air force personnel flew to Uzbekistan after the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021.
A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department told VOA on Thursday that the ownership of ""some aircraft"" was transferred to Uzbekistan as part of the Department of Defense's Excess Defense Articles program.
""This transfer was agreed in the context of our strong bilateral cooperation on counterterrorism, counternarcotics and enhanced border security,"" the spokesperson told VOA in an email, without saying how many aircraft were transferred to the Uzbek government.
The fate of aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan after the fall of Afghanistan into the hands of the Taliban has been a bone of contention between the Taliban and Uzbekistan for three years.
Afghan air force personnel flew about 46 aircraft â 22 military planes and 24 helicopters â to Uzbekistan as the government in Afghanistan collapsed in the face of the Taliban's advances in August 2021.
The Taliban, who consider the aircraft to be Afghan property, objected to the handover of the aircraft to Uzbekistan.
""The Ministry of Defense [of the Taliban] clearly declares that the United States has no right to donate or confiscate the property of the Afghan people,"" the spokesperson of the Taliban's Ministry of Defense said in an audio message sent to media this week.
The Taliban spokesperson also called on Uzbekistan to make a ""reasonable decision"" to return the aircraft to the Taliban.
Local media in Uzbekistan reported last week that the U.S. ambassador said the aircraft had already been transferred.
Tashkent has not commented yet on the transfer. However, Uzbek authorities previously said that the aircraft belonged to the United States because the U.S. government paid for them and that it would not return the military equipment to the Taliban.
Tashkent-Taliban relations
Alisher Hamidov, an expert on Central Asia, told VOA that the transfer of aircraft to Uzbekistan may complicate the relations between Tashkent and the Taliban.
""The situation with the planes may now endanger Uzbekistan's diplomatic relations,"" he said, adding that Tashkent has been playing mediator between Kabul and other countries over the past three years.
""The main goal was to bring Afghanistan [Taliban] to the international arena, restore relations and, of course, strengthen Uzbekistan's economy and foreign policy,"" Hamidov added.
Uzbekistan has cultivated close relations with the Taliban, though it does not officially recognize the Taliban's government in Afghanistan.
On Thursday, the Taliban's deputy prime minister, Abdul Ghani Baradar, attended the inauguration ceremony of the Termez International Trade Center in Uzbekistan's border town of Termez.
On August 17, the prime minister of Uzbekistan, Abdulla Aripov, visited Kabul and signed 35 trade and investment agreements valued at $2.5 billion.
Malik Mansur of VOA's Uzbek Service contributed to this report, which originated in VOA's Afghan Service."

In response to the intensified shelling of Ukrainian civilian objects by Russia, including the attack in Poltava that killed dozens of people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania summoned a representative of the Embassy of the Russian Federation to Lithuania to express a strong protest.
Lithuania's Foreign Ministry noted that rockets and bombs hitting educational institutions, hospitals, and residential areas demonstrate Russia's desperation and complete disregard for human life and international humanitarian law. The Foreign Ministry reminded that legal responsibility lays not only with the direct perpetrators of Russia's war crimes, but also with those responsible for the very planning and execution of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine.
Lithuania, together with the international community, once again calls on Russia to immediately stop its criminal brutal aggression and reiterates that it will do everything possible to further strengthen the support to Ukraine."

Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas. We have now confirmed that one of the hostages killed by these vicious Hamas terrorists was an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
I am devastated and outraged. Hersh was among the innocents brutally attacked while attending a music festival for peace in Israel on October 7. He lost his arm helping friends and strangers during Hamas' savage massacre.  He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world. I have gotten to know his parents, Jon and Rachel. They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable. They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express.  I know all Americans tonight will have them in their prayers, just as Jill and I will.  I have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and am heartbroken by the news of his death. It is as tragic as it is reprehensible. Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.

Turkish security forces have identified and arrested a Kosovar national on charges of managing the financial network of Mossad in the country and transferring money on behalf of the Israeli spy agency.
The Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) said in a statement that Liridon Rexhepi was a ""financier for the Israeli intelligence"", and was sending money to informants who ""were filming with drones, conducting psychological warfare against Palestinian politicians and collecting information about the situation in Syria.""
Turkish security sources said on Tuesday that MIT started following Rexhepi when he entered Turkey on August 25, and that Istanbul's Counterterrorism Police detained him on August 30.
Rexhepi admitted to making cash transfers to informants via Western Union, a financial services corporation, and was sent to prison pending a court appearance, they said.
MIT said that Mossad has been sending money to its spies in Turkey from Eastern European countries, especially Kosovo. Some of the funds were transferred to informants in Syria.
They also used cryptocurrencies, according to the Turkish sources.
Last December, director of Israel's so-called internal security service, Shin Bet, said his organization was prepared to target Hamas anywhere, including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar.
Turkish authorities warned Israel of ""serious consequences"" if it tries to hunt down members of the Palestinian resistance group living outside Palestinian territories, including in Turkey.
Since January, Turkish officials have detained dozens of people, among them private investigators, on charges of collecting data on individuals, mostly Palestinians residing in Turkey, for Mossad.
Back in February, Turkish police arrested seven people on suspicion of selling information to Mossad through private detectives.
Seven more people, including a private detective, were arrested in March â also for selling information to Mossad. Another two were arrested in April.
Turkey halted all trade with Israel in May and it filed a request with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague in August to join South Africa's genocide case against Israel over the war on Gaza.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the strongest and vocal critics of Israel's bloody onslaught against Gaza on the international stage, and has praised Hamas for fighting against occupation."

Yemen's Armed Forces have targeted another ship heading towards the ports of the occupied Palestinian territories in their latest pro-Palestinian operation.
The forces announced conducting the operation in a statement on Monday, identifying the vessel as ""Blue Lagoon I,"" which, they said, had been targeted while sailing through the Red Sea.
""The operation was conducted jointly by the missile force, naval forces, and the drone air force,"" the statement read, adding that it ""involved [firing of] several appropriate missiles and drones, resulting in a direct hit.""
The mission was carried out ""in support for the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters,"" the forces noted.
Since October 7, when the Israeli regime began a genocidal war against the Gaza Strip, the Yemeni forces have been carrying out numerous pro-Palestinian strikes against the occupied territories.
They have also been targeting Israeli ships and vessels heading towards or away from the territories as means of trying to force the regime into stopping the military onslaught and a siege that it has been simultaneously imposing on Gaza.
In the statement, the forces said they ""renew their warnings to all companies dealing with the Israeli enemy that their ships will be targeted as they pass through the announced maritime operational area, regardless of their destination.""
Besides taking aim at trespassing ships across the Red Sea, the forces have been targeting such vessels throughout the Arabian Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean.
The statement repeated the forces' threat that they would keep up their operations as long as the regime sustained the war and the crippling siege.
The brutal Israeli military onslaught has so far claimed the lives of nearly 40,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children."
YL8PZMIQ5V_TPE9URHI6V69J1Q,Cambodia's Hun Manet faces biggest test yet as he marks one year in power,_,_,20240903,globalsecurity.org,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/09/mil-240902-voa03.htm,"By Hul Reaksmey September 02, 2024
A year after succeeding his father as Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Manet is facing widespread public anger over a regional economic cooperation plan with Vietnam and Laos that is testing his political acumen.
Thousands of Cambodians living in Japan, South Korea and Australia have staged protests against the Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area (CLV-DTA) initiative, citing fears of ceding sovereignty or inviting large-scale immigration from Vietnam.
Although the initiative has been in place for decades, regional meetings this year for a 2030 ""master plan"" have put it back in the spotlight. An 11-minute video posted on Facebook by government critics last month fanned historic resentment toward Vietnam and its perceived control over the current government, which Hanoi installed and backed throughout the 1980s.
While political analysts say fears of the CLV-DTA may be overblown and fueled by online misinformation, they also blame the government for failing to provide transparent explanations about the initiative, instead seeking to suppress dissent, which has only fueled suspicions of ill intentions.
Sophal Ear, an associate professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University, told VOA Khmer in an email that the underlying concerns about Cambodia's sovereignty is a significant test for Hun Manet.
""It challenges his ability to navigate complex regional projects while addressing domestic concerns about national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Successfully managing this controversy will be crucial in establishing his credibility as a leader who can protect Cambodia's interests while engaging in regional cooperation,"" he said.
""How he handles this situation could set the tone for his leadership and influence public perception of his capacity to govern effectively,"" he added.
Hun Manet took office on August 22, 2023, shortly after an election the United States deemed neither free nor fair. His father, Hun Sen, was the party's prime minister candidate and arranged for his son to take power ahead of the formation of a new government.
While the generational transfer of power allowed some Western countries to reset relations with Cambodia, there has been little change in the government's reliance on China or its approach to critics and perceived opponents. Dozens of activists and political opponents have been arrested under Hun Manet.
Earlier this month, authorities arrested more than 30 people across the country amid reports of a planned mass demonstration against the CLV initiative in Phnom Penh on August 18.
The creators of the Facebook video were also arrested after it drew the ire of government leaders. Hun Sen, who is now president of the Senate, has threatened additional arrests should public criticism continue.
Sophal Ear said the proactive arrests, along with the deployment of a heavy security presence across major cities, showed the government's determination to quell any significant uprising before it gains momentum.
""However, the situation remains fluid, and the government's approach could either suppress the movement or further galvanize public opposition, depending on how it handles the protesters and addresses the underlying concerns,"" he told VOA Khmer on August 26.
In a public address on August 22 marking one year in power, Hun Manet addressed criticism and concerns about the development triangle area, saying it was meant to ""create potential and development"" in the four Cambodian provinces involved.
He said the initiative would spur infrastructure construction in border regions, encourage more productive land use, and protect forests for joint development. In his speech, Hun Manet highlighted that the initiative would strengthen sovereignty of Cambodia while ""boosting the development and maintaining stability and security"" for its people.
The attention of the CLV initiative also comes as Cambodia is pushing ahead with the controversial 180-kilometer Funan Techo Canal project that will rely significantly on Chinese funding, which carries its own regional implications as it would bypass traditional trade routes through the Mekong delta in Vietnam.
The CLV furor has been a distraction from the Funan Techo project, which officially broke ground earlier this month. Political professor Em Sovannara, who is based in Cambodia, said Hun Manet seems unable to deal with the issue.
""First, I think building the canal is part of creating political value for the new prime minister. Second, on the issue of the CLV project left from the past, the current prime minister has no ability to respond or deal with it based on our observation,"" he said.
Soeng Senkaruna, a former senior official at the human rights group ADHOC who fled to live in Australia, told VOA Khmer that he expected Hun Manet to continue trying to address the criticism by silencing it or creating distractions.
""So, they will not solve the problems according to what the people are demanding, so they will keep defending this project,"" he said. ""We are aware that this project is a long-term strategy between Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. That's why the child prime minister and his father, the former prime minister, as we saw, we know that they can't do anything with Vietnam. Thus, he has no capacity to deal with this issue. The new prime minister will do nothing.""
Cambodia is expected to host a ministerial summit later this year for the review and adoption of the Master Plan for Socio-Economic Development in the CLV-DTA up to 2030.
Cambodia's exiled opposition leaders have seized on fears about the initiative, which could negatively impact four Cambodian border provinces â Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri, Kratie and Stung Treng â as well as provinces in Laos in Vietnam.
The plan encourages freer flow of goods and people across the borders but entering a joint development with its larger and much more populous eastern neighbor also rekindles many Cambodians' traditional fear of Vietnamese expansion and domination.
""The project is in fact a cover for further illegal deforestation, land evictions and exploitation of natural resources for foreign gain,"" the Khmer Movement for Democracy wrote August 14 on X.
""Continued illegal Vietnamese immigration into the four Cambodian provinces concerned by the agreement, and the effective control that Vietnam will wield over the economy of the region, means that the provinces will effectively become vassals controlled by Vietnam,"" it added.
Cambodia's government spokesman Pen Bona said Hun Manet was ensuring peace, security and national sovereignty, and denied restricting freedom of expression or dissent.
""Lately, we have seen the people using opposition culture to cause destruction by a handful of people. So, the government must take very strict measures by not absolutely allowing such a group to use its own trick to spoil peace or harmony or national development,"" he told VOA.
He added, ""I would like to clarify: Don't consider the government measures as a restriction of freedom of expression [or] democratic freedom."""

The commander of the Israeli Army Ground Forces has resigned from his position, amid a recent wave of resignations by the regime's high-ranking officers, which has fueled speculation about the potential for a domino effect within various institutions.
The Israeli military said in a statement on Tuesday that Major General Tamir Yadai has stepped down due to ""personal reasons.""
Yadai has served as the head of the Ground Forces for the past three years.
The Israeli army's chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi and minister of military affairs Yoav Gallant have approved Yadai's request, the statement added.
Yadai is expected to leave the office within the coming weeks, once a replacement officer is found. It is not immediately clear who will be his successor.
Back on June 9, Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz and war cabinet observer Gadi Eisenkot stepped out of Israel's war cabinet.
They joined Netanyahu's administration after Israel launched its onslaught against the Gaza Strip in early October last year, leading to the formation of the emergency coalition, which then established the war cabinet.
Addressing a press conference in Tel Aviv, Gantz called on Netanyahu to hold early elections ""as soon as possible.""
""Months after the October tragedy, the situation in Israel and in the room of the decision-makers has changed. Netanyahu and his partners have turned unity into a moving call without real-world action. Fateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,"" Gantz said.
""Unfortunately, Netanyahu prevents us from reaching true victory. Therefore, today, we are leaving the emergency coalition with a heavy heart, but with a full heart,"" he added.
Earlier, Brigadier General Avi Rosenfeld, commander of the Israeli military's Gaza Division, resigned from his post over failure to prevent a historic operation by the Gaza Strip-based Palestinian resistance groups early last October.
Rosenfeld submitted his resignation in a letter to the chief of staff of the Israeli army, saying he ""failed"" in his mission to protect the regime in the face of the Palestinian resistance's Operation al-Aqsa Storm, which was carried out on October 7, 2023.
""I have decided to end my position as commander of the 143rd Division (the Gaza Division) ... as part of my responsibility as a commander,"" he wrote in his resignation letter.
Israel waged the genocidal war against the Gaza Strip, targeting hospitals, residences, and houses of worship after Palestinian resistance movements launched a surprise attack, dubbed Operation al-Aqsa Storm, against the usurping regime on October 7.
At least 40,786 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children, and another 94,224 individuals have sustained injuries. More than 1.7 million people have been internally displaced during the war as well."

For Immediate Release  Office of Public Affairs
The Dassault Falcon 900EX Aircraft Was Illegally Exported from the United States and Used for the Benefit of Maduro and His Representatives
The Justice Department today announced the seizure of a Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft owned and operated for the benefit of NicolÃ¡s Maduro Moros and persons affiliated with him in Venezuela. The aircraft was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the Southern District of Florida at the request of the United States based on violations of U.S. export control and sanctions laws.

""This morning, the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by NicolÃ¡s Maduro and his cronies,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ""The Department will continue to pursue those who violate our sanctions and export controls to prevent them from using American resources to undermine the national security of the United States.""
""Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,"" said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod of the Department of Commerce.  ""It doesn't matter how fancy the private jet or how powerful the officials - we will work relentlessly with our partners here and across the globe to identify and return any aircraft illegally smuggled outside of the United States.""
""The United States' seizure of the Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft illustrates our unrelenting commitment to enforcing U.S. export control laws and imposing U.S. sanctions for any violations,"" said U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida. ""This successful seizure was the result of planning, coordination, and execution by the United States government, with invaluable assistance by the authorities in the Dominican Republic. Our office, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to work to forfeit this plane and all other assets that circumvent the law.""
""The seizure of this aircraft is another significant action by Homeland Security Investigations working with our domestic and international partners against the illegal activities of the Maduro regime,"" said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami. ""The efforts here highlight HSI's global reach and our continued commitment to enforce US sanctions and stemming the flow of illicit proceeds being generated from high level foreign public corruption.""
In August 2019, the President issued Executive Order 13884, which prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with persons who have acted or purported to act directly or indirectly for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela, including as a member of the Maduro regime. To protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, the Department of Commerce has also imposed export controls for items intended, entirely or in part, for a Venezuelan military or military-intelligence end user.
According to the U.S. investigation, in late 2022 and early 2023, persons affiliated with Maduro allegedly used a Caribbean-based shell company to conceal their involvement in the illegal purchase of the Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft (which at the time was valued at approximately $13 million) from a company based in the Southern District of Florida.  The aircraft was then illegally exported from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean in April 2023. Since May 2023, the Dassault Falcon, bearing tail number T7-ESPRT, has flown almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela and has been used for the benefit of Maduro and his representatives, including to transport Maduro on visits to other countries.
The Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security Miami Field Office is investigating the case, along with the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) El Dorado Task Force Miami.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joshua Paster and Jorge Delgado for the Southern District of Florida and Trial Attorney Ahmed Almudallal of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are handling the matter. The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs and HSI in Santo Domingo provided significant assistance in working with authorities in the Dominican Republic. The United States thanks the Dominican Republic for its assistance in this matter.
The burden to prove forfeitability in a forfeiture proceeding is upon the government.

URUMQI, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- A resolution opposing a series of U.S. sanctions related to northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and providing support for affected companies was unveiled and took effect on Monday, according to the regional legislature.
Passed by the Standing Committee of the 14th Xinjiang Regional People's Congress in August, the resolution stated that the U.S. imposing sanctions on Xinjiang enterprises employing so-called ""forced labor,"" is in fact political manipulation and economic bullying under the guise of human rights protection.
The so-called ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act,"" which took effect in June 2022, prohibits the entry of Xinjiang goods into the U.S. market in the name of combating ""forced labor,"" damages the rights of Xinjiang enterprises, and causes severe harm to the rights to subsistence and development of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
The sanctioned companies involve industries such as textiles and clothing, and silicon-based solar products, which play an important role in promoting high-quality development, creating employment and increasing rural residents' income.
Anwar Abdullah, an entrepreneur and a deputy to the Xinjiang Regional People's Congress, said these labor-intensive enterprises sanctioned by the U.S. are among the most for ordinary people to find jobs and earn money to support their families.
""The purpose of the U.S. is to prevent Xinjiang and its enterprises from developing,"" he said. ""Through sanctions, people in Xinjiang lose their right to development.""
The rights of workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are guaranteed and people live harmonious lives, the resolution stated. However, neglecting these facts and such progress, the U.S. maliciously slanders the human rights situation in Xinjiang. U.S. unilateral sanctions and the implementation of long-arm jurisdiction violate international law and business ethics, undermine the stability of global industrial and supply chains, and disrupt the international trade order, said the resolution.
The U.S. gross interference in Xinjiang affairs, which are purely China's internal affairs, seriously violates international law and the basic principles of international relations, and is opposed by people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, it added.
The resolution aims to expose to both the international community and the people of Xinjiang, what is clearly a sinister U.S. intention in implementing sanctions against Xinjiang, and to reveal the U.S. suppression of the region's enterprises and its undermining of Xinjiang's social stability and development.
It demanded that the U.S. stop unwarranted sanctions, infringement of labor rights and other wrongdoings. It urged the U.S. to restore a fair market environment for sanctioned enterprises, a development environment in which people in Xinjiang can pursue a happy life, and a fair economic, trade and rule of law environment for the international community.
Xinjiang is committed to supporting the enterprises and industries affected by U.S. sanctions based on false accusations of ""forced labor,"" according to the resolution.
Regional legislative bodies at all levels are urged to expedite the legislation of relevant laws to provide legal support for these sanctioned enterprises and relevant industries.
Local governments are encouraged to help sanctioned companies expand their domestic and international markets, promote their products, boost innovation, and strengthen the appeal of company brands.
In addition, relevant judicial authorities are urged to actively provide legal support to these companies, and to help defend their rights.
Sanctioned companies should make efforts to use legal measures to protect their rights, modernize management, increase technological innovation, improve product quality, enhance core competitiveness, and expand markets while seeking new opportunities, among others.
Cheng Yufeng, head of a silicon manufacturer based in Xinjiang, said that after being sanctioned by the U.S., the company has seen a decline in profits and headwinds in business. However, the company has secured jobs and ensured workers' income does not decline through innovation, expanding domestic business, and other ways, he added.
""With help and care from all walks of life, our enterprise will have more room for development,"" he said."

Experts slam Manila, Washington for repeated trouble-stirring in South China Sea
By Liu Xuanzun Published: Sep 01, 2024 10:20 PM Updated: Sep 01, 2024 11:15 PM
A US Navy patrol aircraft was reportedly spotted as a Philippine Coast Guard ship rammed into a China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel in the lagoon of China's Xianbin Jiao in the South China Sea on Saturday, with experts saying the US plane serves as encouragement for the Philippines to conduct bolder and riskier provocations.
The Philippine Coast Guard ship MRRV-9701, which has been illegally stationed at China's Xianbin Jiao, on Saturday lifted its anchor and conducted continuous maneuvers, stirring up troubles in the lagoon of Xianbin Jiao. CCG Vessel 5205 took measures including verbal warnings, monitoring and control in accordance with the law and regulations, Liu Dejun, a CCG spokesperson, said in a statement on Saturday.
In the process, the Philippine MRRV-9701 deliberately rammed into CCG Vessel 5205 in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, causing a collision for which the Philippines bears full responsibility, Liu said.
Liu demanded the Philippines to immediately withdraw its ship from the Chinese reef.
The CCG also released a video showing the Philippine ship sailing into the path of the Chinese vessel, causing the collusion.
The Philippines has repeatedly attempted to send supplies to the MRRV-9701 that has been illegally anchored in the lagoon of China's Xianbin Jiao since April, first using ships then using a helicopter, marking serious violations to China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, as well as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.
The latest movement by the MRRV-9701 showed that, unlike the Philippines' old warship illegally grounded at China's Ren'ai Jiao, the MRRV-9701 is capable of moving on its own, observers said.
Xue Chen, a research fellow at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times that if the MRRV-9701 runs short of supplies, it should withdraw from Xianbin Jiao and return to the Philippines.
It exposed that the Philippine ship's deployment at Xianbin Jiao is aimed at creating a false concept to smear China in the international community, with the aim of violating China's sovereignty, Xue said.
During the incident, a US Navy P-8A maritime patrol aircraft was spotted on-site disrupting the CCG's law enforcement operations, according to Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account affiliated with state broadcaster China Central Television.
A Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday that the US military aircraft could gather intelligence and potentially carry out jamming on Chinese vessels.
The P-8A's presence serves as an encouragement to the Philippines to conduct harder provocations, the expert said, noting that US aircraft could also serve as an aerial military ""journalist"" contributing to its scheme of throwing mud on China.
Such moves will only sabotage peace and stability in the South China Sea, experts said, predicting new rounds of provocations by the Philippines in near future, backed by the US."

In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris held talks and signed a bilateral agreement.
The Ukrainian President noted that 7 people were killed and more than 50 injured overnight in Lviv due to a Russian missile strike. There were also casualties in Kryvyi Rih as a result of the Russian attack. The second day of clearing the rubble continues in Poltava, where nearly 300 people have been affected overall.
""Under such conditions, we in Ukraine especially appreciate every show of support for our state and our people, and we value the fact that Ireland, a militarily neutral state, is not neutral morally,"" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The President thanked Ireland for its unwavering support of Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, Ireland has provided humanitarian aid and assistance to Ukrainian infrastructure worth â¬380 million.
Ireland is also participating in the implementation of the Peace Formula and supports sanctions against Russia. During the meeting, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Simon Harris specifically discussed how to make the sanctions regime more effective.
""Unfortunately, Russia is still able to manufacture missiles using components from different countries around the world. Moreover, the Russian state creates various schemes to circumvent sanctions. All of this can only be stopped through strong, timely, and collective efforts by all countries that value a normal rules-based world order and seek peace,"" the President emphasized.
The leaders signed a bilateral security agreement. According to the Ukrainian President, this document will allow the realization of the full potential of cooperation between Ukraine and Ireland, as well as with partners within the framework of the security agreement architecture.
Simon Harris assured that Ireland would support Ukraine for as long as needed. He also announced that his country would provide an additional â¬36 million in humanitarian aid.
""We will never allow this to continue and become normalized. And we will never allow events like those that happened this morning to be normalized,"" stressed the Irish Taoiseach.
During his visit to Ukraine, Simon Harris visited communities in the Kyiv region that experienced Russian strikes and attempted occupation. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope for significant Ireland's participation in Ukraine's reconstruction."

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi on the eve of his next visit to the Zaporizhzhia NPP temporarily occupied by Russia.
The Head of State thanked Rafael Grossi and his team for their tenth visit to our country during the work of the IAEA monitoring mission at the temporarily occupied Ukrainian plant.
""I am grateful for the IAEA's two years of work at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. We support the Agency's continued monitoring of the situation at the plant,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted.
The President also briefed his interlocutor on the consequences of the massive Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure with ballistic and cruise missiles, along with kamikaze drones, which led to the temporary disconnection of NPP units from the grid and a reduction in their capacity.
""The shelling of critical infrastructure by the Russian Federation is the largest threat to the safe operation of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. It primarily affects ordinary people,"" the Head of State emphasized.
During the meeting, the parties discussed the improvement of nuclear safety in Ukraine, particularly in the context of the inadmissibility of shelling Ukrainian NPPs and other energy facilities. A stable external power supply is critical for the safety of nuclear power plants.
The parties agreed on the need to extend the mandate of the current IAEA monitoring missions to nuclear power plants in Ukraine in order to ensure continuous monitoring not only of the condition of nuclear power plants, but also of substations critical for their operation.
As for further technical assistance to our country, the IAEA also assured of its support for the construction of new nuclear power units in Ukraine."

In an X post on Monday, Abbas Araqchi said Israel's Western supporters bear responsibility for their failure to end ""criminal provocations"" by the occupying regime in the region.
""By persisting in Gaza genocide and now dispatching its killing machine to West Bank, Israel's pushing region to brink of dangerous crisis,"" he said.
""If Bibi's Western enablers fail to curb these criminal provocations, they'll share responsibility for consequencesâand be held accountable,"" he added, referring to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Israel launched a genocidal war on the besieged Gaza on October 7, 2023 after the Hamas resistance group carried out a surprise operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.
So far, however, the Tel Aviv regime has failed to achieve any of its declared objectives in the Gaza Strip despite killing at least 40,786 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring 94,224 others.
During the same period, the Israeli military has also conducted bloody raids in the occupied West Bank and killed 670 Palestinians.
On August 28, the Israeli army launched a massive West Bank assault, deploying hundreds of troops and conducting airstrikes on the cities of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the occupying regime."

On 4 September 2024, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation ensured a safe rotation of the 22nd IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) team at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The rotation was organised by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi.
To this end, a ceasefire regime, strictly observed by Russian servicemen, was declared from 05:30 to 08:00 along the route of movement from the crossing point designated by the observers - the destroyed bridge near the Kamenskoye. While inspecting the road in the area of the crossing, Russian servicemen located unexploded foreign-made ammunition left in the immediate vicinity of the ZNPP as a result of renewed regular shelling from the Ukrainian side.
Four inspectors have arrived to observe and assess the safety of Zaporozhye NPP. During the rotation, IAEA Director R. Grossi visited cooling tower No. 1, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked by drones on 11 August. The Russian side's analysis of the scene showed that the UAVs were equipped with an incendiary substance that caused the fire. Rafael Grossi and IAEA experts confirmed that a fire source at the base of the cooling tower was unlikely.
The IAEA experts have been present at the Zaporozhye NPP since 1 September 2022, following the first visit of Director General Rafael Grossi to the Plant.
For Reference:
At the moment, all units of Zaporozhye NPP are shut down and are in the state of 'cold shutdown'. The equipment is maintained in accordance with all necessary regulations under strict control of radiation safety standards.
Radiation background at the plant and the adjacent territory is unchanged and is at the level corresponding to normal operation of the power units and does not exceed natural background values.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must remain in a strip of land between the Gaza Strip and the Egyptian border to prevent Hamas from rearming. He spoke as the White House said Israel must withdraw at least partially from the area.
The Israeli army published a picture Wednesday of the opening of the tunnel in Gaza where the bodies of six Israeli hostages were found after they had been executed by Hamas on Saturday.
The deaths of the six, including American Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, have sparked mass demonstrations in Israel by hundreds of thousands of Israelis who want Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire deal with Hamas that would free the remaining 101 hostages.
The demonstrations have grown increasingly angry as many blame Netanyahu for holding up a cease-fire deal. Three of the six hostages killed by Hamas were set to have been released in the first phase of the deal, meaning they were killed days before they could have been freed.
Israeli media reports say Netanyahu had agreed to leave the Philadelphi corridor, the strip of land along the border between Gaza and Egypt.
Mossad chief David Barnea confirmed on Monday to mediators in the talks with Hamas taking place in Qatar that Israel was prepared to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor in the second stage of a hostage release deal. This was hours before Netanyahu publicly declared he would refuse to do so, foreign sources familiar with the negotiations told the Haaretz newspaper.
Barnea, who traveled to Qatar on Monday, had informed the representatives that Israel stood behind its agreement to pull out all its forces from the area in line with the Biden plan, if Israeli operational demands were met.
But in an English language news conference today, Netanyahu said that Israel's decision to leave this area in 2005 as part of a complete withdrawal from Gaza was a big mistake.
""Once we left our side of the Philadelphi corridor, rockets went in, missiles went in, drones went in, ammo went in, weapons manufacturing equipment came in, tunnel-drilling equipment came in,"" he said. ""Once we got out, once we left the Philidephi corridor, Iran could carry out its plan to turn Gaza into a base, terrorist enclave that would endanger not only the communities around it but would endanger Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Be'er Sheva, the entire of country of Israel.
Netanyahu said the goals of the war remain the same.
""We are committed to achieving our goals, all three goals,"" he said. ""Destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities, releasing all our hostages and ensuring that Gaza does become a threat to Israel anymore. And all these require standing firm on the things that will ensure the achievement of these goals.""
That, he said, means Israel must maintain control over the Philadelphi corridor at least for the near future, even if it means there will not be a cease-fire deal with Hamas."

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has reiterated his administration's unconditional support for the Palestinian resistance in its fight against the occupying Israeli regime.
Pezeshkian made the remarks in a message delivered during the 9th International Conference of ""Mujahideen in Exile"" which was held in the Iranian city of Damghan in the northern province of Semnan on Tuesday, with guests from different Muslim countries and national and provincial officials in attendance.
""Over the course of nearly half a century, the legacy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has consistently championed justice and advocated human rights globally, has been to fully support the oppressed Palestinian nation's resistance against the Zionist usurper regime, as well as the struggle of all the oppressed nations in the world,"" he said.
The president said from the beginning of his tenure, he has declared his steadfast support for the Palestinian people and the oppressed around the world.
He also said the 14th Iranian government will continue its unwavering support for the Palestinian resistance just as the previous governments.
""I believe that we should always consider ourselves committed to seeking justice and support freedom-seekers and also the oppressed in any circumstance, because justice-seeking on the part of the elite and awakened consciences can lay a good ground for realizing a bright future,"" he said.
Pezeshkian further praised the late Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian as ""a distinguished diplomat and a true embodiment of resistance diplomacy"" as well as ""a strong and intelligent negotiator.""
Amir-Abdollahian passed away in the helicopter crash of May 19, along with late President Ebrahim Raisi and several other officials."
